1  Yes  I am going to refer to the charts that were distributed  They  don’t have a cover on them, but the words “Smoothness of the Federal Funds Rate”  are at the top of the first chart  For some time, economists have noted that monetary  policy rates in major industrialized countries tend to change only gradually A case in  point is the intended federal funds rate, plotted in the top panel of exhibit 1 As can be  seen, the stance of policy is typically adjusted in sequences of relatively small steps in  the same direction  Over the sample shown, nine out of ten of the policy actions  moved in the same direction as the previous change  Moreover, nearly all of the  policy moves in the sample were 50 basis points or less     The smoothness of the federal funds rate can be captured more formally by   estimating simple monetary policy rules that measure the systematic response of the  policy instrument to key macroeconomic variables  An example is shown in the  bottom left panel  In this equation, as in John Taylor’s original specification, the  quarterly average level of the federal funds rate is assumed to respond to the current  output gap and the inflation rate over the previous year  However, in this version we  also allow the previous quarter’s federal funds rate to enter the equation  Estimating  this rule using real-time data from 1987 through 2000, we find that the coefficient on  the lagged policy rate is strongly significant and not far below unity—a finding that is  common in the research literature This coefficient causes predicted movements in the  federal funds rate to be more inertial than otherwise      Right, so the R² is very high—it’s 096—reflecting that the lagged   dependent variable soaks up a lot of the explanatory power                                                     1 The materials used by Messrs Sack, Tetlow, Croushore, and Rudebusch are appended to this transcript (appendix  1)   January 28-29, 2003 10 of 195     One can also express the R² in terms of the model’s ability to predict   interest rate changes instead of the level, and there it falls off a good degree—down to 042  So   part of this, as you noted, is that the level of the funds rate is very predictable    Of course, simple rules such as this one provide only a rough  description of actual policy decisions, and it would not be surprising if the parameters  of these rules would change over time  One possible incidence of this is hinted at by  the easing of 2001, highlighted in the bottom right panel, which was more rapid than  would have been expected under the policy rule estimated through 2000  This  episode brings into sharper focus the question of the appropriate speed of adjustment  for monetary policy, which is the topic of this briefing  More specifically, we  investigate whether gradual movements in the federal funds rate are desirable in terms  of achieving the macroeconomic objectives of the Federal Reserve—maximum  sustainable employment and price stability     As summarized in the top panel of exhibit 2, we consider the monetary policy rule   that would be optimal assuming that the FOMC desires to limit squared deviations of  inflation from a target level and of the unemployment rate from its equilibrium level  over all future periods  Inflation and unemployment deviations are penalized equally,  and the target for core PCE inflation is taken to be 1½ percent  Note that  policymakers do not have a direct preference for smoothness in the federal funds rate   The exercise also assumes that FRB/US is the correct characterization of the  economy  We can compute the policy that maximizes the assumed objectives of the  FOMC given that model, assuming that the policy is required to have the same form  as the estimated rule from the prior exhibit     As shown in the middle left panel, the coefficients of the calculated policy rule,   which we will refer to as the “optimal” rule, differ considerably from those of the  estimated rule  In particular, the optimal rule is much more responsive to current  economic conditions, as indicated by the larger coefficients on inflation and the  output gap, and is much less inertial, as indicated by the smaller coefficient on the  lagged federal funds rate  We will focus on both of these characteristics, since each  of them would increase the volatility of the federal funds rate relative to the estimated  policy rule      January 28-29, 2003 11 of 195    The more aggressive nature of the optimal policy rule can be seen by looking at  its prescription for the path of the federal funds rate going forward, assuming that the  economy will be subject to the sequence of shocks implied by the Greenbook  projection  As shown by the dotted line in the middle right panel, the optimal rule  calls for an immediate easing of policy to zero percent in order to boost output toward  potential more quickly and then a substantial tightening over the second half of this  year to unwind the accommodative stance of policy  By contrast, the path of the  federal funds rate under the estimated policy rule, the solid line, is much more stable   The panel also shows the policymaker perfect foresight path that appears in the  Bluebook (the dashed line labeled PPF)  This path is computed from an exercise that  is similar to the one just described, but with two important differences  First,  policymakers are endowed with more information, including knowledge of the  sequence of shocks that will be hitting the economy in the future  Second,  policymakers are assumed to have a preference for a smooth path of the federal funds  rate  This latter assumption importantly influences the shape of the PPF path  If the  smoothing preference were removed, the PPF policy would push the federal funds  rate immediately to zero  Thus, the PPF exercise also suggests that monetary policy  should be much more aggressive in the absence of a preference for smoothing     At first glance, it might seem surprising that the optimal policy calls for   movements in the funds rate that are so much more aggressive and volatile than those  observed  As described in the lower panel, these characteristics of the optimal rule  hinge on three key assumptions underlying this exercise  First, we assumed that the  private sector continues to form its expectations as if the FOMC were following its  historical policy rule, even when the true policy differs considerably  This  assumption implies that large policy moves have sizable effects on the yield curve  and on real activity, because private agents do not expect those actions to be quickly  reversed  Second, we assumed that the FOMC knows the structure of the economy  with certainty and in particular faces no uncertainty about the impact of its policy  actions, no matter how drastic they are  Third, we assumed that the FOMC is able to  observe the current state of the economy perfectly That is, there is no measurement  error in the macroeconomic data or in policymakers’ estimates of potential output and  other unobserved variables  Under these circumstances, there is nothing to prevent  the central bank from pushing very hard on the economy to achieve its objectives;  hence the optimal monetary policy responds aggressively to macroeconomic variables  and is quick to reverse course  But clearly these three assumptions do not hold in  practice In the next three exhibits, we investigate the implications of relaxing each  assumption in turn     MRTETLOW  As just noted, the finding that the federal funds rate should be   very aggressive under the optimal policy depends crucially on the manner in which  private agents form their expectations, the subject of exhibit 3  The previous exercise  assumed that those expectations are formed under the belief that the FOMC is  following its historical policy rule, even if that rule is changed going forward  In  practice, private agents are likely to take into account changes in the way policy is  implemented   January 28-29, 2003 12 of 195      Consider what happens when the private sector understands the policy rule that   the central bank is actually using  As summarized in the top panel, if policymakers  are following an inertial policy rule, private agents will expect the initial response of  the federal funds rate to a macroeconomic shock to be followed by additional policy  changes in the same direction  Moreover, those actions will be expected to unwind  only gradually as the shock dissipates  Expectations of this persistent response of  policy will be incorporated into current asset prices and economic decisions, thus  bringing forward the effects of those future policy actions  As a result, an inertial  policy response can have an immediate and sizable impact on economic variables,  even with relatively small movements in the federal funds rate in each period  By  contrast, the large but transitory movements in the federal funds rate that were found  to be optimal in the previous exhibit will be less effective, because private agents will  recognize the change in the policy rule and look through the near-term swings in the  interest rate     To illustrate the importance of this consideration, we conduct an experiment in   which the public forms its expectations as a weighted average of forward- and  backward-looking terms  As the middle panel notes, the degree of forward-looking  behavior is governed by a single parameter, φ  When φ equals zero, the model  corresponds to the version of FRB/US used in exhibit 2, in which expectations are  formed using a “backward-looking” vector autoregression (VAR) model  When φ  equals unity, expectations are rational—meaning that households and firms fully  understand the structure of the model and the policy rule in forming their  expectations      With this set-up, we can calculate the optimal policy rule for different degrees of   forward-looking behavior  As shown in the bottom left panel, the optimal coefficient  on the lagged federal funds rate moves higher as the parameter φ increases  That is,  the optimal monetary policy rule becomes more inertial when the public is forward- looking, since expectations of future policy actions lead to larger and more-persistent  movements in bond rates and other asset prices that effectively counterbalance the  persistent effects of macroeconomic disturbances  Note, however, that the historical  estimate of the coefficient on the lagged federal funds rate (076) is reached only  when expectations are formed in an almost completely forward-looking manner  The  bottom right panel shows the complete optimal policy rule for three choices of the  degree of forward-looking behavior  As just noted, in the case in which φ equals  unity, the coefficient on the lagged policy rate is quite high—even higher than that  from the estimated rule  Nevertheless, the coefficients on the output gap and inflation  are about three times larger than their estimated values  Thus, the optimal rule still  calls for much more volatile movements in the federal funds rate than are observed     Another possible source of gradualism in policy setting is parameter uncertainty,   the topic of exhibit 4  In the analysis so far, policymakers have been assumed to  know the exact structure of the economy; uncertainty has entered only through  additive error terms  To see the effects of this assumption, consider the situation in   January 28-29, 2003 13 of 195    the top left panel, which shows the relationship between the output gap (plotted on  the horizontal axis), and the real interest rate, r, relative to its equilibrium level, r*  (plotted on the vertical axis)  The solid line represents policymakers’ best estimate of  the level of the output gap that would be realized at any given setting of the real  interest rate  But because of an additive error term, the realized outcome could lie  above or below the central estimate, as indicated by the shaded region  As noted in  the top right panel, the amount of uncertainty is not affected by the policy decision   For this reason, it turns out that additive uncertainty has no effect on the optimal  policy setting  That is, policymakers should ignore the uncertainty and set policy  based on their best estimate of the likely outcome for macroeconomic variables     However, this framework neglects the obvious fact that policymakers face   considerable uncertainty about the values of key parameters in their models of the  economy  To see the implications of this type of uncertainty, suppose policymakers  are unsure of the value of the policy multiplier, as shown in the middle left panel   The policymakers’ best estimate of the relationship again is represented by the solid  line, but the actual slope of the relationship could be higher or lower  In those  circumstances, policymakers face more uncertainty about the outcome for the output  gap the further the real interest rate deviates from its equilibrium level, as indicated  by the shaded region  As we note in the middle right panel, this example highlights  the key implication of parameter uncertainty—that uncertainty about future economic  conditions will be importantly affected by current monetary policy decisions—a  factor that policymakers should take into account in formulating those decisions   Under the objectives assumed, policymakers will tend to shade their policy actions  toward choices that reduce uncertainty about future levels of unemployment and  inflation  Of course, the middle left panel presents just one specific example of  parameter uncertainty  Many other parameters are also unknown, in which case the  variance-minimizing policy will not be to hold the real interest rate at its equilibrium  level  In general, the effects of parameter uncertainty depend crucially on which  parameters are unknown and on the variances and covariances of those parameters     Unfortunately, the complexity of FRB/US makes it difficult to incorporate   parameter uncertainty directly into simulations of that model  But we can quantify  the effects of parameter uncertainty using the simpler VAR model utilized to  characterize expectations in FRB/US  As summarized in the bottom left panel, the  VAR captures the dynamics of key macroeconomic variables, including inflation and  the output gap  In addition, the VAR provides a convenient measure of parameter  uncertainty—namely, the variance-covariance matrix of the estimated coefficients   We can use this measure to assess the effect of parameter uncertainty on the optimal  monetary policy rule     The results are shown in the bottom right panel in two steps  We first compute   the optimal policy rule that ignores parameter uncertainty by assuming that the  estimated coefficients from the VAR are known with certainty  As shown in the first  line of the table, the optimal policy under those assumptions is much more aggressive  than the estimated policy rule, as reflected in the larger coefficients on the output gap   January 28-29, 2003 14 of 195    and inflation and the smaller coefficient on the lagged policy rate  These findings are  qualitatively similar to those found earlier using the FRB/US model  However, when  we allow policymakers to recognize that the coefficients of the VAR are uncertain,  they choose a policy with smaller coefficients on inflation and the output gap and a  larger coefficient on the lagged interest rate  Parameter uncertainty therefore moves  the optimal rule in the direction of the estimated rule, but it seems to fall well short of  explaining the observed degree of smoothness in the federal funds rate      May I also try to clarify that?  The estimated policy rule from our analysis   would actually be consistent with your impression of the 2001 episode  That episode did look as   if the policy moves were much more rapid than would have been predicted by the estimated   policy rule  It’s hard to assess because there are only a few data points in a quarterly policy rule    But if you let the rule choose a different coefficient on the lagged funds rate for that episode, it   will put it pretty close to zero  So that episode, in the context of this rule, actually was a very   rapid policy easing relative to the average pace of policy adjustment seen from 1987 to 2000    In a recent research paper that I wrote with two colleagues, we show that it   is possible to estimate policy rules directly allowing for both factors  So we don’t necessarily   have to turn to the term structure evidence to separate them  What our paper and several other   papers have found is that clearly Glenn’s point is right  There are variables omitted from the rule   that have serial correlation, which gives some impression of gradualism  But that’s not the   whole story  In fact, when we apply these methods to our policy rule and allow for serially   correlated errors, that decreases the coefficient on the lagged federal funds rate from 076 to   056  So it reduces the degree of inertia in these rules, but there’s still a significant amount of   gradualism    Right    I think we would agree on the general point of our briefing  We’re   bickering about what the coefficient is on the lagged federal funds rate in the estimated policy   rule, but these issues don’t affect our calculations of the optimized rules and don’t affect the   main conclusion of our briefing  What we find is that these optimized rules result in very   aggressive, very volatile movements in the federal funds rate—more volatile than we see in the   data regardless of what the exact rule is  Recall that we said there are two aspects in which   policy is too smooth  The coefficients on output and inflation appear to be smaller than under   January 28-29, 2003 30 of 195    the optimal rules, and the coefficient on the lagged funds rate tends to be bigger  Even leaving   aside that second part, as Glenn alluded to in his last exhibit, these types of exercises that we   perform would still recommend larger response coefficients and more-aggressive movements in   the federal funds rate      When I said term structure, I meant the evidence that Glenn presented       It might be useful to point out as well that, while policy actions three, four,   or five quarters ahead are hard to predict, it’s not that they don’t get built into the term structure    The Board staff produces an expected path of the federal funds rate based on our readings of the   futures markets, and it commonly has policy actions built in at those horizons  In fact, the   current forecast is a good example  Policy is expected to be on hold until the fourth quarter of   2003 and then, according to our path, about 150 basis points of tightening is built in for   subsequent years  So it’s not that future actions don’t get priced in at all but that they’re not very   predictable     Well, that’s true; that could be the case as well    Actually, I think there’s surprisingly little research relating to that   explanation compared with the huge amount of literature on parameter uncertainty and model   uncertainty  As far as I know, financial fragility has more or less slipped by      Right, and I’m getting the impression that financial fragility is important!    [Laughter]    We do know a few things, though  First, markets actually have become   better at anticipating our policy actions since the early 1990s and especially since 1994  Second,   January 28-29, 2003 36 of 195    presumably markets have become better at trading and allocating risk as well  These   developments in the economy bear on this issue  But in terms of research indicating what   financial fragility does to the optimal rule, there hasn’t been very much    Another point is that, while the more aggressive rules would create   volatility in the short-term interest rate, it’s not really clear what they would do to the volatility   of prices of longer-lived assets such as long-term bonds or stocks  To the extent that these rules   are better at stabilizing the macroeconomy, they could actually reduce the volatility of those   asset prices  In other words, such rules would clearly make the volatility of the term structure   more negatively sloped  So in terms of the fragility aspects, there are a lot of subtle points like   that to think about    I’ll take the other side  If policy is inertial, what we highlight in exhibit 3   are the benefits of inertia when markets and agents are forward-looking  You provided some   very nice examples of exactly what happens in these models  In these models, policymakers by   assumption are committed to the optimal rule, which has inertia  That gives them the benefit of   bringing forward effects of anticipated, drawn-out policy responses  As you said, for example, in   the fall of 1998, expectations were that those easings would not be quickly reversed  Now, that   does imply that there will be other situations in which policymakers might want to do something   different, but they’ve committed themselves to this gradual rule  Mike Woodford has done a lot   of the research on this theory, and he talks quite a bit about the fact that policymakers often find   themselves confirming expectations of policy actions that were built in in advance  It’s   important to confirm those expectations in order to get this channel operating and to get markets   bringing forward the effects of policy actions  I think you gave some good examples of what is   going on in exhibit 3   1  Financial markets improved further over the period since the last  FOMC meeting, with risky asset prices rising on net, financial institutions raising new  capital, and money markets continuing to heal  Those developments reflect, and in  turn support, greater optimism about the economic outlook  However, one                                   June 23–24, 2009 5 of 261  consequence of these events was that intermediate- and long-term interest rates came  under significant upward pressure   As can be seen in chart 1, Treasury coupon yields moved up markedly over the  intermeeting period, with increases of 20 to 80 basis points  The run-up was initially  concentrated in longer-term yields, but more recently it spilled over into the two-year  yield as well The rise in the two-year yield was driven in part by a shift in monetary  policy expectations, as the “green shoots” theme continued to gain traction  As  shown in chart 2, expectations of monetary policy tightening this year remain limited,  but the market now anticipates nearly 200 basis points of tightening over 2010   The upward movement in Treasury yields was the largest, however, at horizons  beyond the next year or two, as can be seen in the shift in the yield curve in chart 3   The upward pressure on longer-term Treasury yields came from a variety of sources,  including an improved economic outlook, an associated reduction in the risk of  deflation, substantial increases in the supply of Treasury debt, the need to hedge  mortgage convexity exposure as rates increased, and an ongoing reversal of the flight­ to-quality flows  Our survey of primary dealers indicated that many of these factors  were seen as “important,” as summarized in chart 4  An increase in upside inflation  risk was also cited as a relevant, but less important, factor    The upward pressure on yields occurred despite the fact that the Federal Reserve  continued to take considerable amounts of duration onto its own books through the  large-scale asset purchase programs  As shown in chart 5, the SOMA continued to  accumulate longer-term assets through the three programs initiated by the FOMC  As  the chart indicates, those purchases have proceeded at a relatively steady pace  towards their mandated sizes  As summarized to the right in chart 6, the Desk has  purchased $170 billion of Treasury securities to date, $90 billion of agency securities,  and $577 billion of MBS Our dealer survey indicated that market participants are  not expecting much expansion of the programs beyond the currently stated limits   The median survey response indicated no expected increase in the size of the agency  and MBS programs and only a 15 percent chance of expansion of the Treasury  program at this meeting, with the peak amount of Treasury purchases put at  $363 billion   Given their current sizes, these programs have had different degrees of  importance in their respective markets  For Treasury securities, the SOMA purchases  have simply been overwhelmed by new issuance  As shown in chart 7, the supply of  new Treasury debt is far outpacing the accumulation by SOMA, leaving the market to  digest considerable amounts of new debt and putting upward pressure on yields  That  is not the case for MBS, however, where the Fed’s purchases to date have been large  relative to the size of the market and the flow of new supply   This pattern may explain why the MBS purchases have had such a notable effect  on the MBS rate As shown in chart 8, the MBS current coupon rate fell sharply after  the program was announced, both because the Treasury yield declined and because                        June 23–24, 2009 6 of 261  the spread to Treasuries narrowed  That movement prompted a major refinancing  wave, with nearly the entire universe of outstanding fixed-rate mortgage loans  becoming refinanceable  The MBS rate subsequently remained near 4 percent, even  as the Treasury yield began to move up, in part because of a perception that SOMA  purchases would be used to hold the line at that level  More recently, though, the  MBS rate began to rise, with two important factors amplifying that movement  First,  the rise in yields reduced repayment risk, extending the duration of outstanding  mortgages and causing mortgage holders and servicers to try to shed duration  elsewhere—the convexity hedging mentioned above  Second, market participants  came to understand that the Fed would not ramp up the pace of its MBS purchases  significantly in reaction to upward pressure on the MBS rate, in contrast to the  expectations of many  On balance, the MBS rate is 80 basis points higher than at the  time of the last FOMC meeting  Much of that change has showed through to the  primary mortgage rate, which has increased about 60 basis points   Overall, our view is that the purchase programs have kept Treasury yields and  mortgage rates lower than they otherwise would have been, though they are no longer  at the very low levels that were observed ahead of the last FOMC meeting   The move towards higher yields has been accompanied by considerable chatter in  the market about inflation risks  As shown in chart 9, break-even inflation rates  moved up notably with the backup in nominal yields, with the five-year, five-year  forward measure (the Barclays measure) approaching 25 percent  However, some of  the rise in recent months appears to reflect that the risk of low inflation has been  pared and that the liquidity of TIPS has improved  Break-even inflation rates have  not reached levels that would suggest that either inflation expectations or perceived  upside inflation risks were unusually high That interpretation is largely confirmed  by the distribution of longer-term inflation outcomes from our dealer survey, chart 10   The chart shows the evolution of the distribution over the last three FOMC meetings   In general, respondents have been shaving down the left tail, with most of the mass  making its way into the 2 percent to 25 percent bucket rather than into the upper tail   Still, it is important to note that the inflation outlook is now seen as much more  balanced, as reflected in both the survey and the level of break-even inflation rates   I will close my discussion of yields by taking a longer-term perspective   Although it seems that many factors are putting upward pressure on Treasury yields,  the yield curve is essentially showing the same degree of steepness that has occurred  around or just after the end of previous recessions, as can be seen in chart 11  Thus,  despite the unprecedented fiscal deficits and the unprecedented expansion of reserves,  the yield curve is not doing anything unprecedented  Of course, one potential  explanation is that the large-scale asset purchase programs have prevented a more  severe steepening   The greater prospects for an economic recovery are also reflected in a broad set of  risky asset prices Corporate yield spreads, chart 12, came down significantly, with  the investment-grade and high-yield spreads narrowing by 176 and 405 basis points,                              June 23–24, 2009 7 of 261  respectively, over the intermeeting period  That narrowing has more than offset the  increase in Treasury yields, leaving corporate borrowing costs lower  With more  favorable costs, corporate issuers have brought a heavy flow of new bonds to the  market in recent months  Equity prices also advanced on net over the intermeeting  period, despite some backtracking over the past week or so  As shown in chart 13,  the S&P index gained about 5 percent, continuing the recovery seen since the trough  in March The recovery in equities has been driven in part by the view that downside  growth risks have diminished  One indication of this is that the negative skewness of  equity outcomes implied by options (the light blue line) has fallen notably from the  very elevated levels reached last fall  The willingness of investors to move back into  risky assets, both here and abroad, has contributed to a weakening of the dollar, chart  14, with the broad dollar index off by about 5 percent   The positive sentiment in markets has been driven in part by better prospects for  banks As shown in chart 15, share prices of the large financial institutions included  in the Supervisory Capital Assessment Program (or SCAP) have moved sharply  higher since March, far outperforming broader equity indexes  There may be several  reasons for this outperformance, but the SCAP process clearly played a role  The test  results provided some clarity to investors about the capital needs of those institutions  and, overall, indicated that those needs were less severe than had been earlier feared   This information was greeted favorably by market participants  Since the release,  many of those institutions have been able to raise new capital, as shown by the solid  bars in chart 16, which has helped to fill the capital needs identified by the SCAP, the  hollow bars In total, the SCAP institutions have raised or announced plans to raise  $70 billion in new capital In addition, they have issued more than $35 billion in new  debt, including $25 billion that did not use the FDIC guarantee program  Lastly, 10  large financial institutions were approved to repay TARP funds and returned $68  billion collectively to the Treasury last week   The better sentiment about banks and other financial institutions has helped to  improve conditions in money markets  In the market for unsecured lending, the  three-month LIBOR–OIS spread continued to fall, as shown in chart 17, and has now  dipped below 50 basis points—its lowest level since early 2008  However, the  spreads on LIBOR at longer maturities still remain unusually elevated, and the  liquidity and functioning of the LIBOR market is still strained  Secured funding  markets show a similar pattern—ongoing improvement, but remaining far from  normal, with considerable uncertainty about what normal will turn out to be in the  new environment   The improvement in term funding markets has allowed the markets to become  less dependent on the liquidity facilities provided by the Federal Reserve  This is a  natural development and, indeed, a positive sign, in that some of the facilities were  priced to be relatively unattractive once market conditions became less strained  As  shown in chart 18, the shrinkage has spanned almost all components of the liquidity  facilities, with the total amount of short-term credit provided falling to about half its  level at the beginning of the year                                       June 23–24, 2009 8 of 261  Another sign of policy traction comes in the consumer credit markets  Recent  TALF subscriptions have been larger and have covered a more diverse set of asset  classes As can be seen in chart 19, the total issuance of TALF-eligible ABS jumped  to about $30 billion in the second quarter  In addition, and perhaps even more  encouraging, some ABS deals have been coming to the market without TALF  support, bringing the total amount of ABS issuance for the quarter to about $40  billion Thus, there are signs that the consumer ABS market is at least starting to get  back on its feet   The liquidity being provided to the ABS market and the return of investor  confidence in that market have caused spreads on triple-A-rated ABS to narrow  considerably, as shown in chart 20 for auto and credit card paper  These  improvements in the secondary market rates should help to make credit available on  more favorable terms to businesses and households  However, improvement in the  CMBS [commercial-mortgage-backed securities] market has been more tenuous   Spreads on senior CMBS have narrowed by much less from their peak and have  moved higher of late Newly issued CMBS were the focus of the most recent TALF  subscription, and there was no participation  That outcome was expected, though, as  it takes time for issuers to originate the paper that would be eligible  Given the  strains in the CMBS market, we anticipate that CMBS activity in the TALF will pick  up over time    Overall, as shown in chart 21, the total balance sheet of the Federal Reserve has  remained around $2 trillion since last December  However, that pattern masks the  significant rotation that is taking place in the composition of the balance sheet  As  noted above, the share of the balance sheet associated with short-term lending  operations (the orange area) is shrinking notably, while the System’s holdings of  longer-term assets (the blue area) continue to grow  Going forward, we expect the  total portfolio to expand further, as the ongoing growth in the asset-purchase  programs will outweigh further declines in the liquidity facilities   That concludes my prepared remarks on financial market developments  Let me  now turn to the separate issue of whether to expand the existing SOMA securities  lending program to include agency debt securities held by the SOMA  A memo was  circulated to the FOMC in advance of today’s meeting to describe this proposal and  its economic rationale   The intention of the proposed change is to make SOMA holdings of agency debt  available to the market in order to foster improved liquidity and secondary market  functioning for agency securities  Through an auction format, dealers could pay a fee  to borrow a particular security, offering a Treasury security in exchange as collateral   This allows the dealer to obtain individual agency securities that might be in short  supply in the market                                                             2 The materials used by Mr Carpenter are appended to this transcript (appendix 2)                        June 23–24, 2009 9 of 261  The potential for scarcity problems in agency debt arises in part from limited new  supply and in part from the Fed’s asset-purchase program  Agency debt purchases of  $200 billion would represent approximately 35 percent of total outstanding agency  benchmark debt  Dealers are already expressing some unwillingness to short agency  issues due to concerns about their ability to close out such positions  And while fails­ to-deliver in agency securities have not been substantial, we believe that they could  rise if there were another bout of financial market strain  Indeed, agency debt does  not benefit from the new fails penalty that was recently implemented for Treasury  securities, possibly making them more susceptible to an episode of widespread fails   Making SOMA holdings available to the market would address these concerns, which  should help to support market liquidity   Let me make two additional points about the program  First, it involves little risk  for the Federal Reserve, as it is swapping an agency debt security for a Treasury  security, with a small haircut applied  Second, it puts the agency program on a par  with the Treasury debt and MBS programs, as those already have comparable  strategies in place In particular, Treasury securities held in SOMA are already  included in the securities lending program, and SOMA holdings of MBS can be made  available to the market on a temporary basis through dollar roll transactions     This proposal is not covered by the current Desk authorization and thus requires  an amendment to the authorization, as indicated in our memo to the Committee  That  concludes my prepared remarks   The pace of corporate bond issuance has picked up  May was a very heavy   month, about $40 billion of issuance  That strength seemed to spill into June  Anecdotally we’re   seeing this bond issuance used for a variety of purposes  In part it’s being used to pay down   bank loans and pay down CP We are also seeing lots of holding of liquid assets  This activity   may just be some rotation or substitution on corporate balance sheets, but the pace of bond   issuance certainly has picked up in response to the more favorable borrowing rates  As your   question suggested, certainly the collapse in spreads has been sufficient to outweigh the increase   in Treasury yields So, yes, corporate bond costs have declined              June 23–24, 2009 28 of 261  We have interpreted the directive as having some flexibility, but it is   relatively limited, in that we varied the approach that we take to purchases and the pace of   purchases to respond to problems with market functioning  So we do vary the purchases to   ensure that markets can continue to function and that we’re not causing too much strain in the   markets  One concrete example of this is that the approach to agency debt purchases has moved   to a somewhat more flexible one that has reduced the pace and that raises the possibility of not   getting all the way to the $200 billion because of what we’ve seen in the development of the   functioning of that market  So we’ve taken some limited flexibility in terms of responding to   how markets function     I think the more difficult issue is whether to exercise any flexibility in response to   changes in market interest rates—that is, beyond the reaction to market functioning, whether the   Desk should respond and try to resist increases in, say, MBS rates or Treasury rates  There I   think our view is that we certainly don’t have enough guidance from the Committee about the   extent to which that responsiveness should be implemented or the yield levels at which purchases   would ramp up  We have not taken a dynamic market-responsive approach in that regard, and   that’s why this is one of the issues that Trish raised in her briefing, namely, whether the   Committee would like to consider moving to a more flexible approach  She raised the issue of   doing that across asset classes, but she also raised the issue of doing that within an asset class to   be more responsive to interest rates   I agree I think for this intermeeting period, most estimates of borrowing   needs of the Treasury didn’t rise  So I would say that’s more of a “backdrop” condition, not the   main driver of the rising yields over this intermeeting period  But it’s certainly a very important   factor over a broader time period   If you’re going to go down that road, you should make the salaries   responsive to the upside as well [Laughter]   Well, I think it’s quite possible that we will exercise the “up to” part of the   mandate regardless of whether we’re lending the agency securities or not  I think the desire to   lend the agency securities is in response to concerns about market function, which would be   there whether the program ended at $100 billion or $150 billion or $200 billion  In either case,   SOMA holdings are going to be a sizable portion of the benchmark GSE market, and, as I said,   we’re already hearing reports from the market about concerns about shorting and not enough   floating supply of these issues   That’s because we are buying them, right  It’s a matter of degree  So I   agree If you don’t get to $200 billion, you lessen the problem, but I think we would pursue the   authority to lend our agency holdings regardless of whether we thought the program was going   to end before $200 billion or get all the way to $200 billion  We’re already seeing these strains    We think making these holdings available to the market makes sense in terms of supporting   market functioning, treating these assets the way we treat other SOMA holdings, and, as I said,   posing little risk to the Federal Reserve   Actually, what I said before was that the Desk may exercise the “up to” part   of the directive And what I meant by that is that we may not get to the entire $200 billion on   account of these concerns Now, the question is  What does the market expect?  We actually   changed our procedures for accepting tenders on agency debt in a way that we think is going to   taper off the pace and perhaps leave us short I would say this hasn’t garnered a ton of market   attention There may be a period during which they have to learn and adjust to that, or it may                 June 23–24, 2009 63 of 261  just not be that big of a deal  So I think the markets understand we have some flexibility  They   haven’t reached a definitive conclusion that the SOMA holdings may fall well short of   $200 billion But presumably over the next several months there will be increasing inference in   that direction, if things evolve the way we expect   I think the purchases of the Treasuries have been regular and steady and   nonresponsive to market conditions, and that’s very well understood at this point in the markets    For MBS, I think what happened is that, over this intermeeting period, the markets learned that   the Desk was less responsive than they anticipated  The current MBS secondary rates reflect that   understanding  It’s just that the adjustment of how they got there was perhaps lumpier because   of that learning I think the secondary MBS rates stayed lower for longer, because there was this   assumption about more Desk responsiveness, and they then had to adjust up more abruptly  But   on net, it’s at a point where the markets seem to understand that the Desk is exercising only   limited discretion in terms of making those purchases   I would say that, if the Committee is comfortable with the degree of   flexibility that the Desk has been exercising, then I would leave it alone, in terms of public   communications at least To the extent that you start to change the directive, it’s going to   involve a lot of guessing about what has changed and what’s going to happen now  I think the   market has gone through a learning process that may have caused some abrupt movements here   and there, but it has gotten to a point where it pretty much understands that the general approach   is slow and steady, with some flexibility around that in response to market functioning  And if   that’s what the Committee is comfortable with, we’re at a point where we don’t need any kind of   public clarification If the Committee wanted the Desk to be more responsive to market interest   rates, then that would require some kind of communication to the market, so that they didn’t   have to infer it over time just from our actions           June 23–24, 2009 66 of 261  I would add that without the sentences that the Chairman read, it’s a   somewhat mixed release  At least one program is being scaled down, but others are being   extended, so the direction is not really clear  I think the focal point of the markets would be the   sentences that were read about the extended date being the expected terminal date, and I do think   there’s some risk that that will be seen as the first step—as you said, “lifting the screwdriver”    So it is a risk                       June 23–24, 2009 69 of 261  The statement is conditioned on anticipated further improvement that hasn’t   really been defined So I think it leaves open some issues  If conditions just stay where they are,   does that mean the programs will be extended?  How much improvement is expected?  And so   on I would just say it’s complicated to signal that so far in advance   1 Thank you I should start with a warning that I’m going to talk for  a pretty long time  I apologize in advance  Prices of risky assets have continued to  recover at an impressive pace, boosted by a more optimistic assessment of economic  prospects and by favorable news on corporate earnings  The advance in equity prices,  shown in the top left panel of the first exhibit, was particularly sharp, with broad  indexes up 12 percent to 15 percent since the last FOMC meeting  Equity prices were  supported by sizable second-quarter earnings surprises that spanned a range of  sectors As shown in the top right, over three-quarters of S&P 500 companies posted                            August 11–12, 2009 4 of 165  positive earnings surprises in the quarter—about the highest percentage observed over  the past fifteen years  At the same time, investors continued to become more  optimistic about economic prospects  The responses to our dealer survey indicated  that market participants raised their forecasts for second-half growth and saw fewer  downside risks to those forecasts   Given the news on earnings and the economy, investors’ perceptions of risk  declined further, as indicated by the drop in the implied volatility of equity prices, the  middle left panel  Corresponding with that shift, investors showed a greater  willingness to hold risky assets  Retail investors, for example, have been reallocating  large amounts of capital out of the safest asset classes, such as money market mutual  funds, as shown in the middle right panel  That capital appears to be making its way  into a range of riskier asset classes, including equity and fixed-income funds both  here and abroad   Given this shift in risk appetite, corporate bond spreads continued to narrow  sharply, as shown in the bottom left panel, with the spread on the investment-grade  index declining about 75 basis points and that on the high-yield index declining  nearly 250 basis points since the last meeting  Other risky asset classes, such as  emerging-market debt and stocks, have also benefited   The panel to the right suggests that the dollar has also been strongly influenced by  shifts in investor risk appetite In particular, there has been a tight relationship  between the dollar and risky asset prices, here captured by an emerging-market equity  index, with the dollar appreciating last fall as investors attempted to move into safe  assets and depreciating more recently as risk appetite returned  On net, the dollar has  fallen 1 percent to 2 percent on a broad, trade-weighted basis over the intermeeting  period   The increased optimism about the economic outlook has coincided with favorable  developments in the financial sector  Share prices of large financial institutions rose  substantially, as shown in the top left panel of exhibit 2, in response to robust  earnings reports Those earnings were fueled by strong profits in trading and  investment banking activity  The durability of those sources of revenue is  questionable, but that did not seem to trouble investors   Earnings results for smaller and regional financial institutions were not as strong   Those institutions benefited little from the robust trading gains that helped large  firms  Moreover, some regional banks posted greater-than-expected loan loss  provisions for consumer loans, and many of them have considerable exposure to  commercial real estate and construction loans  Despite those hurdles, regional banks  managed to meet their earnings expectations on average, and their share prices  performed as well as those of larger firms over the intermeeting period   The difficulties at CIT that surfaced in mid-July highlighted the fact that financial  institutions can still run into difficulties  Nevertheless, financial markets continued to                        August 11–12, 2009 5 of 165  function well throughout that episode Moreover, investors’ perceptions of  counterparty risk in the financial sector improved notably over the intermeeting  period CDS spreads for major financial institutions moved lower, by 50 to 200 basis  points in most cases, as shown in the top right  Moreover, the spread of LIBOR over  the OIS rate, the middle left, continued to shrink, with the three-month spread falling  below 30 basis points At those maturities shown, spreads have reached levels that  many thought would constitute the post-crisis normal  Longer-term spreads,  however, still remain elevated   One hurdle that the financial sector faces going forward is the expiration of the  FDIC’s temporary liquidity guarantee program (or TLGP) on October 31  The TLGP  has allowed financial institutions to issue debt at a much lower cost than they would  have otherwise paid, as indicated in the middle right panel  Financial firms currently  have $330 billion of outstanding debt under the program, with maturities out to three  years As that debt matures and has to be rolled over into new securities, these firms  will likely face higher financing costs  However, given that the maturity of that debt  is spread out and that firms have been making efforts to reduce their reliance on the  program, market participants do not currently anticipate any problems around its  termination   This argument raises a broader point to be considered  While money markets and  financial markets more broadly have healed to a great degree, the improvement has  been conditioned on a number of government support programs—many of which are  scheduled to expire over the next six months  Over the period between now and  February 1, in chronological order, the markets will need to digest the end of the  Treasury’s money market guarantee program, the FDIC’s TLGP, the Fed’s large- scale asset-purchase (LSAP) program in Treasuries, the Fed’s MMIFF, the Treasury’s  purchases of agency MBS, the Fed’s LSAP programs in agency debt and MBS, the  Treasury’s credit facility for the GSEs (or GSECF), the Fed’s CPFF, AMLF, PDCF,  and TSLF, and potentially the Treasury’s TARP authority  The good news is that we  will all benefit from some much-needed acronym relief; [laughter] the bad news is  that there are many risks involved  The expiration of any one of these programs  individually seems manageable, but it is more challenging to judge the effects of  removing them all together  That is one reason that we want to continue to monitor  markets closely with this in mind   As shown in the bottom panels, securitized credit markets also improved over the  intermeeting period  Here the story very directly involves the effects from  government programs aimed at supporting those markets  The consumer ABS market  has made considerable strides in the right direction  ABS spreads narrowed further,  as shown to the left, and new issuance continued at a decent clip  These  developments have been driven importantly by the ongoing support from the TALF  facility The July and August TALF subscriptions for ABS involved about  $21 billion of TALF-eligible issuance, of which about $12 billion was financed  through the facility Improvements in the CMBS market have generally been slower,  but the market has reacted favorably to recent news about the inclusion of CMBS in                         August 11–12, 2009 6 of 165  the TALF program and in the Treasury’s PPIP program  As shown to the right,  CMBS spreads have narrowed significantly since the last FOMC meeting  However,  spreads are still very wide by historical standards, and there has been no new  issuance With commercial real estate prices falling, delinquencies rising, and  considerable amounts of CMBS coming due through 2012, this sector is likely to face  considerable pressure for some time   As shown in the next exhibit, the positive sentiment reflected in recent asset-price  movements put upward pressure on Treasury yields  However, the changes were  fairly modest, with coupon yields moving up 5 to 15 basis points, on net, over the  intermeeting period  The market’s expectations for monetary policy steepened a  touch, as reflected in the rates on federal funds and Eurodollar futures contracts,  shown to the right   Our dealer survey helps to shed some more light on these policy expectations   The middle panels show the distribution of outcomes for the federal funds rate that  are perceived by the respondents for horizons of 12 months ahead (to the left) and  18 months ahead (to the right)  As can be seen, the modal forecast is for the federal  funds rate to remain unchanged at the 0 to 25 basis point range, even at that longer  horizon However, one feature of being at the zero bound is that the risks tend to be  skewed in only one direction The distributions show that respondents see some  probability of higher rates, with that probability building as the horizon extends  through 2010 This skewed risk profile has presumably pulled the futures rates up  relative to what is perceived to be the most likely outcome  Overall, investors  apparently expect that the recovery will be anemic enough to allow the Fed to keep  policy rates low well into 2010—a view that has been supported by FOMC  communications   Even though it is seen as still being a way off, market participants also focused on  whether the Fed will face any difficulties exiting from its accommodative policy  stance Investors reportedly took some comfort from Chairman Bernanke’s op-ed  piece in the Wall Street Journal and his monetary policy testimony on July 21  This  subject was also addressed by several other FOMC members over the intermeeting  period, with market participants taking note of the consistency of the message  The  discussion of exit is presumably aimed, in part, at keeping longer-term inflation  expectations anchored As shown in the bottom left panel, measures of the five-year  five-year-forward breakeven inflation rate rose over the intermeeting period and are  near the upper end of the range seen over the past several years  Our interpretation of  the level of the breakeven rate is the same as it was at the last meeting—that it has  moved up to levels that, while not alarming, show more balance in the perceived risks  around the inflation outlook As shown to the right, our dealer survey indicates that  the perceived likelihood of CPI inflation from five to ten years ahead is the highest in  the buckets from 15 percent to 25 percent—levels that are consistent with the long­ term inflation projections of most FOMC members                    August 11–12, 2009 7 of 165  The next exhibit focuses on the Fed’s large-scale asset-purchase programs  As  shown in the top left panel, purchases in those programs have continued at a fairly  robust monthly pace, though for each asset type the pace has slowed a touch  For  Treasuries, the slowing was intended to put the Desk on a trajectory to complete the  $300 billion of purchases in September  For agency securities and MBS, the slowing  was driven by market conditions and concerns that a faster pace of purchases would  risk some market disruption   In the Treasury market, there are no signs that our purchase program is having  detrimental effects on market functioning  As shown in the top right panel, the  amount of dispersion in Treasury yields around our smoothed yield curve has  diminished sharply from the very elevated levels that were seen late last year  This  improvement suggests that market participants have been increasingly willing and  able to engage in arbitrage, limiting the difference in yields across securities with  similar characteristics  The improvement was also likely driven by the Fed’s  participation in the market, as the Desk has often purchased less-liquid securities that  were trading at yields well above the smoothed yield curve  As shown in the middle  left, trading volume in the Treasury market stabilized and began to pick up in recent  months Moreover, bid–asked spreads ticked down for both repo and outright  transactions in recent months  Given these improvements in market functioning and  the fact that our purchases are not disproportionately large in that market, we  anticipate that there will be no significant disruption by the approaching winding  down of the Fed’s purchases of Treasury securities  As shown to the right, our  Treasury purchases, while certainly sizable, are not overwhelming the market  The  scheduled total purchases for the program will constitute about 8 percent of the  outstanding stock of Treasuries and 39 percent of the expected net issuance   As you know, the story is quite different for the purchases of agency debt and  MBS For MBS, scheduled Fed purchases will take up 28 percent of the outstanding  stock of securities and more than three times the amount of net issuance  Our  purchases represent even larger shares for the agency debt market  Given these sizes,  the impact of the Desk’s purchases has been considerable in the agency and MBS  markets  As shown in the bottom left panel, those purchases have contributed to a  dramatic decline in the option-adjusted spread of MBS to Treasury securities  That  spread has reached negative territory—an anomaly by historical standards  The  compression of the MBS spread and the associated pressures on the functioning of the  MBS market make the exit from this program trickier than is the case for the Treasury  program  Some options for winding down the purchase programs will be discussed at  the end of my briefing   In terms of economic effects, the MBS spread compression has strongly  contributed to the FOMC’s objective of providing stimulus to the economy  As  shown in the figure, the narrowing of the MBS spread has passed through to some  degree to the conforming-mortgage spread, which has declined to around 175 basis  points—near its historical norm  That, in turn, has kept primary mortgage rates lower  and supported housing activity It may be difficult or problematic for the Desk to                   August 11–12, 2009 8 of 165  collapse MBS spreads any further  Thus, it is worth considering why conforming- mortgage spreads have only retraced to their historical norm and not further  There  are two factors in play First, the prepayment option that is afforded to households in  their mortgages is very costly today  That is, the option adjustment in computing the  option-adjusted spread for MBS is unusually large, mostly because long-term interest  rate volatility has been very elevated  Second, but less important, the primary–  secondary mortgage spread still remains somewhat elevated  This likely reflects the  reduction in the number of originators and the tighter credit conditions for  warehousing those loans until securitization  Even with these impediments, the  compression of the conforming-mortgage spread has far outpaced that for other  mortgage products, such as adjustable-rate mortgages  As can be seen in the chart to  the right, while the ARM spread has come off its peak, the improvement in this  spread has been much more limited than is the case for fixed-rate mortgages  This  difference likely reflects the fact that, while the fixed-rate mortgage market has  benefited appreciably from the Federal Reserve’s MBS purchase program, the  adjustable-rate mortgage market has not  I will return to this issue and potential  changes to the Desk’s outright purchases of MBS at the end of my briefing   The ongoing purchase of assets has, by itself, continued to add to the size of the  Fed’s balance sheet As shown by the blue area in the top left panel of the last  exhibit, outright securities holdings associated with those programs expanded to  about $880 billion—about halfway toward the specified limit of $175 trillion  In  contrast to this ongoing expansion, the Fed’s liquidity programs continue to shrink, as  shown by the orange area in the chart This pattern largely reflects the substantial  improvement in money markets that was discussed above, which has made these  programs increasingly unattractive to users  Overall, summing across these  programs, the total size of the liquidity facilities has declined more than $1 trillion  from its peak earlier this year  This decline has just about offset the expansion of  asset holdings in recent quarters, keeping the overall size of the balance sheet near the  $2 trillion mark Nevertheless, as shown in the table, we expect the balance sheet to  begin to grow again going forward, as the steady rise in asset holdings and the  ongoing expansion of the TALF will begin to outpace the declines in liquidity  programs  We currently project that, absent any policy changes, the balance sheet  will reach a peak of just over $26 trillion by early 2010, after which it will begin to  decline gradually   That concludes my summary of recent developments in financial markets and  Desk operations I will now turn to two specific issues regarding Desk operations  going forward The first issue is whether to include mortgage-backed securities  backed by ARMs in the large-scale asset-purchase program  A memo was circulated  to you describing the arguments for and against a shift in this direction and  recommending a specific structure for those purchases if the FOMC were to decide to  move forward  I will briefly review the main points from the memo   The case for including ARMs rests primarily on the fact that they are currently an  expensive form of mortgage finance for households relative to fixed-rate mortgages                    August 11–12, 2009 9 of 165  As shown earlier, the Fed’s MBS purchases seem to have depressed the rates on  fixed-rate mortgages, whereas the rates on ARMs have instead remained high in  comparison  Given that they are relatively expensive, the use of ARMs has come to a  near stand-still  Including ARMs in the asset-purchase program might be seen as  beneficial for several reasons  First, given that their spreads remain wide, purchasing  ARMs-related securities might achieve a considerable improvement in their pricing  and hence might provide more economic stimulus than using those same funds to  purchase fixed-rate mortgages  Second, it would eliminate the distortion that the Fed  has created in households’ decisions between what mortgage product best suits their  needs Third, it would help the Desk to achieve the $125 trillion of MBS purchases  while, at the margin, taking some pressure off the fixed-rate MBS purchases  And  fourth, because ARMs have lower duration than fixed-rate mortgages, it would  reduce some of the interest-rate and income risk in the SOMA portfolio   However, there are also some counterarguments to consider  First, any  reallocation to ARMs, because it would come out of the total allocation of MBS  purchases, could reduce the effect of the fixed-rate MBS purchases  Second, it could  involve certain political and reputational risks  In particular, ARMs carry some  stigma given their association with the recent housing and financial crisis, and Fed  purchases may be seen as an endorsement of this product  Third, encouraging  households to move into ARMs may subsequently present an awkward situation  when the FOMC begins to raise short-term interest rates  Fourth, the ARM market is  less liquid and less transparent than the fixed-rate MBS market, which raises some  complications in the trading process and requires even more extensive reliance on  external investment managers  And fifth, given the size of the ARM market, the  magnitude of potential purchases is limited   If the FOMC decides to move in this direction, the Desk recommends a program  that would include 3/1, 5/1, 7/1, and 10/1 hybrid ARMs backed by Fannie Mae,  Freddie Mac, and Ginnie Mae The majority of purchases would be expected to take  place at the 5/1 sector, which has the largest amount of outstanding securities   Purchases would include both newly issued and existing ARMs and would exclude  interest-only ARMs The program would start with a targeted amount of $25 billion  in purchases, to be conducted over the remainder of the asset-purchase program,  although the pace and eventual size of the program would be adjusted in response to  market conditions  This allocation would come out of the $125 trillion total amount  of MBS purchases  These are the broad principles that the Desk proposes for guiding  ARMs purchases Actual implementation will also require the Desk to make a  number of decisions about specific operational issues, as summarized in the memo   The second issue for the FOMC to consider is the possibility of tapering the  Desk’s asset purchases as the end dates for the asset-purchase programs approach   The desirability of doing so depends on how one views the effects of those programs   The primary effect of those programs on market interest rates likely occurs through  altering the stock of securities available to investors  In a framework that considers  only such “stock effects,” there would be no response to the end of the LSAP                   August 11–12, 2009 10 of 165  programs as long as it was fully anticipated in the markets  However, it is also   possible that various market frictions allow the flow of purchases to have meaningful   effects on market interest rates  In this case, the cessation of purchases could create a   discrete market adjustment—the so-called “cliff effect”  This latter concern may be   particularly relevant when the Fed’s purchases are very large relative to the amounts   of outstanding supply and net issuance in a market, as is the case for the agency debt   and MBS programs  If there is at least some possibility of flow effects, it may be   desirable for the Fed to gradually reduce the pace of asset purchases rather than to   terminate them abruptly  The tapering could take place over a period of several   months around the end of the programs  This approach would allow any flow-related   effects on the markets to be spread out, helping to facilitate a smooth market   adjustment to a post-LSAP regime  Moreover, as long as the FOMC’s commitment   to the overall stock of purchases is unchanged, this strategy should have no   detrimental effects under the stock-based perspective on markets      In order to taper purchases and still reach the full amount of the programs, the  Committee would have to extend the end dates of the programs  The only other  alternative would be to increase the pace of purchases today in order to reduce it later,  but this approach could disrupt market functioning over the near term  The Desk  recommends a short extension of the Treasury program to the end of October, to  allow purchases to be tapered off over a period of two months or so  For agency debt  and MBS purchases, the Desk believes that a slightly longer tapering period is  appropriate The Desk would recommend extending those programs to the end of the  first quarter, with the intention of beginning to taper off purchases in a meaningful  way in December For each program, the Desk would decide on a more precise  schedule for reducing purchases while still hitting the total amount of purchases  decided by the FOMC The Desk recommends reaching the full allocation of  purchases for Treasuries and MBS in order to validate the market’s expectations that  have had beneficial effects on financial conditions  It is less important, in our view,  to reach the full allocation for agency securities   At this juncture, the FOMC has to decide only on its strategy for the Treasury   program, given that its expiration date is approaching  The agency and MBS   programs are not scheduled to expire until year-end  However, market participants   are beginning to discuss the exit from these other programs as well, and they are   likely to draw some inference about how these programs will be wound down from   the approach taken with Treasuries These considerations will be raised again in the   discussion of policy options and statements by Brian Madigan tomorrow    Right   So that’s right I was focusing on the level  The level of the conforming   spread is not far from historical norms, but the level of the ARM spread is still extremely   elevated compared with historical norms, although it has improved  I would interpret the   improvement as being driven not by Fed purchase programs but just by the broader recovery in   markets  You point out that it is not that different a magnitude from the improvement in   conforming-mortgage spreads, but I think that probably has to do with the fact that it was starting   from such a wider, more disrupted level   Well, I think that would presume that households have a more efficient   outlook on monetary policy than the bond market more broadly  Obviously, the yield curve in   Treasuries or in mortgages should reflect the expected path of short-term interest rates, so I   would think that normally the market would be priced in a way to make households relatively   indifferent, in terms of the risk, between ARMs and fixed-rate mortgages  The point is that   different households may have different preferences based on their different situations  So if the   purchase programs have had a very large effect on one product and absolutely no effect on the        August 11–12, 2009 12 of 165  other, it is creating a distortion that does not allow households to choose efficiently between the   two   Of interest only?   Sorry Yes, that is correct There is about $400 billion of ARMs in total    About $200 billion is interest only In the memo, we presented the arguments for and against   interest-only ARMs In the end, we made a recommendation, but I certainly think we viewed   that as an open issue for the Committee to discuss   I guess I wasn’t thinking of the ARMs purchases as really affecting the risk   profile of the outstanding securities  Obviously, those delinquency rates are very high  They are   very high for a lot of reasons, not necessarily that those products are ARMs but rather that those   ARMs are sold with very lax underwriting standards  So I think a benefit of purchasing ARMs is   not to bring back the kind of mortgage conditions that we saw previously but just to make these a   viable product if used with responsible underwriting going forward   In terms of whether to hold assets that have those delinquencies, we are talking about   buying only GSE-sponsored securities So part of the answer is that we are getting credit   protection from that and basically we are buying securities where any credit risks and issues like   that are already priced in So I do not really see it as a portfolio issue that the delinquencies are   going up but more as a reputational issue about whether the Fed wants to be involved in products   that are still very visibly associated with the housing bubble and the problems that ensued   The $200 billion is GSE-sponsored  In total, there’s $400 billion of GSE-  sponsored ARMs  I believe that outside the GSEs, there is about $1trillion of ARMs   outstanding   Correct   Correct     August 11–12, 2009 14 of 165  We’re starting with the $25 billion proposal  It is going to be useful to   compare that magnitude with the purchase program in fixed-rate MBS proportionally to that   market  With $25 billion, we are essentially buying a smaller portion of the outstanding stock         August 11–12, 2009 15 of 165  We would be buying about 15 percent of the eligible outstanding stock compared with 25 to 30   percent for the fixed-rate program  But we would be buying a much larger share of the gross   issuance—about double what we have seen for gross issuance so far this year—whereas on the   fixed-rate side, we are buying something like 75 to 100 percent of gross issuance  We have   calibrated it that way to be somewhat comparable, but I think that the question about what   market effects might ensue has to do with that gross issuance  The possibility is that, once the   ARM purchases begin, if the pricing improves, then of course you’ll see more ARM issuance,   and that will give you some scope to raise the size of the program if that is seen as a good   approach   In terms of what effect we might have on rates, I would not be surprised to see an effect   in the 50 to 100 basis point range The memo had some measures of the relative pricing of   ARMs versus fixed-rate mortgages, and the deviations were 50 to 150 basis points of difference    You can actually see in figure 24 that there’s a considerable difference in the size of the spreads    So given that this market is disrupted and given that it is relatively small, it wouldn’t be   surprising to have a very meaningful effect on the pricing  With fixed-rate mortgages, we started   from a very high spread in a market that was functioning poorly but not that poorly  Here we’re   talking about a market that’s not functioning well at all, so I think we could really have a   substantial effect by participating in the market   In some of the bigger liquid markets—Treasuries, MBS—we’ve obviously   seen considerable improvement from late last year and early this year, and I think enough   improvement to where we are now perhaps just on a slower ongoing trajectory for improvement    We are not back to where things were before the crisis  Bid–asked spreads are still a bit wider   than they were One thing that’s very different is that trade sizes seem to be a lot smaller  So   even at the quoted bid–asked spreads, market depth is much more limited  But it’s certainly not   bad It may take some time to get back to that  We may never actually get back to that  So I   think you would have to say that those markets in general are functioning quite well  The   corporate bond market as well  We have had a lot of corporate bond issuance, a lot of   improvement in pricing  So that looks quite decent  The markets that are still very disrupted, as   I mentioned in the briefing, are the securitized credit markets  There market activity is very   dependent on the TALF  There was basically nothing going on in CMBS until the TALF and the   PPIP came along, and what we have seen since the TALF and the PPIP is some pickup in   trading—actually some encouraging signs—but no new issuance still  So I think that those   markets will take quite some time to come back        August 11–12, 2009 17 of 165  Right   To my knowledge, we did not try the level of yields, and of course, chart 3   shows the outcome of just one model  But I think the argument that ARMs look expensive to   households seems pretty compelling  I mean, you do not need a regression to tell you that; you   can pretty much see it in chart 24 Even if activity tends to fall off when rates are low, we have   to at least entertain the idea that the apparent expense of ARMs—the wide spread that we see   today—is contributing to that falloff  So it’s possible that the purchase program would bring the   ARM spread in and make it more comparable with the fixed-rate spread but still households   would choose fixed-rate mortgages because those rates are very low  I think that’s possible, and   that’s fine I think one would argue, well, let’s bring that spread down and then let households   make that choice  So in no way are we suggesting that you target some proportion of ARM   issuance or push on this until you get ARM issuance back up  We are just saying that, you could   argue, Let’s bring down what looks to be a very wide yield spread, and let households make that   choice   That last question is certainly a tougher one than we aim to answer in the   memo  How far to go is a question for policymakers  However, let me say something about the   liquidity issue and whether the ARMs market is disrupted  In general, you know, the ARM   market is less liquid than the fixed-rate mortgage market  The fixed-rate mortgage market trades   on a TBA basis That means that a bunch of securities can be delivered into a contract, and that   adds a lot of liquidity to that market  It is traded over an electronic trading platform, Tradeweb    The ARM market is different It trades much more on a specified pool basis  There is no TBA   It is not on Tradeweb It is literally a deal-driven market in which, to execute an order, you need   to pick up a phone and talk to some dealers   This is the way it was before and the way it is now  So just in general the   ARM market is less liquid than the fixed-rate mortgage market  Today I think that difference is   greater than normal, and you can see that in terms of bid–asked spreads  The bid–asked spreads   for ARMs, for comparable-sized trades, are four to eight times what they are for fixed-rate   mortgages I think that difference has gotten greater, and one reason for that is that you have a   market in which there is just no new issuance, so there is no flow that is creating liquidity in     August 11–12, 2009 22 of 165  trading So it is really a market that—I don’t want to say it is completely dried up in terms of   trading, but it has suffered in terms of liquidity   We don’t have a nice time series of bid–asked spreads  In part because   there is no electronic platform, we don’t have a nice data source to give us a long historical   perspective   No I am saying that, given the lack of liquidity by these measures, given   the lack of issuance, and given the cheap pricing, I think the evidence in general supports the   idea that, if the Fed were to purchase those securities and encourage new issuance, you would   see a pickup in liquidity, and you would see these liquidity measures improve   No [Laughter]   Yes, they have to be GSE guaranteed     There is another point, which is that the expansion of the conforming-  mortgage limit has actually brought what would have been a lot of jumbo new issuance into the   conforming-mortgage market  Moreover, most fixed-rate MBS pools can have up to 10 percent   of jumbo conforming mortgages in them  So the asset-purchase programs already in place are   already helping to support some high-balance mortgages   Just to be clear, we are not bringing up this issue because of something that   has happened, a worsening of conditions, over the intermeeting period  I think we left the last   meeting thinking that this was an open issue and that we wanted to present the Committee with     August 11–12, 2009 26 of 165  the full range of arguments on both sides and let the Committee decide it  You know, we are   well into the program  We are at a point where people are beginning to discuss the exit  Maybe   there is an issue about whether it is the right time to be making changes like this, but we just   wanted to present the case In terms of timing, given the size of the program we are talking   about, there is no issue It would be very easy to get this program done in the size we have   talked about, in the time left   Yes I would just add, as Chairman Bernanke said, that the example you   gave of Bank of America is basically describing the portfolio balance effect, which underlies the   stock effect that I talked about  Basically, the system as a whole has to be forced to hold these   liquid assets instead of longer-term assets  To make participants happy to do that, the yields on   the longer-term assets have to be lower  The way we have thought about it is that this is all   priced in already If you believe a stock effect, where the effects are based on the expectation of   what the stocks are going to be, completing the asset purchase programs that are already   announced is going to force this portfolio reallocation  But markets tend to bring it forward, so   you don’t get the flow effect as it happens You get it priced up front  This flow versus stock   issue is something that we are conscious of, and maybe you are raising the fact that the flow   issue also depends on the level of reserves, and so we are still going to get some effect there  But   we tend to think of most of the effect as coming through the expected stock, even though we   allow some possibility of flow effects and make recommendations for policymakers to hedge   themselves in case there are these flow effects                       August 11–12, 2009 30 of 165   Yes When we did the balance sheet projections, we assumed the   extensions that Bill talked about   1  Thank you, Mr Chairman Prices on a broad range of risky assets  continued to rise over the intermeeting period, fueled by an improving economic  outlook and the low level of financing rates arising from the current stance of  monetary policy Broad equity indexes, shown in the upper left panel, rose more than  7 percent on balance, adding to the sizable recovery since the end of the first quarter   Corporate bond spreads, the upper right, edged down further, leaving them  dramatically improved from their levels earlier in the year   The gains over the past six months owe primarily to a more optimistic assessment  of the economic outlook and a perception that the downside risks to growth have  diminished  Indeed, as captured in our primary dealer survey in the middle left panel,  the upward revision in the expected path of GDP growth from earlier in the year has  been substantial In addition, respondents also indicated that the downside risks  around the expected growth path diminished notably over this period  This shift has  reduced the amount of uncertainty that investors see in risky asset prices, as indicated  by the relatively low levels of implied volatility on equities, shown to the right   The gains in asset prices have been so dramatic that market observers have begun  to wonder whether the markets have become too frothy, with some pointing to the  extensive liquidity provided by the Federal Reserve as a contributing factor  By  many metrics, however, asset valuations do not look too extended  The Board staff’s  measure of the equity premium, shown in the bottom left panel, is still high by  historical standards Likewise, by many measures, corporate yield spreads still look  relatively high, taking into account the outlook for defaults  As shown in the bottom   right, expected corporate defaults have fallen substantially since earlier in the year,  which likely explains a considerable portion of the narrowing of corporate yield  spreads   Overall, risky asset prices have come a long way over the past six months, but so  has the economic environment that they reflect   In contrast to the more accommodative conditions in financial markets, banks  continued to restrict credit to private borrowers  As shown in the upper left panel of  exhibit 2, the volume of private loans at commercial banks (the dark blue line) has  declined sharply This decline has not been driven by a lack of available funds, as  deposits (the orange line) have risen sharply and other sources of funding have  become more readily available  In fact, banks have been accumulating Treasury and  agency securities (the light blue line) over this period However, they have less  appetite for adding credit risk to their portfolios, as they continue to repair their  balance sheets and face additional loan write-downs going forward   Part of the decline in bank credit also reflects weaker demand  The business  sector as a whole has little need to raise new funds, and net borrowing by the sector  has been negative in recent months  In addition, firms with access to the market have  shifted towards corporate bonds as a source of financing  This shift can be seen in the                          September 22–23, 2009 5 of 212  amount of high-yield debt that has been issued since the first quarter, the upper right  panel The pattern for consumer credit is similar in some regards  Overall, consumer  credit is contracting sharply, despite the issuance of a decent volume of consumer- related ABS As shown in the middle left panel, ABS issuance reached $38 billion in  the third quarter, near its pace from the previous quarter   Activity in the ABS market has been supported to a great extent by the TALF,  with nearly all of the ABS deals in the third quarter brought to the market through the  TALF However, there are signs that dependence on the TALF is beginning to wane   Most notably, even though most issuance is TALF-eligible, the amount of that  issuance that is actually financed through the facility has been declining, a sign that  private credit markets have improved enough to make TALF financing relatively  expensive for some borrowers  At the September subscription, for example, only  $6 billion of the nearly $17 billion of ABS issued ended up being financed through  the TALF   The better financing conditions and the greater willingness of investors to take  risk have led to a further decline in ABS spreads, shown in the middle right panel   Spreads for AAA-rated consumer ABS have returned to levels not seen since the  middle of last year   Spreads also narrowed on outstanding CMBS, the bottom left, despite the ongoing  worsening in the outlook for the commercial real estate sector  The improvement in  CMBS has been very much tied to government support programs, as the PPIP and the  TALF have led market participants to anticipate greater demand for these assets  The  nine PPIP funds are in the process of raising capital and should begin purchases of  assets later this year, and the TALF has now included three subscriptions covering  legacy CMBS assets, financing over $4 billion of purchases  In addition, a recently  announced change by Treasury to the tax treatment of CMBS workouts seemed to  provide a further boost to their prices  Unfortunately, as shown to the right, issuance  of new CMBS remains completely shut down, and the TALF has yet to fund any  new-issue CMBS  Thus, the commercial real estate sector faces a very difficult credit  environment going forward   Despite the broad increase in risky asset prices, Treasury yields moved lower over  the intermeeting period  As shown in the upper left panel of exhibit 3, Treasury  coupon yields declined 15 to 30 basis points, on net  The most important sources of  the decline in longer-term rates, according to our dealer survey, were a decline in  inflation expectations, a reduction in upside inflation risks, and strong demand from  foreign official institutions Consistent with those responses, forward break-even  inflation rates, shown to the right, moved down over the intermeeting period   Investors also see less interest rate risk, as suggested by the implied volatility  measures shown in the middle left panel, which have fallen notably from their  elevated levels over the summer  The perceived reduction in upside inflation risk and  the decline in interest rate volatility may have contributed to a narrowing of the term  premium embedded in longer-term yields                                  September 22–23, 2009 6 of 212  Investors also apparently marked down the expected path of monetary policy, as  the substantial slack in the economy and other favorable inflation news supported the  view that the Fed would remain on hold for an extended period  As shown in the  middle right panel, futures prices now suggest a later start to policy tightening  That  brings the market pricing closer to the results from our dealer survey  As shown in  the bottom left, most survey respondents do not expect the tightening to begin until  the third quarter of 2010 or later   The FOMC’s decision to taper its purchases of Treasury securities, announced at  the last FOMC meeting, was well received by market participants  This approach is  widely seen by investors as a prudent exit strategy, and the announcement did not  prompt any response in Treasury yields  At present, the Desk has completed  $289 billion of purchases, and it plans to wind down its remaining purchases over the  next five weeks, as shown in the bottom right panel, while still reaching a cumulative  purchase total of $300 billion   The exit from the agency debt and MBS purchase programs could prove more  challenging, however As shown in the upper left panel of the next exhibit, option- adjusted MBS spreads over Treasury yields remain unusually tight  In our view,  Federal Reserve purchases have had a substantial effect on MBS rates, partly  accounting for this low level of spreads Market participants seem to agree with that  assessment  As shown to the right, the responses to our dealer survey indicate that  the purchase programs are seen as pushing down the current-coupon MBS rate by a  significant amount, with an average response of about 60 basis points  However, it is  worth noting that only a subset of respondents chose to provide such estimates, and  the responses vary over a wide range   Given these effects, some observers are concerned that the MBS rate will rise  sharply as the Fed’s purchases come to an end  The extent of these concerns should  depend on one’s views about how the purchase programs affect the markets  As we  have highlighted in recent memos, the effect on market interest rates could come  primarily through the stock of assets purchased, consistent with a portfolio balance  effect Under that perspective, even an abrupt end of the purchase program would not  create market difficulties, as the stock of assets held outside the Fed would not  change discretely However, we have also highlighted the possibility that the flow of  purchases could have some effect on rates due to various market imperfections  In  that case, one might be concerned about how the market would adjust to a sharp drop- off in asset purchases by the Fed   To gauge the scope of these different effects, we asked the respondents to our  dealer survey about their views on how the Fed’s asset purchases affect the market   The answers did not exactly settle the issue  In rough terms, about one-third of the  respondents said that the effects arise primarily through stock effects, one-third said  primarily through flow effects, and one-third said through both  [Laughter]  Moreover, in quantifying the effects of the purchase programs, most respondents saw                         September 22–23, 2009 7 of 212  the effects identified in the upper right panel as either partly or fully diminishing over  the six-month period after purchases end, consistent with the presence of some flow  effects   Given the responses from the survey, it may be prudent for the FOMC to take an  exit approach that is robust to the possibility of both stock and flow effects  This  consideration was the basis for the recommendation that the staff made at the last  FOMC meeting to taper the pace of purchases gradually as the programs come to an  end For this meeting, we provided a memo with more details about potential paths  for the purchases of MBS and agency debt   The strategy highlighted in the memo is to taper MBS purchases beginning soon  after the current FOMC meeting, with the intention of finishing the purchases by the  end of the first quarter One potential path under this strategy is shown by the light  blue line in the middle left panel  This approach would give the market time to adjust  to the declining presence of the Fed and to allow new purchasers of MBS to crowd in  and replace the Fed, which might smooth any interest rate response associated with  that process Another potential benefit is that it would allow the Desk to start letting  up on the gas pedal immediately, which could help to address any strains on market  functioning arising from our current pace of purchases, although our impression is  that market liquidity over the past month or two has been decent even at our current  rate of purchases   The FOMC could consider an even longer tapering period that lasts through the  second quarter, as shown by the red line However, this would involve a steeper drop  in purchases today, which would risk prompting some backup in mortgage rates in the  near-term  The Desk does not believe that the longer tapering period is needed for  facilitating the market adjustment or for ensuring market liquidity  Hence, any  decision to move in this direction should be based on other considerations, such as the  optimal amount and timing of the stimulus that policymakers desire   The memo also made a recommendation for tapering agency debt purchases  The  green line in the panel to the right shows that the pace of agency purchases would  have to pick up considerably to reach the $200 billion limit by year-end  The current  pace of purchases is already causing some strain on market functioning, so such an  increase is not advised An extension of the program through the first quarter would  allow the Desk to get to the $200 billion limit (the red line), though the amount of  tapering would be limited under that approach  Alternatively, the Desk could aim to  reach $175 billion of purchases through the first quarter, which would allow a decent  amount of tapering (the blue line)  One possibility is to allow the purchases to end up  somewhere between $175 and $200 billion, depending on how market conditions  evolve   The market effects of an announcement on tapering will also depend on whether  market participants make any inference about changes to the total size of the  programs  In particular, there is some risk that the announcement of a slowdown in                               September 22–23, 2009 8 of 212  the pace of purchases could be interpreted as a sign that the total size of the program  is being reduced This risk may be particularly acute when the program size provides  flexibility in that direction, as is currently the case with the “up to” language  When  the tapering of Treasury purchases was announced, the FOMC decided to drop the  “up to” portion of the targeted amount, which provided the markets with clarity about  the total size of the program and avoided this risk   As shown in the bottom panels, our dealer survey suggests that market  participants expect the Federal Reserve to reach the full $125 trillion limit for MBS  purchases That view is consistent with what the Desk has heard in conversations  with a broad set of traders and market analysts  The survey also indicates that agency  debt purchases are expected to reach the full $200 billion limit, although discussions  with traders indicate that this view is not held as uniformly or with as much  conviction In both cases, respondents expected purchases to continue into the first  quarter   The ongoing purchases of securities have now begun to outpace the decline in  balances at the Fed’s liquidity facilities, as shown in the upper left panel on the last  page, causing the size of the Fed’s total balance sheet to drift higher  We expect this  trend to continue, with the balance sheet projected to grow from its current level of  $21 trillion to a peak of $24 trillion by June 2010  This process will continue to add  reserves to the banking system  In addition, the drawdown of the Treasury’s SFP  balances from $200 billion to $15 billion over the next six weeks will boost the  amount of reserves even further  Overall, based on these developments, the level of  excess reserves is likely to increase from its average of around $850 billion in the  current maintenance period to nearly $12 trillion by the end of the year   I will conclude my briefing by describing recent developments in short-term  funding markets and the associated effects on lending through our shorter-term  liquidity facilities  The rates at which some of the largest financial institutions can  obtain unsecured credit have fallen impressively, as indicated by the LIBOR–OIS  spreads shown in the upper right panel The spread for the three-month maturity  point has dropped all the way to 12 basis points—a level that was seen as normal  ahead of the financial crisis This improvement reflects greater confidence in the  soundness of the financial system, a greater willingness to extend credit, and a  gradual reduction in borrowers’ demand for funds  For similar reasons, the market  for borrowing by nonfinancial firms has also improved, as shown in the middle left  by the tight spreads on commercial paper    However, while some firms face few funding constraints, others reportedly have  much less access to the market  Indeed, even in the LIBOR panel, there remains  some degree of tiering in the pricing of credit across borrowers, and anecdotal  evidence suggests that such tiering is much more extensive for financial firms outside  the LIBOR panel   In terms of secured financing, the repo market is generally functioning well                                       September 22–23, 2009 9 of 212  Repo volumes have stabilized after the steep decline that began late last year, and  bid–asked spreads on many types of transactions have improved considerably from  the high levels reached during the crisis  However, there is now much more  differentiation across types of collateral  As shown in the middle right panel, haircuts  in the repo market widened sharply for lower-quality collateral during the crisis and  have remained very disperse  This type of differentiation is expected to persist to  some degree   Overall, the financial crisis has caused some lasting changes to the way short-term  funding markets operate, with greater differentiation across both borrowers and types  of collateral Nevertheless, market participants seem to have adjusted to these  changes, and access to short-term funding has been improving for many borrowers   This improvement has been sufficient to reduce the usage of the Fed’s liquidity  facilities by market participants, as most facilities were priced to be attractive during  periods of financial stress but uneconomical during normal periods  The amount of  credit provided by these facilities, shown in the bottom left, has shrunk dramatically  from over $15 trillion early this year to less than $350 billion today—a decline that  has spanned all of the facilities  This decline indicates that the automatic exit strategy  that was built into the design of these facilities has worked well   It is important to note, however, that these volumes might not be on a simple glide  path to zero The table to the right shows the number of firms that remain in the  facilities, as well as the number of borrowers that have continuously relied on the  facilities since June  The Fed is likely to face an adverse selection problem in which  firms with limited outside financing options prove the most challenging to push out of  the facilities Federal Reserve staff has begun to engage those firms remaining in  each facility in discussions about their plans for exiting the program in order to ensure  the least disruptive transition from these facilities once they expire   That concludes my prepared remarks   I can There’s a lot of focus on the LIBOR–OIS spread, which seems to   give the impression that the market has completely returned to previous practices  I wanted to           September 22–23, 2009 10 of 212  present some evidence suggesting that that’s not the case, but rather that the market does look   different today from the way it looked several years ago  In particular, as I said in the remarks,   there’s just much more differentiation across types of collateral and, to some degree, across types   of borrowers Those are lasting changes, not only in that they have persisted to today, but also in   that we expect them to persist, at least to some degree, indefinitely, as the market moves towards   more reasonable pricing and a more reasonable structure going forward  It makes sense  There   certainly should be a good deal of differentiation across different types of collateral  For   example, some of the collateral listed in this chart is riskier—it’s harder to put a price on it, so   you don’t know the value of the collateral, so, certainly, the idea that the market would require a   haircut for that kind of collateral seems reasonable  That was the point We see those changes as   likely to persist, to some degree at least, going forward   Correct But I think there’s a possibility that we’ll see structural changes as   well For example, a working group has been formed to look at the triparty repo market and   some of the credit issues that arose in that market during the crisis In the end, depending on   what the solutions are, structural change could also affect pricing in these markets   I think there’s less conviction that we’ll follow through to the full limit on   the agencies, and that’s primarily because there’s a recognition by market participants that the   pace of purchases is causing some strain in the market  And it’s also because the pace of   purchases is not sufficient to get us to the $200 billion limit by the end of the year  You can see   that in chart 22—we’d need a pretty sharp increase in the pace of purchases to get to the   mandated total  So I think the inference that investors have drawn is that the Committee is less   committed to getting to that total on the agency debt side than it is on the MBS side   At this point, I think that outcome would likely prompt some backup in   MBS rates It’s difficult to gauge the magnitude of that increase, but it wouldn’t be surprising if   it were on the order of, say, 15 to 30 basis points, something like that  In the past, the staff has   looked at a variety of evidence and used rules of thumb suggesting that something like   $100 billion of a surprise—in any purchase program—could be worth something like 6 to   10 basis points on ten-year yields So that estimate would be consistent with those metrics  I           September 22–23, 2009 12 of 212  think it’s important to realize that market participants see a sizable effect today  They seem to   have a pretty strong conviction that the program will go all the way to $125 trillion  So those   two things mean that that announcement would be a surprise   I think it wouldn’t necessarily be disruptive to the market, at least in any   sustained sense Obviously, it would be a surprise upon announcement  There would be some   adjustment, but presumably the market would reprice and begin to function just fine  I think the   broader question of whether it’s a good thing is an issue for the FOMC  It would mean a higher   cost of housing and, obviously, the associated effects on the strength of the economy   They see the effect today as 60 basis points   I was talking about yields The dealer survey question is about yields  It’s   true that we look at spreads, as indicated in the chart in the briefing  We look at spreads as a   useful measure to look for those effects, but I think ultimately we care about the effects on   yields So we were careful to phrase the dealer question to be about yields and not spreads  I   think you would assume some of that effect passes through to Treasuries, but, obviously, not one   for one   We’re talking about an effect on MBS yields  So whether it’s 15 to   30 basis points or up to 60 basis points, we’re talking about the effect on MBS rates  I would   expect some portion of that to pass through to Treasury yields and to yields more broadly           September 22–23, 2009 14 of 212  When we modeled MBS spreads—and we’ve used a variety of models—   some of them included other credit spreads  There does seem to be some co-movement between   MBS spreads and other credit spreads  I think that was probably the case in that earlier period,   and, obviously, we see this pattern of widening into the crisis and then improving in other   markets as well  I think the difference is that the improvement in the MBS spread has been so   sharp and has corresponded so strongly with the purchase programs that we don’t think this   narrowing just reflects some improvement in credit and some cyclical effect  We think it goes   well beyond that   Having said that, I would like to say it is hard to determine how far beyond some   sustainable level the spreads are  Here, I’m showing a measure relative to Treasuries  This   spread is negative That looks anomalous by historical standards, so you could look at this chart        September 22–23, 2009 15 of 212  and eyeball it and say, “Well, maybe the spread is 50 basis points below what’s sustainable”    But if we measure it relative to swap rates, it doesn’t look quite as extreme  I would say relative   to swap rates it looks like MBS are maybe 25 basis points beyond fundamentals   Our general conclusion is that we believe the purchases have had a very large effect on   the spreads Starting from a disrupted market, I think it’s very fair to conclude that the purchases   have collapsed those spreads more than 100 basis points  The harder question is Have they   collapsed them to normal or through normal, and, if through normal, how far?  Based on the   range of models we’re estimating trying to answer this question, something like 25 to 50 basis   points looks like a reasonable guess   Well, there is a range of interpretations  Let’s say we assume half the effect   comes through stock, and half the effect comes through flow  In this case, if the total effect is 50   to 75 that means, say, we have 35 and 35  You’re right about the stock effect not changing   dramatically  The expected stock effect is shifting, but if we take your one-fifth, we’re talking   maybe 10 basis points, max  But, of course, the flow effect is going to diminish as well   When we look at these responses, 50 to 75 basis points, and at how these respondents   answered about how the effects would evolve going forward, they essentially almost uniformly   assume that the effect would diminish from now to six months after the conclusion of the   purchases So, implicitly, they were putting a lot of weight on flow effects in those responses    We didn’t push too hard on that because it’s a small number of responses  We didn’t really dig   into it very much and follow up with them on why they had so much reversal  But I think when   we look at the dealer survey as a whole, it suggests that flow effects are a big part of this   No, that’s okay   Well, I think we’ve had a very sharp rally reflecting the size of the revision   to the economic outlook and the very substantial shift in the perceived risks around that outlook    So, yes, it is big by historical standards, but there is a very extreme update to the outlook among   market participants  The question is Going forward, can you sustain that pace?  The answer is    Definitely no Going forward, the equity market gains are going to be governed by changes in   earnings revenue and by changes in the valuation or the equity premium that was shown in the   chart On the earnings revenue side, earnings have been good, but a lot of that good news has              September 22–23, 2009 18 of 212  come from cost-cutting  We don’t have a lot of top-line GDP growth, so it will be hard to   produce a robust enough earnings environment, given the GDP forecast, for that to be the engine   of ongoing substantial equity market gains  I think a bigger question is the equity premium that I   showed in the bottom left panel  There we have scope for further narrowing, so that could be   one source of ongoing gains But, as you can see, we’ve already narrowed a good amount, so   even there we’re kind of losing capacity   But keep in mind that we’re going up very rapidly  We had a 7 percent gain this   intermeeting period, and for a while I was describing that as underperformance relative to the   previous intermeeting periods  So I think, of course, this can level out  My main point was not   that we should expect to sustain these increases, but that these increases have not necessarily set   us up for some kind of a reversal, because the increases have not pushed valuations beyond what   looked reasonable under some models    That’s correct   We try to retain some flexibility for varying the flow of purchases in   response to market conditions and in response to the kinds of offers that we receive  That’s the   main answer  I think it would be problematic if the market had no sense of what our pace of           September 22–23, 2009 19 of 212  purchases was going to be, or what kind of target we were trying to get to  But they know all of   that, so we just afford ourselves some ability to vary over time in response to market conditions   We do exercise discretion in terms of how much to push the markets on any given day,   especially in the MBS program and in the agency debt program  We will have a target for   purchasing, currently around $25 billion a week for MBS, but what we actually realize in a given   week depends on the market conditions that we see and how much we seem able to buy without   causing problems in market functioning  So the main answer is that we don’t commit to a   schedule of purchase amounts, because we want to retain that flexibility   First, let me just clarify one thing  We don’t announce in advance paths for   the size of MBS purchases When we do Treasury operations, we do announce the size the day   before the operation is conducted   But we don’t pre-commit to the size—that’s what I meant  In the agency   market, a lot of the feedback is anecdotal  We look at trading volumes, we look at bid–asked   spreads, but we also rely a lot on discussions with market participants  And we see a number of   things For example, for a time we weren’t buying on-the-run issues  We were only buying off-  the-run issues And what we saw was actually a reverse on-the-run premium develop, in the   sense that the on-the-run yields were actually higher than all of the off-the-run yields                                                                      September 22–23, 2009 20 of 212  So we certainly look at this market and say, “Well, our purchases are really pushing   prices a lot They are taking a lot of the floating supply in the market”  And we hear back from   dealers that they are affecting dealers’ willingness to short issues out of fear that there is not   enough floating supply to cover those positions  So we look at a variety of evidence   This isn’t too controversial We are very big in that market  I think in the last briefing I   indicated that our purchases were something like ten times the net issuance in the agency sector   that we expected over the program  So we are very big relative to issuance and the size of that   market, and it’s quite clear that that’s causing some problems for marketing functioning   For the Treasury purchases and the MBS purchases, I would say the answer   is yes, I think we’ve had a substantial effect on market interest rates  Assuming your objective   was to lower market interest rates and simulate economic activity, I think those programs have   been very successful It’s less clear how the agency debt purchase program has led to those   effects Obviously, there are indirect channels through affecting the agencies’ ability to finance   themselves and maybe their purchases of mortgages  But they’re not expanding their balance   sheets, so I would say the benefits of that program are less clear to me   Our view is that it’s not that the MBS purchases have had an effect and the Treasury   purchases just didn’t work  It’s just that the sizes were disproportionate  It’s easy to see the MBS effects,   because the program was so large relative to that market; it’s harder to see the Treasury effects, because   the purchase is supposed to work through supply, but net supply was actually going up quite rapidly So   we may have offset some upward pressure on yields   Yes I think the purchases take duration out of the market regardless  There are   some other differences  The MBS purchases actually take some negative convexity out of the market,                     September 22–23, 2009 39 of 212  too, and you don’t have that with Treasuries  So there are some differences  But the big effect is all of   these purchases pull out duration, and, in that regard, you would think they would have some effect on all   longer-term assets, and I think that’s true to a degree But I think one thing we realize is that there’s not   perfect substitution across our asset classes, so when we talk about large-scale MBS purchases, we see the   effect most pronounced on MBS rates   Well, I think it means that there are spillovers, but they’re just hard to see  If we   talk about the effect of the MBS purchases and we look at the spread and say, “Well, maybe it looks like   the spread is 50 basis points,” so the effect on the spread is 50 basis points  I think it means probably that   the effect on the rate is actually larger and some of it has spilled over into Treasuries as well   When you think about the effects through a portfolio-balance channel,   you’re right that it depends on if and how the purchases are sterilized  If you’re buying MBS   and sterilizing that by selling long-term Treasuries, you’d be having a much smaller effect on   duration in the market, and so it would be getting a smaller yield effect   If it’s sterilized through reverse repos, for example, even if the reserve   paths aren’t different, essentially the portfolio-balance effect still works, because you’ve changed   the duration and the supply of those assets in the market, which is what we think, at least   partially, prompts the effect on yields   The estimate of the effect of total program purchases?              September 22–23, 2009 44 of 212  I said that if the MBS purchases were ended at $1 trillion, then perhaps the   upward pressure on MBS rates would be 15 to 30 basis points   Again, it’s a very uncertain estimate, but just to put an order of magnitude   on the table   Right This is really to a point Bill Dudley made  We are talking strictly   about supply effects, portfolio-balance effects  Any signals about the path of short-term interest   rates or the FOMC’s policy inclinations would be on top of that  So if it were interpreted as a   step towards tightening, and market participants, for example, moved up the expected timing of   tightening, you would get further effects   I would say unsterilized Certainly, the biggest announcements in March   were beyond the period in which the Desk was sterilizing the operations           September 22–23, 2009 45 of 212  I’m sorry  What exactly is sterilized?   No, I would say we have not sterilized the purchases   Okay But if we’re talking about sterilization through short-term credit, and   through the withdrawal of short-term credit, you’re still left with a change in the supply of the   long-term asset, you’re still left with the shift in duration from the purchases  There are different   kinds of sterilization If you’re sterilizing, as I said, by selling long-term assets, that would really   work against the portfolio-balance effect  If it’s being sterilized by reducing short-term credit, I   don’t think it works against the portfolio-balance effect that much, because it is not affecting the   fact that the market is holding that much less duration than it was before   I think even using the end of first quarter provides a six-month tapering   period, which is actually pretty long  The concerns I raised in the briefing were that a longer   tapering period certainly will require a much steeper drop-off in the pace of purchases in the near   term  As policymakers, the risk to be taken into consideration is whether that will actually   prompt a quicker backup in mortgage rates   My main point was that, from a market functioning perspective, I thought Q1 is a   sufficient tapering period So I wouldn’t use market functioning as an argument for going all the   way to Q2 I think that decision would have to be based instead on market effects and policy   flexibility and things that fall in your domain, not mine   No, I don’t have a problem  I don’t think it’s a massive source of confusion   if it says “completed,” but I have no problem with “executed” either   1  Thank you The surge in the prices of risky assets that has taken  place since March cooled off over the intermeeting period, as investors took note of  the economic risks that remain and the ongoing difficulties facing the financial sector   As shown in the top left panel of the first exhibit, broad equity indexes declined  modestly, on net, since the last FOMC meeting  That is a notable downshift from the  gains posted over the previous four intermeeting periods, which averaged over  8 percent per period   The drop in equity prices occurred despite favorable earnings surprises for the  third quarter As shown in the top right panel, more than 80 percent of the firms in  the S&P 500 index beat expectations—an unusually high portion by historical  standards However, investors also focused on the growth of revenue, which was  generally less impressive, and questioned the sustainability of profit growth   Moreover, equity prices no longer benefited from the substantial upward revisions to  the economic outlook that had propelled earlier gains  Indeed, recent economic data  have been seen as mixed, and the GDP forecasts of most market participants were  essentially unchanged from the previous FOMC meeting, as indicated in the dealer  survey responses in the middle left panel   One factor weighing on stocks was a growing concern among investors about  prospects for financial firms  Banks’ earnings reports continued to highlight many of  the problems facing that sector, and investors also became increasingly concerned  about how pending regulatory changes would affect those institutions  As a result,  financial shares lost ground over the intermeeting period, as shown in the middle right  panel Nonfinancial firms continued to be seen as relatively healthy  Indeed, yield  spreads on corporate bonds narrowed further over the intermeeting period, although at  a less rapid pace than earlier in the year, as shown in the bottom left panel    Overall, despite their sharp gains from earlier in the year, we do not see equity or  corporate bond prices as stretched well beyond fundamental values  This can be seen  in the Board’s equity premium measure, shown to the right, which is wide by  historical standards It is also reflected in recent work by the New York Fed staff on  high-yield bonds, suggesting that those yield spreads are near the levels expected  given the outlook for defaults Our assessment is that, overall, the levels of US asset  prices appear reasonable   Nevertheless, this assessment could change if the very  rapid gains from earlier in the year were to continue  In this regard, the flattening out  of asset prices since the last meeting could be regarded as a favorable development,  as it suggests that those prices are still connected to fundamentals   As shown in the next exhibit, Treasury yields were little changed, on balance,  since the last FOMC meeting  In part, this pattern reflects that the incoming  economic news has been mixed and has not provided any clear direction for yields   Investors also took note of the considerable volume of commentary by Fed officials   As shown in the top right panel, FOMC members gave no less than 30 speeches in the  month of October  I’m all for Central Bank transparency, but this may be going a bit              November 3–4, 2009 5 of 201  far [Laughter] Many of those speeches were seen by the markets as containing  directional information about the likely course of monetary policy, and investors saw  some of those messages as conflicting with one another  In part for this reason,  investors marked down the grade they gave you on communications in our dealer  survey Despite all of the focus on these speeches, the implied policy path was little  changed, on net, as shown in the middle left panel  Investors continue to expect  policy to remain on hold until at least the middle of 2010   This accommodative policy stance is one of the factors that market participants  see as contributing to the decline in the dollar from earlier this year, as shown in the  middle right panel  The degree of angst about the dollar seems to have been building  in recent months, as its weakness has been widely discussed among market  participants A key policy question is whether the dollar movement reflects an  appropriate response to the outlook for the economy and policy or whether it is the  beginning of a more abrupt decline that could ultimately produce a problematic  increase in inflation or inflation expectations  We lean toward the former  explanation The decline to date has been smooth and orderly—at a pace not much  different from that seen before the fall of 2008  In fact, over this intermeeting period,  the dollar was essentially flat against our major trading partners  Moreover, some of  the recent weakening reflects an unwinding of the surge in the dollar that took place  during the financial crisis It is also worth noting that currency options markets do  not seem to be pricing in considerable odds of an abrupt dollar decline, as indicated in  the pricing of risk-reversals against the euro, in the bottom left panel  These do not  show a premium for protection against sizable dollar depreciation, and in fact, are  now pointed in the opposite direction    That said, we are mindful of the risks that are present, given the widespread focus  of investors on this issue Moreover, the Treasury market is pricing in a bit more  inflation protection than was the case at the last FOMC meeting  As shown in the  bottom right panel, some measures of forward breakeven inflation rates have turned  higher of late, though they are still within historical ranges  In any event, we will  closely monitor these markets for any signs that a more definitive correlation between  dollar weakness and inflation expectations is developing    As covered in your next exhibit, the Desk completed the last of its scheduled  Treasury purchase operations last week I thought it would be useful to provide a  summary of the program and to discuss its effects  In total, the Desk conducted sixty  outright purchase operations in Treasury securities, bringing the cumulative total  purchases to $300 billion on the nose The top left panel shows the pace of purchases  that we implemented over the program, including the tapering of the purchases at the  end of the program  The top right panel shows the distribution of the securities  purchased across maturities  As was announced in a Desk statement at the start of the  program, the purchases spanned all outstanding maturities beyond a year, but the  majority of securities purchased were in the two- to ten-year sector  With these  purchases, the Desk removed a considerable portion of the duration that was issued to  the market over that period               November 3–4, 2009 6 of 201  The middle two panels indicate that market functioning has improved over the  period covered by the purchase program  The left panel shows the amount of  dispersion across Treasury yields relative to our smoothed yield curve, which could  be taken as a proxy for the degree to which balance sheet constraints and extreme risk  aversion prevented relative value trading in the market  This measure has come in  notably, with many attributing some of that pattern to our purchases  Liquidity  measures for the Treasury market have also improved  Bid-asked spreads have also  come in from the high levels earlier this year, and the depth of market quotes, shown  to the right, has risen Overall, the Treasury market has recovered notably from the  strains during the crisis, and there are no signs that our pullback from the market is  causing that improvement to reverse    The other key issue is whether the Treasury purchases, along with the other LSAP  programs, were successful at lowering longer-term yields  Some have pointed to the  fact that the 10-year Treasury yield has risen since the onset of purchases and have  used that fact to argue that the program was not effective  We do not find that  argument particularly compelling  The problem is that it fails to define the  counterfactual of what would have happened to yields in the absence of the  purchases In fact, many regression models of longer-term yields would have  predicted them to rise over this period  This can be seen from a modification of the  Backus–Wright yield model from their 2007 Brookings publication, shown in the  bottom left panel  The fact that yields remain below the model’s prediction is at least  suggestive that the asset purchases have had some effect  A different approach to  measuring the effects of asset purchases is based on event-study  As was presented to  the Committee earlier in the year, this exercise takes a list of dates on which  important announcements were made about LSAPs and aggregates the movements in  yields on those dates The updated results, shown in the bottom right panel, indicate  that the yield movements around LSAP announcements were substantial  Together,  the regression and event-study evidence suggests that LSAP programs have had  notable effects in lowering Treasury yields  We associate these effects primarily with  changes to the stock of securities, arising through a portfolio balance channel, and  hence we would not expect them to unwind as purchases end  To date, that appears to  be playing out Indeed, the market barely noticed the end of the Treasury purchase  program—which is what we had hoped would happen    As I noted in the last briefing, we are somewhat more worried about how the  markets will react to the winding down of the agency debt and MBS purchase  programs  Even in those markets, however, the basic message is “so far so good”   The top panels of exhibit 4 show the pace of purchases for agency debt and MBS  As  can be seen, the Desk has begun to follow the tapering program that was decided at  the last FOMC meeting  This strategy will slowly reduce the pace of purchases while  still getting to total levels consistent with the Desk directives  For MBS, the  projected path takes total purchases to $125 trillion  For agency debt, the Desk  directive had given us some flexibility, but we were following a path aimed at a total  purchase amount of $175 billion                 November 3–4, 2009 7 of 201  As could be seen in the event-study results, the effects of the LSAPs appear to  have been even greater on agency securities and MBS than on Treasury securities,  causing those spreads to narrow The middle panels show the history of spreads on  the two asset classes As we have noted before, spreads relative to Treasury securities  appear unusually tight Part of the concern of market participants is that the purchase  programs have driven spreads to these narrow levels and that the end of the programs  will cause them to move back to historical norms, pushing agency securities and MBS  rates higher However, it is hard to judge the magnitude of this risk  In that regard, it  is worth noting that the MBS spread does not look unusually narrow when measured  relative to swaps, as shown to the left    MBS purchases may have an additional effect on MBS rates beyond their  influence on option-adjusted spreads  Purchases of MBS not only remove duration  from the market; they also remove prepayment risk  Investors generally find it  challenging to hold the negative convexity of MBS associated with prepayment risk,  and hence they demand an extra return to bear that risk, which keeps MBS rates  higher than they would otherwise be The removal of a considerable amount of this  risk by the Fed’s purchases could therefore work to lower MBS rates by offsetting  this effect Accordingly, it might be useful to watch the pricing of instruments that  markets use to hedge this risk, such as the implied volatility from swaptions shown in  the bottom left panel, to see if they come under any upward pressure as the Fed backs  away from its MBS purchases     Lastly, I would like to make a note about the distribution of our MBS purchases   There was a period earlier this year when refinancing activity led to a greater amount  of production of new MBS with coupons of 4 and 45 percent  The Desk strategy  taken at that time was to concentrate purchases in those coupons in order to soak up  the new supply and facilitate this refinancing  This can be seen in the current  distribution of our MBS holdings, the dark blue bars in the bottom right panel  More  recently, we have begun to spread out our purchases into higher coupons and plan to  continue to do so This strategy is reflected in the distribution of holdings that we  project for the end of the program, shown by the light blue bars  The purpose of this  shift is to achieve greater diversification in our holdings across coupons  The higher- coupon securities will be relatively more liquid than the lower-coupon securities in  the event that mortgage rates increase, which could prove useful if the Committee  wants to engage in larger amounts of dollar rolls or to conduct outright sales    These asset-purchase programs have pushed the total size of the balance sheet up  to about $22 trillion, as shown in the top left panel of the last exhibit  Outright asset  holdings now account for about $17 trillion of that total  It is this component of the  balance sheet that presents the most significant exit challenges, as those holdings will  run off only slowly on their own and will therefore keep reserves in the banking  system for a long time  The staff’s work on developing tools for draining reserves  and for raising short-term interest rates is advancing well, as Jim Clouse and Chris  Burke will cover in their briefings  And the market seems generally to accept that we                             November 3–4, 2009 8 of 201  have sufficient tools to exit However, market participants are increasingly looking  for guidance on how the tools will be used—for example, what will be the timing of  reserves draining relative to increases in the IOER rate and what quantity of reserves  will be taken out of the system    As shown to the right, the Desk asked dealers about the likelihood of various tools  being used to drain reserves Not surprisingly, respondents placed high odds on the  FOMC using reverse repurchase agreements and term deposits  What was more  surprising was that the respondents put about 50 percent odds on using outright asset  sales as well However, there was considerable disagreement about the likelihood of  asset sales, with the responses ranging from 5 percent to 100 percent odds, as  indicated by the line   In contrast, the exit from liquidity facilities is already well along toward  completion  Those facilities were priced to facilitate their wind-down  As shown in  the middle left panel, that process has worked well, as the improvement in money  market functioning and the abundant supply of reserves have made our programs  unattractive to most borrowers, leading to a dramatic shrinking in the volume of  activity at those programs  Currently, only four of the programs have any outstanding  volume, with the total amount of credit totaling about $200 billion    Although the exit design has worked well overall, it might require some effort to  get the remaining balances to shrink to zero in an orderly way  Indeed, as I pointed  out in my last briefing, the Fed faces an adverse-selection problem in which the  remaining firms are the ones with more-limited opportunities to obtain outside  financing With this in mind, the Federal Reserve staff has begun to engage the firms  remaining in the facilities on a bilateral basis to encourage them to plan for  transitioning away from the Fed’s facilities  These discussions have already helped  this process notably  The remaining firms have received a clearer signal that such a  transition is necessary and have made progress toward developing alternative  liquidity plans As indicated in the middle right panel, the number of firms remaining  in the facilities has declined, and we will continue to engage those remaining firms to  ensure a smooth exit    I will close by discussing another issue in money markets—the approaching year- end The bottom left panel shows the estimated effect of the year-end on the two- month LIBOR rate and compares it with the levels observed at this point during past  year-end periods Unlike previous year-ends, we are not seeing much upward  pressure on the LIBOR rate This observation could reflect the fact that the demand  for unsecured credit is fairly limited given the abundance of reserves and liquidity in  the system    Where we may see some unusual behavior over the year-end is in the Treasury  market  It is possible that the heightened demand for safe assets will cause Treasury  bill yields and GC repo rates for Treasury collateral to turn negative over year-end   Indeed, the implied forward rate for bills for the week spanning year-end is already at               November 3–4, 2009 9 of 201  around minus 15 basis points, as shown in the bottom right panel  This is not an   unusual degree of softness relative to other short-term interest rates; however, it is   notable because, given the low absolute level of rates, this softness pushes the yield   into negative territory    This consideration raises a policy question of whether the Federal Reserve should   use its balance sheet to offset such a development  We could do so by supplying   more Treasury collateral to the market, either by a special TSLF operation over year-  end or through reverse repurchase agreements  As for now, we are inclined to think   that mildly negative Treasury yields are not problematic and would not require such a   policy response However, any signs that the rates are going more deeply negative   and are causing disruption to market functioning could change that assessment    Thank you    There is a lot of talk about the carry trade, and I think when we talk about   the carry trade we need to be careful to distinguish whether we are talking about a fundamental   story that we would expect to take place or whether we are talking about something beyond that   The fundamental story would be that low financing rates in the United States should make it   attractive to borrow and to go long other assets And you should evaluate the return on those   other assets relative to the return that investors could get on a risk-free asset, which is quite low    To the degree that the carry trade reflects that activity, I think it is perfectly reasonable and   desirable The question is, “Do we see so much activity that it goes beyond that, where the low   financing rates are causing asset prices to go up too far because there is too much leverage and   too much risk-taking?”              November 3–4, 2009 10 of 201  That is what I tried to focus on, in the context of US assets, in exhibit 1  I think the only   way to answer that question is to turn to the models and try to make an assessment of fair value    And for US assets, we do not see a problem at this point because, as I said, we think they are   fairly priced  I do think there are greater concerns regarding assets outside the United States, in   particular emerging market assets  We don’t look at those in detail, so I don’t have as detailed an   answer, but we have certainly heard quite a bit of concern being expressed about the prices on   those assets being pushed up too far  So I think it is a concern, or it is a risk to be aware of, but I   would think at this point it is directed toward emerging-market asset prices     The short answer is that there is a lot of uncertainty about calibrating the   effects  Absolutely  And the uncertainty in these two panels comes from different sources in   some way  In the one on the left, like any model of fair value, the results have only a certain   degree of statistical significance and can depend on the type of model that you write down  This   model actually includes a supply variable directly, which it does find is statistically significant,   and then we can use that to back out, in the context of the model, what it thinks the effects of the        November 3–4, 2009 11 of 201  LSAPs would be  The point estimate is something around 50 basis points, but it has a   confidence interval that certainly spans easily from 20 to 80 or so   The uncertainty on the right is a bit different, but equally important  The advantage of   the event-study exercise is to zoom in on the LSAP events, so that we can be sure we are   isolating the effect of the LSAPs Of course, the downside of event-studies is that they give you   no perspective on whether those effects persist and what the dynamics are thereafter  If you have   an efficient-markets hypothesis, you might expect them to persist  I mean, it would be odd, in   the context of efficient markets, if they predictably reversed in a timely way  We have some   confidence that some of this effect persists, but I guess I wouldn’t want to hang my hat on saying   absolutely that this entire effect persists  So that is the source of uncertainty there  I take this   evidence together to suggest that the LSAPs have worked  There has been some effect, but it is   very difficult to quantify, no doubt   I think it is useful, regarding that question, just to relate what we hear from   the market participants who come through our door and talk to us about this  Almost everyone   thinks that MBS spreads are too low and are too low because of Fed purchases  There is   disagreement about the size of those effects, but if you ask me to give you a range, I would say                November 3–4, 2009 12 of 201  that the range we hear is 25 to 100 basis points  My own view is that it is going to be much   closer to the lower end of that, but certainly that is hard to pin down   The logical next question is to ask, “Well, if you think that, why aren’t you shorting this   and trying to take advantage of that?”  And the answer almost as uniformly is, “We are going to,   but we are just afraid to get into it yet, while the Fed is still so sizable” So it is a very strange   situation from a market perspective, especially from those of us who think about the efficiency of   markets  Everyone is kind of waiting for this adjustment to take place and kind of waiting to   jump in to try to take advantage of it  There is just a sense that it is too early   My guess is that we are not talking about waiting until the end  There will be some   arbitrage that, if there is a flow effect, is going to bring it forward  It would be a wild guess, but   I would say that it wouldn’t be surprising to see something start to develop within the next two   months, as we get closer to that exit  I think when people assess their risks, we haven’t heard   anyone come and express the view that mortgages are cheap and that the spread is likely to go   down So that kind of leaves you with this one-sided opportunity that I think can’t persist for   that long   Another dimension, from the perspective of policymakers, is that, even   though some firms can substitute between getting dollar funding here through our facilities and   getting it abroad, by providing a dollar swap and allowing the foreign central bank to provide the   dollar liquidity, they rather than the Fed are bearing the credit risk of the facility        November 3–4, 2009 25 of 201  As I noted in my briefing, however, market participants are asking a lot of   these same questions about the strategy  I think right now the strategy is not well defined or well   laid out  So the questions they are asking are, “Will the reserve drains take place ahead of the   increase in the interest on reserves rate or concurrent with it?  Even if you are relying at least   partially on the interest on reserves mechanism to work, how, then, will the appropriate level of   reserves be decided?  So just how big will the drain be?”  There is obviously a lot of room   between where we are and where we were in the old regime, and I think they are not sure in   terms of reserves where the Committee intends to end up in that range   Well, we did reach out and take a poll of various players in the agency debt   market  It seems as though the expectations are generally between $175 billion and $200 billion,   maybe a touch higher than we had been thinking, so I think there is a modest surprise here  But   it is modest  I wouldn’t worry about it Could agency spreads back up a little?  Sure Will there   be a lot of talk about why and what this means?  Yes, absolutely   Right And we changed the language exactly to accomplish that, to convey   that this is consistent with what we have been doing already   1  Since the last FOMC meeting, financial conditions have generally   become more supportive of economic growth Yields have declined at short- and   intermediate-term maturities, and equity prices have posted a solid gain, while the   dollar has remained about unchanged on net     Some of the adjustment in financial markets appears to have been driven by   increased confidence among investors that short-term interest rates will remain low    The repetition of the “extended period” language in the November FOMC statement,   along with the additional clarity provided by including explicit conditioning factors,   seemed to solidify investors’ expectations that policy would remain on hold    Subsequent speeches by FOMC members, including comments that US asset prices   do not look obviously out of line with fundamentals, were seen as providing further   support to that view In response, the expected path of monetary policy derived from    futures quotes shifted down as much as 35 basis points over the intermeeting period,   as shown in the upper left panel                          December 15–16, 2009 5 of 247  The Bluebook noted that these futures rates overstate what investors see as the  most likely path for short-term interest rates, because they are influenced by the  distribution of risks around that outcome  This point can be made by looking at  options prices to derive the perceived probabilities of different outcomes for the  short-term interest rate, as shown in the distribution to the right  According to that  exercise, the most likely outcome for the three-month LIBOR rate about ten months  from now is that it will remain in the 25 to 50 basis point range  However, given the  proximity of that outcome to the zero bound, the risk is skewed almost completely in  the direction of higher rates, pulling the mean of the distribution well above the mode   As a result, the futures price, which corresponds to the mean, is about 50 basis points  above what is seen as the most likely outcome   With this consideration, there does not appear to be much discrepancy left  between market-based measures of policy expectations and survey responses, if the  latter captures the modal outcome seen by respondents  Our primary dealer survey  indicates that the median respondent expects the first tightening to occur in the fourth  quarter of 2010, with a range of views that spanned from the second quarter of 2010  to early 2012   We also used the survey to query dealers about their interpretation of the  “extended period” language used in the FOMC statement  By far, the most common  response was that the “extended period” language would be removed three meetings  before an actual rate hike We are happy to use future versions of the survey to  quantify any timing of policy tightening that you want—such as “some time,” “a  while,” “before long,” or, maybe to accommodate some Committee members,  “immediately” [Laughter]   The lower expected path of monetary policy contributed to a decline in shorter- term Treasury yields  This adjustment occurred even though the incoming economic  data were generally stronger than anticipated  As shown in the middle left panel, the  two-year yield fell about 10 basis points, on net, while the 10-year yield posted a  small increase  At one point over the intermeeting period, the 2-year yield had dipped  to 65 basis points—essentially equaling the lowest level on record, as shown in the  middle right panel—although it has more recently retraced back above 80 basis  points The 10-year yield, at just over 35 percent, is also low by historical standards,  though it is still well above the levels reached at the end of last year     Yields remain at these low levels despite the fact that inflation concerns seem to  be lingering Some market participants continue to discuss whether the  accommodative monetary policy stance and expansionary fiscal policy will  eventually lead to upward inflation pressure  Consistent with those concerns, the  5-year, 5-year forward break-even inflation rate remains near the upper end of the  range observed in recent years, as shown in the bottom left panel                          December 15–16, 2009 6 of 247  While we recognize that technical factors can affect break-even rates, it seems  that perceptions of inflation risk have at least contributed to their recent patterns   Several observations support that view First, flows into mutual funds that invest in  inflation-linked products have increased notably over the course of 2009, indicating  elevated demand for inflation protection among retail investors  Second, investors in  the swaption market are paying an increasingly large premium for protection against a  rise in longer-term interest rates, which could in part reflect concerns about inflation  expectations moving higher  However, some of the other patterns associated with  inflation jitters, such as rising gold prices and a falling dollar, have reversed course in  recent weeks  We will be watching closely to see if that reversal is a temporary head  fake or a more persistent shift in trend    Looking across global sovereign debt markets, we find that another factor that has  recently come into play is the perceived risk of default  Given the fiscal challenges  facing a wide range of countries, investors have been reevaluating their views on  sovereign default risk One measure of this risk, albeit an imperfect one because of  the limited size of the market, is the pricing of CDS on sovereign debt  As shown to  the right, there has been considerable upward pressure on the yields of Greek debt as  markets have grown concerned about the prospect of default  Similar concerns have  been expressed about Spain and Ireland, and the fiscal situations in the US and the  UK have also been discussed in this context  However, to date there appears to have  been little upward pressure on US yields from this factor   Overall, any upward pressure on Treasury yields arising from investors’ concerns  about longer-term inflation risks or the fiscal outlook is being dominated by the  downward pressure arising from the prospect of low short-term interest rates for an  extended period, leaving Treasury yields quite low   Turning to the next exhibit, better economic news and the prospect of  accommodative short-term interest rates contributed to a further advance in the prices  of some risky assets  Most notably, broad equity indexes posted another sizable gain  since the last FOMC meeting, with the S&P 500 index up more than 5 percent on net   One of the issues that I have addressed in recent briefings is whether risky asset  prices have risen too far To help make this judgment, we can look to valuation  models, such as the Board’s measure of the equity premium  This premium, shown to  the right, still appears wide by historical standards, suggesting that the run-up in  equity prices since earlier this year has not pushed them too high relative to  fundamentals  Similarly, an analysis of corporate bond spreads suggests that their  risk premiums are also not unusually narrow   Another approach to address this issue is to look across asset classes in order to  see if all risky assets are rising, as such a pattern could imply an indiscriminate  increase in risk tolerance on the part of investors  Correlations in the movements  across various asset classes, reported in the middle left panel, have been unusually  high over the past six months, compared with their levels a few years ago, with                              December 15–16, 2009 7 of 247  increasing equity prices strongly associated with rising emerging market equity  prices, rising commodity prices, and declining corporate yield spreads  To be sure,  this pattern could result from a variety of factors, such as the considerable change in  the economic outlook and the easing in financing strains  However, some might take  this pattern as indicative of a large shift in risk preferences that, if carried too far,  could be associated with speculative excesses   The current intermeeting period provides some relief from this pattern, though   Even though equity prices charged ahead, they did not pull all risky asset prices with  them  Indeed, corporate bond spreads, shown to the right, appear to have leveled out  to a considerable degree Moreover, yield spreads on commercial mortgage-backed  securities, the bottom left panel, have widened since the summer, and ABS spreads  across most other asset classes have also edged higher recently  Thus, the  performance of risky assets has been mixed  In addition, even though the events  associated with the debt standstill by Dubai World were not a primary driver of these  price movements, they provided a reminder to investors of the need to assess credit  risk and differentiate across borrowers   Banks, in particular, continue to be wary of taking additional credit risk onto their  balance sheets They have continued to tighten the terms on many types of lending,  and the volume of bank loans has continued to contract  These patterns contrast  sharply with the narrowing of credit spreads in capital markets since earlier this year  and the robust issuance of corporate bonds that has taken place in recent months   Bank equity prices, shown in the bottom right panel, were mixed over the  intermeeting period  The recent focus of the market has been on the efforts by Bank  of America, Citigroup, and Wells Fargo to repay TARP funds, as investors weigh the  advantages of escaping TARP against the dilutive effects of the capital increases  required to do so   The next exhibit addresses the Fed’s large-scale asset-purchase programs  The  Desk has been tapering its purchases of MBS and agency debt, as shown in the top  two panels But despite the slower pace, our purchases continue to put pressure on  these markets  The available supply of MBS in the market has been limited, as  seasoned bonds seem to be largely locked up in portfolios and new originations have  been relatively light   Given these market dynamics, our purchases have produced a further richening of  MBS and agency debt relative to Treasury securities, as can be seen in the yield  spreads shown in the middle panels  Indeed, the concern among market participants  that these spreads would widen as the Fed pulled back from its purchase programs has  not yet materialized  Market participants continue to raise this concern, however,  with many expressing a view that the MBS spread to Treasuries could quickly rise by  25 to 50 basis points from its current level  Accordingly, we will continue to watch  for such developments as our purchases decline further                    December 15–16, 2009 8 of 247  Of course, winding down our purchases of assets is just one dimension of  managing our balance sheet  The evolution of financial market conditions will  depend on all decisions influencing the size and composition of the balance sheet  going forward   In that regard, the Committee faces a key policy issue, namely, setting the  appropriate strategy for either redeeming or reinvesting maturing SOMA holdings   Like asset sales, redemptions of SOMA assets allow policymakers to shrink the  balance sheet, simultaneously reducing excess reserves and reversing some of the  portfolio-balance effects that resulted from the LSAP programs  This outcome may  be seen as desirable, depending on the evolution of economic and financial  conditions   The figure in the bottom left panel shows the profile of remaining maturities for  our holdings of Treasury and agency securities as well as the pattern of principal  payments that we anticipate on our holdings of MBS  The MBS profile is based on a  prepayment model that incorporates a market-based forecast of interest rates, and it  should be noted that there is a considerable amount of uncertainty surrounding those  estimates  Those MBS payments would come on top of the nearly $50 billion of  prepayments that we have already experienced to date, and which we have not  reinvested   The table in the bottom right panel shows the path of the size of the Fed’s balance  sheet under several possible redemption strategies  The first row assumes full  reinvestment of all SOMA securities, which would require the LSAPs to be expanded  to replace the MBS prepayments and agency debt maturities already received  This  strategy would leave the size of the portfolio steady at $22 trillion through 2011   The second row assumes that the Desk redeems all agency securities that mature and  all MBS that are prepaid, while following its usual practice of reinvesting Treasury  holdings This strategy allows the balance sheet to shrink gradually, providing about  $350 billion of redemptions (relative to the full reinvestment strategy) by the end of  2011 The third row shows the effects of redeeming all SOMA holdings, including  Treasury securities This strategy reduces the balance sheet by over $500 billion by  the end of 2011 Of course, other strategies could also be used under which only a  portion of the Treasury portfolio would be reinvested   At this point, the Desk only seeks to verify the Committee’s preference to allow  MBS and agency debt to run off the balance sheet without replacement  As noted,  this is the approach that has been taken to date with the prepayment of MBS, and it is  the approach that was taken with the agency debt security that matured on December  10, the first security purchased under the LSAP programs to mature  Going forward,  the flow of maturing agency securities and prepaid MBS will become more  substantial, adding to the importance of deciding upon the redemption strategy   Reaching a decision for handling Treasury securities is less pressing, as the Desk  has a long-standing practice of routinely reinvesting existing Treasury holdings and                              December 15–16, 2009 9 of 247  can continue to do so for now However, policymakers may want to revisit the  redemption strategy for Treasury securities before long, as it gives them more scope  to achieve different balance sheet outcomes   Your final exhibit covers the behavior of short-term interest rates and discusses  the market’s views on some of the Fed’s exit tools  As shown in the upper left panel,  the Fed’s balance sheet expanded modestly since the last FOMC meeting, reflecting  further increases in our asset holdings accumulated under the LSAP programs  The  balance sheet currently stands at $22 trillion, with $18 trillion of that corresponding  to our holdings of Treasury, agency, and mortgage-backed securities   Partly as a result of the growth of the balance sheet, the amount of excess reserves  in the banking system has also increased and currently stands at about $11 trillion, as  shown to the right With that large amount of liquidity in the system, the federal  funds rate has remained persistently below the interest rate paid on excess reserves, or  the IOER rate   It is useful to look at this relationship between excess reserves and the federal  funds rate as a scatter plot, shown in the middle left panel for the period since last  December  As can be seen, there has been a downward slope to the relationship,  although it is very small in magnitude  When excess reserve balances were around  $600 billion, the spread between the federal funds rate and the IOER rate tended to be  limited  As reserves have increased towards and now beyond $1 trillion, the spread  has grown to a typical level of 10 to 15 basis points  Of course, a key area of  uncertainty that policymakers face is the extent to which this relationship will shift as  the IOER rate increases   Given the large amounts of reserves and the behavior of short-term interest rates,  market participants are increasingly asking for more information about the FOMC’s  exit strategy They are particularly focused on the likelihood, sequencing, and size of  various policy actions, such as draining reserves, increasing the IOER rate, and  selling assets We asked a number of questions in our dealer survey to gauge their  own views on these issues   The survey results indicate that about three-quarters of the respondents expected  the Fed to use temporary reserve-draining tools, either reverse repos or term deposits,  before any increases in the policy rate The remainder expected reserve draining and  policy rate increases to begin at the same time, and no respondents expected the  policy rate to be raised before any draining operations took place  Based on the  median of all responses, the initial use of reverse repos and term deposits was  expected to take place in the third quarter of 2010, while the first policy tightening  was expected to take place in the fourth quarter, as noted earlier in the briefing   Some additional information on the expected path of these tools is presented in  the lower left panel As can be seen, reverse repos and term deposits are both  expected to ramp up through the second quarter of 2011 and to edge up further into                         December 15–16, 2009 10 of 247  2012 By the middle of 2012, the respondents expected about $300 billion of   outstanding reverse repurchase agreements and $200 billion of term deposits  About   half of the respondents also expected asset sales to be used, bringing the average   expected path of sales above zero However, as can be seen, asset sales were   expected to be increased more slowly  Lastly, about half of the respondents also   expected SFP balances to be raised from their current level and hence to remove   reserves     Based on the use of all of these tools, respondents on average expected the FOMC   to drain several hundred billion dollars of reserves before the first policy tightening,   leaving the amount of excess reserves at that time below $1 trillion  However, as   shown by the distribution in the bottom right panel, there is a fairly wide range of   views on that outcome  Respondents also expected the FOMC to continue draining   reserves even after an increase in the policy rate, but their responses suggest that a   decent amount of excess reserves would still be left in the system through at least   2012    Let me close with a brief note about year-end effects, which are not covered in   your charts We continue to monitor year-end pressures and the potential   consequences for markets  As I discussed in my last briefing, we are not seeing any   upward pressure on unsecured lending across year-end, the traditional year-end effect   in markets, presumably as a result of the substantial amount of liquidity in the   markets  Instead, year-end pressures seem to be most evident in strong demand for   risk-free assets spanning year-end, which has put significant downward pressure on   short-term Treasury yields  For example, the implied forward rate from Treasury   bills for the week spanning year-end has been consistently negative for several   months, and last week’s auction of the four-week bills stopped out at a rate of   precisely 0 However, the downward pressure on rates does not appear to be   intensifying or causing significant market disruption, and thus does not clearly   necessitate a policy response    One development that could alleviate some of the market pressure is issuance of  SFP bills ahead of year-end  If the debt ceiling is increased soon by a sizable amount,  the Treasury will likely auction SFP bills in the last week of the year  Those auctions  would be part of a broader plan to return SFP balances to $200 billion  However,  given the politics surrounding the debt limit decision, this outcome is, at best,  uncertain at this point Thank you  That concludes my prepared comments   Yes, I think we’ll have enough information  There will certainly be details   about the tools that we’re still working out, but I think we’ll have some information on their   scope For reverse repos, in particular, we essentially already have the capacity to do the amount   of reserve draining that was indicated in the survey  So I wouldn’t argue for putting off that   more strategic debate in order to hammer out every last detail of the tools  I think it’s probably   time to move forward with that   I would just like to make sure that everyone is on board with running down   the agency and MBS holdings, or at least doing that as an interim strategy  In terms of a strategy   for the entire portfolio or a strategy to be used beyond the near term, I think that, yes, we should   come back and have a full discussion and one that probably to some degree folds in the issue of   asset sales, because obviously redemptions accomplish many of the things that asset sales   accomplish   One way to think about the redemption strategy is that it is in some sense a commitment   strategy to convince the markets that you are not going to shed your portfolio too quickly  So   one question I think we should consider is  If there are other ways to make that commitment,   then do asset sales give us more flexibility? Obviously what is somewhat odd about redemptions   is the flip side of that, which is that this decision about how quickly to shrink the portfolio is   governed by other factors that are uncertain and that could change and so on  So I would like to   give it full consideration, along with the discussion of whether there is any strategy through   which we could sell assets safely in some regard                December 15–16, 2009 13 of 247  Absolutely   That’s correct, though I think one shortcoming of the survey as we designed   it is that we didn’t actually ask about redemptions, so I think we will do that in the future  But   this question was phrased to be explicitly about sales  A few dealers volunteered views on   redemptions under the category of “other,” but I think in the future we’ll be more careful about   trying to get their views on their expectations about the redemption strategy   I would strongly guess that the consensus expectation is that the agency and   MBS will be run off and the Treasuries will be reinvested, but I’ll have more confidence in that   if we measure it in the next survey   It’s the federal funds rate  I think it’s likely that market participants see   those two, the federal funds rate target and the IOER rate, moving in tandem  But again, we   didn’t explicitly get that from the survey—the survey asks about timing of policy tightening in   terms of an increase in the federal funds rate target   They did not But again, I think we could incorporate that in future surveys    I also think that, if we’re very interested in gauging the market’s views on all of these issues—   obviously there may be a few survey issues to clean up—we also might want to consider doing a   broader survey This is a survey of the 18 primary dealers  It’s answered mainly by the   economists at those primary dealers  We’re not convinced that they have the same views as the   traders or as a broader set of financial firms  So if there is a lot of interest in gauging these   expectations, I think we could make a more extensive effort for the next meeting   As you know, the November TALF subscription included the first new-  issue CMBS deal, the DDR deal  That seemed to have some positive effect on the market, even   though we ended up taking only a small amount of risk, I think, on the portfolio—the amount of   the loan was only $72 million  The deal was very well received and seemed to initiate some   activity in the market  Since then we’ve seen two other new single-borrower issues come to   market   No, not through TALF, outside of TALF  And we hear reports of a handful   of other issues also being prepared to come to market  Of course, this is still a trickle of issuance   compared with where we were several years ago, so I think the market is still extremely   impaired, but showing some signs of life   I think TALF has been a very important factor in bringing this activity back   and will continue to be for as long as it’s in place  But, at the same time, I think there has been a   surprise at how strong the demand has been for the issues  So maybe that’s the most   encouraging sign—not only did TALF get a deal done, but it brought some activity back to the   market even independent of TALF  We see that as a very positive sign   Let me add a few more things  We have begun to ask market participants   about their expectations for the market, to try to assess how dependent it is on TALF  We’ve   asked a very small set of market participants, so take all of these responses with a grain of salt    The general view was that CMBS spreads would widen once the TALF expired, and, indeed, in   secondary market trading we do see some difference between similar deals that are TALF-  eligible and not TALF-eligible So it does appear, based on that evidence, that the TALF is   having an effect on keeping spreads narrower than otherwise   It’s very hard to gauge  We know the survey is filled out by a lot of   economists, but they sit on trading desks and talk to traders  So it’s somewhat mixed, I would   say, in terms of what you are actually getting   My impression is that it’s consistent  At the New York Fed, we also   interact with a separate group of advisers, who are from the buy side, and we’ve been              December 15–16, 2009 17 of 247  experimenting with running a similar survey out to that group where we clearly would be   reaching investment managers  As we move into 2010, we hope to bring that product on line as   a MarketSOURCE piece for exactly this purpose, that is, to broaden our reach in these surveys  I   think the surveys are proving very valuable in being able to address key policy issues, so I think   we want to maximize their effectiveness   Yes, you certainly could Even, say, within a certain asset class, like   Treasuries, you have options such as those that came up earlier, like redeeming longer-term   securities and reinvesting shorter-term ones, or even reinvesting longer-term ones into shorter-  term securities  There are some limits on doing that at auction, but you could always do that in   the secondary market as well  The same is true for MBS  There’s nothing in theory that   prevents us from selling MBS and purchasing Treasuries or trying to reallocate across asset   classes I think there would be obvious challenges to doing any of that in terms of           December 15–16, 2009 18 of 247  communicating to the markets what you’re doing, and we’d have to be very careful in that   communication, but it could be done   I’ll also say that there’s a lot of concern in the markets about sales of MBS  We’ve   bought a lot, and we’ve been the dominant player in the market  The market is concerned about   adjusting to our not being there as a steady purchaser, and I think the idea of our being there as a   net seller of MBS is a concern to some  So while all of these strategies are possible, I think we’d   have to be very careful about what we were trying to achieve and make sure the market   understood it   Again, we didn’t get into that level of detail  I think the presumption would   be that they understand that interest on excess reserves is a tool that can raise all short-term   interest rates even with a large amount of reserves in the system  In this response, they’re   implicitly saying that that mechanism will work, or at least that policymakers think it will work   with a relatively high degree of reserves, or at least that policymakers will begin to tighten and   see if it works   Right I think that’s the general perception, although as I noted in the text,   there’s a lot of uncertainty If you look at panel 27, we know that with all of these excess     December 15–16, 2009 19 of 247  reserves, the funds rate has been soft to the IOER rate  I think a real key policy question is  Is   that spread steady?  If that spread is steady—10 to 15 basis points—then it seems that   policymakers have very effective control of short-term interest rates even with the amount of   reserves indicated in the lower right panel  There’s just no way to measure empirically whether   that spread will be steady because we’ve only had this period of high reserves when we’ve been   pinned up against the zero bound So that is, I think, a key policy question   I think your question raises a general issue about the fact that we’re doing a   survey with the firms we have been interacting with the most in terms of setting up the reverse   repo program There was some concern on our end about whether that was biasing the results in   this direction  So, I think that argues for the wider survey   Having said all of that, when we speak to market participants outside of the primary   dealers, there’s just an incredible amount of focus on reverse repos, and I am not sure why that   is, relative to term deposits  So I think, broadly speaking, market participants really do expect   reverse repurchase agreements to be a key part of the policy tools  Of course, in this response   both reverse repos and term deposits are being used very actively  Reverse repos are a little bit   higher, but they’re both very active draining tools  It may be that asking the dealers puts a little   bit more focus on reverse repos, but I’m not sure  I wouldn’t want to say that this probably does   not represent the broader review I think that, if we could make an effort to find that out through   a broader set of participants, then I wouldn’t be surprised if it comes out similarly        December 15–16, 2009 20 of 247  First, let me respond to your point on communications about reverse repos   versus other tools, such as asset sales or the term deposit facility  I think in part that has been a   result of the timing  The reverse repo tool for the Treasury and agency collateral, at least, has   progressed more quickly, and we wanted to go ahead and test it  So you do have a situation   where we’ve had more communications about that  I think we’ll see—and Jim Clouse will talk   about this—more communication on the term deposit facility going forward, and so some catch­  up in that regard   On the SFP, I thought the survey results were interesting  Roughly speaking, half of the   respondents thought it would just stay at $15 billion, and the other half thought it would be   ramped back up to $200 billion  Our thinking was that, with an adequate increase in the debt   limit, which as of yesterday we thought we were probably going to get, SFP would run back up   to $200 billion over a relatively quick time frame—four to six weeks—and to a point where we   had a nice, evenly spaced maturity distribution that would then just roll over and keep that size    More recently, it looks like the debt limit may be raised by a much more limited amount, only   enough to provide room for several months, in which case it would be very hard to run up the   SFP because it would immediately have to be run back down  But I think that, absent that   constraint, our inclination is to have Treasury run the SFP back up, and that obviously would   keep it as a policy tool that could be used if needed at some point in the future  There’s no   reason $200 billion is the right number, but I think that decision would have to be made in              December 15–16, 2009 22 of 247  conjunction with our assessment of the effectiveness of the other tools in terms of getting   reserves out   That sounds right  I actually took this chart from some work being done by   Jamie McAndrews and other staff at the New York Fed  And I know there is similar work going   on at the Board and probably a number of other places  That work tried to fit a demand schedule   through here, and it’s a nonlinear demand schedule  As you suggest, it has more elasticity at   lower levels of reserves and then flattens out That work has a lot of other interesting results,   including looking at whether GSE balances have a special effect relative to the overall level of   reserves  So I would expect, hopefully, that some of that work will be presented in whatever   material is prepared for the next meeting   I think one thing it clearly does is pull reserves out of the market—less   reserves available for overnight lending means you’ll bring short-term interest rates up  That’s   exactly what’s shown in exhibit 27, that is, the idea that those tools could be used to get to a   lower level of reserve balances and bring these other short-term interest rates up closer to and   maybe more connected to the IOER rate  I think that’s the main effect   One question we wrestled with, especially with reverses, is whether there’s an   independent effect, a direct effect, on RP rates  If we drain $300 billion of reserves by dumping   a bunch of collateral into the RP market, do we not only get the effect in exhibit 27, but do we   also get further upward pressure on the RP rate from that collateral?  I think we see that as a   possibility—that is, you could actually get some further upward pressure on RP rates relative to   overnight rates I think that would tend to be transitory, but certainly if that collateral were   dumped quickly that could happen  But generally speaking, and over longer periods of time, we   think the main effect comes via affecting the amount of liquidity available in the overnight   lending market, in which case draining enough liquidity tends to pull rates up towards the IOER   rate   Well, I think at some point, if the size is large enough, then, yes, you could   pull short-term interest rates above the IOER rate  I’m making an assumption that the size of   these programs will be calibrated to some objective, whether that objective is getting the other              December 15–16, 2009 26 of 247  rates around the IOER rate or not  So the size will be endogenous to the framework that the   FOMC lays out   That’s right There’s going to be analysis and judgment, but, of course, in   the old days when we did temporary operations every day, there was always assessment and   judgment about how much operations were needed   Yes, exactly   That’s right   They’re sticking to their story   That’s right Our purchases have declined, but conditions in the market   have been very tight It’s not just that the assets didn’t cheapen, but they have actually richened   in terms of the spread narrowing further  So we haven’t seen any signs of what we and the   markets worried about as we backed away from this   Now, there are a lot of things going on in markets  There’s not a lot of supply coming   into the market  We are approaching year-end, and so on  So we’ll wait and see But so far,   there are no signs that there is any increase in rates from our pulling back   Yes In my view, a big chunk of the question about asset sales is  Can we   do them in a way that doesn’t cause a sharp backup in rates, whether that’s a pre-commitment to   a gradual sales pace, or whether it’s building in some kind of state responsiveness to interest   rates, or whether it’s other approaches?  The staff is trying to think about these issues—that is,   what mechanisms could we use to sell assets safely?  It may be that there is no way to do it   convincingly, and the only way to shed assets is to do it through redemptions, and that would be   fine But I think we at least want to think through all of the options and assess whether there is   some approach where we could basically get the effects—the same kind of gradual winding   down in the portfolio you would get under redemptions—but that would give us more flexibility   along the way   Okay What I meant, but you can correct me, was not producing a large   backup in rates I guess I was working under the assumption that an abrupt and sizable increase   in long-term interest rates would be viewed as counterproductive at this point   The data suggest we’ve pushed them low  We do think the LSAPs have   worked, and it is just an optimal policy decision about how quickly you want to unwind any of   those effects We can put this differently  A challenge with asset sales perhaps is that there will   be a tendency for the markets to front-load all of the effects  When we did LSAPs, you saw an   immediate and sizable market reaction; then a lot of the program was carrying through the   commitment to justify that reaction  I think policymakers need to be concerned about those same   patterns taking place in reverse So that’s the issue  Is there a way to unwind the portfolio   slowly to limit that immediate reaction?   Okay   Correct I think that strategy is consistent with the current directive, so I   don’t believe any action is necessary     Yes  Thank you, Mr Chairman  The Committee reviews the Authorization   for Domestic Open Market Operations at its first meeting each year  I propose a few   amendments to the domestic authorization for the Committee to consider  These changes were   described in the memo that I sent to the Committee on the subject ahead of the meeting  Let me   highlight two major changes   First, I am proposing that the Committee expand the securities eligible for the repo pool   offered to foreign, international, and fiscal agency account holders to include securities that are   direct obligations of, or fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by, any agency of the United   States  This change would, in effect, expand the range of SOMA assets to be used in these   transactions to agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities, as opposed to the current   authorization’s restriction to only Treasury securities  This wider set of securities corresponds to   those that are eligible for outright purchases or sales by the Desk  This change would allow the   Desk to optimally allocate the SOMA’s asset holdings across different tools and facilities going   forward  In particular, it would provide the Desk with additional collateral to offer as a repo   facility to our customers, allowing Treasury collateral to be used as needed in other facilities or   transactions   Second, I am proposing a change to the language in section 4B so that it is more   consistent with other sections of the authorization  These changes include clarifying the term   January 26–27, 2010 6 of 260    “agency securities” to explicitly refer to both agency debt and agency MBS securities  Note,   however, that operations under section 4B are not currently in use     In addition to these items, I would like to update the Committee on four issues related to   the authorization  These items do not require changes to the domestic authorization  First, I   recommend that the Committee keep suspended the guidelines for the conduct of System   operations in federal agency issues, because the agency and agency MBS purchase programs are   still under way  Second, in the policy directive to be discussed at the end of the meeting, I   propose that the Committee authorize the continued use of dollar roll transactions to aid in the   settlement of the Federal Reserve’s agency MBS purchases that will be conducted through   March  As I will explain in my financial market briefing, there have been considerable   settlement failures in the MBS market in recent months  The ability to conduct dollar roll   transactions allows the Fed to defer settlement, if necessary, in order to facilitate the smooth   process for achieving delivery of our purchased securities  I anticipate that the use of this tool   would continue to be relatively limited in nature, between an estimated $10 billion and   $30 billion in activity per month, with the final dollar roll in this context likely to be executed no   later than August     Third, the current authorization allows the Desk to transact in agency MBS for the   SOMA through agents We are working to bring agency MBS administration, trading,   settlement, and risk analysis in house, but this process is likely to be lengthy, and I am thus   asking that this authority be retained through 2010  Lastly, in November the Committee   authorized the Desk to conduct small-scale reverse repo operations as needed to ensure the   operational readiness of this tool across a broad range of collateral types and counterparties  We   successfully conducted a series of operations in December, which increased the Desk’s   January 26–27, 2010 7 of 260    confidence that tri-party reverse repos could be quickly implemented  However, these operations   did not employ agency MBS collateral and did not involve an expanded counterparty list  Thus   we anticipate a need to conduct at least two additional programs of small-scale operations in the   first half of 2010 to further improve our operational readiness  These operations are covered   under the current resolution  We need a vote to approve these changes     That’s correct   January 26–27, 2010 8 of 260     On the foreign side, the Desk operates under the following Committee   guidelines  the authorization of foreign currency operations, the foreign currency directive, and   the procedural instructions with respect to foreign currency operations  I recommend that all   three be renewed without amendment  In doing so, I am proposing that the list of currencies in   the authorization remain unchanged this year, under the view that it reflects the current foreign   exchange market structure  We need a vote to reaffirm these instruments  The vote to reaffirm   these documents will include approval of the System’s warehousing agreement with the   Treasury  1  Thank you  A variety of factors affected financial markets over the   intermeeting period but did not provide them with a consistent direction  Incoming   economic data were generally seen as mixed, leaving market participants with a   roughly unchanged forecast of economic growth going forward  Even in that   environment, the prices of risky assets had been performing well over most of the   intermeeting period  However, over the past two weeks, market participants had to   digest several proposals for financial sector reform that created concern about the   outlook for that sector and for the economy more broadly  In response, major US   equity indexes declined sharply, bringing them to a modest net loss since the last   FOMC meeting, as shown in the top left panel  Measures of implied volatility on   equity prices, shown in the top right panel, increased markedly last week, largely   reflecting the uncertainty associated with the reform initiatives            Corporate bonds, in contrast, rallied on net over the intermeeting period, as shown   by the yield spreads in the middle left panel  It had appeared that the spreads were   leveling out in the latter parts of 2009, but their tightening trend has strongly   reemerged  The sizable narrowing of corporate spreads since early 2009 has been   driven in large part by fundamental factors, including the shift in the economic   outlook, the diminution of downside economic risks, and the improving access of   corporations to capital markets  However, those fundamental factors explain only a   portion of the movement, as a reduction of the risk premium has also played an   important role  One measure of the risk premium for the high-yield index is shown in   the middle right panel  As can be seen, it has come in sharply, but much of this   movement was simply retracing the sharp increase in 2008  By this measure at least,   the current risk premium does not appear unusually narrow by historical standards   Issuance of corporate bonds has been quite strong, as firms continued to take   advantage of the favorable financing conditions  However, other parts of credit   markets remain much more restrictive, including parts of the securitized credit   markets and bank lending  Spreads for commercial mortgage-backed securities   (CMBS) have narrowed some of late, as shown in the bottom left panel, reportedly   because investors are increasingly looking to these products to pick up yield    However, we have seen only a trickle of new issuance in this sector, and we do not   know of any major deals that are likely to be brought to the market by the scheduled   expiration date of the TALF in June   Another area of the credit markets that remains tight is bank lending  Banks   continue to be wary of taking additional credit risk onto their balance sheets, though   we may be slowly reaching a turning point in that regard  The most recent survey of   bank lending practices indicated that commercial banks generally ceased tightening   standards on most types of loans  However, this comes after an unprecedented   tightening of conditions, and any substantial improvement in lending conditions is   likely to be slow, given the challenges still facing those firms  As shown in the   bottom right panel, share prices for regional banks fared well over the intermeeting   period, based in part on the view that the rate of deterioration of outstanding loans                                                     1 The materials used by Mr Sack are appended to this transcript (appendix 1)   January 26–27, 2010 10 of 260    may be slowing  However, share prices for larger banks fell back, especially after the   recent reform proposals that would affect those firms                  As shown in your next exhibit, monetary policy expectations implied by federal   funds and Eurodollar futures rates shifted down over the intermeeting period  This   change reflected the mixed economic data as well as FOMC communications that   were read as suggesting that the Fed’s accommodative policy stance will remain in   place for longer than anticipated  Nevertheless, the overall pattern of expectations   remains the same—the market expects the Fed to begin raising the federal funds rate   late this year and to take it to around 2 percent by the end of 2011  With the decline   in policy expectations, the two-year Treasury yield fell modestly, on net, over the   intermeeting period, as shown to the right  Longer-term yields ended the period   about unchanged   Many bond market participants have been discussing the possibility that longer-  term yields could move up notably  They cite the risk factors that we have been   discussing in recent months—namely, the heavy financing burden associated with   large fiscal deficits and the challenges facing the Fed in terms of its expanded balance   sheet and the political environment  Given those perceived risks, investors have paid   an increasingly large premium for protection against a sizable increase in longer-term   interest rates, as can be seen from the payer skew on swaptions, shown in the middle   left panel   Because many of the risks cited focus on longer-term inflation, it may be   important to closely track break-even inflation rates relative to historical ranges    Forward break-even inflation rates from 5 to 10 years ahead have moved higher under   both of the measures shown in the middle right panel  The Board measure, for   example, had moved above 3¼ percent at one point over the intermeeting period   before recently pulling back closer to 3 percent  The table in the bottom left panel   compares the most recent readings of those two measures with the range observed   over a period before the financial crisis, from 2002 to 2007  Even with the recent   pullback, the current reading of the Board measure is above 89 percent of the   observations in the historical period  The Barclays measure tells a more dramatic   story, as the recent movements have pushed it to the upper end of its historical range   As always, we want to be careful interpreting movements in break-even inflation   rates  For example, it is possible that the divergence in the supply of nominal   Treasuries and TIPS, shown to the right, is lifting break-even rates  One observation   consistent with that view is that the nominal forward rate is well inside its historical   range over the period considered in the table  Nevertheless, given the focus that the   FOMC has placed on inflation expectations, the evolution of break-even inflation   rates going forward certainly bears watching   The next exhibit addresses the Fed’s large-scale asset-purchase (LSAP) programs    The Desk continues to taper its purchases of MBS and agency debt, as shown in the   top two panels  MBS purchases are right on track to meet the $125 trillion target, but   January 26–27, 2010 11 of 260    the agency debt purchases have fallen behind their intended schedule because the   volume of dealer offers at our operations has been relatively weak  Unless we move   above our initial plan in order to make up ground, we could end up purchasing only   $170 billion or so, which we view as being sufficient to meet the objective of “about   $175 billion”               Despite the slower pace of purchases, the spreads on agency debt and MBS   remain tight, as indicated in the middle panels  An informal survey of market   participants indicated that the vast majority continue to expect some widening of the   MBS spread, on the order of 15 to 25 basis points, as our purchases come to a close    However, to date the evidence is consistent with the view that the effects on longer-  term rates have been more strongly associated with the stock of our holdings rather   than the flow of purchases  In that case, any effects that the purchases have had on   longer-term rates should only slowly unwind as the SOMA portfolio shrinks over   time   The bottom left panel shows that the MBS market has been suffering from an   unusually large volume of settlement fails in recent months  Recall that this market   generally trades on a forward basis, in what is called the TBA market, where trades   settle anywhere from one to three months ahead  Market participants who have sold   securities in the TBA market have frequently been failing to deliver the securities on   the scheduled settlement dates  In part, this pattern reflects that our holdings have   reduced the floating supply of current-coupon TBA securities, making it more   difficult for sellers to find securities to deliver  However, a more important factor has   been the proximity of short-term interest rates to the zero bound, which significantly   reduces the cost of failing   I raise this issue because it has had implications for our purchase program  For   these same reasons, market participants could fail to make delivery of the securities   they have sold to us  Rather than accepting fails, we have been alleviating the   problem by selling dollar rolls  In a dollar roll, the seller provides its counterparty   with a security for an upcoming settlement date, under agreement that the   counterparty will deliver back a similar security at a subsequent settlement date,   typically one month later  By selling dollar rolls specifically to those who owe us   securities at an upcoming settlement date, we in effect allow our counterparties to   postpone settlement for one month in exchange for a small fee  We believe that it   will be advantageous to continue using dollar rolls in this manner in order to settle all   of the outstanding purchases under the LSAP program  This will provide the market   with time to obtain and deliver the needed securities to us in an orderly fashion  The   directive proposed in the Bluebook includes a sentence that is intended to explicitly   recognize that this activity will potentially continue for several months after the   scheduled completion of the MBS purchases in March   Your next exhibit focuses on the Fed’s balance sheet  The volume of activity in   our short-term lending facilities declined further over the intermeeting period, as   shown in the top left panel  This pattern, of course, reflects the fact that the facilities   January 26–27, 2010 12 of 260    involve above-market rates for most borrowers, but it also reflects to a degree our   efforts to encourage individual borrowers to develop alternative funding plans  On   February 1, all of the facilities shown will expire except for the term auction facility   (TAF) and the primary credit facility (the dark blue and the yellow areas in the   figure)  As indicated to the right, there is very little activity in the facilities that are   set to expire  The market is not showing any strains associated with the termination   of these programs  Indeed, as shown in the middle left panel, short-term funding   spreads have not moved up at all and remain quite tight                  With the ongoing decline in the liquidity facilities, the dominant component of the   balance sheet has become the outright holdings of SOMA assets, as indicated by the   dark blue area in the chart to the right  Those holdings currently stand at $19 trillion,   out of the total balance sheet of $23 trillion  These outright asset holdings present   the most challenging issues for exiting from the current stance of monetary policy, as   they do not automatically unwind in a timely manner  For that reason, market   participants have been increasingly discussing the Fed’s use of reserve-draining tools   and asset sales   To help gauge market expectations, we conducted an extensive survey that asked   respondents about how they expect the FOMC to exit from its current policy stance    We expanded the survey beyond the economists who are typically included in our   dealer survey, because many of you at the last meeting indicated that you don’t   actually trust economists  [Laughter]  This may be a good time to remind you that   most of you are economists   This survey included 17 sell-side economists, 5 sell-side interest rate strategists,   18 buy-side investors, and 13 bank funding desks  As indicated in the bottom left   panel, almost all of the respondents expected the Fed to use its temporary draining   tools such as reverse repurchase agreements and term deposits as well as the IOER   rate  More surprisingly, two-thirds of the respondents also expect asset sales to be   used across the three types of securities  However, there was a very important   distinction in the timing of these tools   In particular, survey respondents overwhelmingly expected reverse repos and   term deposits to be employed prior to the first increase in the federal funds target rate    As shown in the bottom right, the mean response expected those tools to come into   use about two meetings before an increase in the target rate  Only 23 percent of the   respondents expected the Fed to use the draining tools concurrently with the target   rate, and less than 5 percent of the respondents thought the Fed would hike the target   rate first and then drain reserves  Increases in the IOER rate were strongly seen as   occurring at the same time as an increase in the target funds rate  In contrast, asset   sales were overwhelmingly expected to occur after the first rate increase, if at all  As   can be seen to the right, the mean response put sales of agency debt and MBS about a   year after the first increase in the target funds rate   January 26–27, 2010 13 of 260    The top left panel of your last exhibit shows the expected size of the various tools   over time  Market participants expect reverse repurchase agreements and term   deposits to be ramped up over the period between the second quarter of this year and   the second quarter of 2011, to a level of about $250 billion for each  Asset sales are   expected to occur more slowly, consistent with the responses from the previous   exhibit, and to remain relatively small in size               We also asked about the speed at which the temporary draining tools could be   increased if necessary—specifically, what amount could be implemented over an   intermeeting period without causing significant market disruption  Respondents saw   a surprisingly high capacity for a quick ramp-up, including $200 billion each for   reverse repos and term deposits  The ability to increase capacity quickly may explain   why they on average saw these tools as being implemented only two meetings before   an increase in the target funds rate   Views about the redemption policy to be taken with SOMA assets are described   in the middle left panel  The vast majority of respondents expect the Fed either not to   reinvest or to reinvest only partially its holdings of agency debt and MBS  That is not   surprising, since the approach of redeeming those assets is already under way  More   surprising, participants saw redemptions of Treasury securities also as a distinct   possibility, with only 25 percent expecting full reinvestment   Respondents’ views about the path of temporary draining policies, asset sales and   redemptions, and other draining mechanisms determine how they expect the path of   reserves to evolve ahead of the first change in the target funds rate  The middle right   panel shows the distribution of responses for the expected level of reserves at the time   of the first target funds rate hike  As can be seen, there is a wide range of views  The   distribution is relatively uniform from $400 billion to $1 trillion, with a few outliers   instead expecting reserves to get down to very low levels   As shown in the bottom left panel, the use of reverse repos and term deposits was   seen as achieving a variety of purposes  A minority of respondents thought that   draining reserves with these tools would directly influence bank lending, for reasons   independent of the implications for the path of short-term interest rates, while more   than half thought it would help to contain inflation expectations  However, the most   definitive result was that the use of these tools was expected to improve the FOMC’s   control of short-term interest rates  That effect is quantified further in the bottom   right panel  We asked respondents to gauge the degree to which the effective federal   funds rate might fall below the IOER rate as the IOER rate is increased  To be sure,   respondents probably have considerable difficulty predicting these outcomes, much as   we do, but their estimates may still be informative  As can be seen, the expected gap   varies with the level of reserves anticipated  At the current level of excess reserves of   around $1 trillion, the interquartile range of market participants’ views spanned from   15 to 29 basis points for the IOER rate at 1 percent and went as high as 50 basis   points for the IOER rate at 2 percent  At the other end of the spectrum, respondents   expected the effective federal funds rate to remain very close to the IOER rate if the   January 26–27, 2010 14 of 260    level of excess reserves were to return to its historical range of $0 to $25 billion  In   between these outcomes, if roughly half of the reserves were drained, market   participants expected the effective federal funds rate to remain within 25 basis points   of the IOER rate         Overall, the survey responses, I hope, provide some useful backdrop for the   discussion of policy strategy that will take place after the briefings by Jim Clouse and   Spence Hilton  Thank you  That concludes my prepared remarks    I think we are hearing reports of those types of activities at least at the   fringe—issuance to make dividend payments and other structures that may be somewhat   questionable  I think we’re perhaps at the edge of worrying about some of that  Those instances   are pretty isolated; they’re certainly not widespread at this point  And in many ways we are not   back to the froth in the markets that we saw before  We don’t see that froth in terms of financing   abilities  Repo haircuts are still relatively high and differentiated across asset classes  We don’t   see it in the complexity of structures  We don’t see it in the intent of the issuance broadly  So   January 26–27, 2010 15 of 260    we are certainly not back to where we were, but I think we are starting to hear more and more   reports of those types of activities  Very much like other valuation measures, the valuation   measure I showed suggests that we have moved a long way back, but we are not to levels that   look overextended  But it is certainly putting us back into that historical range where I think we   need to pay more attention to valuations and then to worry about things like that  And these   anecdotes about activity suggest that is where we are as well, getting back to the fringe of a   range where we want to pay attention, but not at a level that is alarming today    I am certainly not suggesting that you need to choose a strategy that follows   the market’s expectations  As I said, I think that the market is increasingly looking for guidance   on what the strategy will be  So I do think it’s important to begin to formulate a strategy and   communicate it, but it certainly does not have to match market expectations, and you could shape   those expectations with your communications   January 26–27, 2010 16 of 260    I do think, though, for some questions that hearing the views of market participants may   be quite informative—to choose one example, gauging the possible gap between the funds rate   and the IOER rate  As we highlighted in the memo, there is no sample; there are no data from   which to empirically investigate that relationship  We have never been in an IOER regime with   this level of reserves where we have tried to increase the IOER rate  So there are no empirics we   can throw at the question, and we are left to conjecture what may happen  In that regard, it is   probably useful to talk to market participants who are very involved in funding markets and who   have their own views on balance sheet usage, arbitrage activity, and the types of things that will   affect that spread to hear what they think  So I do hope you can extract some information from   how markets may behave, in addition to just understanding what they expect we are going to do    Well, I am sorry to disappoint you  [Laughter]  I agree with the assessment    There is no doubt that early in the program, when markets were strained, our purchases helped to   January 26–27, 2010 17 of 260    restore market function and improve liquidity  Then at some point, that relationship switched   sides, and our purchases began to impair liquidity as we removed so much supply from the   market  And that’s continuing because the amount of issuance in the market has been so light    So even though our purchases are winding down, we continue to put a lot of pressure on the   market  I think in general the market is functioning okay  Trading volumes are decent  Other   measures of liquidity are okay  But we are seeing these fails, and certainly our presence is noted    I do think the market will function better as we back away from it, and I think that has been the   tradeoff  We have wanted to have sizable purchases for other purposes—because we thought   they helped to lower longer-term interest rates—and perhaps toward the end of the program that   has come at the cost of some modest impairment of market functioning  But we are on a course   of tapering these purchases, and they will soon be over  So I think probably from this point   forward the least disruptive path to the markets is just to continue what they expect and be out of   the markets by the end of March    I don’t see anything necessarily wrong with that  I think we should make   the dollar roll decision based on what we think is best for the market for settling the purchases   January 26–27, 2010 18 of 260    that are already scheduled through the end of March  What we are proposing is modest dollar   rolls just to give the markets a chance to smooth out settlement for several months  As I said in   my remarks, we won’t be conducting dollar rolls more than a few months after the end of the   purchases   I think the decision about whether to sell assets is different, and you could make that no   matter what we are doing with the dollar roll book  That decision depends much more on   whether you think the market can handle the Fed’s putting duration and prepayment risk back   into the market  The market is already going to have to adjust to find purchasers for the amount   of issuance to replace the Fed as we back away, and the issue is, Do you also want to sell assets   and force the market basically to find an even larger amount of purchasers, and what kind of   price action, what kind of yield movement, will be required to accomplish that?    I think it is a great suggestion  I don’t have the answer at my fingertips, but   I agree that makes sense  As you know, there is much debate taking place in the markets and in   the academic community about how rich or how narrow these spreads are  Could it reflect a shift   January 26–27, 2010 19 of 260    in the government guarantee of these entities?  We have been skeptical that that shift in the   guarantee accounts for all of the movement that we have seen in the spreads, but I agree  The   more measures we can look at to confirm that would be useful    To start with the second question, it’s hard to definitively draw that   inference because, of course, the IOER rate could be set in a way to produce that fed funds path   even if the spread between the two measures widens out  So I don’t necessarily want to draw   any inference about the tightness of the fed funds–IOER spread just from the expected path of   the fed funds rate  On the first issue, yes, we had an open comment section  It is actually in the   summary of the survey  Broadly, I think there is a lot of discussion about what the right policy   instrument is and whether the federal funds rate will be kept as a policy instrument  And I think   January 26–27, 2010 20 of 260    a lot of it focuses on whether the IOER rate now should be considered the policy instrument  So   my take is that the market does see this as an open issue at this point     That is correct    I would imagine that such a situation would be quite confusing to the   markets because it is not clear what the federal funds target rate actually means in that case  So   it seems to me that, if the Committee maintained a federal funds rate target as its operating   instrument, the market would expect the Fed to set the IOER rate as needed to hit the federal   funds rate target, and that given the patterns indicated in the table, that may well require setting   the IOER rate above the federal funds rate target    But you are suggesting that the asset sales could be aggressive enough to   achieve the reserve-draining needs—is that correct?    Right  That memo has an entire section on the concerns about an   aggressive approach, and actually one of the four options considered is an aggressive asset sales   approach  So I think it is covered in the memos    I think it’s problematic to go too quickly, especially with the reverse repos,   because first of all, the tools are new and the markets have to adjust to them  Second, when we   use reverse repurchase agreements, it requires a reallocation of flows of short-term funding  We   will be taking funds that used to flow, say, into the tri-party repo market  You will have   someone with securities that they used to finance in tri-party repo, and they now have to find the   funds from another source  Ultimately that source has to be the banks because the reserves come   out of the banks  And our view is that the reallocation of flows and the relationships and   changes it would require should caution us about thinking we could go extremely fast with   reverse repos  So I think there are advantages to starting early and gradually ramping up the   program, especially on reverse repos   January 26–27, 2010 40 of 260     Well, at $850 billion, as you can see in the scatter plot on page 3, as you   point out, you enter into the point where you see some upward slope, and that tells you that   further reductions in reserves tend to move the funds rate up toward the IOER rate  It doesn’t   exactly identify what happens when the IOER rate goes up and whether the funds rate tracks it   closely, and that is, I think, the policy issue that you face  As has been discussed, that’s what is   hard empirically to assess given the lack of experience  The survey would say that, indeed, you   do not achieve a tight, one-for-one linkage at those levels of reserves   January 26–27, 2010 45 of 260     That’s a good question  I think that redeeming everything, as you point out,   gets us to those ranges by 2011  Actually, if allowed to run its course, it gets us back to no   excess reserves in 2015 or so  At a minimum, redemptions would reduce the amount of ground   we would have to cover with other operations to ensure that the relationship between the fed   funds rate and the IOER rate is maintained, but we just don’t know  On the strategy of draining   reserves ahead of time to get to a different starting point for raising the IOER rate, in the memo   and in Spence’s presentation, we threw out a number of $500 billion, but basically there is very   little analysis that you can use to nail down that level  So I think it’s really going to come down   to how you weigh the costs of the risk that there could be more slippage than we anticipate and   how quickly in that case we could actually turn around and drain reserves to tighten up that   linkage    I think we don’t anticipate pushing up overnight interest rates much, and we   wouldn’t anticipate the situation you described where the term rates—say, a 30-day term rate—  would have to be as high as you suggested  We should keep in mind that investors are holding   30-day bills at anywhere between minus 2 and plus 4 basis points of return, and so I think it’s   possible that we could entice, especially with the reverse repos, a decent amount of reserve   draining without having to push term rates up as much as you suggest    They are small  So if you are asking about the net, clearly we are adding on   net  Obviously, when we get to the next meeting, it will be a week or two from the end of the   purchases  We will be at a point where we have tapered a lot more    I was just saying that, over this intermeeting period, the purchases are going   to outpace the redemptions by far  We have about $85 billion more of MBS to purchase  The   redemptions are—    I’m sorry  I can take a look    So it looks as though we have—I don’t have the exact profile over the   whole year—maybe about $10 billion a month coming off and, as I said, $85 billion of MBS   purchases and about $10 billion more of agency purchases to do over the next two months    We were going to propose for now maintaining the current policy of   reinvestment and preparing a full analysis that we could discuss either between the meetings or   at the next meeting on whether to redeem or to use a more complicated rollover strategy to   shorten the maturity     If you want a more immediate change, we need to discuss it in more detail   January 26–27, 2010 210 of 260     Okay  There are repercussions, and I want to make sure that everyone   understands them  For example, our securities lending program will be affected    There are only two dates this year when return coupons coincide with no   bill issuance   1  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Several broad themes have garnered   significant attention in financial markets in recent months, including mounting   concerns about sovereign credit risk, ongoing assessment of the strength of the   economic recovery, and continued focus on the Federal Reserve’s exit strategy  The   net effect of these factors over the intermeeting period was to leave financial   conditions modestly more supportive of growth            1 The materials used by Mr Sack are appended to this transcript (appendix 1)   As shown in the upper left panel of exhibit 1, market-implied expectations for   monetary policy shifted lower since the last FOMC meeting, continuing the trend   seen over the past several intermeeting periods  This reassessment has occurred   against the backdrop of ongoing communications from the FOMC that the policy rate   will remain “exceptionally low for an extended period”  The current configuration of   rates suggests that market participants do not see substantial risks of policy tightening   until late this year   Similarly, the Desk’s survey of primary dealer economists showed that the   average respondent placed the first policy tightening at right around year-end  The   survey also indicated that dealers do not expect any major changes in the policy   statement to be released today  Regarding the exit strategy, the dealers continue to   anticipate that reserve-draining tools will be implemented two or three meetings   before any increase in the target federal funds rate and that asset sales will take place   after the target rate increase, if at all  The Desk continues to make substantial   progress in preparing for reverse repurchase agreements, including the publication of   criteria for money market mutual funds to participate in the program, as I indicated in   a memo to the FOMC from two weeks ago                                                       March 16, 2010 3 of 146    Even though market pricing suggests that the FOMC’s exit from current rate   levels is a ways off, investors seem sensitive to any news related to the exit  For   example, the increase in the discount rate came as a surprise to some, despite the fact   that the FOMC minutes published a day earlier said that such an increase would   “soon be appropriate” This prompted discussion about the likely path of the Fed’s   exit  The announcement that the Treasury would increase the size of the SFP back to   $200 billion was also widely discussed in this context  The amount of focus on these   two events highlights the market’s sensitivity to the issue of exit, although the net   responses of asset prices were muted                  Although policy expectations were marked down slightly, Treasury yields edged   higher over the intermeeting period, as shown in the upper right panel  This pattern   does not appear to be driven by perceived inflation risk  Indeed, some of the   concerns about inflation risk that had been priced into Treasury yields appear to be   diminishing, as suggested by the decline in break-even inflation rates from their   recent highs, shown in the middle left panel  Moreover, measures of implied   volatility and payer skew on longer-term interest rates have come down, presumably   for related reasons   Government securities markets around the world have also had to contend with a   greater focus by investors on sovereign credit risk  As shown to the right, investors   have been quite concerned about default prospects in Greece, and some of those   perceived risks have spilled over at times into other countries in the European   periphery  Greece managed to placate those concerns to some degree by announcing   several important steps towards fiscal austerity that, along with a statement of support   from the European Council, enabled Greece to issue €5 billion of new debt    However, Greece still faces some near-term hurdles, as it has to issue a considerable   amount of additional debt in coming months  Nathan Sheets will discuss these   developments in more detail in his briefing   Regardless of how the situation in Greece plays out over time, it has precipitated a   wider discussion about sovereign credit risk across all major economies  At this   point, however, investors’ concerns about US sovereign risk appear to be limited    Indeed, as shown in the bottom left panel, CDS spreads on US Treasuries have not   widened in any meaningful way  There has been some widening in the CDS spreads   for US states that face challenging fiscal situations, but those pressures have not   passed through strongly into the cash market  The municipal bond market continues   to benefit from strong investor inflows, spreads on municipal bonds have narrowed,   and issuance by municipalities has been solid, despite the continued deterioration of   fiscal conditions in various states   The events surrounding Greece appear to have had an impact on currency values,   contributing to the euro’s weakness against the dollar, shown in the bottom right  In   addition, other countries facing fiscal challenges, such as the UK, also saw their   currencies weaken against the dollar   March 16, 2010 4 of 146    This intermeeting period included several notable events for the Federal Reserve’s   liquidity facilities  A number of the facilities closed on February 1, including the   PDCF, the CPFF, the AMLF, the TSLF, and the currency swaps with foreign central   banks; in addition, the TAF conducted its last auction on March 8  Accordingly, all   of the short-term credit facilities that were introduced during the crisis are now   inactive, in that there will be no additional operations  The outstanding credit   provided by those facilities, shown in the upper left panel of exhibit 2, has reached   minimal levels and, by June, will be confined to just the primary credit facility                     The markets have adjusted well to the withdrawal of this credit  As shown by the   LIBOR-OIS spreads to the right, there has been no evidence of any reemergence of   market strains as the facilities have wound down   Another facility that is approaching its end is the TALF  The final subscription   for non-CMBS took place on March 4, and the final subscription for legacy CMBS   will occur later this week  After that subscription, the only remaining operations will   be in new-issue CMBS—an asset class for which there are currently no outstanding   TALF loans  Subscriptions in new-issue CMBS will continue until their scheduled   end date in June   As shown in the middle left panel, the cumulative volume of borrowings from the   TALF has expanded fairly steadily in recent months  However, the volume of   repayments of TALF loans has also risen, as borrowers have been able to secure   funding from other sources on more favorable terms  As a result, the net amount of   outstanding credit from the TALF has leveled out to some degree and currently stands   at around $50 billion  That balance will presumably decline going forward as   repayments continue   Securitized credit markets have not shown much strain from the termination of the   TALF program  As indicated to the right, spreads on ABS remain tight  Moreover,   ABS issuance has been fairly strong, and only about one-fifth of the issuance this   year has been financed by the TALF  A survey of TALF-eligible ABS issuers   suggested that the expiration of the TALF will not significantly affect the use of   securitization as a source of funding for auto loans and credit cards  Nevertheless, the   securitization market faces several challenges going forward, including uncertainty   about the balance sheet treatment of the assets supporting ABS and the consequent   impact on the cost of funding through securitization   Other risky asset prices continue to fare well, supported by decent earnings and   ongoing evidence that an economic recovery is taking hold  Major US equity   indexes advanced about 5 percent over the intermeeting period, as shown in the   bottom left panel, and measures of implied volatility on equity prices dropped back   sharply  Corporate bond spreads, shown to the right, narrowed modestly over the   intermeeting period   March 16, 2010 5 of 146    Your next exhibit focuses on the Fed’s large-scale asset purchase (LSAP)   programs  We are nearing the end of the programs  MBS purchases are on track to   meet the $125 trillion target, with only $20 billion of additional purchases needed to   reach that goal  Agency debt purchases have fallen somewhat behind the schedule   that would be needed to reach $175 billion  Our purchases currently stand at just over   $170 billion, and we have only one more operation scheduled, which is likely be   around $1 billion in size                  Even as our purchases have slowed, the spreads on agency debt and MBS have   remained tight, as indicated in the middle panels  This pattern has led market   participants to reassess the vulnerability of the market to an increase in rates as our   purchases end  The current view among market participants is that the MBS spread   may widen only marginally, by 10 basis points or so, as our purchases come to a   close  That estimate is down substantially from their earlier estimates; indeed, just   six months ago, the average response in one of our surveys was 60 basis points  We   continue to believe that the LSAPs helped to lower longer-term interest rates, and that   those effects will only slowly unwind as the stock of the Fed’s holdings gradually   declines   With our purchases ending, it is a good time to assess how the program has left   the functioning of the MBS market  As shown in the bottom left panel, our holdings   of MBS represent a sizable portion of the outstanding supply across the coupon stack,   particularly in the most active coupons  Over time, the share of our holdings will   decline, as we receive prepayments and as new issuance of MBS comes to the market    However, this decline has yet to materialize, despite the slower pace of our purchases,   because of the tepid pace of new issuance   Overall, the market has had to adjust to our large presence—and particularly to   having less tradable float than it would in our absence  As I highlighted in my last   briefing, our holdings have contributed to the unusually large volume of settlement   fails in the market in recent months, shown in the bottom right panel  However, this   situation has improved notably in recent weeks  Moreover, trading volume in the   MBS market has remained healthy even as our own transaction activity in the market   has faded  Thus, while our presence has caused some strains, the market seems to be   functioning with decent liquidity in most areas   Your final exhibit discusses the Fed’s balance sheet and the issue of whether the   FOMC may want to redeem its maturing holdings of Treasury securities  The overall   size of the balance sheet currently stands at $23 trillion  As shown in the upper left   panel, about $20 trillion of that is associated with the outright holdings of securities   in the domestic SOMA portfolio  These holdings have expanded rapidly with the   purchases of agency debt and agency MBS; in addition, our Treasury holdings have   returned to near $800 billion   The expansion of the SOMA portfolio has been accompanied by a notable shift in   its risk characteristics  Most important, as shown in the upper right panel, the   March 16, 2010 6 of 146    duration of the portfolio has jumped from an historical level of between two and three   years to more than four years, with the current reading indicated by the red square    Our Treasury holdings have the longest duration of all of the asset classes held in the   portfolio, at around five years, as shown by the blue line  The duration of our MBS   holdings is around four years, although I should note that measuring this duration   requires one to use a prepayment model and hence is only an estimate  The duration   of the agency portfolio, at three years, is the lowest of the three asset classes               The changes in both the size and the duration of the SOMA have resulted in a   substantial increase in the risk of the portfolio, at least on a mark-to-market basis    Under the current portfolio, a 100 basis point upward shift in the yield curve would   generate mark-to-market losses on the order of $100 billion  The comparable figure   from July 2007, when the portfolio was regular-sized and concentrated in Treasuries,   is about $20 billion  Thus, the duration-related exposure of the portfolio has   increased fivefold  In addition, the portfolio has substantial exposure to prepayment   risk that it did not previously have  Of course, removing this duration and   prepayment risk from the market was part of the purpose of the large-scale asset   purchases, in order to shrink the risk premiums on the assets purchased   The FOMC will have to make decisions that affect how quickly its asset holdings   will decline, including the policy for redeeming maturing SOMA holdings  The Desk   is currently employing an interim strategy of allowing SOMA holdings of agency   debt and MBS to roll off the balance sheet, without reinvestment, as those securities   mature or are prepaid  To date, about $3 billion of our agency debt holdings have   matured, and about $80 billion of our MBS holdings have been prepaid  As shown in   the middle panel, if this interim strategy is maintained, we would expect to shed   another $250 billion of asset holdings by the end of 2011 and $545 billion by the end   of 2015   For Treasury securities, the current practice of the Desk is to reinvest all maturing   holdings, but the FOMC could decide instead to implement a strategy of allowing   some or all of its Treasury holdings to mature without reinvestment  Such a policy, if   applied to all maturing Treasury holdings, would produce a runoff in the portfolio of   $139 billion through 2011 and $436 billion through 2015  Note that the runoff   through 2015 is comparable in size to the declines in agency debt and MBS holdings   The staff memo circulated ahead of this meeting highlighted several potential   benefits associated with redeeming Treasury securities  First, redemptions would   reduce the need to drain reserves through other tools such as reverse repurchase   agreements and term deposits  This could be seen as advantageous if the FOMC does   not have full confidence in the capacity of those draining tools or in the efficacy of   interest on reserves  Second, redemptions would lower the overall interest rate   sensitivity of the portfolio  Third, by reducing the balance sheet to its typical size   more quickly, redemptions could underscore the FOMC’s commitment to price   stability  And lastly, even though the FOMC ultimately plans to hold a portfolio of   March 16, 2010 7 of 146    Treasury securities, redemptions would give it more flexibility to rebuild the Treasury   portfolio with the most appropriate structure               Treasury redemptions raise some potential concerns as well  The primary concern   may be that redemptions could hasten the reversal of the portfolio balance effects that   were associated with the large-scale asset purchase programs  Our empirical work on   this issue suggests that the effects of the incremental increase in Treasury supply on   longer-term interest rates would likely be relatively small  In addition, some   expectations for Treasury redemptions may already be reflected in yields, further   limiting the scope for a market response  Indeed, in our recent survey of primary   dealers, respondents saw a 28 percent chance that the FOMC would adopt a policy of   redeeming all Treasury securities by the end of the second quarter, and another 16   percent chance that it would begin redeeming some Treasury securities over that   period  However, with so much market focus on the Fed’s exit, it is possible that a   decision to move forward with Treasury redemptions would have a larger effect than   we are anticipating, especially if it were seen as indicating an inclination to exit along   other dimensions   A second concern is that redemptions would limit the scope of the securities   lending program that the Federal Reserve currently offers, by eliminating our   holdings of on-the-run and other recently issued Treasury securities  This change   could potentially have negative implications for the repo market in specific Treasury   securities  However, we judge that any detrimental effects on market functioning   would be limited, in part because of the ample supply of Treasuries in the market   The expected path of the size of the domestic SOMA portfolio under the   redemption policy is shown by the darker line in the bottom left panel, compared to   the expected path under the current redemption policy, the lighter line  As can be   seen, the more aggressive redemption policy causes the size of the portfolio to decline   more quickly  However, by 2015, the portfolio reaches a point at which excess   reserves are back to minimal levels, and hence the portfolio has to begin growing   again to accommodate the ongoing expansion of currency and other factors  At that   point, the Desk would presumably still be allowing agency and MBS holdings to run   off and would be purchasing Treasury securities to make up for that runoff and to   produce the overall portfolio expansion shown  Thus, the redemption strategy   involves some churning of the Treasury portfolio, allowing our holdings to decline   for several years and then rebuilding them more aggressively thereafter    Lastly, it is worth considering an alternative redemption approach under which   the Desk would roll maturing holdings into shorter-term Treasury securities  There   are some operational impediments to this approach, unless the FOMC is willing to   acquire the shorter-term securities in the secondary market  In particular, based on   longstanding interpretations of the Federal Reserve’s authority to purchase securities,   the amount of newly issued securities that the Desk can acquire at a Treasury auction   is limited to its holdings maturing on the day of the auction settlement  The practical   implication is that it is difficult to roll over maturing Treasury coupon securities into   March 16, 2010 8 of 146    Treasury bills, since coupon securities mature at mid-month or end-month dates,   while bills settle every Thursday            The table to the right highlights this issue  The amount of Treasury redemptions   through 2011 under a full redemptions strategy is $139 billion, consistent with what   was reported in the middle panel  If the FOMC reinvests into bills whenever   possible, it can only roll over $36 billion of its maturing holdings, leaving net   redemptions still sizable at $103 billion  The capacity to reinvest goes up sharply,   though, if the strategy is expanded to allow for reinvestment into shorter-term notes,   given that those are issued on the mid- and end-month schedules of the maturing   coupon securities  If two-year securities are included, an additional $71 billion could   be rolled over, bringing net redemptions down to $32 billion  If three-year notes are   included, all maturing holdings could be rolled over, leaving zero net redemptions    Of course, if the FOMC were willing to purchase securities in the secondary market,   it would have the flexibility to shift all of the maturing holdings into Treasury bills,   without the constraints presented in this table   Any of these strategies would reduce the duration of the SOMA portfolio and   hence shed risk  However, it is worth asking what the advantage of these strategies   would be over a full redemption strategy  The primary difference is that these   strategies leave larger amounts of reserves in the system over the near term  While   the shorter maturity profile of Treasury holdings would provide the FOMC with   flexibility to withdraw those reserves relatively quickly in the future by allowing   holdings to mature, that option, even if fully exercised, would only bring reserves   down to where they otherwise would have been under a full redemption strategy    Thus, the partial redemption strategy would only seem to have clear advantages if the   FOMC felt it was important to keep more reserves in the system for now, or if it were   part of a longer-run plan to restructure the Treasury holdings in the SOMA portfolio    Thank you  That concludes my prepared comments    It’s up to you    Right    I think our intention was certainly at least to start a discussion of the   redemption issue  Whether the Committee wants to reach a decision now or at a later meeting—  it’s fine, because either one could be implemented  There may be reasons to wait, but maybe we   can get into that in the discussion    I didn’t mention that, but I think that is an interesting and potentially   important market development  Overnight interest rates have been somewhat firm  Both the   federal funds rate and the Treasury GC repo rate have drifted up at times into the 15 to 20 basis   point range, which, based on historical behavior of those rates relative to the level of excess   reserves, looks anomalous—it looks surprisingly firm  We don’t necessarily have a strong   explanation for why that’s taking place  Some have pointed to the supply of Treasuries coming   back into the market from the SFP, but I think we would be surprised if that effect were that big    Others have pointed to more idiosyncratic factors—initially the month-end and, more recently,   Treasury settlement days  So I think we would like to take some more time and see if the rates   settle back down into that expected range before drawing too much inference from it    The staff generally thinks of the LSAPs as arising from removing the   duration and other risks from the market  So, in that sense, a credible complete commitment to   sell only that amount of MBS, something equivalent to the Treasury redemptions, should have   effects that are fairly comparable in size  There are a few differences  Selling MBS puts not   only duration back to the market but also prepayment risk, and it also has different   characteristics  I think there’s perhaps some sense that the effect is slightly bigger for MBS, but   it’s presumably in the same ballpark   I think an issue with asset sales is whether the FOMC would be willing to commit   strongly to a gradual pace of sales  An advantage of redemptions is that the market can look at   the portfolio and have an estimate of how quickly the actual holdings would run off, and it’s   credible if you are in a regime of only redeeming securities—that puts a limit on how quickly the   duration gets reduced  So the issue with asset sales is that, unless there’s an ironclad   commitment in terms of the pace, the markets may always worry that the sales could end up   being larger than indicated, and it would price that risk factor    Right  But there was conditionality attached to the purchase program  And   I think the issue in a program of sales is this  If the Committee would want that same kind of   conditionality and flexibility, that may be seen as a risk factor to the markets, and they may price   some risk of more rapid sales that would be more disruptive   March 16, 2010 14 of 146    That’s the issue  We’ve talked about this in past meetings, namely, that redemptions in   some way are a commitment device to shed the portfolio only gradually  And if you could   achieve something equivalent through commitments, presumably you could do something   similar through asset sales    I don’t think it’s infeasible, but I think you have a tradeoff between wanting   to retain flexibility and at the same time creating a perceived risk, at least, in the markets    For the first part of the question, I think the answer is yes, they had a bad   guess  And they essentially just gradually whittled down that guess over time as the effects   didn’t materialize  We sat at the table talking about when we would expect to see these effects,   and they just never came, so they gradually shrank their estimates   In terms of what it means for how we assess the program, the fact that the market may   not react to our moving away from the LSAPs could have two interpretations  One is that the   LSAPs didn’t do anything; the other is that the effect of the LSAPs was mainly through the stock   of our holdings  The staff, at least, puts the weight on the second argument  The flow effects are   smaller than we thought  The stock effects are probably still there  We believe they are there   from various types of empirical evidence  And, of course, that has important policy   implications—it means that the effect on long rates isn’t going to reverse quickly; it’s only going   to reverse gradually as the stock of our holdings diminishes    I’m not sure what I’m supposed to answer  I mean, your observation is   correct  Under a redemption-only strategy, it takes a very long time to shed the MBS    Well, we’ll have some MBS holdings on our books for 30 years   essentially—not much, since the securities will be paid down under the redemption strategy    But, as that memo shows, at the end of 2011 we still have $943 billion of MBS, and at the end of   2015, I think we still have $715 billion of MBS on the books  It does take quite a long period of   time under a redemption-only strategy    Yes  The possibilities outside of bankruptcy are a disruption to coupon   payments or, maybe in extreme cases, debt restructuring  Either of those in some cases can be   considered default events   1  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Investors continued to become more   confident in the economic recovery over the intermeeting period, prompting a further   rise in asset prices that will, in turn, provide additional support for the economy  The   gains in the equity market were sharp, with the S&P 500 index advancing by more   than 5 percent, as shown in the upper left panel  In addition to greater optimism   about the economy, equity prices were supported by earnings releases for the first   quarter that have generally exceeded analyst expectations  Despite the ongoing   appreciation of equity prices, the staff’s measure of the equity premium remains   sizable, as shown in the upper right                  1 The materials used by Mr Sack are appended to this transcript (appendix 1)   Corporate bond spreads, shown in the middle left panel, narrowed further over the   intermeeting period, owing to the same factors pushing equity prices higher    Expectations for corporate defaults continued to decline, as corporations have healthy   balance sheets and ample access to markets   Securitized credit markets also showed signs of improvement  Spreads on   outstanding asset-backed securities generally narrowed, and issuance of ABS has   been decent across several sectors, despite the expiration of the TALF for most asset   types  Spreads on CMBS, shown to the right, narrowed sharply over the intermeeting   period, as investors sought higher yields and felt that the stress in the commercial real   estate sector may be less severe than previously anticipated   Even the new-issue market for securities related to real estate has shown signs of   life  A multi-borrower new-issue CMBS was brought to the market, the first since   2008, and several large banks are reportedly preparing deals for the second and third   quarters  In addition, the first non-agency RMBS issue since 2007 was brought to the   market  Both of these deals were heavily oversubscribed, though it should be noted   that they were relatively small, had very high-quality loans as collateral, and had   simple structures  If I had to make up a term for it, I might call these deals   “greenshoots”  [Laughter]  Note that the CMBS deal did not seek TALF support   because it was priced well in the market  Even though the TALF remains open for   new-issue CMBS through June, it is very unlikely that we will have any new deals   coming to the program   Prospects for financial institutions also generally improved, though a number of   risks surround this sector  Nearly 75 percent of financial institutions reported first-  quarter earnings that beat expectations, reflecting strong capital market and trading   results and lower than expected loan loss provisions  As shown in the bottom left   panel, equity prices for both the largest institutions and regional banks gained sharply   through mid-April  However, the SEC’s announcement on April 16 of legal action   against Goldman Sachs took a toll on the share prices of that firm and other   institutions that investors felt could face similar questions  In addition, this sector is   subject to considerable uncertainty related to pending legislation on financial   regulation                                                      April 27–28, 2010 5 of 206                   Another area of concern among investors is the situation in Greece, which was a   key focal point of financial markets over the intermeeting period  Nathan Sheets will   cover in detail recent developments regarding the possibility of an economic support   package for Greece from the EU and the IMF  Uncertainty about whether such a   package would be available and about the feasibility of the longer-run fiscal   adjustments that are needed caused a significant widening of Greek bond spreads over   the intermeeting period, as shown in the bottom right panel, which shows data only   through yesterday  Moreover, the concerns about Greece have spilled over into other   debt markets in peripheral Europe, with yield spreads in Portugal and Ireland   increasing notably  While the chart shows data through yesterday, the situation took   a turn for the worse today, with S&P’s decision to downgrade its sovereign credit   ratings of Greece and Portugal  Markets came under pressure in response, with the   yield spread on Greek debt jumping more than 200 basis points and the yield spread   for Portugal increasing over 100 basis points today  These developments have   contributed to a further weakening of the euro relative to the dollar  However,   through yesterday at least, we had not seen any broader spillover from the pressure on   those European debt markets to US financial markets               As shown in the upper left panel of exhibit 2, the greater optimism about the   economic outlook did not cause a shift in near-term expectations of monetary policy    The stability of policy expectations likely owed in part to the retention of the   “extended period” language in the March FOMC statement and in other   communications  The current configuration of rates suggests that policy tightening is   not expected to commence until late this year or early 2011  The responses from the   Desk’s recent survey of primary dealers and buy-side market participants were   largely consistent with that outlook  As shown to the right, respondents placed the   highest probabilities on the first tightening occurring in either the second half of this   year or the first half of next year   Even though near-term policy expectations remained steady, Treasury yields   moved higher, as shown in the middle left panel  The 10-year yield at one point   touched 4 percent before retracing in recent weeks  On balance, most Treasury   coupon yields increased 10 to 20 basis points over the intermeeting period   While the greater optimism about the economic outlook contributed to the rise in   Treasury yields, it also appeared that supply pressures were pushing rates higher at   times  One sign of the effects of supply comes from the behavior of swap spreads    Those spreads, shown to the right, have reached unusually tight levels by historical   standards, perhaps reflecting some upward pressure on Treasury yields  Such   pressure could also be reflected in the upward drift in the term premium, shown in the   bottom left panel, which remains higher than its levels in recent years   Given these and other indications of supply concerns, the Treasury is anxious to   begin reducing the sizes of its coupon offerings  The Treasury is likely to announce   that it is starting that process in its quarterly refunding statement next week  Of   course, the Treasury’s debt management strategy would have to take into account any   April 27–28, 2010 6 of 206                   decisions by the FOMC to redeem its maturing holdings of Treasury securities  A   decision to redeem our holdings would presumably lead the Treasury to issue more   coupon debt to the public over time than would otherwise be the case, although the   size of that effect is small relative to the potential swings in funding needs from other   sources                      Redeeming Treasury holdings over the near term would come as a surprise to the   markets  As indicated to the right, the responses to the Desk’s survey indicate that   only a minority of market participants expect the FOMC to move in that direction   over the near term    Your next exhibit focuses on the adjustment of financial markets to the end of the   large-scale asset purchase programs and some potential issues surrounding asset   sales  The Desk completed the purchases of agency debt and MBS at the end of   March, with purchases following the tapering pattern shown in the upper left panel    Our MBS purchases fell 61 cents short of the $125 trillion target  I figured it would   make President Lacker happy to note that we did not, in fact, go all the way to the   target  [Laughter]    On the agency debt side, purchases fell about $3 billion short of the   target level of $175 billion   The Fed’s purchases of $17 trillion of assets over the last 16 months likely   represent the most rapid accumulation of assets by a single entity in the history of   financial markets  To achieve that outcome, the Desk conducted 128 discrete   operations to purchase Treasury and agency debt and managed 310 trading days on   which either it or its investment managers acquired MBS  The design and execution   of those programs seem to have been successful in achieving policy objectives while   respecting the functioning of markets as much as possible   Moreover, the exit from the purchase programs has been smooth  As shown to   the right, trading volume in the MBS market has remained healthy as the Fed’s   participation has declined, and other metrics also show no material change in MBS   market liquidity  The Fed’s withdrawal from the market does seem to have had some   effect on market prices, but only a modest one  As shown in the middle left panel,   option-adjusted spreads for MBS have moved higher from the very low levels   reached in late 2009, suggesting that a portion of the effect of the purchase program   on MBS rates has unwound  A similar story emerged from the Desk’s survey  As   shown to the right, respondents put the maximum effect of the asset purchases on the   MBS rate at nearly 100 basis points  The respondents believe that, at this time, about   30 basis points of that effect has unwound and that the effect will continue to unwind   to some degree over the next six months, even in the absence of sales   April 27–28, 2010 7 of 206                   Given the policy options being discussed by the FOMC at this meeting, our   attention has turned towards asset sales  Indeed, within two weeks of completing our   final MBS purchase, the Desk staff held our first meeting to discuss potential methods   for selling them  We really appreciated the two-week break  [Laughter]                  The operational challenges of selling our MBS holdings are quite different from   those associated with buying MBS  For example, we purchased relatively liquid,   homogeneous assets, because we operated in the TBA market  Almost all of the   purchases fell into 33 individual TBA securities, which differed only by the coupon   and maturity of the security and the GSE that securitized it  However, we were   delivered a large set of individual securities that met the TBA requirements  As a   result, we now own a complicated portfolio of securities, with over 40,000 individual   CUSIPs on our books  If the FOMC were to move in the direction of selling assets,   we would most likely want to aggregate those CUSIPs into fewer, larger securities, a   practice that is common in the market  We would also need to determine other   dimensions of the method for selling these securities—for example whether to use   external investment managers or conduct auctions—should the FOMC move in this   direction   In addition, we have been focused on how the market may react to a decision to   sell MBS  The bottom two panels present some information on this issue from the   Desk’s recent survey  As can be seen to the left, investors put larger odds on sales of   MBS than on sales of Treasury debt  However, even for MBS, they do not put high   odds on sales beginning within two years  As shown to the right, participants believe   that a decision to begin selling MBS would put upward pressure on Treasury yields   and, particularly, on the MBS rate  The effect was seen as quite sizable for more   rapid sales of $300 billion per year   Exhibit 4 covers recent developments in money markets  As shown in the upper   left panel, overnight interest rates have firmed since the beginning of March, with the   effective federal funds rate moving up to around 20 basis points, compared with its   typical level of 12 to 15 basis points before then  A similar firming has taken place in   repo rates and other overnight interest rates   The rise in the effective funds rate has occurred even though the aggregate level   of reserve balances has remained above $1 trillion  As shown to the right, this pattern   is clearly anomalous relative to the relationship between rates and reserve balances   that had been observed since the beginning of 2009  The earlier experience had   suggested that the aggregate reserve demand schedule had a relatively simple shape,   sloping downward as reserves increased towards $1 trillion and flattening out as   reserves pushed above that level  The recent observations for the effective funds rate   have been well above what would have been expected from that earlier pattern   Moreover, investors apparently expect this deviation from past patterns to persist    As shown in the lower left panel, the rates on federal funds futures contracts through   May have all shifted higher to levels around 20 basis points   April 27–28, 2010 8 of 206                                      Market participants have suggested several factors that might explain the recent   firmness of the federal funds rate  These factors were also indicated in the Desk’s   survey, as shown in the middle right panel  First, market participants have pointed to   increases in SFP issuance, and in the supply of Treasury collateral more broadly, as   an important factor, presumably because increased Treasury supply puts upward   pressure on repo rates that then passes through to the federal funds rate  Second, they   have pointed to the decline in reserves in recent months  And third, they have pointed   to recent declines in GSE lending in the federal funds market, including the decline in   lending that accompanied the GSE’s buyouts of delinquent loans   In our view, it is not obvious that any of these factors fully explains the recent   patterns  It could be that a complicated combination of these factors is at play or that   some other consideration has led to the recent firming of rates  Because we do not   fully understand the recent firming, we cannot effectively predict whether it will   persist, revert, or intensify going forward  If the effective federal funds rate were to   drift up to the upper end of the target range, we would have to make a decision about   how to respond   More generally, this recent experience suggests that the aggregate reserve demand   schedule is more complicated, and perhaps less stable, than we had previously   thought  That conclusion highlights the uncertainty that we face regarding the   possible responses of market rates and market activity to the use of reserve-draining   tools    Finally, on a topic unrelated to the earlier material, I would like to request a vote   to renew our long-standing bilateral swap lines of $2 billion with Canada and $3   billion with Mexico  Ahead of the meeting, Nathan Sheets and I sent the Committee   a memo recommending renewal of the lines at this time  Our proposal is to keep the   swap lines in their current form  At some point the FOMC may want to give further   consideration to the size and structure of these swap lines, but such a review would   best be conducted in the context of a broader discussion of the role of swap facilities   across central banks—a discussion that the Committee has postponed for the time   being  Thank you  Brian Madigan will now continue our presentation    We have  I think the most immediate consequences would be to other   countries and institutions in Europe, which have greater exposure to Greek debt, and, of course,   to the Greek banks themselves, which are relying on posting Greek sovereign debt to the ECB   for liquidity needs   In terms of spillover to the US, our sense is that the risk of direct spillovers from these   securities to US financial institutions is relatively limited  But that still leaves open a lot of   channels of contagion  Of course, if the contagion spreads throughout Europe, then the potential   exposure to the US institutions could be larger  There’s also the contagion coming from the   prices of risk and how risk premiums behave  Would the markets build in a premium for US   institutions?  Would dollar funding markets dry up?  Would investors become concerned about   sovereign credit risk, even in the US?  I think we are certainly aware of all of those risks  To   date, as I said, we think the evidence of those spillover channels has been limited, and it’s quite   reasonable to expect them to continue to be limited, but we’re certainly watching closely, given   the risks    At the moment, we are simply trying to get the systems in place to have the   ability to use the MBS collateral  No decisions have been made in terms of which collateral type   would be used first and in what size  We’re starting to weigh the options and to think through   the advantages and disadvantages of each, but we’d certainly come back to you with a broader   dialogue on that before we moved forward   There are tradeoffs  The Treasury collateral is simpler, it’s cheaper to use, and for some   market participants, such as the dealers, it’s much more valuable for them to take in as opposed   to MBS collateral  On the other hand, for money funds and other lenders outside of the dealer   community, there’s really not a strong preference for the type of collateral—they’re much more   interested in us as the counterparty as opposed to the collateral we provide them  So we’re trying   to take all of that into account in developing a proposal for how to run the operations and allocate   the collateral    That’s right  We will have the ability to use all types of assets as collateral    I should note that the current constraint on the size of operations would be the counterparty list,   not the collateral As we have discussed before, we think the capacity through the primary   dealers is probably somewhere between $100 and $200 billion  We have much more Treasury   holdings than that, and we have much more MBS holdings than that, so we could do those   operations with either  So, really, the constraint on total size right now is the counterparty list,   which is why we’re trying to push forward with the money funds and with other firms     Do you mean over the coming years?     I can give you some numbers now, or I could put together a full set of   numbers    Yes    I believe it is approaching five years    Yes  5  In yesterday’s discussion of the redemption strategy for the Federal   Reserve’s holdings of Treasury securities, several FOMC members raised the   possibility of running down our holdings of longer-term securities while continuing to   reinvest in shorter-term issues  We circulated a table to you this morning that   summarizes the amount of redemptions achieved under several potential strategies   along these lines   A decision to redeem all maturing holdings of Treasury securities would achieve a   cumulative decline in the SOMA portfolio of $330 billion by 2013  This outcome   serves as a good baseline for comparison   The FOMC could, instead, decide to redeem only those assets with original   maturities above a certain level  If it redeemed all assets with an original maturity of   three years or more, redemptions by 2013 fall to $254 billion  And, of course, raising   the threshold maturity level further would scale the redemptions back even more    Redemptions fall to $158 billion with a five-year threshold and to $34 billion with a   seven-year threshold   Note, however, that the approach of using the original maturity of Treasury   securities to decide what is redeemed is somewhat arbitrary  It is not the case that our   holdings of a particular maturity are always reinvested in securities of the same   maturity  Instead, the proceeds from all securities maturing on a given day are   aggregated and allocated to newly issued securities in a manner that does not depend   on the original maturity  What determines the evolution of the duration of our   portfolio is the type of securities that we buy with these maturing proceeds   With that in mind, another approach is to direct the reinvestments of the proceeds   of all maturing securities into relatively short-term Treasury instruments    Unfortunately, we have limited scope to switch our holdings into Treasury bills in the   primary market  The reason is the statutory limitation that we can only roll over our   maturing holdings into new issues when the day of the maturity matches the day the   new securities are issued  Few coupon securities mature on the days of Treasury bill   issuance  As a result, we would only be able to acquire about $66 billion of bills at   Treasury auctions through 2013, leaving $264 billion of redemptions over that period   If the strategy were expanded to include reinvestment in two-year notes, the   FOMC could roll over more debt, bringing redemptions down to $123 billion  And if   it were expanded to include three-year notes as well, then all maturing holdings could   be rolled over into new issues                                                      April 27–28, 2010 81 of 206                   Of course, an alternative strategy is not to rely only on the primary market, but   to purchase securities in the secondary market Under that strategy, even if the FOMC   restricted new investments to bills, it could bring its redemptions down to zero if it   chose  Alternatively, it could achieve any level of redemptions that it wanted   between zero and the full redemption amount under this approach         The staff can continue to study the advantages of various approaches and provide   more information to the Committee, such as the path of the duration of SOMA   holdings under these alternative approaches, if the Committee wants Thank you    Six     Yes, I am    Sure  Let me make a few comments about markets broadly, but I’ll focus   primarily on the funding markets  The situation is largely the same as it was when we discussed   it previously  Obviously, investors’ concerns about sovereign risk have spilled beyond Greece   and into other European countries, including Portugal, Spain, Ireland, and Italy  Investors have   attempted to reduce exposures to sovereign risk in those countries  That movement has become   more widespread and indiscriminate, resulting in a significant increase in the yield spreads for   May 9, 2010 8 of 42             the debt of all of those countries  The pressures in sovereign debt have created concerns about   European financial institutions and a general flight to liquidity  In particular, we’ve seen   substantial pressure in dollar funding markets for European institutions   Let me review in more detail where we stand on that  I think that, at this point, unsecured   dollar funding in European markets has essentially collapsed to overnight lending, or at least to   very short-term lending, particularly over the past couple of days  So term funding is either very   expensive or simply not available  You see this in some measures, such as a rise in LIBOR, but   LIBOR doesn’t really capture the rate at which these institutions are borrowing  You see it more   strongly in other measures, such as implied dollar funding rates through FX swaps—of course, a   lot of these institutions borrow in euros and swap into dollars  The FX swaps market has come   under a lot of pressure, and we’ve seen liquidity dry up considerably in that market  On the repo   side, repo markets are still functioning, but we are seeing a large degree of tiering across both the   types of collateral and types of counterparties, and, in general, I think the investor pullback from   financing European institutions has become wider  Certainly, the banks that are providers of   funds are participating in that, but now the money market mutual funds as well seem to be   pulling back  It’s not necessarily that they’re actively selling and trying to get out of positions,   but they’re certainly not willing to roll over investments the way they were  So they’re basically   rolling into overnight investments and being much more discriminating, that is, making much   more differentiation across borrowers   There is widespread focus on the potential for government actions this weekend  I would   say that the chances of implementing something like FX swaps or liquidity swap lines across the   central banks are perceived as very likely, and there’s a lot of discussion of other policy   measures that might be taken over the weekend  So I do believe that, if the government actions   May 9, 2010 9 of 42             are seen as inadequate or incomplete, then funding markets would be under considerable   pressure early next week   Many also say they’re worried about funding conditions for US institutions and US   markets  However, the US situation has held up relatively well  Most anecdotes suggest that   there hasn’t been much change in haircuts or rates of maturity  So US institutions are still   having success at funding themselves in US markets  I think a lot of funding desks had   expected to see some pressure on Friday—they were kind of braced for that—but it didn’t   materialize to the degree they expected  I think there has been a bit of widening in bid–ask   spreads and maybe a bit of loss of liquidity, but that’s about it  We do hear a few exceptions to   that, such as one or two anecdotes of institutions having to pay up through different vehicles, and   there was one commentary suggesting there has been a bit more cutback in haircuts and rate   effects than we see  I think there’s discussion of, but not evidence of, widespread pressure on   domestic markets  So, for now, this is a story of European institutions’ ability to fund   themselves in dollars  But I think we’re very cognizant of the risk of spillovers into funding   markets for US institutions   Moving away from money markets, it’s also worth noting that the concerns about   European sovereign debt and the associated liquidity pressures have prompted a broader flight   from risk in recent days  Equity prices have tumbled around the world, and corporate bonds and   other private debt instruments have suffered  This response in part reflects worries about the   economic consequences of the pressures in Europe, but it also simply represents a shift in   investor sentiment and a flight to safety  That flight to safety has benefited US Treasuries—  we’ve seen 10-year Treasury yields fall 30 basis points since the FOMC meeting   May 9, 2010 10 of 42             Lastly, the euro has weakened notably against the dollar  It’s down nearly 4 percent   since the last FOMC meeting, which is an acceleration of the depreciation trend that had been   seen over previous months   Overall, there has been a strong shift in sentiment in the markets  The situation remains   fragile, with considerable focus on what government actions might be taken to stem these   negative dynamics  Thank you    Just to be clear, all we’re talking about here, though, is affecting the value   of the collateral, not the return of the funds    But they still have promised to repay the full amount   May 9, 2010 12 of 42              At the moment, it’s not clear that we have a need to sterilize them  We are   operating with a target band for the funds rate  We are drifting up to the upper end of that band    So we could, but I think it’s not obvious that we need to    We have an estimate of the amount of reserves for the euro area, so that   would be the ECB and all of the member central banks  It looks as if it’s somewhere just above   $150 billion  About half of that is actually held in custody at the New York Fed, so that gives us   a chance to have a glimpse at its composition  In general terms, a lot of it is in Treasuries and   agencies, not surprisingly  I think that gives you a sense of the status of their reserves  But,   again, for them to use those reserves introduces a couple of complications  It would require them   to go out and sell dollar assets, which we might not want to encourage in this market   environment  Or, if they’re not going to sell dollar assets, they have to use those securities as   collateral in dollar repo funding transactions  And, of course, if they’re taking dollar funding,   they could be taking it from other market participants  The FX swaps, in a way, are an addition   in terms of the amount of dollar funding, whereas using the reserves are not necessarily    I agree with your second point  I was just pointing out that it will require   dollar asset sales  You’re right that it’s in an asset class where there is demand  But, relative to   the case of using swaps, it’s an incremental source of selling   May 9, 2010 16 of 42             I didn’t fully follow the first part  I think if we sterilize the operations, then, yes, we   would be removing short-term dollar funding from the market, just as would be the case if the   euro area countries had to use their holdings as collateral  But that’s if we sterilize it  If we   don’t sterilize, then I think it’s this net addition of dollar funding that I talked about    If we don’t sterilize, I don’t see how we’re taking funding from anyone    We’re just introducing new funding into the market   1  Thank you, Mr Chairman  The evolving fiscal situation in Europe   and worries about global economic growth prospects dominated the attention of   financial market participants over the intermeeting period      Investors have remained concerned about the fiscal positions of some European   countries, despite the austerity measures and other policy efforts announced to date    Those concerns have been reflected in the pricing of sovereign risk for countries in   the so-called European periphery, as indicated by the yield spreads shown in the   upper left panel of the first exhibit  The policy steps announced by the European   Commission and the European Central Bank on May 10 led to an immediate and   significant improvement in those spreads, but they have widened since then as   investors have questioned whether the steps taken are sufficient to mitigate the risks   involved      1 The materials used by Mr Sack are appended to this transcript (appendix 1)   The developments surrounding sovereign debt have also amplified investors’   concerns about the health of European financial institutions perceived to have                                                      June 22–23, 2010 4 of 213             significant exposures to these countries  The pressures on these institutions arise   from their direct exposures to sovereign debt, from questions about the ability of their   respective governments to backstop them, and from the contractionary effects of the   fiscal adjustments required in some countries  In response, share prices of euro-area   banks have fallen significantly since the beginning of the year, and CDS spreads,   shown in the upper right, have moved up notably                  These developments have generated strains in short-term funding markets,   including those for dollars  Many European financial institutions still hold large   amounts of dollar-denominated assets and finance a sizable portion of those holdings   in short-term dollar-denominated funding markets  In the presence of concerns about   the status of these institutions, investors have become more reluctant to extend term   funding to many of them   This reluctance has pushed term funding rates higher, with the spread of the three-  month US dollar LIBOR relative to OIS moving above 30 basis points, as shown in   the middle left panel  Moreover, forward rates suggest that the LIBOR-OIS spread is   expected to continue widening in coming months to near 50 basis points  That is a   significant improvement relative to late May, when the LIBOR-OIS spread was   expected to surpass 70 basis points, but it is still indicative of a market under   pressure   As shown to the right, the amount of commercial paper issued in US markets by   foreign financial institutions has been falling, a further sign of the pullback by   investors  Moreover, many European institutions have had to shift their funding into   shorter tenors, with some institutions limited to maturities of a week or less  The   market has had a somewhat more favorable tone over the past several weeks, with   some core European firms reportedly able to obtain longer-term funding on better   terms, but such funding remains unavailable for many European institutions   One factor that has likely influenced the dynamics of funding conditions is the   presence of the liquidity swap arrangements that the Federal Reserve established with   the Bank of Canada, the Bank of England, the European Central Bank, the Swiss   National Bank, and the Bank of Japan  There is currently only a very small amount   of credit extended through the liquidity swap arrangements, as shown in the bottom   left panel  The limited usage of the swaps reflects the fact that their pricing is still   unattractive relative to the funding rates available in the market  Nevertheless, the   presence of the swaps has provided a backstop for dollar funding markets and has   likely helped to prevent a more significant deterioration   In contrast to the limited activity in its dollar operations, the ECB has been   actively providing euro-denominated funding to the markets  Indeed, to address the   demand for euros, the ECB decided to return to a fixed-rate, full-allotment offering at   its three-month open market operations, and it added a six-month operation as well    As shown in the bottom right panel, the amount of euros injected by open market   operations has risen from already high levels  At the same time, the amount of funds   June 22–23, 2010 5 of 213             on deposit at the ECB has been increasing rapidly  These patterns indicate that the   ECB has increasingly acted as an intermediary, providing funds to those   counterparties who cannot find them on favorable terms in the market and taking in   funds from other counterparties                     In an attempt to provide more confidence to investors, European Union leaders   announced late last week that they would release the results of stress tests for some of   the largest European financial institutions, although further details remain limited at   this time   The developments in Europe have had implications for broader financial   conditions in the United States  As shown in the upper left panel of exhibit 2, the   euro has depreciated notably against the dollar since early this year, with the   movement becoming more rapid over the intermeeting period  On net, the dollar has   gained 6 percent against the euro since the last FOMC meeting   At the same time, investors have become more wary of holding risky assets over   the past two months, causing broad equity indexes to fall sharply, as shown in the   upper right panel  This flight from risk has been driven in large part by the deepening   concerns about the European fiscal situation and its potential consequences for global   growth  However, some weak domestic data releases and considerable uncertainties   surrounding regulatory reform efforts have likely contributed to this movement as   well  On balance, the S&P 500 index has declined more than 5 percent since the last   FOMC meeting   As shown in the middle left panel, those same factors have led to some widening   of corporate bond spreads, a notable shift from the steady rally since early 2009    Similarly, some backtracking has been observed in the spreads on other private credit   instruments, such as commercial mortgage-backed securities and, to a much lesser   extent, consumer-related asset-backed securities    The greater concerns about growth prospects, along with the uncertainties   associated with regulatory reform efforts, have weighed on US financial institutions    Share prices of those institutions have modestly underperformed the broader market,   and CDS spreads for these institutions have risen some on average, as shown to the   right  Note that US financial institutions have not been strongly affected by the   pressures in dollar funding markets, in part because they are seen by investors as   more creditworthy and are not as reliant as some European institution on unsecured   term funding     Going forward, the evolution of the fiscal situation in Europe will continue to   pose risks across global financial markets  Our recent survey of primary dealers   provides a snapshot into how the situation may evolve, with the range of outcomes   considered listed in the bottom left panel  Even though respondents put significant   odds on the possibility that meaningful fiscal austerity measures would be   implemented, they still saw a sizable chance that one or more credit events would   June 22–23, 2010 6 of 213             take place in the euro area  Moreover, a nontrivial probability was even placed on a   country leaving the euro zone altogether  Thus, market participants are not ruling out   outcomes that could be quite disruptive to financial markets                        The survey question reported to the right focused on the extent to which these   sovereign risk concerns could spill over to the US economy going forward  In   March, the last time we asked this question, nearly 80 percent of the respondents saw   the effect as minimal  However, most respondents now see the European situation as   having a moderate effect on the US economy   Your final exhibit focuses on developments in US interest rate markets  Given   the volatility in financial markets and increasing concerns about growth prospects,   investors have pushed out the expected timing of monetary policy tightening, as   shown in the upper left panel  Current futures prices do not price in policy tightening   until well into 2011  Moreover, the Desk’s primary dealer survey indicates that the   median expectation is for policy tightening to begin in the second quarter of next   year, about a quarter later than what was expected in the last survey   Given the shift in policy expectations and the elevated demand for safe assets,   Treasury yields have fallen sharply, as shown in the right panel  The two- and ten-  year yields have declined 24 and 44 basis points, respectively, since the last FOMC   meeting   Some of the movement in Treasury yields reflected a drop in breakeven inflation   rates, shown in the middle left panel  Investors may have lowered their expectations   of future inflation or reduced the odds that they are placing on upside inflation   outcomes in response to the increased concerns about growth prospects and the   benign incoming data on inflation itself  The mode of the distribution of long-term   inflation expectations from our dealer survey has edged down as well   Rates on agency mortgage-backed securities moved roughly in line with those on   Treasury securities  Indeed, as shown in the middle right panel, option-adjusted MBS   spreads have remained relatively low since the end of our large-scale asset purchases,   despite edging higher from late last year  The narrow level of spreads, along with the   sizable rally in Treasuries, has brought conforming mortgage rates back to near their   lowest levels observed in recent years   Trading activity in the agency MBS market has remained intact, but market   functioning has suffered in other dimensions  Specifically, settlement fails, shown in   the bottom left panel, have risen sharply in recent months  This pattern stems from   the low level of short-term interest rates, which reduces the cost of failing, and from a   lack of available supply  The supply shortage has been exacerbated by the Federal   Reserve’s sizable holdings of MBS   While fails have occurred across a range of securities, the situation is most   problematic in higher coupon securities  In those issues, there is a backlog of trades   June 22–23, 2010 7 of 213             that are having difficulty reaching settlement, and there is no new production of   securities to alleviate those shortages since mortgage rates have moved to lower   levels  As can be seen to the right, the net supply of Fannie Mae 55 percent coupon   mortgage-backed securities (or “FNMA 55s”) has been declining, as prepayments   have outpaced new origination  New origination has instead moved to lower   coupons, such as FNMA 45s, increasing their supply                     The settlement issues in the market have affected the Federal Reserve’s   operations as well  Specifically, the Desk has encountered difficulty reaching   settlement of all of its purchases of FNMA 55s  About $9 billion of these bonds   have proven difficult to settle, and it is unlikely that primary dealers will deliver these   securities anytime soon, given the supply shortage in the market  Accordingly, if the   FOMC is intent on achieving settlement of its MBS purchases in a timely manner,   further actions by the Desk will be required   Given those circumstances, the FOMC may want to give the Desk the authority to   conduct coupon swap transactions  These transactions would allow the Desk to   effectively exchange our unsettled holdings of FNMA 55s for other agency MBS that   are more readily available for settlement  Further details on this recommendation   were provided to the FOMC in a memo in advance of this meeting  Here I will   review some of the key points   A coupon swap is a trade with a single counterparty in which the Desk would   agree to simultaneously sell one coupon, in this case the FNMA 55s, and buy an   equal amount of a different coupon, say the FNMA 45  This operation would   effectively net the Desk out of the outstanding transaction in which we are owed the   FNMA 55s  We would still be left with an outstanding transaction in which we were   owed the FNMA 45, but we see a much greater chance of delivery of that security,   given its more ample supply   Coupon swaps are very common transactions in the MBS market  The trade is   quoted at a single price, reflecting the spread between the prices of the two coupons,   and can be transacted with primary dealers over the same Tradeweb system that we   have used to conduct outright purchases and dollar roll transactions  We would be   transacting at market prices, ensuring that we are adequately compensated for the   shift in portfolio composition    Note that it is the sell leg of the coupon swap that alleviates the Desk’s settlement   problems  The Desk could have a similar effect on settlement if it were simply to sell   $9 billion of FNMA 55s on an outright basis  Addressing the situation through a   coupon swap, rather than an outright sale, is intended to avoid any confusion in the   market about whether the Fed is entering a sales regime   If the Committee agrees to move in this direction, it will require a change in the   policy directive from the FOMC  The Tealbook presented one possible option for   amending the language of the directive to allow for coupon swaps   June 22–23, 2010 8 of 213                               In addition, it would be desirable for such a change in strategy to be accompanied   by a more extensive explanation of the scope and intent of the coupon swaps in order   to avoid confusion among market participants  One possibility is to have the Desk   release an operating statement that would specify the details and rationale for the   coupon swaps  The message could be that these operations are technical in nature   and are being undertaken to facilitate settlement of a specific amount of our previous   agency MBS purchases  To begin applying the approach for the July settlement   period, the Desk would need to release the statement and to begin transacting before   the release of the minutes from the June FOMC meeting   Thus, I am asking the Committee both if it is comfortable moving forward with   coupon swaps and if it is willing to have this direction communicated by the Desk   ahead of the release of the minutes   Before closing my briefing, I will offer a brief update on the development of our   reserve-draining tools  As noted in the Tealbook, the term deposit facility has   attracted interest from a number of depository institutions  Nearly 400 institutions   have now registered for the TDF, and these institutions in aggregate hold well over   $500 billion in reserve balances at this time  The first small-value TDF auction, a   $1 billion offering of 14-day deposits, was held on Monday, June 14  The auction   proceeded smoothly, and the automated systems supporting it performed well  A   total of 71 institutions submitted 156 competitive bids at the auction, resulting in a   bid-cover ratio of over 6  Of those, 13 institutions were awarded term deposits at the   auction stop-out rate of 27 basis points  In addition, 38 institutions submitted   noncompetitive tenders that totaled $152 million, which were awarded in full at the   auction stop-out rate   The second small-value auction will offer 28-day term deposits and will be held   next Monday  The staff has recommended to the Chairman that the amount offered at   this auction be raised to $2 billion  The somewhat larger offering amount may allow   for a greater number of institutions to win awards and, judging by the high bid-cover   ratio at the first auction and the tone of our conversations with large institutions,   should be readily taken up  A third small-scale operation is scheduled for July, which   will be an 84-day operation   The staff has also made further progress on developing our large-scale reverse   repo capabilities  We continue to work on the legal arrangements to conduct   transactions with primary dealers using agency MBS as collateral  As a reminder, we   are already fully operational in our ability to do such transactions using Treasury and   agency debt as collateral   We have also moved closer to bringing the first wave of expanded counterparties   online  Recall that we received applications to join the program from 26 different   money market mutual funds  Our credit, legal, and compliance teams have finished   their reviews of these applications, and we are now working towards completing and   June 22–23, 2010 9 of 213             executing the relevant legal documentation The Desk expects to be able to announce   the first wave of expanded counterparties by August, which would then be followed   by small-scale transactions with those firms         Overall, the staff has made decent progress in readying both draining tools and   will continue to work towards expanding the capacity of those tools to remove   reserves when needed  Thank you    Strictly in terms of market functioning, I think selling a small amount of   MBS would be helpful  As I mentioned in the briefing, it’s the sell leg of the coupon swap that   alleviates some of the pressures that we see in the market  Of course, the decision of whether we   want to enter into a regime of selling assets doesn’t depend just on the market functioning, but it   also depends on how it would affect financial conditions  Depending on the size of that   approach, the risk is that it could lead to a rise in long-term interest rates  But in terms of a pure   market functioning perspective, the market is very tight right now, and some more supply,   particularly of these higher coupon securities, would probably be helpful    That’s correct  The proposal here is only to do the coupon swaps for the   $9 billion of unsettled transactions  There is a broader question about whether there could be   some swap program that would be broader to address market function  I think your point is   right    Well, certainly, a distinction has been drawn between selling assets or   letting the balance sheet run down on the one hand, and using the reserve-draining tools on the   other  I think the staff has pointed out that the former tools, including asset sales, have additional   effects, because they put duration back out into the markets and presumably put upward pressure   on long-term interest rates  In contrast, the draining tools don’t do that—they simply get   reserves out and improve our control of short-term interest rates  I think that distinction has been   made pretty clearly in the staff memos  We haven’t gone a further step and asked the question   about which draining tools would be more costly, for example, comparing term deposits and   reverse repos  I think it’s hard to judge right now which one might be more costly, but it’s   something we can certainly continue to think about    Right    Right  And, of course, there’s always the possibility of having a very   dynamic strategy and making adjustments over time, because we certainly will learn a lot about   the effects of the tools as we start to use them in greater size   June 22–23, 2010 12 of 213              We don’t have complete data on the distribution of fails across coupons    We believe that more than half the fails are in the 5s and the 55s  I highlighted the 55s  There   are fails as well in the 5s  And there are fails across the coupon stack  But it’s certainly   concentrated in higher coupons    I think there are, but they’re much more limited, and we are, as I said in the   briefing, much less worried about delivery of the 45s, and even the 5s, because there is still   production in those coupons  Actually, there are other market dynamics that are somewhat   complicated that are increasing the supply of deliverable securities into the TBA market  Some   of the older vintages of those coupons are cheapening up enough to come into the TBA market    June 22–23, 2010 15 of 213             So, as I said, we’re particularly worried about the 55s, and much less worried about the 5s, and   much, much less worried about the 45s    We can do any of those things  The question is  What obligation do they   have?  They owe us the security and aren’t delivering it  They have an obligation to deliver    There’s an ability to fail, essentially without penalty now, because the short-term interest rates   are close to zero  And after several months, we have the right to initiate buy-in procedures,   which would essentially force a negotiation with the counterparty for terms at which the   transaction would be canceled   Our view is that going down the road of forcing delivery, whether just through   communications with the primary dealers or eventually through initiating buy-in procedures,   would be even more disruptive to market functioning  We’re seeing all of these pressures in the   market right now under a strategy where we’re allowing the counterparties to fail and where   we’re actually doing dollar rolls to postpone their settlement  So our view is that, if we turned   around and forced delivery of that final $9 billion, it would tighten that coupon significantly and   be very disruptive to the market    Right   June 22–23, 2010 16 of 213              That’s right  Whether we sell outright or do the coupon swap, what we’re   doing is we’re unwinding that transaction, but we’re doing it at market prices, as opposed to the   other procedures    Right    I think you probably could effectively communicate that  We just thought   the coupon swap was a simple, elegant solution to it, because it’s a common transaction in the   market, and because it provides 100 percent clarity that the Fed is not starting a sales regime    Right  That effort is under way  It is a complicated issue that the Treasury   Market Practices Group is studying  But let me make one point clear  Market conditions in the   55s are extremely different from those in the 45s or the 4s—extremely different  So we think   it’s highly unlikely that we would do the coupon swap and then find ourselves in such a difficult   situation with the new coupon we enter into    I would say that we don’t have a strong sense  There are reasons to think   that the capacity of the facility should be pretty high at relatively low rates  As mentioned, the   institutions that have signed up for the TDF hold a large amount of excess reserves currently—  over $500 billion  They’re holding those earning, obviously, the interest rate on excess reserves,   so we think that’s a situation that will lead to significant demand—that is, they’re able to pick up   some yield by entering into the term deposits  But I don’t have a more precise answer than that    $9 billion that has not settled    Yes  We can negotiate with the counterparties and cancel the transaction at   a negotiated price  We thought there was an advantage to doing what effectively cancels the   transaction, but doing so at market prices    Exactly    Right    Yes  I understand your point    Yes, I am sorry  Whether you do it as a pure sale or a coupon swap, you are   using market prices to essentially cancel the 55s, that’s correct   June 22–23, 2010 19 of 213              Correct  I think the coupon swaps are a very simple technical adjustment    It’s as if, along the way to buying $1¼ trillion of assets, we had just bought $9 billion less of the   June 22–23, 2010 20 of 213             55s and bought $9 billion more of the 45s  If we had done it along the way, I don’t think   anyone would be sitting here talking about it  Unfortunately, we got caught with the settlement   problem  But I think there’s a very simple, commonly used solution in the market, which is the   coupon swaps  Of course, we’re doing transactions already to facilitate settlement We’re doing   dollar rolls, where we’re willing to swap settlement across delivery days  And this is just another   variant of that, except that it gives us some range to swap across coupons    That’s correct   2 The Committee at its last meeting requested further analysis of options   related to the reinvestment of SOMA Treasury holdings  In response, the staff circulated a   memo ahead of this meeting that presented a few options, which I will now review   Under the current strategy, the Federal Reserve fully reinvests its maturing   holdings of Treasuries into newly issued Treasury securities under the following   procedure  For Treasury bills, the Desk exchanges the proceeds received from all   bills maturing on a given day for an equal quantity of the new four-week bill issued   that day  For coupon-bearing securities, the Desk takes the proceeds received from   all coupon securities maturing on a given day and allocates them across all new   coupon securities being issued that day, such that the SOMA acquires an equal   percentage of each new offering   This strategy implies that decisions about the tenor of these reinvestments are not   driven by portfolio considerations, such as the duration or liquidity of the SOMA    Instead, this reinvestment policy maintains a constant allocation between bill and   coupon holdings and allows the composition of coupon holdings to be driven by   Treasury debt issuance decisions   This strategy will not actively reverse some of the portfolio changes that took   place amid the extraordinary policy efforts beginning in 2007  Two major changes   should be noted  First, over 2007 and 2008, the Federal Reserve reduced its Treasury   bill holdings dramatically by allowing bills to mature without reinvestment and by   conducting outright sales in order to sterilize its lending operations  Indeed, SOMA   holdings of Treasury bills declined from $277 billion in mid-2007 to just $18 billion   at the end of 2008  Second, the FOMC decided to purchase $300 billion of longer-  term Treasury securities in 2009   The effects of these two changes can be seen in the upper panels of your handout    As shown to the left, the total size of the Treasury portfolio is not far from where it   would have otherwise been, since the large-scale purchases essentially offset the   rundown in bills and other securities  Nevertheless, as shown to the right, the change   in the composition of the portfolio has resulted in a sharp increase in the duration of   those holdings   More details about these changes can be found in the table in the bottom panel by   comparing pre-crisis readings (the first column) to current readings (the second   column)  The size of the Treasury portfolio is currently $772 billion, compared with   $786 billion before the crisis  However, the duration of the portfolio has increased   from 26 years to 55 years  Moreover, the portfolio now has very little maturity   liquidity, with only $85 billion of securities maturing within a year, compared with   $402 billion before the crisis                                                       2 The materials used by Mr Sack are appended to this transcript (appendix 2)   June 22–23, 2010 22 of 213             Going forward, the current reinvestment policy for Treasury holdings could be   altered in two broad directions  The first direction is to shorten the maturity of our   Treasury reinvestments, even if we continue to roll over the full amount of maturing   securities  This possibility was covered by two specific options discussed in the   memo, labeled options 2 and 3, which differ only in terms of whether the   reinvestments include short-term coupon securities in addition to bills  These two   options leave the overall size of the Treasury portfolio unchanged but shorten its   duration over time  The second direction is to redeem maturing holdings of Treasury   securities  This approach, labeled option 4, shrinks the size of the Treasury portfolio   but leaves its duration about unchanged   The characteristics of the Treasury portfolio in mid-2013 that are realized under   each of these options are shown in the table   Let me begin with the effects of maintaining the current reinvestment strategy, or   option 1  The primary advantages of this choice are that it avoids any   communications challenges surrounding a change in policy and eliminates any risk of   prompting an increase in long-term interest rates  As can be seen in the table, this   approach leaves the duration of the portfolio about unchanged from current levels, at   53 years, and it only slightly improves the degree of liquidity maturity of the SOMA,   with about $127 billion of securities maturing within one year   Reinvesting in shorter-term securities, options 2 and 3, instead offers the   advantage of returning the Treasury portfolio towards its previous characteristics of   having lower interest rate risk and more maturity liquidity  As shown in the table, the   duration of the portfolio declines to below four years in each case, and the amount of   securities maturing within one year jumps to $211 billion for option 2 and to $379   billion for option 3  However, this approach could lead to a modest increase in   longer-term interest rates, as the SOMA would be removing less duration from the   market over time  It would also involve a communications challenge, as the FOMC   would have to explain the reasons for the change in policy   Redeeming maturing Treasury securities, option 4, is the only option that shrinks   the size of the balance sheet, with Treasury holdings falling to $477 billion by mid-  2013  This approach removes reserves from the banking system, thereby reducing the   potential need to drain reserves using other tools  It could also reduce upside risks to   inflation expectations under the assumption that the size of the balance sheet   influences those expectations  The duration of the portfolio remains about unchanged   from its current level, but the smaller size of the portfolio means that the SOMA   holds less interest rate risk   One concern with this approach is that it would come as a considerable surprise to   financial markets  According to our dealer survey, the odds placed on full   redemptions at this time are less than 1 percent  A decision to move in this direction,   therefore, would likely produce an increase in long-term interest rates as portfolio   balance effects unwind  If the change were seen as suggesting a stronger inclination   June 22–23, 2010 23 of 213             of the FOMC to exit more quickly from its accommodative policy stance, the market   reaction could be more sizable  As noted earlier, the risk of such a market response is   also present, though to a lesser degree, under options 2 and 3   Let me close by making one last point  Under each of the options discussed here,   the Desk will likely end up engaging in secondary market purchases of Treasury   securities by 2014 or 2015  These purchases will be fairly substantial in size, in order   to meet the regular growth of the overall portfolio and to offset any sales or   redemptions of agency debt and mortgage-backed securities that are occurring at that   time  Accordingly, those purchases will provide the FOMC with another opportunity   to shape the maturity structure of the Treasury portfolio  Thank you    Let me start with the second question  The source of the estimates is the   same set of staff analysis that we’ve used in the past  I think the staff has argued that the full   asset-purchase program of $17 trillion would, perhaps, lower longer-term interest rates 50 to   80 basis points  If we scale that down to $300 billion, which is the change discussed here, you’ll   get something on the order of 10 to 15 basis points, which is actually the lower end of this range   As for the first question of why the effects are so much smaller under options 2 or 3,   there’s implicit in that an assumption that the Treasury will be willing to shift more issuance to   shorter-term securities given our participation there  So, actually, the amount of duration that   ends up being pushed into the market is greater under option 4 than under options 2 and 3    Now, just to be clear, the Treasury I think has some concern about rollover   risk even regarding our holdings  It’s much less concern than with the public, but not zero   concern  So under any of these options, given that we’re holding less duration, there will be   more duration pushed out into the markets  At this time, Treasury is quite interested in extending   its debt maturity for this particular reason  So I think all of these options produce some upward   pressure on long rates, but it’s more severe under option 4    The problem with that is that there’s a legal interpretation that we can only   acquire securities at an auction when we have securities maturing that day  We are required to   obtain securities in the open market in general, but the interpretation has been that we can roll   securities over when their maturity date matches the settlement date of a new issue  The problem   with your outcome is that, as soon as we start to do repos, we’ve lost the option to jump back   into the new auction in the primary market  We have explored other options—such as whether   Treasury could issue a bridging security to us, and so on—but we’ve been able to come up with a   solution that circumvents the problem    That’s exactly right  It may help to understand that there are three different   settlement structures in play in the Treasury market  There are Treasury bills, which settle every   Thursday; and then there are the coupons, which are either on a mid-month cycle or an end-of-  month cycle  Given the restriction that we can roll securities over in the primary market only   when the maturity of one security matches the issue date of the new security, we’re left   constrained in terms of how we can reallocate across coupons   That’s actually one advantage of option 2—by including Treasury bills, two-year notes,   and three-year notes, we cover that full range of settlement days, because the two-year notes   settle at the end of the month, and the three-year notes settle mid-month  So that’s a solution that   allows us to be present on every single Treasury issuance day, while still achieving a shortening   of the portfolio    That’s correct  And just to be clear to everyone, in option 3, to go to a bills-  only portfolio would, therefore, require sizable secondary market purchases of bills  That could   present communication difficulties, because with one hand, we’d be trying to pull reserves out of   the system through term deposits and reverse repos, and with the other hand, we’d be making   short-term investments   June 22–23, 2010 26 of 213              Right  The past several sets of FOMC minutes have stated, I believe, that   the Committee has discussed the reinvestment strategy and that the current reinvestment strategy   will be continued, which suggests that it is a policy decision in play  Yet the financial markets   still see it as very unlikely to change it in the short term  You can see from our dealer survey that   over, say, a two-year horizon the chance of some type of Treasury redemptions actually moves   up to about a third, but, in the short term, redemptions are seen as very unlikely  I think there   hasn’t been a broad enough discussion of the other options that we’re entertaining—options 2   and 3, where we reinvest in the shorter coupons—for market participants to have caught on and   be considering that as a possible outcome    Oh, no  It would be much shorter  The duration of our agency MBS   holdings broadly is between three and three and a half years, and presumably the duration of the   55s would be less than that on average    Right  I don’t have the exact reading for that coupon, but—    Correct    Right  Treasuries are our longest-duration asset right now in aggregate   June 22–23, 2010 37 of 213              Right, but if we just sold MBS and didn’t do anything else, it would be   putting more dollar amounts of duration into the market    The main issue is clearly in the 55s that we discussed, with the $9 billion of   unsettled transactions  I think we will see how things go once we start, but we would anticipate   June 22–23, 2010 132 of 213             swapping out of those perhaps over a two-month period, so there would be two settlement   cycles  In terms of other coupons, there are other unsettled trades, particularly in the 5 percent   coupons  At this time, we don’t anticipate having to use coupon swaps to settle those  As noted   yesterday, there is still some production in those coupons, and there are other factors that we   think will keep their supply available  But we’ll see, and if we do decide that we need to do   swaps in those other coupons, I would inform the Committee before moving forward with that    There’s about $6 billion of unsettled transactions right now    And the release wouldn’t list the directive or even refer to the directive, but   the current directive that the public is aware of doesn’t allow for coupon swaps  So there is that   degree of front-running the directive that will come out in the minutes, because it could lead to a   question   1  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Concerns about the outlook for   economic growth led market participants to lower their expected path of short-term   interest rates sharply and to begin discussing other steps the FOMC could take to   increase the degree of policy accommodation   As shown in the upper left panel of your first exhibit, the expected path of the   federal funds rate derived from futures quotes has fallen dramatically over the past   two intermeeting periods, and the FOMC is now expected to keep the federal funds   rate near its current target range until late next year  Similarly, the Desk’s survey of   primary dealers, shown to the right, indicated that the most likely timing of the first   policy tightening has shifted back notably, namely, to the latter part of 2011   In addition, market participants have increasingly focused on four possible steps   that the FOMC could take to make its policy setting more accommodative  reduce   the interest rate on excess reserves (the IOER rate), modify the policy language to                                                     1 The materials used by Mr Sack are appended to this transcript (appendix 1)   August 10, 2010 5 of 160             convey more strongly the FOMC’s intention to maintain a very low federal funds rate   for a long period, reinvest the principal repayments from the System’s holdings of   agency debt and mortgage-backed securities (MBS), or expand the balance sheet by   purchasing even larger amounts of those securities  As indicated in the middle left   panel, the median response to the Desk survey placed about one-third probability on   the FOMC adopting stronger policy language or reinvesting maturing proceeds by the   end of the year, with smaller probabilities assigned to a cut in the IOER rate or an   expansion of the balance sheet  It should be noted that these readings were taken   before the more extensive discussion of these options in the financial press over the   past week, and it is likely that the perceived odds have risen since our survey   The recent economic data have been a key driver of this shift in sentiment and   have led market participants to mark down their outlook for GDP growth and to   reassess the distribution of risks around their forecasts  However, FOMC   communications also played an important role, as they conveyed a shift in the   Committee’s economic outlook and at least opened the door to more aggressive   policy actions   The revision to policy expectations strongly influenced Treasury yields, as shown   in the middle right panel  The two-year yield fell to around 50 basis points—the   lowest level on record  Across the curve, Treasury coupon yields declined 10 to   50 basis points, with the most pronounced declines at intermediate maturities     The fall in longer-term Treasury yields was driven by both the shift in monetary   policy prospects and a decline in the term premium  As shown in the bottom left   panel, one measure of the term premium embedded in the 10-year Treasury yield has   declined to around 25 basis points  Expectations that the FOMC could begin   purchasing Treasury securities as part of a broader reinvestment strategy may have   contributed to this decline in recent weeks   As shown in the bottom right panel, the decline in nominal yields has been   accompanied by a fall in breakeven inflation rates  Benign incoming data on inflation   and heightened concerns about the economic recovery apparently led to a modest   decline in expected inflation  Market participants have also begun to discuss the risk   of deflation to a greater degree than in the past  However, as best as we can tell, they   still seem to view a prolonged deflation as a fairly remote possibility, holding the   Chairman to his 2002 promise to make sure “it” doesn’t happen here   Despite ongoing concerns about the economic growth outlook, investors became   slightly more comfortable holding risky assets over the intermeeting period  As   shown in the upper left panel of exhibit 2, US equity prices recovered in recent   weeks to leave them slightly higher than they were at the time of the last meeting    Similarly, corporate bond yield spreads narrowed slightly, on balance   These assets were supported by second-quarter earnings reports that were   generally stronger than expected  However, a more important factor boosting these   asset prices was the sense among investors that the chances of a sharp deterioration of   August 10, 2010 6 of 160             financial market conditions had diminished with the passage of some key risk events,   including the European bank stress tests  Consistent with this interpretation, the   implied volatility of US equity prices over the near term declined over the   intermeeting period, as shown in the upper right panel   Investors did not view the European bank stress tests as particularly stringent, but   they did place value on the additional information about the firms’ exposures that was   released as a result of this process  Moreover, other factors likely contributed to the   improved sentiment towards Europe, including progress by some countries on fiscal   adjustment, successful auctions of sovereign debt, the smooth expiration of the   European Central Bank’s (ECB’s) one-year liquidity operation, and stronger-than-  expected data on European growth  Nathan Sheets will discuss the outcome from the   stress tests and these other developments in more detail in his briefing   The more positive view of European financial institutions is reflected in the CDS   spreads for those firms, shown in the middle left panel, which have narrowed notably   in recent weeks  It has also provided some relief from the strains that had been   observed in dollar funding markets, as indicated by the decline in LIBOR–OIS   spreads, shown to the right   The swing in investors’ views about Europe has also shown through to the   exchange rate  As indicated in the bottom left panel, the dollar has depreciated   sharply against the euro in recent weeks as sentiment about the European situation   improved, reversing much of the appreciation experienced in the second quarter  But   the dollar has also weakened against a broader set of currencies, suggesting that the   recent depreciation has been driven not only by developments in Europe but also by   the heightened concerns about US growth prospects and the associated decline in   US yields   Before leaving this exhibit, I want to make a few points about financial stability    While European banks and governments seem to have received a reprieve, it is worth   noting that important risks remain  Foreign financial firms remain heavily dependent   on short-term dollar-denominated funding markets, and they also have large amounts   of unsecured, longer-term debt coming due over the next several years  Moreover,   governments in the euro area still have difficult fiscal adjustments ahead, and the   credit ratings of some of them are uncertain   US financial institutions also face a complicated set of risks, albeit from   different sources from their European counterparts  Second-quarter earnings were   generally better than expected, but much of that performance reflected declines in   loan loss provisioning  The sector faces questions about the sustainability of earnings   going forward, especially if the economy were to slow further  Moreover, the recent   regulatory reform bill and still evolving capital and liquidity standards from the Basel   Committee continue to present additional uncertainties for the sector   The good news is that the financial sector does not appear to suffer from the types   of aggregate imbalances that were observed in the period leading up to the financial   August 10, 2010 7 of 160             crisis  This was the primary conclusion of the financial stability memos that were   circulated to the Committee in advance of this meeting  Valuation measures in most   markets appear to be broadly in line with fundamental factors or historical norms    Moreover, aggregate measures of leverage in the financial system do not appear   excessive, such as the amount of short-term financing used by primary dealers on net,   shown in the bottom right panel  Nevertheless, asset prices could always decline,   even abruptly, if the outlook for the economy were to deteriorate or if risk aversion   were to rise sharply  Elevated uncertainty about the economic outlook, the still   fragile psychology of investors, and the remaining hurdles for the banking sector   noted above suggest that such risks are currently above normal   Your final exhibit discusses conditions in mortgage markets and the SOMA   portfolio  As reviewed in a recent MarketSOURCE piece, our assessment of the   functioning of the MBS market is mixed  Many measures of market activity and   liquidity have held near normal levels or have worsened only slightly, and market   participants generally report that they continue to trade and take positions without   difficulty  However, some aspects of market functioning remain problematic—most   notably, the amount of settlement fails, shown in the upper left panel  Particular   coupons in the MBS market remain in short supply, which, along with limited   consequences of failing, has led many participants not to make delivery on previous   trades   As I discussed at the last FOMC meeting, this chronic fails situation has   complicated the settlement of the Federal Reserve’s purchases of mortgage securities    In response, the FOMC authorized the Desk to conduct coupon swap operations in   MBS to facilitate the settlement of our MBS purchases, with the particular aim of   clearing our unsettled trades of the Fannie Mae 55 percent coupon security  That   approach worked very well   The effects of the coupon swaps can be seen in the table in the upper right panel,   which reports the evolution of our MBS coupon holdings from their unsettled   positions at the time of the last FOMC meeting (column 1) to their current unsettled   position (column 4)  We conducted coupon swaps that reduced our unsettled   positions in the Fannie 55s by the full $92 billion of our unsettled transactions,   bringing that position to $0  The swaps added $92 billion to our unsettled position in   45 percent coupon securities, but we expected to get delivery of those issues given   their greater available supply  That expectation was fulfilled, as we managed to settle   the entire amount of the coupon swap and now have only a small amount of 45s left   unsettled  Looking across all coupons, we have whittled the remaining unsettled   amounts of our MBS trades down to $24 billion  At this point, we are taking the   approach of strongly encouraging the dealers to deliver the remaining amount this   month   Demand for MBS in the market more broadly remains strong, with the spread   between MBS and Treasuries, shown in the middle left panel, still at relatively tight   levels by historical standards  The panel to the right shows the net supply of MBS   that is projected to come to the market over the next two years  As can be seen, under   August 10, 2010 8 of 160             the FOMC’s current policy of not reinvesting principal payments received on its MBS   holdings, the market will be provided a decent flow of new securities—the sum of the   light blue and red bars  We would expect this supply to be readily digested, given the   strong investor demand observed  Note, however, that the majority of new supply   comes from the rundown in the Fed’s holdings, the red portion  Outside of this   adjustment, the market is generating only a modest amount of new production of   MBS    The bottom left panel provides some further details on the projected runoff of our   MBS holdings  We have had about $130 billion of repayment of principal to date,   and our baseline projection has another $340 billion of repayment between now and   the end of 2011  If rates were to decline another 50 basis points, the projected   amount of repayment over that period would increase from $340 billion to   $520 billion  In addition, the portfolio has about $55 billion of agency debt that will   mature between now and the end of 2011, in addition to the $13 billion that has   matured to date  Thus, a decision to reinvest the proceeds from maturing agency debt   and repayments of principal on MBS would represent a sizable adjustment to the path   of the balance sheet   Turning to the final panel of the exhibit, I thought it might be useful to give you a   snapshot of the current financial condition of the SOMA portfolio  Of course, the   return on the SOMA portfolio is of secondary importance to the economic mandate of   the FOMC  However, since some FOMC members have expressed concerns about   potential losses on the SOMA, I thought that this information might be of interest  As   shown in the table, the portfolio has about $115 billion of unrealized gains at current   market prices  On top of that, the portfolio generated $68 billion of income over the   past year, primarily from the interest on our holdings   I will close the briefing with a short update on our draining tools, for which there   are no exhibits  Both the reverse repurchase agreements (RRP) program and the term   deposit facility (TDF) had meaningful achievements over the intermeeting period   For reverse repurchase agreements, last week we conducted the first operation   using our MBS holdings as collateral  This was an important step to reach, given the   additional complexities posed by our use of an external custodian for those securities    The operation was part of a two-week series of small-scale operations that we are   conducting to ensure our readiness to operate with all three types of collateral in the   SOMA  Separately, we have completed the legal contracts needed to bring money   market funds on line officially as counterparties  With that step complete, we hope to   announce shortly the list of 26 money market funds that have already been approved    We would then intend to conduct small-scale operations with the expanded   counterparties in coming months  I will be circulating a memo to the FOMC shortly   after the meeting to describe these and other approaching steps in more detail     With respect to the TDF, the second and third small-value operations were   conducted over the intermeeting period  Both auctions proceeded smoothly, with   high bid-to-cover ratios and stop-out rates only a little above the interest rate on   August 10, 2010 9 of 160             excess reserves  Over 500 institutions have now registered for the TDF; in aggregate,   these institutions hold about $550 billion in reserve balances  New institutions   continue to register for the TDF, and System staff will continue to encourage   institutions that hold large quantities of reserves to complete the steps necessary to   participate in the program  Based on the experience to date with the TDF, the staff   recommends moving to a regular schedule for small-value TDF operations—perhaps   one auction every other month  These auctions would provide a vehicle for new TDF   participants to become familiar with the facility and would allow the Federal Reserve   to continue to test its systems and procedures  Thank you, Mr Chairman    Issuance has been robust, especially in corporate bonds, and it has been so   for the better part of the past year  I think it’s telling us that capital markets for high-quality   corporations are open  These firms have tapped the commercial bond market fairly extensively,   and that market is not constraining them in any meaningful way  I think much of the issuance   has been used to pay down bank debt and other sources of debt  The overall need for funding   from the corporate sector is still somewhat sluggish, but I don’t think the capital markets are   imposing a significant constraint  In contrast, from the Senior Loan Officer Survey, it seems   that, even though standards and terms on business loans from banks may be beginning to ease,   they still remain relatively tight    This measure is produced by the Board staff based on a research paper by   Kim and Wright  To make this decomposition of yields into policy expectations and the term   premium, you need to use some type of structural model; of course, all of those models are   imperfect, so I present this as just one measure of the term premium  The term premium has   fallen a lot  I don’t think it has fallen as much as the 10-year yield, but certainly the model is   interpreting much of the decline as a term premium movement  My guess is that both   components are in play in the same direction  Certainly, policy expectations have been a big part   August 10, 2010 11 of 160             of the story for the rally in Treasuries, but it appears from the evidence we have that the term   premium has also played some role    Well, I wouldn’t downplay the shift in policy expectations  I think what   you just described is certainly part of the story, but I think that policy expectations are a big part   of the story, and we see that in various ways  The 5-year Treasury yield fell more than the   10-year yield, so it’s that intermediate horizon, which has a lot of policy sensitivity, that moved   the most  We saw the responses about the expected policy path in our Desk dealer survey shift a   lot, as I showed in the briefing  And there are other signs, too  If you look at, say, options   prices, some of the volatility and upside risk associated with rates a year or two ahead have really   come down  I think the market has seen the policy outlook solidifying around being at these low   August 10, 2010 22 of 160             levels for a long time, and that has probably been a big factor—not the entire factor—but  a big   factor driving movements in asset prices over the period    Absolutely  I pointed to the second quarter earnings in my briefing, and, as   you understand, the story there is that, relative to the GDP outlook, the earnings outlook has been   surprisingly favorable  So that’s another factor supporting equities and corporate bonds, even   relative to the macro outlook    Let me just describe some of the broad features of the strategy that we   would employ should the Committee move in this direction  First, the Desk would calibrate the   total amount of purchases of longer-term Treasury securities or MBS to maintain the Federal   Reserve’s holdings of domestic securities at the current level, as the FOMC directed  The most   recent H41 data release indicates that the face value of outright holdings of domestic securities   in the SOMA was $2054 trillion, so we would take that as a target for the size of the portfolio    The actual amount of our holdings would vary to some degree around that level, given   differences in the timing of the settlement of our purchases and the paydowns of MBS   On timing, we would essentially implement this on a monthly schedule  Principal   payments on MBS occur in the second half of the month in a very lumpy fashion—on three   particular days  But we’d learn about the magnitude of those paydowns about a week into the   month with the publication of the MBS factors by the GSEs  That would give us an opportunity   to begin purchasing securities ahead of the realized paydown, so that we could smooth the   purchases and still remain relatively close to the target  We would announce a schedule in the   middle of the month of the purchases we intend to conduct over the following month  If we were   buying Treasuries, that announcement would include the total amount of the purchases and a   detailed schedule of what days we would purchase  If we were buying MBS, we would be   purchasing in the secondary market on a relatively continuous basis, so that announcement   would just give the total magnitude of the purchases we would expect   In terms of what securities we would be buying, our intention was to structure the   purchases of Treasury securities the same way we did in the first round of large-scale asset   purchases  That means purchases would be concentrated in the 2- to 10-year sector of the   nominal yield curve, although some purchases would occur across the curve and in TIPS as well    August 10, 2010 90 of 160             Under that approach, the duration of the purchases would be between five and five and a half   years, which is similar to the typical duration of newly issued MBS  On that score, then, whether   we’re buying Treasuries or MBS, we have pretty much the same duration   Operationally if we were buying Treasuries, we would do it over FedTrade with the   primary dealers—if there were no outstanding issues, it could be implemented immediately    With MBS, as I said, we’d be buying in the secondary market  We would be executing those   trades internally as we did at the end of the first LSAP over Tradeweb   Under any of these plans, we could publish as early as tomorrow our anticipated   purchases over the next month, and we could begin operations within a week, if desired  The   purchases over the first month in either case would be expected to total nearly $20 billion    We decided that we didn’t want to concentrate the settlement of the   purchases so much to try to perfectly match those lumpy prepayments of the MBS, so we were   left with a couple of choices  We could wait for those prepayments and then make them up over   time, or we could take the approach I described, which was to anticipate those prepayments and   begin in advance    We had two reasons  First, we thought it was probably least disruptive to   make the purchases with conventional settlement practices; to use something other than   conventional practices would be a change for the markets, plus it would introduce a number of   additional parameters, such as credit risk exposures we would have on unsettled trades, and so   on  So we thought there were benefits to maintaining standard settlement timing of purchases   Second, we didn’t think there was much disadvantage in having modest variation of asset   holdings around this targeted level as long as the markets understood that that was the targeted   level and that over time we would be moving towards that level  So, if we think there’s a   portfolio balance effect associated with the expected stock of our holdings, I think it’s essentially   unaffected if we have modest variation around the target level    Okay  Sorry  To make the settlements lumpy to match the MBS, we could   do two things  We could keep the one-day settlement standard and just do three massive   operations toward the end of the month, or we could conduct auctions well in advance of   settlement  I thought you were talking about the latter  For the former, I think it’s just probably   too much to auction off in a few operations  We’re expecting, as I mentioned, nearly $20 billion   of operations this month, and it would raise risks and probably be undesirable to try to do that in   just a couple of operations  I think it’s a lot smoother for the markets and that we’ll end up   getting better market functioning and better pricing if we can smooth that out over multiple   operations    Right    It will lift our duration  This is a bit complicated  The duration of our   portfolio is expected to drift up over time in any case as we get the prepayments of the ones that   are likely to prepay and then eventually as rates drift up  Under a strategy where we do not   reinvest, our projection of the duration of the SOMA portfolio is 41 years as of the end of 2011,   and with the reinvestment strategy in the Treasuries, it rises to 45 years  So there is some uplift   in the effective duration of the portfolio   August 10, 2010 93 of 160              I was more concerned about the directive, which clearly states that it will be   kept at approximately this level    Or approximately $2 trillion    It’s difficult, obviously, to calibrate the cost precisely, but I will say I do   have some concerns about rolling over into MBS  We can design the program to be as gentle as   possible  I think that means sticking to production coupons, smoothing purchases as much as we   can, probably going back into a dollar roll book, or maybe even coupon swaps  We can take a   number of steps, but we clearly risk putting more strain on the MBS market  Calibrating that   strain is hard, as I mentioned in my briefing  When we look at the market, there’s a lot of mixed   evidence  For example, trading in the production coupons seems okay, that is, it’s not   significantly impaired, yet, at the same time, we have these settlement problems, and everyone’s   concerned that at some point they’re going to come back to bite market functioning   So rolling over into MBS would risk putting more strain on the market  I also think it   creates a risk of damaging our reputation with market participants, at least in those circles around   MBS markets  We’ve tried to be as responsible as possible to market functioning in the context   of this large program, but, obviously, there’s a lot of attention on the fails and on the role we’ve   played in market functioning, and I worry that going back into the MBS market may be seen as   being a bit out of touch with some of those strains  I think there probably are risks  They are   hard to calibrate  One other thing that might lead you to a second set of Treasury purchases is   August 10, 2010 97 of 160             that the portfolio balance effects, in our view, are nearly equivalent, given that you’re removing   the same amount of duration from the market in either case    The benefits and the costs?    The benefits are lowering longer-term interest rates  I’d take 20 basis   points as an upper bound of the estimates—these things are hard to calibrate, because we don’t   know the duration of the effects—so I’d say somewhere in the range of 10 to 20 basis points    Absolutely    Right  The costs have been discussed around this table in the past, and they   include possibly complicating an exit strategy down the road and possibly putting too much risk   on the Fed’s balance sheet   I feel that, especially in Treasuries, there are reasons to think we have plenty of ability to   exit even if we do this reinvestment  The draining tools are proceeding nicely in their   development; we have a long history of Treasuries; we know how to sell them, if it came to that;   in other words, operationally, they’re easy for us to deal with  I don’t have great concern about it   complicating our ability to exit  I also don’t have great concerns about its effects on the risks to   August 10, 2010 98 of 160             our balance sheet, because I think the economic benefits should be put well in front of any risk to   financial return, and also because we have a portfolio with a lot of embedded positive return   already, as I showed in my briefing    Yes  Don’t get me wrong—I think we could exit under either scenario  But   it is true that Treasuries are operationally easier, so, at the margin it complicates the strategy   slightly less   1  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Financial markets have demonstrated   considerable sensitivity to perceived changes in the economic outlook and to FOMC   communications, but financial conditions ended the intermeeting period with only   small changes, on net   As shown in the upper left panel of the first exhibit, longer-term Treasury yields   declined notably early in the intermeeting period, as investors became increasingly   concerned about economic growth prospects  At one point, the 10-year yield was   down about 35 basis points  However, sentiment in recent weeks improved following   several positive data surprises, causing yields to retrace a sizable portion of their                                                     1 The materials used by Mr Sack are appended to this transcript (appendix 1)   September 21, 2010 8 of 151             earlier decline  On balance, the 10-year Treasury yield ended the period about   10 basis points lower   More broadly, Treasury yields remain significantly below their levels of just a   few months ago and appear unusually low by historical standards  This broad decline   in yields has been driven primarily by downward revisions in the outlook over that   period and by the anticipated policy response of the Federal Reserve, in terms of the   paths of the federal funds rate and its balance sheet   The revision to the path of the federal funds rate has been sizable over this period,   as shown in the upper right panel  According to current futures prices, a rate hike is   not fully priced in until early 2012  A similar pattern is evident in the Desk’s primary   dealer survey, shown in the middle left panel  The median of the distribution for the   timing of the first rate hike moved out into 2012, and respondents now place about   25 percent odds on no policy tightening occurring until the second half of 2012 or   later, as can be seen in the far right bucket  It’s not a good sign that we need to add   more buckets to the range of responses for this question   The effects of the revision to these expectations can also be seen if we decompose   the decline in longer-term Treasury yields since the spring into one-year-forward   rates  As shown to the right, forward rates spanning the next several years have fallen   the most dramatically, presumably reflecting the shift in the expected funds rate path    However, that has not been the entire story, as even more distant forward rates have   moved down appreciably   There are several potential explanations for the decline in longer-term forward   rates  One possibility is that the term premium on Treasury securities has moved   down notably, driven in part by the decision by the FOMC to begin reinvesting the   principal payments on the SOMA portfolio and the possibility of further balance sheet   expansion  As shown in the bottom left panel, the Desk’s primary dealer survey   indicates that market participants have placed increasing odds on an increase in the   size of the balance sheet, with the most recent readings indicating a 40 percent chance   by the end of the year and a more than 50 percent chance over the next two years    The median dealer expectation for the size and length of a purchase program, if   enacted, was $625 billion over 12 months   Another potential explanation for the decline in forward rates is that longer-term   inflation expectations are not completely anchored  The bottom right panel shows the   evolution of the five-year, five-year-forward breakeven inflation rate since the middle   of last year  It may be a concern that this measure has generally drifted lower in   recent months and that it swung considerably over the intermeeting period in a   manner highly correlated with investors’ views on economic prospects  While   several factors could be influencing this measure, inflation expectations have likely   played some role, as discussed in detail in the Tealbook    As shown in the upper left panel of the second exhibit, equity prices also swung   widely over the intermeeting period in response to shifting sentiment about growth   September 21, 2010 9 of 151             prospects  At one point, the S&P 500 index was off 7 percent, but it subsequently   recovered to finish the intermeeting period about flat   Bank share prices, also shown in the chart, have fluctuated over an even wider   range  Those share prices had moved down notably since the spring, in response to   the weakening economic outlook, falling net interest margins, and the ongoing   assessment of the implications of the Dodd–Frank legislation  However, they have   recovered more recently with the upswing in broader equity markets  In addition,   they received a boost in recent weeks from the announcement of further details on the   Basel III global capital standards  Investors apparently took comfort from the fact   that the transition period for the standards would be longer than anticipated and that   the new regulatory capital ratios were on the lower end of expectations  Bank CDS   spreads, shown to the right, inversely tracked the movements in equity prices and   finished the intermeeting period little changed   Money markets have shown signs of greater comfort with the banking sector in   recent months  As can be seen in the middle left panel, the three-month spread of   LIBOR over OIS fell back to around 10 basis points, as investors became more   willing to extend short-term term credit to financial institutions  The forward spread,   which had widened more sharply in the spring, also improved, although it remains   above its levels from earlier this year   In addition to the improvement in LIBOR, anecdotal reports suggest that term   funding has become more readily accessible for a number of European banks that had   faced funding pressures in recent months  But while short-term borrowing conditions   may be improving for some firms, conditions remain stressed for financial institutions   in some peripheral European countries  One sign of this stress is the dependence of   those banks on the European Central Bank (ECB) for their euro-denominated   funding, shown in the middle right panel  Banks in Greece, Ireland, and Portugal   have been heavy users of liquidity provided by the ECB, as funding from market   sources remains difficult to find or more expensive for those institutions   Concerns about the financial institutions in those countries are deeply intertwined   with concerns about the financial status of their respective governments  As shown in   the bottom left panel, sovereign debt in Ireland and Portugal came under renewed   pressure over the intermeeting period  Ireland, in particular, has been a key focal   point in the markets, as negative news emerged about additional capital injections that   may be needed to support the banking system  Nathan Sheets will discuss this   situation in more detail in his briefing   The bottom line is that peripheral Europe continues to face pressure  However,   the pressure this time around seems contained to a smaller subset of countries in the   periphery, and the impact on broader financial conditions in Europe has been   relatively modest   Indeed, despite the ongoing problems in some peripheral countries, the euro has   held up well, presumably reflecting the strength of core European countries  As   September 21, 2010 10 of 151             shown to the right, although the dollar appreciated against the euro immediately   following the last FOMC meeting, the currency pair has retraced, leaving the dollar   only marginally stronger against the euro over the intermeeting period and well below   the peak reached in the spring   In contrast, the dollar has been on a steady trend of depreciation against the yen   since the spring, in large part reflecting that US yields have been moving lower,   while Japanese yields, already constrained by their low levels, have held relatively   steady  In response to this trend, the Japanese Ministry of Finance last week decided   to intervene in the dollar–yen market to weaken the Japanese currency, accounting for   the jump in the series at the end of the chart  More details about the intervention will   be offered in Nathan’s briefing   Your final exhibit turns to recent developments regarding the Federal Reserve’s   balance sheet  The Committee’s decision to begin reinvesting the principal payments   from agency debt and agency MBS into longer-term Treasury securities, conveyed in   the August FOMC statement, prompted an immediate decline of about 6 basis points   in the 10-year Treasury yield, as shown in the upper left panel  Information gathered   from interviews the Desk conducted with the primary dealers after the FOMC   meeting suggests that the market had moved to price in considerable odds of this   decision by the time of the meeting, perhaps accounting for an additional 6 basis   points of movement in the yield before the announcement     Putting these pieces together, our best estimate is that the decision itself   accounted for a 12 basis point decline in the 10-year Treasury yield  Since   expectations for the federal funds rate adjusted very little, most of this effect appears   attributable to the portfolio-balance channel  That response is largely in line with the   effects of the earlier rounds of large-scale asset purchases, once scaled for the size of   the balance sheet surprise in this case     The effects of the FOMC statement on markets were more complicated, though    The somewhat downbeat description of the economy, coupled with the somewhat   unexpected reinvestment announcement, may have led investors to believe that the   Committee’s assessment of the outlook had changed notably  That perception   contributed to the heightened concerns about the economic outlook that emerged in   the period following the meeting and that prompted sizable movements in yields and   other asset prices   The Desk’s efforts to implement the Committee’s decision to reinvest principal   payments on agency debt and MBS have gotten off to a successful start  To date, we   have conducted 12 operations and have purchased about $28 billion of securities,   with the majority of those purchases occurring in the four- to ten-year sector of the   yield curve, as shown to the right  Our operations to date have been met with very   strong interest by dealers, with a median offer-to-cover ratio of about 7   Based on the procedure outlined at the last FOMC meeting, our purchases are   following a monthly calendar  About a week into the month, we announce the   September 21, 2010 11 of 151             schedule of operations to take place over the subsequent month and the anticipated   cumulative amount of purchases from those operations, with that amount calibrated to   offset the expected paydown of our agency debt and MBS holdings over that period    As indicated in the middle left panel, purchases this month should total around   $27 billion  We expect purchases to pick up to a pace of around $30 billion a month   over the next several months before falling back in mid-2011   Looking at the cumulative changes in our holdings, we now anticipate a further   paydown of about $300 billion in agency MBS from now through the end of 2011—  slightly above the pace anticipated at the time of the last FOMC meeting  When   added to the paydowns that have occurred to date, the cumulative level of agency   MBS paydowns is projected to be around $450 billion by the end of 2011, as shown   by the blue line in the right panel  The figure also shows how this projection changes   if long-term interest rates were to shift by 50 basis points relative to the Tealbook   assumption, indicating that the pace of MBS paydowns is quite sensitive to the level   of longer-term yields  In addition to the MBS paydowns, the total cumulative decline   in our agency debt holdings through 2011 will be around $70 billion   With the paydown of our MBS holdings, our presence in the market will diminish   over time  As reported in the bottom left table, our current holdings represent   24 percent of the entire universe of 30-year, fixed-coupon agency MBS, with much   higher concentrations in certain coupons  As we receive principal payments on our   holdings and as new production of MBS reaches the market, our share of the   outstanding amount is expected to fall to 17 percent over the next year  By contrast,   our holdings of Treasury coupon securities are only about 12 percent of the market   today, and that share is projected to rise only modestly over the next year under the   current reinvestment strategy  Both the Treasury and the MBS markets continue to   function well, though the high level of gross fails in the MBS market has persisted   At the last FOMC meeting, members noted that the decision to reinvest in   Treasuries as opposed to MBS could be altered if market conditions were to change    One factor that may be relevant to that decision is the relative pricing of MBS to   Treasuries  The bottom right panel shows the spread between MBS and Treasuries,   adjusted for the prepayment option embedded in MBS  This measure began to move   higher around the time of the last meeting, reportedly because the decline in longer-  term yields was expected to create a large flow of new supply of MBS to the market    However, the measure has since reversed and is now only marginally higher, on   balance, since the last FOMC meeting   I will close my briefing with a brief update on the development of our two   reserve-draining tools   Following the course of action described at the last FOMC meeting, the Board   announced a program of ongoing small-scale operations for the term deposit facility   (TDF)  Under the announced program, TDF auctions will be held about every other   month  Two TDF auctions have been scheduled for the remainder of this year, with   each offering $5 billion of 28-day deposits  The objective of this program is to ensure   September 21, 2010 12 of 151             the operational readiness of the TDF and to provide eligible institutions with an   opportunity to gain familiarity with term deposit procedures   For reverse repurchase agreements, there have been two notable developments   since the last FOMC meeting  First, we completed our set of small-scale operations   with primary dealers using MBS collateral  With these operations complete, we now   have the capability to operate with the primary dealers using all three types of   collateral in the SOMA  Second, we publicly announced the list of money market   funds that we have established as counterparties for reverse repurchase agreements    We anticipate conducting small-scale operations with those counterparties in coming   weeks   A primary objective going forward will be to continue expanding the list of   counterparties  As the next step in this direction, the Desk would like to publish a   new set of criteria that will allow a broader set of money market funds to become   eligible counterparties, including funds that are not as large as those that have already   been included  Unless there is any objection from the FOMC, the Desk will take this   step later this week  That concludes my prepared remarks    Issuance continues to be heavy—very much the same pattern that we’ve   seen for some time, namely, corporations that can access financial markets are terming out their   debt and substituting longer-term debt for shorter-term debt  In terms of spreads, there wasn’t   much change over the intermeeting period  I know there has been some recent attention in the   press, including the Wall Street Journal, about the levels of spreads, raising the possibility that   they could be too low  But, to us, there’s nothing new regarding that issue, and we’ve been   talking about that for six months  We remain comfortable with the level of corporate spreads,   given the health of corporate balance sheets     Well, the change in yields on net ended up being relatively modest—I cited   10 basis points in the briefing—so that would give a modest upward boost to equities, but not   much    We can  I don’t have the long history at my fingertips, but you’re correct    Before the crisis, our holdings of coupon securities were about 16 percent of the market  So   we’re moving back towards that level, but we could take a look at the longer history as well   I obviously don’t have it at my fingertips, but I have a few thoughts  As we   watch markets, we tend to think that the movements in Treasury yields that are induced either by   changes in the outlook or changes in Fed balance sheet policies are feeding through to a broader   set of rates  The big story on corporate spreads, of course, has been the narrowing over the past   year with the improving economic conditions  On the mortgage side, once we corrected market   function, the stories on spreads have been more idiosyncratic to the mortgage market, that is, to   the effects of the possibility of a government-sponsored refi program or uncertainty about the   futures of the GSEs, and so on  So, from casual observation, we think that most of the   movements in spreads aren’t some kind of endogenous reaction to movements in Treasury   yields—they’re due to other factors, which means that policies that push around Treasury yields   should be expected to pass through broadly to those other rates  We can take a deeper look at   this    Considerations of large expansions of the balance sheet and large purchases   of Treasury securities, of course, raise this issue  I don’t think we have a clear sense of a   threshold or a trigger, but I’ll note a couple things  LSAPs in the range of $500 billion to   $1 trillion put us up around or possibly above the 24 percent figure of where we are for MBS    September 21, 2010 15 of 151             Having said that, I think it’s hard to make that comparison directly, because, underlying that   24 percent figure for MBS, we have holdings of certain coupons that are extremely   concentrated—we still own 60 to 75 percent of the entire outstanding amount of the 4 and the   45 coupons  My guess is that, if Treasury purchases are distributed across the entire curve, we   could actually push those readings higher before we get into significant problems with market   function, but that will depend very much on how we buy, at what pace we buy, and what   maturities the FOMC wants to target  So I think the short answer is that we think we have   considerable room, but if we’re going to consider very large LSAPs, then that definitely becomes   a relevant consideration     Again, I think this is another difference between buying MBS and   Treasuries  In the MBS market, we operated almost exclusively in the TBA market, because   that’s where all of the liquidity is  So, by design or by necessity, we ended up buying new   issuance  In the Treasury market, we have more flexibility—we buy across the curve, and we   actually often end up buying a lot of off-the-run securities because they’re relatively cheap if the   new ones have an on-the-run premium  With that flexibility, we can allow the market to digest   the new issuance, and we can still ramp up our holdings  In terms of the pace of issuance, the   September 21, 2010 16 of 151             most recent forecast from the primary dealers has about $12 trillion of net issuance over fiscal   2011     $100 billion a month, right    When you say “a big impact,” it depends on what you mean    Okay    At some point, yes, if you take an excessive amount of Treasury securities   onto the balance sheet and out of the market, presumably you’ll start to affect market function    What I’m arguing is that we still have a lot of room on the Treasury side, because we can buy   across the curve, because we can buy old issues, and because, as you pointed out, there is a lot of   new issuance still coming to the market    Yes  We discussed this last night, and I think that’s the range  With   optionality, I think it would adjust as the data come in  But your starting point is probably   around 70 percent   1  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Financial market developments over   the past several months have been dominated by mounting expectations that the   Federal Reserve would launch a new asset-purchase program  Those expectations   have prompted a set of asset price changes that have made financial conditions more   supportive of economic growth            Nominal Treasury yields generally moved lower since the last FOMC meeting,   but the trends over this period are much more pronounced if one focuses on the   components of those yields  In particular, as shown in the upper left panel, TIPS   yields declined sharply since the last FOMC meeting, bringing the five-year measure   well into negative territory  In contrast, break-even inflation rates, shown in the   upper right panel, moved significantly higher, reversing much of the decline that had   taken place since the spring  On balance, as summarized in the middle left panel, the   real yield fell about 50 basis points at the five-year maturity, while the break-even   inflation rate rose nearly 30 basis points  A similar pattern was evident at the 10-year   maturity point    These changes appeared to be driven primarily by expectations that the Federal   Reserve will initiate an asset-purchase program to expand its balance sheet further    As can be seen in the middle right panel, the Desk’s survey of primary dealers places   the probability of balance sheet expansion at this meeting at around 90 percent  The   probability of such an action by year-end has been increasing since June, but it   ramped up notably over this intermeeting period in response to the September FOMC   statement and the active discussion of this issue in communications by individual   FOMC members  The effects of those expectations on Treasury yields and broader   financial conditions appeared consistent with a portfolio-balance channel   At the same time that expectations of asset purchases were building, the expected   timing of the first increase in the federal funds rate was being pushed further into the   future  As shown in the bottom left panel, market participants now see the first rate   hike as most likely occurring around mid-2012—a dramatic shift from the                                                     1 The materials used by Mr Sack are appended to this transcript (appendix 1)   November 2–3, 2010 16 of 238             expectations in place earlier this year  Moreover, market participants appear to have   become increasingly confident in this assessment  As shown in the bottom right   panel, the implied volatility of outcomes for short-term interest rates over the next   12 months has collapsed to very low levels                  The val     Other asset prices have been influenced by the policy-induced low-rate   environment  Corporate bond yields moved down by more than the decline in   Treasury yields, causing corporate yield spreads to narrow further over the   intermeeting period, as shown in the upper left panel of the second exhibit    Moreover, corporate bond issuance has surged for both investment-grade and high-   yield securities, indicating that corporations continue to take advantage of the low-  rate environment   Equity prices, shown to the right, advanced briskly, with the S&P index up about   4 percent over the intermeeting period and up about 13 percent from its trough in late   August  These gains were driven to a large degree by the downward shift in the risk-  free returns available to investors, which may have encouraged some investors to   move into riskier assets  In addition, both equity and corporate bond markets   benefited from stronger-than-expected corporate earnings for the third quarter   The increase in equity prices was even more pronounced in emerging-market   economies  Capital poured into the financial markets in those economies, given the   more robust recovery that they are experiencing and the low yields in the United   States and other advanced economies  In response, equity prices in those markets   gained sharply, with the MSCI Emerging Markets Index up about 6 percent since the   last FOMC meeting   The shift in prospective asset returns in the United States relative to those in the   rest of the world also put downward pressure on the value of the dollar  As shown in   the middle left panel, the DXY dollar index fell about 5 percent over the intermeeting   period, continuing the general trend observed since the second quarter   ue of the dollar has been a topic of intense focus in the international   community, with some observers arguing that an asset-purchase program by the   Federal Reserve may have a disproportionately large effect on the currency and hence   be detrimental to growth abroad  However, the decline in the dollar has been   consistent with the shift in relative yields and inflation expectations observed in   recent months  Moreover, conditions in foreign exchange markets remain liquid and   orderly, and the market is not pricing in an unusual risk of a sharp dollar decline   going forward, as shown by the risk reversal pricing to the right   The bottom left panel focuses on the recent behavior of financial institutions    Equity prices for the financial sector as a whole were little changed over the   intermeeting period  However, investors became increasingly concerned in recent   weeks about problems in the securitization process for residential mortgages  These   problems could allow holders of mortgage-backed securities to force financial   November 2–3, 2010 17 of 238             institutions that originated mortgages or sponsored the securities to buy back   nonperforming mortgages  In addition, issues surfaced surrounding the processing of   mortgage foreclosures by financial institutions, potentially causing delays in   foreclosure efforts  These concerns weighed on the equity prices of some large   financial institutions                     The market for mortgage-backed securities has not been significantly affected by   these developments  In the agency MBS market, investors are insulated from such   issues by the guarantee provided by the GSEs  In the private-label MBS market,   there has not been a significant impact on prices, as suggested by the indexes shown   in the bottom right panel, although trading activity has reportedly diminished some in   light of the greater uncertainty associated with these developments   Your final exhibit reviews recent changes to the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet   and discusses the views of market participants on prospective changes going forward    The upper left panel shows the distribution of our purchases of Treasury securities to   date under the policy of reinvesting the principal payments from our holdings of   agency debt and agency MBS  As planned, the purchases have been concentrated in   Treasury securities with remaining maturities between 2 and 10 years, and the   average duration of purchases so far has been about 5½ years  To date, we have   purchased $65 billion of securities, and the operations have been met with strong   participation by primary dealers   The duration of these purchases roughly matches the average duration of our   existing Treasury holdings, shown by the dark blue line to the right  Thus, our   reinvestment policy has left this measure about unchanged  Note, however, that the   duration of our Treasury holdings exceeds that of our agency debt and MBS holdings    Thus, as the allocation of the portfolio swings towards Treasuries, the average   duration of the SOMA portfolio as a whole will rise   Of course, the focus of market participants has not been just on the reinvestment   policy, but on the possibility of an expansion of the SOMA portfolio  As noted   earlier, the market is placing high odds on an expansion being announced at this   meeting  Our recent survey of primary dealers and buy-side investors attempted to   measure the expected size and structure of a purchase program should the FOMC   decide to announce one   As reported in the middle left panel, about two-thirds of the respondents expected   the FOMC to announce a program of about $500 billion of purchases of Treasury   securities over the next six months, with the FOMC retaining the flexibility to change   the total size of purchases as needed  About one-third of the respondents instead   expected a more incremental approach, in which the FOMC would announce only the   purchases to be conducted over the next intermeeting period or so, with a size of   around $100 billion  No respondents expected an announcement of even larger   purchase sizes than these two options   November 2–3, 2010 18 of 238             The median response from the survey indicated that purchases were expected to   cumulate eventually to levels around $1 trillion  The expected total size of purchases   did not vary much with the expected structure of the program                     The survey also asked about how the 10-year yield would react to various   announcements about the size of asset purchases over the next six months  As shown   to the right, respondents saw considerable market effects from asset purchases  An   announcement of a $500 billion program was expected to push down the 10-year   Treasury yield by 5 to 10 basis points  This response is modest because expectations   for a sizable program have already been established  Indeed, the survey results   suggest that the Treasury yield has already fallen sharply in anticipation of the asset   purchases  This can be seen by the 30 basis point increase in the yield that would be   expected if the FOMC announced no purchases   Together, these readings suggest that respondents attributed 35 to 40 basis points   of movement in the 10-year Treasury yield to a $500 billion shift in the balance sheet    The effect on the real interest rate was seen as even more pronounced   This view on the effectiveness of purchases was widespread across primary   dealers and buy-side investors  Thus, there seems to be little disagreement among   investors with the notion that changes in the balance sheet affect financial conditions    However, there is considerable debate among market participants on the extent to   which such changes ultimately affect economic activity—an issue that was not   addressed in our survey   Your last two panels present indicators related to some of the perceived risks   around an asset-purchase program   Some market participants have questioned whether additional balance sheet   expansion could present difficulties for a future exit from policy accommodation    One relevant measure in that regard is the expected volatility of long-term interest   rates  If market participants have considerable concerns about our ability to exit from   an expanded balance sheet, then one might expect to see the market price in greater   volatility of long-term interest rates beginning several years ahead  As shown in the   bottom left panel, the volatility of the 10-year rate beginning three years ahead   implied by swaption prices has instead moved lower in recent months and is close to   the middle of its historical range   Another concern might be that the balance sheet expansion could dislodge   inflation expectations, perhaps because of concerns about the ability to exit  As noted   earlier, break-even inflation rates have moved up sharply over the intermeeting   period  This increase showed through strongly to the five-year, five-year forward rate   that is often used to gauge the Federal Reserve’s credibility for keeping inflation low   and stable over the longer run  As shown in the bottom right panel, this measure has   moved into the upper half of its historical range  However, we interpret the repricing   November 2–3, 2010 19 of 238             to date as consistent with the view that the FOMC will credibly return inflation to   levels consistent with its dual mandate                  Clearly, it will be important to monitor these two measures and other indicators of   associated risks as part of the ongoing assessment of the Federal Reserve’s balance   sheet actions   I will close with a brief update on the development of our two reserve-draining   tools  Overall, the staff continues to make good progress towards ensuring the   readiness of these tools and expanding their capacity to drain reserves   Consistent with the Board announcement in September, the Federal Reserve   began conducting regular, small-scale auctions for its Term Deposit Facility  The   staff’s current intention is to conduct a $5 billion auction for a one-month deposit   every other month  The first such operation, which took place on October 4, was met   with strong demand, and the second operation will occur near the end of this month    The Term Deposit Facility currently has 542 registered depository institutions, with   more trickling in over time   Similarly, for reverse repurchase agreements, the Desk conducted five small-scale   operations over the intermeeting period  These operations were notable in that they   included money market funds as counterparties for the first time  At this point, our   counterparty list includes the 18 primary dealers and the 26 money market funds that   were approved in August  In addition, an additional 32 money market funds have   begun the application process to become eligible counterparties  Thank you  That   concludes my prepared remarks    In the first asset-purchase program and in the reinvestment program, we’ve   concentrated purchases in the 2- to 10-year sector of the curve  That decision was based on   November 2–3, 2010 20 of 238             several considerations  One was that that’s the duration range where most private issuance takes   place  Another was that it’s a big, liquid part of the curve  Nevertheless, we’ve spread   purchases out beyond that sector, and the purpose of doing so was to avoid creating significant   kinks or odd patterns in the shape of the yield curve  So I think that has been largely successful   Now, the 10s/30s slope has gotten a lot of attention in financial markets recently because   it has steepened a good amount, and there’s a lot of discussion about whether, if another asset-  purchase program were launched, we would consider moving more strongly into bonds in order   to offset that  We don’t feel strongly that we have to do that  The 10s/30s curve is primarily   steepening because the 10-year yield is falling, and the forward rates between 10 and 30 years   have risen some, but they’re not unusually high by historical standards  Having said that, in the   proposal the Desk has put together for alternative B, which we’ll discuss in detail tomorrow, we   are proposing feathering a small amount of additional purchases into the long end just to make   sure that we don’t exacerbate that distortion to the shape of the curve  So the bottom line is that   we’d like to operate in the 2- to 10-year sector, but we’re also cautious about not creating too   much distortion in the shape of the curve even out to the bond    We do have significant draining capacity today, as the development of the   draining tools has progressed largely as we had expected  At an earlier meeting we had   estimated the draining capacity to be something like $900 billion  I believe that we had   November 2–3, 2010 21 of 238             something like $500 billion in the Term Deposit Facility and then another $400 billion on the   reverse repo side  On the reverse repo side, I think we’re approaching those capacity numbers,   or, at least, we will be approaching them once we get this next wave of money funds on line  We   still think we have $150 to $200 billion of capacity through the dealers, and then the rest is   through the money funds  On the Term Deposit Facility side, as far as I understand it, that is   progressing as expected, so I would expect those capacity numbers still to hold   I should emphasize, though, that it’s very hard to judge capacity ahead of time, so those   are estimates with wide confidence bands  One difficult issue is trying to figure out how much   the capacity will automatically rise as additional reserves reach the market, as would be the case   if the FOMC decided on an asset-purchase program  Obviously, those reserves will be at banks,   so, just by having those additional reserves, one would expect the capacity to be rising, and, even   if it doesn’t rise at a rate that’s one for one with the reserves, it would still be at a rate that’s   significant  But, again, it’s difficult to judge    Well, the view that we’ve been describing is that the asset purchases   worked by taking that duration out of the market and, therefore, essentially repricing the term   premium  One view is that it is a portfolio-balance channel—just having less duration risk in the   market means that those investors left holding the remaining duration risk are willing to do so   with a lower expected return  Another way to say it is that it’s harder and harder to force people   out of holding Treasury securities, so, as we purchase, those most willing to hold them with a   lower expected return are the ones that remain   I know that different theoretical models will give very different assessments of how big   that effect should be  Some would point out that, since there are all sorts of asset classes with   duration risk, it’s not obvious why this one should have such a large effect  But, from a practical   perspective, the empirical evidence seems to show that the prospect of asset purchases did have a   significant effect on the yield curve and on financial conditions    Right, but when we look at how longer-term rates have fallen, we do see   two components  One is that policy expectations have repriced, which could be pulling down the   short- and intermediate-term yields  And we believe that the term premium also has been falling;   one reason we believe that is that you see these effects on real yields very far out the curve in   terms of forward rates, and the other reason is that models that do try to separate those two   pieces all suggest that the term premium is coming down    Conceptually, under the portfolio-balance view, those two do have similar   effects  The effects we’re talking about arise from the amount of duration that’s left for the   private sector to hold, and that could be changed through debt management decisions just as   easily as it could be changed through our portfolio decisions  But there are two differences to   highlight  First, we can move a lot more quickly than debt managers—obviously, as they change   their issuance calendars, that changes duration, but only slowly, as the auctions occur, and we   can move faster than that  Second, debt managers do not have an economic mandate  They   operate under a mandate of being regular and predictable and minimizing their borrowing costs   over time, so they don’t really have a clear structure through which they should make debt   management changes like that in order to affect economic outcomes    That’s a fair observation  [Laughter]    I wasn’t trying to make the point that this is a perfect forecaster of future   volatility  I would argue that, if market participants today saw considerable complications with   the Federal Reserve’s exit, then they would likely price in greater volatility of long-term interest   rates at those horizons at which we would be exiting  So, even if it’s difficult to predict what the   volatility will be, these data still represent investors’ views today about policy challenges the   FOMC can face  That was the only point I wanted to make—I didn’t want to make any claim   about how good a predictor this measure is    Well, no  A bad track record as a predictor doesn’t mean this is not an   indicator of investors’ views  It just means that those views don’t turn out to be correct  It’s fine   to say we can’t be reassured because investors are sanguine—that it is no reason we should be   sanguine as well  That’s an absolutely fine point to make    That’s right    The forward rates suggest that the markets expect long-term interest rates to   remain relatively low and that they will gradually rise, but not sharply  This is a measure of   whether the markets see a lot of risk around that forecast, and it suggests not an unusual amount   of risk  4  I’ll be referring to the handout labeled “Operational Implications of   Policy Alternatives”   If the FOMC were to decide to expand its securities holdings as described in   alternatives A or B, the Desk would have to determine a number of details for   conducting the asset purchases  This briefing describes a proposed structure for an   asset-purchase program, in order to allow you to better assess the desirability of such   a program and to give you a chance to provide feedback on its structure   As Bill just described, alternative B involves purchasing longer-term Treasury   securities in order to achieve a $600 billion expansion in the domestic asset holdings   of the SOMA by the end of the second quarter of 2011  Those purchases would be in   addition to the purchases of longer-term Treasury securities being conducted to   reinvest principal payments on agency debt and agency MBS held in the SOMA    Based on current market conditions, we expect those reinvestments to total $250 to   $300 billion by the end of the second quarter  Accordingly, our total purchases of   Treasury securities over that period would be $850 to $900 billion—or an average   pace of roughly $110 billion per month  The projected path of purchases is shown in   the upper left panel of the first page of the handout   Such a program would have us running at a pace close to what we judge to be the   capacity for Treasury purchases, in terms of our ability to complete operations and   avoid disruptions to market functioning  The Desk would be operating in the market   on almost every available business day  In particular, the schedule we propose would   involve about 18 operations per month, with the average size of those operations at   around $6 billion  By comparison, the reinvestment program has involved 9   operations per month, with an average size of around $2½ billion    We would propose distributing the purchases across maturities in the manner   shown by the red bars in the upper right panel  This distribution continues to focus   our purchases in securities with remaining maturities of between 2 and 10 years    However, compared to the reinvestment strategy that has been employed to date, we   would increase our purchases at both ends of this range, and we would modestly step   up our purchases of very long-term securities and TIPS  Spreading out our purchases   in this manner should increase our overall capacity for purchases    These changes in the distribution were designed to have little effect on the   average duration of the securities that we purchase  Indeed, under this distribution,                                                     4 The materials used by Mr Sack are appended to this transcript (appendix 4)   November 2–3, 2010 112 of 238             purchased securities are expected to have an average duration of about 5½ years,   which is very close to the average duration of our reinvestments to date  However,   the actual duration realized would depend on what offers we are shown in our   operations  The distribution of purchases could be adjusted as warranted by market   conditions, but any such changes would be designed not to alter significantly the   average duration of the assets purchased                  To enhance our operational flexibility and to ensure that we are able to purchase   the most attractive securities on a relative-value basis, the Desk intends to suspend the   35 percent per-issue limit on SOMA holdings under which we currently operate  This   is a self-imposed limit that was established during a period of declining issue sizes in   order to ensure that SOMA holdings would not impair market liquidity  We are   comfortable with temporarily suspending the limit, because our auction-based   approach should guard against purchasing securities that have considerable scarcity    Additionally, SOMA holdings of an individual security will only be allowed to rise   above the 35 percent threshold in modest increments    Purchases associated with balance sheet expansion and those associated with   reinvestments would be combined into one set of operations to be announced under   the current monthly cycle  The timing of that schedule would continue to be based on   the release of MBS prepayment factors early in the month  Thus, on or around the   eighth business day of each month, the Desk would publish a tentative schedule of   purchase operations expected to take place through the middle of the following   month  The schedule would include a list of operation dates, settlement dates,   security types to be purchased, the range of eligible issues, and, for the first time, an   indication of the expected size of each operation    The Desk also would like to increase the transparency of its purchase process    Under current practice, some broad summary statistics from each purchase operation   are published shortly after the operation has concluded, but no pricing information is   provided  In order to ensure the transparency of our purchase operations, the Desk   intends to begin publishing information on the prices paid in individual operations at   the end of each monthly calendar period, coinciding with the release of the next   period’s schedule  This information should encourage additional participation by   customers operating through dealers and, hence, should result in more submissions   and better pricing   If the FOMC were in fact to adopt the asset purchases described in alternative B,   the Desk would release a statement concurrent with the FOMC statement, a draft of   which is attached to your handout  This statement would provide details on the   operational plan for purchasing securities, including the expected distribution of our   purchases, in order to limit any uncertainty in the market  An accompanying set of   FAQs on the asset purchases would also be released   These details have been developed for the case of alternative B  If the Committee   were to choose alternative A instead, most aspects of the proposed program structure   November 2–3, 2010 113 of 238             would be the same  As Bill described, alternative A involves increasing SOMA asset   holdings by $1 trillion by the end of 2011  This approach would involve about the   same monthly pace of purchases as in alternative B, only with the operations carried   out for a longer period  Given the larger cumulative amount of purchases, the Desk   would likely modify the proposed distribution of purchases to some extent, in order to   avoid excessive concentration of SOMA holdings in some maturity sectors                  Under either alternative for asset purchases, the SOMA portfolio of domestic   securities would be considerably larger than it would be if the current portfolio   strategy were maintained  This difference has implications for the expected income   and risk exposure from the portfolio, as explored in the remaining panels of the   exhibit  I will focus the results on the $600 billion purchase strategy described in   alternative B   As shown in the middle left panel, the additional asset purchases under alternative   B lift the size of the SOMA domestic portfolio to $26 trillion in 2011, where it   remains into 2012  After that point, asset holdings begin to decline, as the FOMC is   assumed to stop reinvesting proceeds from its asset holdings in the second half of   2012 and then to commence gradual sales of agency MBS in early 2013  This path   can be compared to the portfolio outcome realized under alternative C, which   maintains the current strategy of reinvesting principal payments in the near term but   does not involve purchases of additional assets  This strategy leaves SOMA asset   holdings unchanged at around $2 trillion over the near term, before the same   approach of redemptions and asset sales causes those holdings to begin declining in   2013   The expected net income path from the SOMA portfolio under these two   strategies is highlighted in the middle right panel  For this and the other remaining   panels, the FOMC is assumed to begin raising the federal funds rate target in the   fourth quarter of 2012, and the path of longer-term interest rates moves up notably   over the forecast horizon, as assumed in the Tealbook   As can be seen in this chart, in both cases the expected income from the SOMA   portfolio remains sizable  Under the current reinvestment strategy in alternative C,   net income realized over the next several years is unusually large, reflecting the size   of the SOMA portfolio and the low interest rate paid on reserve balances  Net income   then declines through 2015 as short-term interest rates increase and asset sales lead to   modest capital losses  However, net income remains above $25 billion, implying that   remittances to Treasury never fall significantly below the levels that were typical   before the financial crisis   The additional assets purchased under alternative B increase the expected stream   of net income for the next several years, as the coupon income on the purchased   securities exceeds the expense of the interest paid on the reserves created by those   purchases  Eventually, however, this difference diminishes as the portfolios converge   November 2–3, 2010 114 of 238             under the two alternatives  Over the 10-year period shown, alternative B provides   about $27 billion of additional expected income relative to alternative C                     The additional expected income in part represents compensation for the greater   amount of risk that the Federal Reserve takes on under alternative B  This risk comes   from two sources   One source of risk is the path of short-term interest rates  The bottom left panel   shows the effects on SOMA net income if monetary policy tightening ends up being   earlier and more aggressive than assumed in the Tealbook  In particular, the interest   rate on reserves is assumed to begin increasing in late 2011 instead of late 2012, and   the rate then follows a path that is 100 basis points higher than the Tealbook   assumption through the end of the forecast period  Under this scenario, the higher   cost of the additional reserves created by the elevated balance sheet weighs on net   income under both of the policy alternatives  However, this effect is larger under   alternative B, given the greater size of the reserves created  Over the 10-year period   as a whole, the cumulative loss of income from this risk scenario is about $15 billion   larger under alternative B than it is under alternative C   The second source of risk comes from potential capital losses on securities that   are sold  Any capital losses realized under the assumed path of asset sales were   included in the expected income projections shown in the middle right panel    However, it might also be worth considering the path of unrealized capital losses, as   those losses could end up being realized if the FOMC decided to sell more assets than   assumed in the projections   As shown in the bottom right panel, even under the current reinvestment strategy   in alternative C, the portfolio is projected to swing from a position of considerable   unrealized capital gains today to a position of sizable unrealized capital losses,   reflecting the increase in longer-term interest rates assumed in the Tealbook  This   swing would be even larger under the additional asset purchases in alternative B,   given the greater amount of duration risk taken  The peak difference in the   projections involves about $20 billion of additional unrealized losses under   alternative B   In addition, alternative B increases the sensitivity of capital losses to any   unexpected increase in long-term interest rates beyond that assumed in the Tealbook    For example, a 100 basis point parallel increase in the yield curve would produce   approximately $85 billion in mark-to-market losses on the portfolio in 2012 under   alternative C  With the larger balance sheet in alternative B, the mark-to-market   losses would be approximately $110 billion, or an increase of about $25 billion    However, most of those losses would not be realized under the sales strategy assumed   in our projections  Moreover, yields could also come in lower than assumed in the   Tealbook, thereby reducing the portfolio losses shown in the bottom right panel    November 2–3, 2010 115 of 238             Overall, these calculations are intended to provide some benchmarks for the   amount of additional risk that the FOMC is assuming by engaging in further asset   purchases  In closing, it is worth noting that, even if unexpected developments   pushed the net income from SOMA into negative territory, it would not affect our   ability to conduct monetary policy, although it would affect the remittances that we   make to the Treasury  Thank you  That concludes my prepared remarks       Let me start with the practice that we intend to implement, and that practice   will be described in more detail in the FAQs that would accompany the statement, if you agree to   it  What we intend to do is only to allow SOMA holdings to move above 35 percent in 5 percent   November 2–3, 2010 116 of 238             increments per operation—we would restrict accepted offers at any individual operation to that   limit  The reason for doing that is to avoid unexpectedly and suddenly taking a large amount of   outstanding supply  We do believe the auction mechanism will guard against the Fed owning too   much of any individual CUSIP as long as the market understands where our holdings are and   how they’re increasing  We just want to avoid running into a situation where, for example, four   dealers happen to show us a lot of the same CUSIP and we end up buying them and increasing   our holdings of them too quickly   In terms of the more flexible approach that you describe, we find it difficult to figure out   how to implement that  If we said we’re going to honor 35 percent but may go above it in some   cases, that would require us to have some criteria for deciding when to breach that limit, and we   couldn’t settle on a clear, explicit set of criteria  So we prefer this approach, which will allow us   to go above it based on the offers that we’re shown from the market, and we would do so   cautiously    Well, I think the question is whether you’re comfortable with the practice   that I described  That information will be available to the markets in the FAQs  We can work on   the language of the statement so it doesn’t sound so extreme—perhaps the language on   suspending the limit reads too strongly—but the content will be available to the market  May I   say two other things?    One concern was that suspending the limit would lead to a lot of inference   about where on the curve we’re buying, because this limit is more binding in certain sectors,   including bonds with outstanding maturities between 10 and 20 years  That’s one of the reasons   we felt it was important to publish the distribution of our holdings in the statement also, because   it avoids any confusion about what the suspension of the 35 percent limit meant for the   distribution of our purchases  The other issue is that we did contemplate setting a higher limit,   but the problem we faced there is that, no matter what number we chose, it would lead market   participants to calculate how much capacity that was giving us, and we worried that that would   be seen as a signal about the potential ultimate size of asset purchases  So we felt the best   approach was simply to suspend it, but to do so in this cautious way    Do you want me to answer?    I think the answer is that we made money, because the additional coupon   income is outstripping the increased cost of the reserves under that scenario    Right, under that scenario    The additional net income stream over the 10 years was $27 billion, and the   additional loss coming from the 100 basis point shock to short rates was $15 billion, so it’s the   net of those, which is around $10 or $12 billion    Correct    Clearly, additional asset purchases put more risk onto our balance sheet    And we are compensated for that because we’re buying at market prices,   but that compensation is reduced to the extent that we’ve collapsed the term premium    Conceptually, the term premium is that expected excess return that market participants get for   that risk  So there’s some compensation, but clearly there are risk scenarios where it will be   negative for net income    Sure  We specify a maturity range, which is actually shown in that panel    We do an operation across all CUSIPs in that range, and we choose the securities based on two   criteria  how the prices come in relative to the market, and how cheap or expensive they look   relative to a smoothed yield curve  Therefore, there is a relative value judgment that could   determine where within each maturity bucket we purchase  The point is that, depending on the   offers we’re shown, say, for the bond, we could end up buying at the shorter end of the 18- to   30-year sector or at the longer end—it depends on the offers  That’s what introduces some   variation in the average duration of the securities that we purchase  The question is  If, at some   point, there’s enough variation, how do we compensate for that?   I think the way to compensate   for it is to start to shift how much we’re buying in each bucket  The point I was trying to make is   that we’ll seek to keep the average duration around 5½ years, and if we get enough variation   from that, we’d probably make changes to the distribution    Correct  We think it’s prudent to look at the offers we receive and make a   judgment about which of those securities offers the best value to the taxpayer    We’re not pegging the overall shape of the curve, but it is true that, within   each maturity sector, our operations will tend to compress variation around our spline  The   bigger the Treasury purchase program is, the more relevant our spline becomes, because we’re a   November 2–3, 2010 122 of 238             big participant in the market, and we’re buying based on evaluations around our spline  But this   is an issue about small differences in relative value across CUSIPs as opposed to the bigger   question about the overall shape of the yield curve    Regarding the 2-year versus the 10-year, our actions are completely   represented in the red bars in the upper right  That’s the decision about what sectors we’re   purchasing, and that’s why this is presented to you to make sure you’re comfortable with it   If we used our spline or some theoretical measure of fair value and then bought across the   whole yield curve based on that, then I would agree with you—we would be making a judgment   that the 2-year sector is too cheap and the 10-year is too rich, and we’d have bigger effects across   the whole curve  But that’s not what we do  We divide these up into relatively limited maturity   buckets so that that assessment of relative value occurs only, say, within the 5½-  to 7-year   bucket, so we’re just slicing the yield curve up into these buckets where we’re making a relative   value judgment but only within that maturity range    No  Across the boundaries you’ll get the red bars shown   November 2–3, 2010 123 of 238              We do if they’re in the same bucket, but —    That’s right  We’ll do one operation that will include the 54 and we’ll do   another operation that will include the 55    That’s correct    This is going to be more transparent than Desk operations have ever been    [Laughter]  We’ve never explicitly announced the distribution of our purchases  In the past we   haven’t even announced the size of individual operations when we do them    They already understand that we have a spline to make this relative value   calculation  And almost every shop on the street has an estimate of what our spline is    I think we could entertain that idea—I’m not opposed to that  I don’t really   feel like making that decision today, given everything else we’re trying to implement, but I think   that, compared with the past, we are being very transparent in terms of how we’re distributing   our purchases across the curve, and, as I said in the briefing, in terms of giving them the prices at   which we actually accepted offers, which is something that we’ve never done in the past   November 2–3, 2010 124 of 238              Let me start by saying that I think the capacity has to do, first, with our   ability to conduct the operations and get them done and then, second, with market functioning    The market functioning side is very difficult to judge  I think what we mean by that is  Could   we be buying so much that we would be causing a deterioration of liquidity in the markets?   We   want to separate having a price impact, which, of course, is part of the objective of the program,   from liquidity conditions  So the market dysfunction we would worry about is creating too much   of a one-sided market, resulting in lower trading volumes between other parties, higher bid-asked   spreads, and so on  It’s very hard to judge where that point is  At this pace of purchases,   essentially we are taking up all of the new net issuance from Treasury for a month, because that   will average about $100 billion a month; and if we go further, we have to do more pushing of   investors out of the market  Nevertheless, on the other side, our purchases are actually still quite   small relative to the gross trading flows in the market   To sum up, I think it’s a very hard judgment to make  Looking at our own operations, we   feel that, at this pace, we’re pushing quite hard—as I said, we’re operating every day with pretty   sizable operations  The  purpose was just to say that if the Committee wanted to move more   rapidly—suppose you wanted to do $1 trillion over that window—we would have to rethink how   November 2–3, 2010 125 of 238             we operate and consider whether it can all get done in Treasuries or whether other asset classes,   such as MBS, would have to be introduced    We did write a MarketSOURCE piece a few rounds ago that addressed at   least part of your question  We’ve looked at a lot of event-study evidence in evaluating LSAPs,   and, as you pointed out at one meeting, those experiments involved not just the change in the   asset holdings, but also the concurrent change in reserves  So can we really disentangle which of   those is affecting financial conditions?  The MarketSOURCE piece compared those event studies   with event studies around the SFP  When there have been unexpected changes in the Treasury’s   SFP, it amounts to a surprise change in the level of reserves without any corresponding change in   the amount of duration risk that we’re taking out  The analysis made the point that those   surprises didn’t seem to have much effect on financial conditions  So that may be one small   piece of evidence that the effects of the LSAPs come more from the assets taken out of the   markets than from the change in reserves  To your broader question, it’s true—we could achieve   a sizable change in the duration of our holdings through a portfolio reallocation if you were   November 2–3, 2010 127 of 238             willing to sell shorter-term assets and buy longer-term assets, and you could do that without   reserve implications    We were thinking of it as related to the overall pace of purchases  It is true   that if we shifted the maturity distribution, it would give us more or less capacity—generally, if   we shorten the maturity distribution, we can probably buy more quickly  But that shortening of   duration may offset the perceived benefits of the portfolio-balance channel  So it is somewhat   dependent  I was saying that, under this type of distribution, generally, that’s a pace that we’re   comfortable running at    The approach we’ve taken here is to set out a distribution that we’ll   basically stick to over the entire period of the program  If you decided to do $1 trillion through   the end of 2011, I think the best approach would be just to tweak the distribution as we see fit   and get it in place today, and then carry it out  But it wouldn’t be the end of the world, either, if   we did this for six months and then reevaluated  So we could do it either way  For some sectors,   November 2–3, 2010 132 of 238             like the 10- to 18-year sector, the farther we go with this, the more of the available supply we   take out of the market—we’ll end up with more issues crossing the 35 percent limit, and so on    So we would want to make some modest modifications, but not dramatic ones  I don’t want to   turn that into a larger issue than it is    We discussed the pros and cons of this pretty extensively  I think we’re   comfortable conveying to the market our intentions with this amount of specificity  It does allow   markets to anticipate what we’re going to do  It allows market prices to move in advance of our   purchases even, and we see that as productive—it just pushes markets more quickly to the   outcome that will be realized from the purchases   The current procedure doesn’t give the distribution and doesn’t announce the size of our   operations, so market participants have to infer that and then infer whether that will be   maintained going forward  As a result, after a month or two of the program, under LSAP1 or   under the reinvestment program, the primary dealers have been able to figure out generally what   we intend to do, but it took two months of watching and uncertainty until they got to that point    Here we’re just going to accelerate that and let them know up front what we intend to do  The   only potential cost, in our thinking, is that it might be confusing if we have to change the   November 2–3, 2010 133 of 238             distribution, but we think we’ve guarded against that by having language in here indicating that   we retain the option to change the distribution   A potential risk relates to the individual operations  If we are announcing sizes, and if   something is going on in the market, it raises the risk of not being able to complete an operation   of that size  Right now we don’t have that issue, because we don’t tell the sizes of individual   operations, so that risk would be introduced by announcing the sizes  But we view that as a very   minimal risk—the operations have tremendous coverage to date, and if there were some unusual   strain in markets that made us worry about completing an operation, we probably would   reschedule the operation anyway    In the FAQs, we explicitly address this point and say that we will publish   schedules based only on announced policy actions and directives from the FOMC, so that, if the   directive were to change, then we would publish a new schedule  We had to be explicit about   that, obviously, to avoid signaling  There may be situations in which an FOMC meeting is   approaching and an action is widely expected, but we’ll be publishing a schedule that is out of   step with that, and we address that explicitly in the FAQs  We would just adjust our   communications accordingly as the FOMC adjusts its policy action    That’s right  The statement says, “The distribution of purchases could   change if market conditions warrant,” and we see that as general enough to encompass all of the   possibilities you discussed     That second clause, of course, tries to draw a line between Desk discretion   and FOMC discretion  If the FOMC is content taking it out, the Desk doesn’t have an issue with   that  [Laughter]  Again, it introduces just some flexibility by saying that changes will “not   significantly alter the average duration”—that gives us some room    Well, we intend to break the $110 billion per month figure into its two   components and list each in the statement  And we are making changes to the language on the   35 percent limit  We can’t quite figure out how to handle some of the suggestions—the “if   necessary” language or the “on occasion” language—because it suggests different judgment   criteria from what we actually plan to use  We’re afraid that would be confusing, so we’re trying   to soften the language that we’re using in the paragraph   1  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’ll be referring to the material entitled   “Financial Market Developments and Desk Operations”  Financial markets over the   intermeeting period have been dominated by two developments a sizable jump in   longer-term interest rates and heightened pressures on sovereign and financial debt in   European countries  Today I will discuss these two developments in turn            As shown in the upper left panel of your first exhibit, Treasury yields have risen   sharply since the November FOMC meeting  Virtually all of the increase occurred in   the real component of the yield, with break-even inflation rates moving up only   slightly  On balance, the 10-year nominal Treasury yield ended the intermeeting   period about 75 basis points higher  As shown in the chart to the right, this change in   the yield represents the largest intermeeting increase observed in recent years  The   key drivers of the increase in yields appeared to be a downward revision to market   expectations about the likely amount of Federal Reserve asset purchases, an upward   revision to the expected supply of Treasury debt as a result of the possible tax   compromise, and a reassessment of the likely path of short-term interest rates amid   greater optimism about the economic outlook   As shown in the middle left panel, the median response from the Desk’s primary   dealer survey conducted early last week indicated that the Federal Reserve’s asset   purchase program was expected to reach $850 billion (the middle column), compared   with the expectation of around $1 trillion that was priced in ahead of the November   FOMC meeting (the first column)  That downward revision in part resulted from the   considerable backlash to the asset purchase program from US politicians and foreign   officials  In addition, market participants interpreted communications from   individual FOMC members as suggesting less support for the program within the   Committee than had been assumed   Market participants scaled back their expectations even further following the   news last week that a tentative agreement had been reached on a proposal for                                                     1 The materials used by Mr Sack are appended to this transcript (appendix 1)   December 14, 2010 3 of 127             extending and expanding tax cuts  This proposal was seen by many market   participants as providing a significant boost to GDP growth in 2011 and hence as   reducing the need for additional asset purchases beyond the amount already   announced  Indeed, a follow-up survey of the primary dealers that the Desk   conducted late last week indicated that the median expectation of asset purchases had   fallen to $600 billion (the last column)  In addition, market participants believe that   the unanticipated components of the new tax agreement could add between $100 and   $300 billion to Treasury debt issuance over the next year, further increasing the   amount of Treasury debt that needs to be held by private investors  Overall, the   increase in supply appears to have boosted the term premium embedded in longer-  term yields               As noted earlier, the increase in longer-term Treasury yields has also been driven   by a reassessment of the likely path of short-term interest rates  Market participants   generally revised up their forecasts for GDP growth next year in response to the   incoming economic data and the tax proposal  Accordingly, as shown in the middle   right panel, investors brought forward the expected timing of monetary policy   tightening, with the implied policy path from federal funds and Eurodollar futures   rates now reaching 50 basis points in the first half of 2012   With these developments, the interest rate environment has changed substantially    Ahead of the November meeting, many market participants thought that the Federal   Reserve’s ongoing presence in the market and the sluggish nature of the economic   recovery would ensure a stable and low interest rate environment across the yield   curve  That view provided comfort to those establishing long positions in the market   and likely contributed to the observed decline in the term premium  However, the   downward revision in the expected size of asset purchases and the improvement in   the economic outlook have shaken that view, causing investors to adjust their   positions abruptly at a time when the approaching year-end may have limited market   liquidity  These dynamics contributed to choppy trading conditions and sizable   movements in longer-term interest rates  The anticipated volatility of longer-term   rates going forward, shown in the bottom left panel, moved up sharply, reflecting this   shift in the rate environment   The improvement in the economic outlook and the shift in LSAP expectations   also influenced broader financial conditions, as shown in the table in the bottom right   panel  Equity prices moved up further over the intermeeting period, presumably   because the more favorable economic outlook was sufficient to offset any negative   effects arising from higher interest rates  Corporate bond spreads narrowed slightly   since the last FOMC meeting, while the broad dollar index appreciated modestly  All   of these measures remain more accommodative than they were back in August, as the   sizable changes that were realized ahead of the November FOMC meeting were   sustained or only partly reversed   In addition to the movements in US rates, an important focus in financial   markets in recent weeks has been the situation in the European periphery, the subject   December 14, 2010 4 of 127             of the second exhibit  Nathan Sheets will cover many of the European developments   in detail, but I will go ahead and describe some of the related developments in   financial markets                     As you know, Ireland, the EU, and the IMF agreed to a support package for   Ireland intended to provide capital to their financial system and to cover sovereign   debt liabilities for the next two to three years  However, market attention quickly   turned to conditions in other countries, including Portugal, Spain, and Italy  The   particular situations facing these countries differ importantly, but in each case the   markets are asking the same question—whether the combination of sovereign debt   and financial sector liabilities for that country is on a sustainable track  In addition,   market participants have increasingly noted that the backstop mechanisms put in   place to date, including the European Financial Stability Facility, may prove   insufficient to address pressures in some of these countries, given the volume of their   debt outstanding   In response, sovereign debt spreads in these countries relative to German yields   moved up sharply, as shown in the upper left panel, and the CDS spreads of the   largest financial firms in those countries widened, as shown to the right  Sovereign   spreads have retraced some of their widening of late, helped in part by a faster pace of   sovereign debt purchases by the ECB in particular markets  However, debt spreads   across these countries remain elevated, and the market seems quite vulnerable to   further negative surprises   The concerns about the debt situation in these countries led to some pressure on   euro-denominated assets more broadly  European equity prices have underperformed   US share prices in recent months, as shown in the middle left panel, and the euro   depreciated sharply against the dollar, as shown to the right  In addition, option   prices suggest that market participants are now placing higher odds on the possibility   of sizable euro depreciation over the next year   An area of particular concern is the funding situation for banking firms in the   European periphery  Some of those firms already rely heavily on the ECB for euro-  denominated funding  In addition, signs are emerging that dollar-denominated   funding for those firms is becoming strained   Indeed, US money market funds are increasingly pulling back from providing   dollar funding to major financial firms in peripheral countries, similar to the pattern   that had taken place in the spring  According to a confidential survey conducted by   ICI, reported in the bottom left panel, money market funds’ holdings of Spanish bank   liabilities have declined sharply over the past month, and the holdings of Italian assets   are also now falling notably  These data are consistent with anecdotal reports about   money market funds not rolling over their exposures in these countries   Dollar funding pressures have not spread to financial firms more broadly, as   indicated by the stability of the spot LIBOR spread to OIS, shown in the bottom right   December 14, 2010 5 of 127             panel  However, European institutions that rely on currency swaps to raise dollar   funding have faced higher borrowing rates, as shown by the swap-implied rate for the   EURIBOR panel  Moreover, some market participants have argued that funding   pressures could have already spread more broadly if it were not for the presence of   the central bank liquidity swap lines that the Federal Reserve has in place with the   ECB and four other central banks  They argue that the presence of these lines serves   as an important backstop that has helped maintain the flow of dollar funding from   private sources               Before leaving this exhibit, let me discuss the proposal on the liquidity swap lines   that Nathan Sheets and I described in a memo that was circulated to the Committee   ahead of the meeting  The liquidity swap lines that are currently in place with the   European Central Bank, the Bank of Japan, the Bank of England, the Swiss National   Bank, and the Bank of Canada are scheduled to expire at the end of January  Given   the unsettled conditions in funding markets and the uncertainty about how stresses in   European financial markets could unfold, our central bank counterparties have   expressed interest in extending the liquidity swap lines   As indicated in our memo, Federal Reserve staff recommends that the Committee   approve an extension of these swap lines for six months, which would bring their   expiration date to August 1, 2011  All aspects of the swap arrangements other than   the expiration date would remain unchanged, including the expected pricing of any   dollar funding operations at 100 basis points above the OIS rate  This pricing should   ensure that funding from the lines is attractive to financial institutions only during   times of severe market stress  We will be asking for a vote on this decision after the   conclusion of my remarks  If the Committee were to vote affirmatively, the five   foreign central banks would take corresponding actions over the next several days,   and the extension could be publicly announced soon thereafter   Your final exhibit focuses on the asset purchases for the SOMA portfolio  As of   last Friday, the Desk had conducted $75 billion of purchases out of the $600 billion   expansion of the portfolio that was announced in November and an additional   $31 billion of purchases associated with the reinvestment of principal payments on   agency debt and mortgage-backed securities over the same period  The Desk’s   purchases have followed the maturity distribution shown in the upper left panel,   resulting in an average duration of 55 years for the securities obtained, as planned   The operations have gone very well  Participation by dealers has been strong,   with an average offer-to-cover ratio of nearly 4, and the distribution of securities   accepted has been fairly wide  As expected, we have purchased a decent amount of   securities that have been recently issued but that are not on-the-run issues  In   addition, we have purchased some older securities for which the 35 percent limit on   SOMA holdings would have otherwise been binding  At this point, 24 issues have   moved through that threshold, and our holdings of some of those issues are now   approaching 50 percent  The Desk intends to place additional limits on the extent to   December 14, 2010 6 of 127             which SOMA holdings of any individual security can increase above the 50 percent   threshold                  The robust pace of purchases does not appear to be causing significant strains on   the liquidity or functioning of the Treasury market  As shown to the right, trading   volume has been in its normal range  And while some other measures of liquidity,   such as the depth of market quotes, have deteriorated a bit, our judgment is that this   pattern has more to do with the approaching year-end than with our purchases    Importantly, we do not see any signs of the market facing unusual scarcity of any   particular issues, including those for which our holdings have moved through the 35   percent threshold  Indeed, the number of securities trading on special in the repo   market has remained low, as shown in the middle left panel, and there has been no   unusual activity from our securities lending facility   The next two panels focus on the pace of our purchases going forward  As shown   in the middle right panel, because the purchases did not begin until the week after the   FOMC meeting, the purchases in November fell short of the $75 billion per month   pace that would be required to reach the intended $600 billion expansion in holdings   by the end of the second quarter  Thus, the Desk will have to make up a small   amount of ground at some point during the program  For now, we have maintained   the pace of $75 billion per month, but we intend to increase the monthly pace of   purchases to about $80 billion at some point early next year, as in the potential path   shown in the chart   The bottom left panel shows our projections for the pace of purchases associated   with the reinvestment of principal payments on our agency debt and MBS holdings    Because of the recent backup in longer-term rates, we lowered our estimates of MBS   prepayments significantly  We now project that the reinvestment purchases through   the second quarter of 2011 will run at an average pace of about $27 billion per month   The final panel covers the effects of the repurchase program on the pricing of   long-term Treasury bonds  The maturity distribution of the Federal Reserve’s asset   purchases that was announced by the Desk at the time of the FOMC statement   involved a smaller allocation to bonds than expected by some market participants  As   a result, the bond sold off, even as the middle of the Treasury yield curve rallied,   steepening the slope between the 10- and 30-year Treasury yields shown in the chart    The increase in the slope was abrupt, as some market players reportedly had   established positions betting on a larger allocation to the bond and unwound them   quickly following the announcement  Over recent weeks, however, the slope has   retraced that initial reaction and has returned to levels lower than those observed   before the FOMC meeting   Lastly, I would like to make one brief note about the MBS holdings in the SOMA   portfolio  Several weeks ago, I circulated a memo to the Committee with a   recommendation for conducting CUSIP aggregation for our MBS holdings  The   Desk plans to move forward with the plan described, only on a slightly later time line   December 14, 2010 7 of 127             than presented in the memo  Our current intention is to announce this plan in early   January and to begin aggregating our holdings in the middle of that month Thank   you  That concludes my prepared remarks       Regarding margin debt, or leverage in the financial system more broadly, it   has been moving up  We continue to see the levels of that leverage as not excessive and as not   making us unusually vulnerable to a sharp correction, but we also continue to watch those   measures    Yes, that’s our judgment at this point    The distribution has tightened  Back in November we saw a considerable   range of views about the size of asset purchases, with some participants expecting very large   numbers, like $15 trillion, maybe $2 trillion  At this point, the median expectation is, as I said,   $600 billion, and there were no respondents with a reading below that  So we’ve seen the   distribution tighten up around that announced size of the program    I do think that is why  As you know, the regime we have in place doesn’t   differentiate across collateral types, by the haircut or by the rates that we accept in the   December 14, 2010 9 of 127             operations, so there is a tendency for counterparties to give us what may be seen as riskier   collateral during times of heightened market stress   This regime was set up at a time when there was not the differentiation that we see today   across different types of European debt  In looking forward, we have started a comprehensive   review of the entire framework, including the haircut schedule that we have in place, and we will   consider whether to make changes, such as graduated haircut schedules by collateral type    Having said that, our quick reading at this point is that, even with the elevated volatility that we   see in European sovereign debt, the 2 percent haircut appears adequate  Recall that this is a   haircut applied to collateral that is marked to market and updated every day, so the haircut is   only intended to cover a daily change in the value of the collateral, and it only is relevant in the   event of a counterparty default  Again, though, as you can see, other foreign official institutions   and the London Clearing House do have differentiated haircuts by collateral type and also, in   some cases, by collateral maturity, and those are some things we want to look at    Right  That’s what I’ve noted in the memo  We’re authorized to do repos   with tenors up to 36 days, but we tend to do mostly overnight, and I think the average tenor of a   repo is three days at this point    Yes    I believe we can do this assessment fairly quickly—that is, I don’t mean to   imply that there’s this huge framework review that’s going to take years to complete  We’re   actively looking at this, and, as we go down that path, if it becomes apparent that it would be   desirable to have some kind of graduated schedule, then we can go ahead and move in that   direction  It may be advantageous—we just want to do some more analysis before we move    If there’s a strong sentiment that the haircut is going to be changed, there’s   no impediment—we can change the haircuts  But without some kind of analysis or framework,   it’s hard to know whether we should change them and, if we should, change them to what  We   need to determine what an appropriate haircut is  So we need to do a bit of legwork, but I fully   appreciate the sense from your question that there’s some urgency to the issue    We certainly didn’t make changes to throw them off guard  We always try   to be careful—    We always try to be careful with the dealer survey and to keep the questions   tracked to policy issues that have been discussed in the public domain  I don’t think the   November survey was misleading or overly suggestive to them  It did get a lot of attention, but I   think that it reflected the environment in the press and in financial markets around the time of   that meeting  And this time the survey didn’t really get any additional attention   As to the point of whether $600 billion is a bad thing, we do think some of the backup in   rates has been associated with this revision to the expected size of the asset purchase program    Certainly before the November meeting, the effects we saw were quite large—a 50 basis point   decline in longer-term real interest rates  That would be very large relative to a $600 billion   asset purchase program based on the way we’ve calibrated the likely effects  I think that the   initial market reaction was larger because of the expectation of a much bigger purchase program   and the open-ended perception of it  If that expectation has been scaled down to a $600 billion   December 14, 2010 12 of 127             program, it’s not surprising that we’ve seen some backup in rates  A policy issue for the   Committee is whether that’s the right effect on rates, and whether that was the intention or not    It does appear that financial market participants revised their economic   forecast; they did so even in advance of the tax agreement  We could actually see in our primary   dealer survey that the incoming economic data had led to more optimism about near-term growth   prospects  And then the proposed tax agreement was seen as having a fairly significant effect on   December 14, 2010 13 of 127             GDP growth in 2011  I think the revision largely came from greater optimism about the   economy rather than from any messaging about the policy path from the FOMC    Either that or they sense a slightly different reaction function, one that   would be more responsive to economic growth prospects   Can I make a couple more comments about the chart, though?  First, we do think the term   premiums moved up pretty substantially  Of course, term premiums are a larger component for   longer-term yields, and they tend to get smaller as we move in on the yield curve  But it’s   possible that some of this revision, especially out in 2012, reflects term premiums, because this   chart is constructed with an assumption of a constant term premium   Second, the upward shift also reflects greater risk  As you’ve seen in the Tealbook   charts, the modal forecast is much lower than the futures path  The futures path corresponds to   the mean forecast, and, essentially at the zero bound, you just have one-sided risks  So when the   markets have less conviction, you tend to see the futures rate path jump up  One of the things   that was striking ahead of the November meeting was the extent to which the implied volatility   measures of the short-term interest rates had collapsed  The market had gotten to a point where   participants were not just seeing policy on hold into the 2012, but they were also feeling   incredibly confident about that  And I think what you see here is just less confidence about that,   even if the modal forecast still has the tightening later in 2011 or into 2012    Our discussions with them focused on the six-month horizon, and they   seemed quite comfortable with that  That doesn’t mean they would object to a longer horizon,   but we didn’t pursue that deeply    I wouldn’t think so     Right   January 25–26, 2011 10 of 282               Thank you, Mr Chairman  At its first meeting each year, the  Committee reviews the Authorization for Domestic Open Market Operations, as well  as the set of guidelines that governs foreign currency transactions   Regarding the Authorization for Domestic Open Market Operations, I recommend  that this authorization be renewed without amendment  Even though I am not  requesting any changes, I would like to update the Committee on several items related  to the domestic authorization   First, I recommend that the Committee keep suspended the Guidelines for the  Conduct of System Operations in Federal-Agency Issues, as it is unclear whether  future transactions in these securities may be necessary to achieve the Committee’s  monetary policy objectives   Second, the current authorization allows the Desk to transact in agency MBS for  the SOMA through agents, such as asset managers and custodian banks  The Federal  Reserve Bank of New York continues to evaluate the extent to which some of the  services provided by these agents could be brought in-house  However, some  external services are likely to be needed for an extended period, given the unique  features of MBS  I am thus asking that this authority be retained   Third, the Committee authorized the New York Fed, under a resolution passed on  November 24, 2009, to conduct small-scale reverse repo operations as needed to  ensure the operational readiness of that tool across all types of eligible collateral and  with a broader set of counterparties  We anticipate a need to conduct additional  small-scale operations during 2011, particularly as additional counterparties are  approved  These operations are covered under the current resolution   Let me now turn to an item that will likely come before the Committee for  authorization at a future date  In June 2009, the Committee received an informational  memo on a proposed policy to address the occurrence of daylight overdrafts in  foreign central bank accounts at the New York Fed by providing intraday liquidity  through daylight repurchase agreements, or DLRPs  We have now settled on a  proposed procedure for DLRPs, and the New York Fed hopes to obtain approval in  2011 to commence implementation under Regulation N  At that time, I will review  the proposal with the Committee and will ask it for a change in the Authorization for  Domestic Open Market Operations that would allow the New York Fed to provide  DLRPs   With regard to the authorization for foreign currency operations, the Desk  operates under the following set of guidelines from the Committee the Authorization  for Foreign Currency Operations, the Foreign Currency Directive, and the Procedural  Instructions with Respect to Foreign Currency Operations  I recommend all three be  renewed without amendment  Please note that the vote to reaffirm these documents   January 25–26, 2011 11 of 282              will include approval of the System’s warehousing agreement with the Treasury   Thank you    The intent of the policy is similar, of course, in that it’s to provide collateral   on intraday credit extended  In the course of business for regular FIMA accounts, daylight   overdrafts inevitably occur, given the volume of transactions that take place in them  The   proposed procedure essentially identifies assets that are currently held in their accounts that will   either be earmarked as collateral for these transactions or that, in some cases, could even be   moved to a separate account for those who are heavier users  Although it’s similar in intent, it’s   also a little different, because we manage these custodial accounts already, which have assets in   them, so it’s a slightly different procedure in terms of allocating that collateral for this purpose   2  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’ll be referring to the materials labeled  “Financial Market Developments and Desk Operations”  Over the intermeeting  period, financial markets continued to develop in a manner that reflected an  improving economic outlook and that, in turn, should provide support to economic  growth   As shown in the upper left panel of your first exhibit, Treasury yields largely  leveled out following their sharp increases in the last two months of 2010  On  balance over the intermeeting period, Treasury coupon yields moved up 5 to 15 basis  points, with the 10-year yield now trading around 34 percent   With yields having stabilized to some degree, it may be a good time to look back  and assess why yields moved up so sharply in the period following the November  FOMC meeting  To a large extent, the sharp selloff in Treasury securities over that  period was driven by greater optimism among investors about economic growth  prospects and the anticipated policy response from the Federal Reserve in terms of  both short-term interest rates and its balance sheet   As shown to the right, investors brought forward the expected timing of increases  in short-term interest rates, with the implied policy path from federal funds and  Eurodollar futures rates now approaching 50 basis points in the first quarter of 2012                                                      2 The materials used by Mr Sack are appended to this transcript (appendix 2)   January 25–26, 2011 49 of 282              Although the Desk’s survey of primary dealers indicates that they see the first rate  hike as most likely to occur later in 2012, investors apparently see enough risk of  earlier tightening actions to pull up the futures curve significantly by the first quarter  of next year   At the same time, market participants have reduced their expectations for the  cumulative size of the Federal Reserve’s asset purchase program  As shown in the  middle left panel, the primary dealer survey suggests that expectations have solidified  around $600 billion for the size of the program  According to the survey, no dealers  expect the program to stop short of that amount, and only five dealers expect the  program to extend beyond it   These two developments—the shift in short rate expectations and the scaling  down of expected asset purchases—were cited by the primary dealers in the Desk’s  survey as the most important factors lifting Treasury yields over the past three  months  Our own empirical modeling suggests that these two factors explain a  substantial amount of the increase in yields but not the full magnitude of the increase   Another potential factor is that the term premium may have simply reached levels  that were lower than could be justified, even taking into account the effects of the  asset purchases, in which case some upward adjustment was inevitable  Indeed, as  shown to the right, the Kim–Wright model estimated by the Board staff suggests that  the term premium at the 10-year maturity point had moved below zero and that the  recent selloff has returned it to within its historical range   The rise in longer-term yields did not seem to reflect unusual concerns about  inflation prospects  Indeed, market participants generally believe that the expected  paths of short-term interest rates and the balance sheet will deliver inflation outcomes  that are consistent with the FOMC’s objectives  As shown in the bottom left panel,  the five-year, five-year forward breakeven inflation rate moved modestly lower over  the intermeeting period, remaining at levels consistent with moderate inflation over  the longer term  The five-year breakeven inflation rate instead continued its upward  trend over the intermeeting period, as further increases in energy prices and a stronger  cyclical recovery are expected to pull inflation up from its relatively low level   Before leaving this exhibit, let me highlight one other risk that has come into  focus in the Treasury market, which is the statutory debt ceiling  As shown to the  right, without any changes to the Treasury’s Supplementary Financing Program, the  debt ceiling would be projected to become binding by mid-March, as indicated by the  light blue line  To provide it with additional room under the ceiling, the Treasury  plans to announce on Thursday its intention to reduce the balance of its  Supplementary Financing Account from $200 billion to $5 billion, which it will  achieve by allowing nearly all of the bills that fund this account to mature without  replacement beginning in early February  With that adjustment, the projected point at  which the debt ceiling will be reached moves back to mid-April, as shown by the  dotted line  Of course, the Treasury has a set of other tools that it can employ, which  by our estimates would push back the timing of hitting the debt ceiling until late June   January 25–26, 2011 50 of 282              Your next exhibit focuses on recent developments in US asset markets more  broadly  Equity markets continued to advance at a robust pace, with the S&P 500  index gaining another 3½ percent over the intermeeting period  The equity market  has been buoyed by improving prospects for economic growth and continued strength  in corporate earnings  As shown to the right, the S&P 500 index has now gained  more than 20 percent over the past five months—a pace that has only been matched  on a few occasions over the past 15 years  Despite these gains, the staff is not  unusually concerned about valuations in the equity market, largely because this rally  began from a point at which valuations, by many measures, looked relatively cheap   Nellie Liang will go through some of the staff’s measures in detail in her portion of  the chart show   Corporate bonds also advanced notably, with yield spreads narrowing for  investment-grade and high-yield issues, as shown in the middle left panel  This  advance was driven in large part by the same factors supporting equity prices  In this  case, however, some valuation measures are starting to look stretched, and sizable  further gains from this point might be cause for concern  Corporate bond issuance  remained robust over the intermeeting period, as it picked up following its usual lull  at year-end   Investors also showed increased appetite for other fixed-income instruments,  including a range of securitized credit products  As shown to the right, spreads on  commercial mortgage-backed securities narrowed significantly, and a decent pipeline  of CMBS issuance is lined up for the first quarter  Private-label residential mortgage- backed securities also experienced better pricing in recent months as well as some  improvement in liquidity, but of course this market remains inactive in terms of  funding new issuance  Investor demand for consumer-related ABS was also strong,  with the yield spreads on those instruments, the blue line in the panel, remaining at  low levels  Lastly, investors continued to show increased appetite for syndicated  loans, and the terms of such deals have loosened modestly   While investors are seeking additional return by moving into these asset classes,  this shift does not appear to be accompanied by the leverage trends that occurred  during the credit boom, as reviewed in the financial stability memos circulated to the  FOMC ahead of the meeting   Despite the better sentiment about US growth prospects, the dollar depreciated  against most currencies  The decline in the dollar in part reflected the fact that  foreign growth prospects also improved notably and that investors were shifting into  riskier assets  In addition, the euro received a boost against the dollar from an  improvement in investor sentiment in response to the successful rollover of  government debt by some peripheral European countries and the anticipation of a  more comprehensive policy mechanism for achieving stability  The improved  sentiment resulted in some easing of the pressures on dollar funding for European  financial institutions  Indeed, as shown to the right, the dollar funding rate that can be  achieved through FX swaps declined notably   January 25–26, 2011 51 of 282              Overall, financial markets have been incorporating an increasingly optimistic  outlook for the economy  However, it should be noted that a number of significant  risks remain  The primary risks recognized among investors today include the  ongoing stresses in the euro area, the concerns about credit risk in the US municipal  bond market, the prospective policy responses in emerging market economies— notably China—to rising inflation and heavy capital inflows, and the range of  regulatory and financial uncertainties facing the US financial sector  Many aspects  of these risks will be covered by Nellie Liang and Steve Kamin in their presentations   Your third exhibit summarizes recent Desk operations and market expectations  for future balance sheet actions  As of last Friday, the Desk had conducted  $236 billion of purchases of Treasury securities since the schedule released after the  November FOMC meeting  That total includes $167 billion of the $600 billion  expansion of the portfolio that was announced in November, and $69 billion  associated with the reinvestment of principal payments on agency debt and mortgage- backed securities  As planned, the maturity distribution of the Desk’s purchases,  shown in the upper left panel, has resulted in an average duration of about 5½ years  for the securities obtained   The operations continue to go well  Dealer participation has remained robust, and  we have purchased a fairly wide range of securities  In several recent operations,  though, we have ended up purchasing larger amounts of on-the-run issues, which  could be a sign that dealers are beginning to find it more challenging to source off- the-run issues to offer to us   We continue to feel that our purchases are not causing significant strains on the  liquidity or functioning of the Treasury market  The deterioration in market liquidity  that was seen late last year, evidenced by the decline in the depth of market quotes  shown to the right, turned out to be a year-end phenomenon, as we had expected   Quote depth has moved back towards its previous levels, and other measures, such as  trading volume or bid-asked spreads, suggest that market liquidity remains decent   Going forward, under the current directive from the FOMC, the Desk intends to  continue purchasing at a pace that will expand our security holdings by about  $80 billion per month  The overall pace of purchases will also incorporate  reinvestment flows, projections of which are shown in the middle left panel  We now  expect those reinvestments to be somewhat slower than previously expected because  of the effects of the backup in interest rates on MBS prepayments   In terms of other operational efforts of the Desk, I should note that CUSIP  aggregation of our MBS holdings has gotten under way  So far, we have finished  exactly one aggregation—CUSIP number 31419A3T2—which combined 47 of the  CUSIPs we hold  Because we are consolidating about 30,000 CUSIPs in total, we  still have a ways to go, but at least the first one worked without a glitch   The final three panels of the exhibit present some results from based on the  Desk’s primary dealer survey on how policymakers are expected to manage the   January 25–26, 2011 52 of 282              Federal Reserve’s balance sheet going forward  As shown in the middle right panel,  market participants expect the FOMC to gradually shrink the SOMA portfolio over  time  The median respondent thought that the size of the portfolio would begin to  move down slightly in 2012 and would then decline by about $1 trillion over the  subsequent three years, bringing it to just under $1½ trillion by the end of 2015   While there was a range of responses around that path, all of them showed a gradual  decline   To achieve that gradual decline, market participants thought that the FOMC was  likely to employ some combination of redemptions and asset sales  The bottom left  panel shows the probabilities assigned to halting reinvestments of principal payments  in each of the asset classes  As can be seen, the odds assigned to halting  reinvestments within the next two years were sizable  The interquartile range of the  responses (shown by the light blue bar) ranged from roughly 50 to 90 percent for  agency debt and MBS, with a median response (shown by the tick mark) at around  75 percent  The range of responses for Treasury securities was much wider but also  reached quite high levels  In all cases, the perceived probabilities were considerably  higher for the five-year horizon   Respondents were asked the same question about the likelihood of asset sales for  each type of security  As shown to the right, the perceived odds of asset sales  occurring within the next two years were much lower, with the median respondent  seeing only about a 20 percent chance of sales for each asset class  Over the five-year  horizon, though, the chances of asset sales were seen as much more substantial   Interestingly, the odds placed on selling Treasury securities were generally higher  than the odds of selling mortgage-backed securities   Your final exhibit presents a brief summary of the staff’s forecast for Federal  Reserve income and its assessment of the risks surrounding that forecast, drawing on  the memo that was circulated to the Committee last week   To project the income from the SOMA portfolio, the staff had to make  assumptions about how the portfolio would be managed and how market interest rates  would evolve  For the portfolio, the baseline projection follows the Tealbook  assumption that the FOMC completes the $600 billion in purchases and does not  begin redeeming maturing securities or selling assets until 2013  Accordingly, as  shown in the upper left panel, the size of the SOMA portfolio levels out at  $26 trillion until early 2013  At that time, the FOMC is assumed to begin redeeming  maturing holdings of all asset types and then, later that year, to begin a process of  gradually selling its MBS holdings over five years  Under those assumptions, the size  of the portfolio begins to decline and returns all the way to its steady-state level by  2016  At that point, the Federal Reserve begins to purchase Treasury securities in  enough size to offset the reduction in agency debt and MBS and to increase the  portfolio as needed to meet currency demand   The panel to the right shows the interest rate assumptions under the baseline  scenario  The federal funds rate is assumed to begin increasing in March 2013 and to   January 25–26, 2011 53 of 282              rise about 400 basis points over the subsequent three years  The 10-year Treasury  yield instead begins to rise immediately and moves up by a considerable amount,  reaching about 5 percent by the end of 2014  In the long run, the yield curve settles  down with the federal funds rate at around 4½ percent and the 10-year yield at around  5¼ percent   The baseline results for the income from the SOMA portfolio are shown in the  middle left panel  This chart shows the total net income from the portfolio as the red  line, and the major components of that income as the bars  As can be seen, net  income from the SOMA portfolio remains elevated through 2013, driven primarily by  the coupon income generated by the size of the portfolio  SOMA income then falls  notably through 2016 as a result of several factors  First, coupon income (the dark  blue bars) begins to decline as the size of the portfolio shrinks  Second, the funding  cost of the portfolio, which is essentially the interest paid on the reserves created (the  light blue bars) begins to increase as short-term interest rates rise  Note that this cost  peaks in 2014 and begins to decline thereafter, even though short-term interest rates  continue to rise, because the amount of reserves in the system is declining  And third,  the SOMA realizes capital losses (the green bars) on the securities that it begins  selling  Once we get past 2016, the coupon payments from the portfolio begin to lift  total net income, even though capital losses continue to be realized through 2018   The total net portfolio income is repeated in the panel to the right, only now  expressed as a range to reflect the alternative modeling methods used in the memo   To translate this portfolio income into remittances to Treasury, we have to adjust it  for other sources of income, operating expenses, dividends, and additions to capital   The path of Treasury remittances associated with this baseline scenario is shown in  the chart  As can be seen, even at their lowest point, remittances to Treasury are  projected to remain sizable, at over $25 billion  That trough is comparable with the  average level of annual remittances over the 10 years preceding the balance sheet  expansion   Thus, the expected path of Federal Reserve income and remittances to the  Treasury are favorable under the baseline scenario  In fact, asset purchases turn out  to be quite profitable in that case, adding about $70 billion to Federal Reserve income  over the 10-year period shown  Nevertheless, there are considerable risks to the path  of Federal Reserve income   The bottom left panel focuses on the effects of higher interest rates  As described  in detail in the memo, we consider an alternative scenario in which the federal funds  rate begins to rise in June of this year and follows a path that is roughly 200 basis  points higher than the baseline scenario  The 10-year Treasury yield accordingly  rises more quickly, moving roughly 100 to 150 basis points above the baseline over  the next several years  As can be seen in the bottom left panel, remittances to the  Treasury in this scenario fall to near zero  The downward pressure on income results  from higher funding costs for the portfolio and larger capital losses on the assets sold   January 25–26, 2011 54 of 282              The bottom right panel focuses on the effects of faster asset sales  The scenario  assumed in the memo involves selling all of our MBS holdings over an 18-month  window instead of the 5-year window in the Tealbook baseline  This policy approach  would be aggressive, as it would necessitate MBS sales at an average pace of about  $40 billion per month  The resulting increase in the supply of securities to the market  is roughly equal to the average pace of net issuance of agency MBS generated by the  entire market at the height of the housing boom  The more aggressive sales, if begun  at the same time as in the baseline scenario, would return the size of the SOMA  portfolio to its steady-state level about a year earlier than in the baseline scenario   Treasury remittances under the more aggressive sales scenario decline more  quickly, as shown by the red line  The primary reason is that selling more quickly  compresses the capital losses that would be realized over five years into a shorter  period  As a result, remittances to Treasury suffer sharply in those years, but are then  higher in the latter parts of the forecast period  Under the specific assumptions made  in this scenario, remittances remain positive   Not surprisingly, the most significant effects on Federal Reserve income occur if  faster MBS sales were to take place under a scenario of high interest rates  In that  case, the capital losses are larger and, hence, compressing them into a shorter period  can easily push Treasury remittances to zero  In the memo, we presented an income  projection under the high interest rate path described earlier and asset sales that are as  fast as the one just described but that are accelerated to begin this year  Under those  assumptions, as shown by the light blue area, remittances to Treasury fall to zero for a  period of two years, and a deferred credit asset of between $5 and $35 billion would  be realized on the balance sheet   In closing, it should be noted that there is a wide range of possible outcomes for  Federal Reserve income, as markets and policy decisions can evolve in a number of  directions that can differ from the scenarios presented in the memo  Our intention is  to provide you with a few potential outcomes to serve as useful reference points   Thank you  That concludes my prepared remarks    Right  The current balance is $200 billion    In the income projections?  Yes   January 25–26, 2011 55 of 282               It would have a modest effect on the funding cost of the portfolio, because   that balance would reduce the amount of reserves in the system by that amount  We assume it   does run down  And does it return?    First of all, the concentration of our holdings isn’t quite as high as you   suggested  Our highest holdings right now are at 60 percent, and, under the new thresholds that   January 25–26, 2011 56 of 282              the Desk published, we will only move up in 1 percent increments per operation, so that will   slow how quickly we move up  We have two issues at 60 percent and two others that are above   50 percent  If we look at our top ten holdings in terms of concentration, all of them are old   bonds except one, so, certainly, that’s the group for which this is relevant  The maturities of   those holdings range from 2015 to 2020, so it’s mostly in that 5- to 10-year sector  But it’s not   overly concentrated in any particular year    “Old” means “issued a long time ago,” so that they’re carrying a high   coupon  They tend to be less liquid and less desirable to market participants, which makes them   appear cheap in our relative value analysis, so the method we use inclines us to purchase those    I’ll take it  [Laughter]  Of course, we presented an analysis of the risks on   several occasions along the way, but it is true that we now have the machinery in place to do a   much more comprehensive analysis of a wider range of scenarios    First of all, if we believe that the balance sheet has had effects on financial   conditions, then the primary consideration for you in how to manage the balance sheet and   whether to sell assets would be the effects on financial conditions and the economy  In terms of   income effects, selling assets can concentrate returns  It’s possible that, say, long rates would   move up, but they do so because of greater optimism about the economy and an expected higher   path of short-term interest rates  In that sense, the higher rates, or the capital losses that would   be realized by selling assets, are essentially just the present value of the future costs that the   portfolio would face  So, to a large extent, the asset sales are just reallocating the timing of when   losses are realized, which is probably another reason not to make that income stream the primary   objective    That’s exactly right  You are giving up a term premium, and you can see   that in the projections  In fact, we did a scenario, which wasn’t reported in the memo, where   there were no asset sales, and the total effect on income over ten years was on the order of   $100 to $125 billion  So there’s a sense that because of a term premium we’re earning an excess   return  And if we sell assets and shrink that, we’re giving up some expected income  In   addition, we’re affecting the timing of when it’s realized   January 25–26, 2011 59 of 282               That was an official accounting change, and, in effect, that deferred credit   essentially allows us to use future SOMA earnings to offset losses today  There is no precedent   in the US, because it’s a new treatment    Let me note a couple of points  First, we do report the market value of the   portfolio on a quarterly basis, so the amount of unrealized gains or losses would be apparent to   the market and, indeed, is already apparent to the market, regardless of what sales regime we’re   in  Second, I think it’s very important for markets to understand the message that these income   January 25–26, 2011 60 of 282              streams and these losses, whether realized or unrealized, have no operational consequences for   the conduct of monetary policy  They don’t compromise our ability to tighten financial   conditions or do whatever other operations we need to  If that message is understood, it’s not   clear to me that this results in any significant credibility problem for the Federal Reserve    Yes, that’s exactly correct  I was ignoring that for the purposes of   simplifying the discussion  It affects the value of our collateral that we can use to drain reserves   through reverse repurchase operations  But the value of the collateral would have to fall   dramatically, given that we have more than $700 billion of currency out there  Also, of course,   we can drain without collateral by using the Term Deposit Facility    You’re right about the income effects, but, given the level of short-term   interest rates, that’s trivial today    That’s correct  And in terms of affecting our draining, if the SFP balance   goes down to $5 billion, then $195 billion of reserves will enter the system for that reason   between early February and early April  If the SFP balance were not taken back up at some   point, then that would increase draining needs by that amount  I will note that the Treasury   intends to emphasize the flexibility with this program in its statement  The last time the debt   ceiling became binding, the program was taken down to $5 billion, but then, once the debt   ceiling was raised, it was brought back up  I don’t think we want to prejudge what’s going to   happen, because it will depend importantly on how the debt ceiling is raised, but the Treasury is   at least retaining that flexibility and could bring the program back up in size    That was, for me, one of the more surprising aspects of the survey results,   and, unfortunately, we didn’t ask any questions that would allow us to understand that result   better  In some of the written comments, though, a few members noted that Treasuries were   easier to sell and would be less disruptive to the market, so, for at least a couple of respondents,   that seemed to be the reasoning  But we could explore that in more detail, and I agree with you   that it was surprising    Well, in general, I think it’s appropriate  If and as the Committee moves   towards a well-defined strategy, that could be communicated at some point to allow markets to   prepare and adjust    Can I just say a word?  We believe that the survey does not reveal   information to the respondents, and we try to be very careful to construct it so that it does not    But public release is still an issue, in that doing it would eliminate any perception of asymmetric   information    Let me say a few things about what’s been going on with the TGA and then   say a couple of things about what I think it means for policy implementation  You’re right that   the TGA has been unusually large and very variable—it has been swinging between $10 billion   and $100 billion, which is very different from the old regime, where it was very steady at a low   level, like $5 billion  The reason is that the Treasury used to use its accounts in the private   sector, the TT&L and TIO accounts, to absorb those fluctuations in its cash balance because it   could get a higher return  That return is tied to short-term interest rates  With short-term interest   rates having moved to near zero, and given that those programs have some operational costs,   they’ve taken those programs down to a very trivial level, and they’re just letting the cash   balances in our account fluctuate   In terms of policy implications, we don’t regard that as a problem, given our current   directive, which is to manage reserve conditions consistent with a funds rate from zero to 25   basis point  We have so many reserves in the system it doesn’t matter much if they’re   fluctuating by $100 billion because of this factor  But, as we move into a regime where it   becomes more important to manage reserves more precisely—for example, that might be the   case when short-term interest rates begin to rise—then we’ll have to come to a solution  Of   course, if short-term interest rates are rising, it will be very natural for Treasury to start to move   funds back to the banks, and we’ll see a return towards the old regime, but, depending on the   exact timing and the exact directive we’re given, we could come back to this issue with Treasury   January 25–26, 2011 66 of 282               I have a very brief one  I want to correct a figure that I cited in my answer   to Vice Chairman Dudley  I had said that an alternative scenario without asset sales could raise   cumulative portfolio income by $100 billion to $125 billion  Unfortunately I was looking at the   wrong column  The effect relative to the baseline was actually $50 billion  So the point is right   that asset sales can reduce cumulative expected income, but I overstated the magnitude    The Desk wasn’t advocating putting $80 billion in the statement  We’ve   already moved to a purchase pace of $80 billion, and we’ve explained in our FAQs how to   reconcile that with the FOMC statement  I don’t think it has caused any confusion among   market participants   January 25–26, 2011 187 of 282               I just think it’s not necessary    I just wanted to make it clear that the reason we’re in this situation is not   that we haven’t been keeping pace  It’s because the program didn’t start on November 1, but the   “about $75” was calculated as if it did start November 1     We thought “about” gave us enough flexibility   1  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Investors generally read the incoming  economic data over the intermeeting period as somewhat better than expected   However, the escalation of political turmoil in the Middle East and North Africa  (MENA) and, more recently, the devastating earthquake and tsunami in northeastern  Japan weighed on market sentiment, leaving many asset prices relatively unchanged  since the last FOMC meeting                                                     1 The materials used by Mr Sack are appended to this transcript (appendix 1)   March 15, 2011 3 of 165              As shown in the upper-left panel of your first exhibit, the spread of political  unrest across the MENA region resulted in a sizable spike in oil prices, as investors  reacted to the disruption to oil supply from the region  Oil prices ended the period  more than 15 percent higher than they were at the time of the last FOMC meeting   Nathan Sheets will provide a more detailed discussion of these developments; I will  instead concentrate on their implications for US interest rates and asset prices     The primary effect of these events on US asset prices has been to raise concerns  about growth prospects  Indeed, on the days of the five largest increases in oil prices  over the intermeeting period, which were all associated with key geopolitical  developments, equity prices fell a cumulative 4 percent, and the 10-year Treasury  yield declined nearly 15 basis points    However, the concerns about economic growth arising from higher energy prices  were counterbalanced by the incoming economic data over the intermeeting period   As noted earlier, economic data releases have generally come in stronger than  investors’ expectations, as suggested by the economic news index shown to the right   On balance, the combination of energy price developments and the incoming data  appears to have left investors’ views on US growth prospects about unchanged   Given that assessment, there was little revision to the expected path of the federal  funds rate, as shown in the middle-left panel  At shorter horizons, these expectations  appear firmly anchored by the “extended period” language in the FOMC statement   Moreover, the Chairman’s semiannual monetary policy testimony and speeches by  other FOMC members were read by market participants as emphasizing a  commitment to the current stance of monetary policy, further anchoring expectations  at those horizons  At longer horizons, policy expectations have been responsive to  incoming information but ended the intermeeting period only slightly higher   The small upward shift in policy expectations at longer horizons showed through  to changes in Treasury yields  As shown in the middle-right panel, Treasury coupon  yields ended the period modestly higher than their levels at the time of the last FOMC  meeting   Of course, the recent surge in energy prices also has consequences for the  inflation outlook priced into financial markets  This surge is taking place against the  backdrop of the significant gains in broader commodity prices that has occurred since  last summer  Accordingly, it may be particularly important at this time to monitor  measures of inflation expectations   As shown in the bottom-left panel, the five-year breakeven inflation rate derived  from TIPS rose sharply over the intermeeting period, extending the strong upward  trend that has been in place since last August  This trend reflects an upward revision  to the intermediate-term inflation outlook that has been driven by growing confidence  in a cyclical recovery, evidence that core inflation rates have bottomed out, and the  substantial rise in energy and food prices   March 15, 2011 4 of 165              In contrast, the five-year, five-year forward breakeven inflation rate has stabilized  in recent months at levels that are within its historical range  Thus, according to this  measure, the factors that are boosting the inflation outlook over the intermediate term  are not leading to significant longer-run inflation concerns among investors  Surveys  of market participants also do not show a significant shift in perceptions of longer- term inflation, though the most recent survey reading of inflation expectations among  households showed an unexpected increase, as Dave Stockton will discuss   The panel to the right takes a closer look at the intermeeting increase in the five- year breakeven inflation rate by decomposing it into the changes in the implied one- year breakeven inflation rates at various horizons  As can be seen, the increase in the  five-year rate was driven primarily by a very steep rise in the breakeven inflation rate  over the next year  This increase in large part reflects the direct effects of higher food  and energy prices on headline CPI  In contrast, the rise in breakeven inflation rates at  horizons several years ahead has been limited, suggesting that little of the anticipated  spike in headline inflation is expected to pass through to inflation over the  intermediate term   The effects from energy prices and economic data were also apparent in other  asset prices—the subject of your second exhibit  Broad equity indexes finished the  intermeeting period about flat, on balance, despite several downdrafts associated with  developments in the MENA region  In recent days, the market has also had to digest  the news of the earthquake and tsunami in northeastern Japan and the resulting  problems at their nuclear plants  Those events initially resulted in only a modest  pullback from risk in US financial markets, but, unfortunately, the situation in Japan  has continued to deteriorate  A further response in US financial markets is expected  today following the dramatic plunge in Japanese share prices that occurred overnight   Overall, the developments in the Middle East and Japan have left investors with a  perception of greater downside risks to the outlook   Of course, the broader story in equity markets has been the robust rally since last  August, with the S&P index having gained about 25 percent over that period  The  staff continues to believe that this rally was reasonable from the perspective of the  fundamentals  In particular, the increase in share prices has been driven by a revision  to expected earnings growth as economic prospects have improved  While the  increase has also been supported by a decline in the equity risk premium, the staff’s  measure of this premium still remains sizable, as shown to the right   The more favorable sentiment towards risk since last August has also been  reflected in credit markets, but the story in this area is somewhat more complicated   As reviewed in the staff memo on asset valuations, some developments in credit  markets bear watching at this point   The areas that are drawing the most attention in this regard are the corporate bond  and leveraged loan markets  Pricing in these two markets has become more  aggressive, as shown in the middle-left panel, and the terms of many transactions  have loosened, as investors become more willing to assume risk  Nevertheless, most   March 15, 2011 5 of 165              valuation models indicate that pricing is not excessive at this point, and the terms of  most deals are still closer to those seen in the first half of the 2000s than those of the  bubble years  In any case, we will continue to watch these markets closely, as there is  now less room for the current trends to continue before we reach a worrisome point   Another credit market segment that has attracted some attention is commercial  mortgage-backed securities  Sentiment towards this sector has improved further over  the past several months  This shift is reflected in the ongoing narrowing of credit  spreads on these securities and the pickup in the flow of new CMBS deals  As shown  to the right, most dealers expect issuance to reach about $40 billion this year   Moreover, anecdotal evidence suggests that many investment banks are investing in  their CMBS desks—a further indication that they expect activity to continue to  improve  While some observers have raised concerns about whether the pricing and  terms of new deals are already getting too aggressive, most see this trend as  appropriate and the asset class as still modestly cheap   Overall, the staff’s assessment is that conditions in credit markets, while more  aggressive in some areas, are not obviously out of line with fundamentals or historical  norms  To a large extent, loosening credit conditions have been driven by investors’  assessment that the prospects for economic growth are improving   In foreign exchange markets, the dollar continued to weaken against other major  currencies over the intermeeting period, as shown in the bottom-left panel  This  move in part reflects that monetary policy prospects in several advanced economies  have shifted more aggressively in the direction of tightening than those in the United  States  Indeed, the market now believes that an increase in the policy rate by the ECB  is imminent and that the Bank of England will follow suit soon thereafter  Reflecting  those expectations, two-year sovereign yields in those countries have moved up to a  greater extent than domestic Treasury yields in recent months, as shown to the right   For the ECB, the shift in the policy outlook has taken place despite ongoing strains in  peripheral countries  The announcement over the past weekend of pending changes  to the European Financial Stability Facility prompted some narrowing of peripheral  sovereign debt spreads, but they still remain quite wide   Your third exhibit turns to monetary policy operations  As of last Friday, the  Desk had completed $310 billion of the $600 billion of intended asset purchases  announced in the November FOMC statement, bringing the total amount of domestic  assets held in the SOMA to $23 trillion, as shown in the upper-left panel  Our  purchases for portfolio expansion are currently running at a pace of $80 billion per  month, which puts our asset holdings on a straight trajectory to around $26 trillion by  the end of June  In addition, the Desk continues to conduct purchases associated with  the reinvestment of principal payments on our holdings of agency debt and mortgage- backed securities  Those reinvestments will total about $22 billion over the next  month, but we expect them to decline in subsequent months   The monthly flow of total purchases from the program is shown in the upper-right  panel  The figure also includes the projection of purchases through September under   March 15, 2011 6 of 165              the assumption that the $600 billion of intended purchases is completed by June and  that reinvestments continue thereafter  As can be seen, this approach will produce an  abrupt decline in the pace of purchases beginning in July   Given that prospect, an issue that has been widely discussed in financial markets  in recent weeks is whether the FOMC will taper its asset purchases as the end of the  program approaches  A tapering strategy was employed in the earlier round of asset  purchases, with Treasury purchases slowed over a two-month period ending in  October 2009 and MBS purchases slowed over a six-month period ending in March  2010   One of the reasons behind the decision to taper purchases during the earlier  programs was to allow the markets to transition smoothly to our absence  At that  time, we faced greater uncertainty about whether the stock or flow of our purchases  drove the effects on market pricing, and hence there was some concern that abruptly  ending the flow of our purchases could cause the yields on those assets to move up  sharply  However, the experience from that period gave us greater confidence in the  stock-based view of the program’s effects  Indeed, even as the flow of MBS  purchases was brought to zero over the tapering period, the pricing of MBS relative to  Treasury securities did not change much, as shown by the yield spread in the middle- left panel  This pattern suggests that the Treasury purchases in the current program  could end fairly sharply without causing a significant rise in Treasury yields, as long  as the expected stock of our holdings remains steady   Another reason to expect flow effects to be limited is the depth and liquidity of  the Treasury market  The Treasury market continues to see a considerable amount of  trading activity, as shown in the middle-right panel, and other measures of market  liquidity look decent  In general, our purchases have not dominated market activity  to the extent that our MBS purchases did, and hence it should be less challenging for  the market to adjust as our purchases step down   Overall, these considerations give us greater confidence that the FOMC can  reduce its purchases quickly without causing a significant increase in the term  premium or a notable worsening of market functioning  Market participants appear to  have reached the same conclusion, as they generally do not expect the FOMC to taper  its purchases  Indeed, in the primary dealer survey conducted by the Desk, 16 of the  20 dealers indicated that they expect the FOMC to complete the $600 billion in  purchases at the end of June, suggesting that they do not expect any tapering   Last, I wanted to provide a brief update on the outlook for net income from the  SOMA portfolio  This income will be the primary driver of the pattern of remittances  to the Treasury from the Federal Reserve, although remittances will also be  determined by other sources of income, operating expenses, dividends, and additions  to capital   The bottom-left panel shows the projection of SOMA net income based on the  policy assumptions from the March Tealbook  This projection has the pattern   March 15, 2011 7 of 165              described at the last FOMC meeting  Income remains very elevated for the next two  years, falls to a trough that is roughly in line with historical norms, and then increases  once the portfolio begins to expand again  However, the current income projection is  slightly below the path from the last FOMC meeting, reflecting the earlier timing  assumed for increases in short-term interest rates and for decreases in the size of the  balance sheet   We also thought it would be useful to report on what the SOMA income path  would have been under a counterfactual assumption that none of the asset purchase  programs ever took place  Just to be clear to President Plosser and others—this is not  a possible policy choice at this time  [Laughter]  This exercise is, instead, a  conceptual one conducted to help us arrive at a measure of the total effect of all of the  programs on SOMA income   Defining an appropriate counterfactual path for this exercise is challenging, and  doing so requires a set of assumptions, which we have refined since the last FOMC  meeting  Our approach is to assume that the balance sheet grew primarily as a  function of the expansion of currency and capital since 2007 and that the procedures  for adjusting the balance sheet that were in place before the crisis were maintained   In addition, we assume that interest rates followed the same path as in the baseline  projections over this period  This latter assumption is a useful simplification, but it is  likely to bias the counterfactual income estimates down slightly, since the purchase  programs reduced the yields at which longer-term Treasury securities would have  been obtained over time in the counterfactual portfolio   The counterfactual path of SOMA net income derived under those assumptions is  shown by the red dashed line in the bottom-right panel  The effects of the asset  purchases on SOMA income can be measured by the difference between that path and  the baseline projection (the blue line)  As can be seen, the asset purchase programs  are projected to boost SOMA net income substantially from 2009 to 2014, reflecting  the additional coupon income from the acquired assets  By 2015, the relative income  paths cross, as income in the baseline path is weighed down by the higher interest  payments on excess reserves and the capital losses on asset sales—factors that are  absent in the counterfactual path  Nevertheless, the amount by which the asset  purchase programs reduce income in 2015 and beyond is much smaller than the  increase in income through 2014, leaving the cumulative difference in the income  paths positive and sizable   Of course, other assumptions for the path of interest rates or the management of  the balance sheet could produce substantially different results  The uncertainty  surrounding these projections is considerable, as was discussed in the memo for the  last FOMC meeting  Thank you, Mr Chairman    Right  It’s based on current dividends, a projection of dividend growth that   comes from analysts, and market interest rates    No  This uses a forward-looking measure of earnings from analysts’   expectations  This is the Board staff’s measure that appears in the Tealbook and elsewhere    Even in the previous round of asset purchases we weren’t convinced that   tapering was necessary, but it seemed like a prudent risk-management strategy  To the extent   that there are flow effects, this would essentially space them out gradually over a period of time   As I said, at that time we thought most of the effects came from the stock, and what   we’ve learned looking back on that program gives us even greater confidence in the stock view    We also feel that we are pushing much less dramatically on the Treasury market than we were on   the mortgage-backed securities market  At one point we owned something on the order of   80 percent of the total outstanding stock of the current coupon that we were buying in MBS  In   Treasuries, looking across all coupons, we own less than 20 percent today  Given our smaller   presence relative to the market and the liquidity of the market, we think we can back away   without much or any market impact   Of course, you can make the same argument you made back then  If there were no costs   to tapering, then introducing some schedule of tapering could minimize any risks that are left,   even if we think they are small  But that would be a decision for the Committee about whether it   saw any costs to tapering that would outweigh that  I would argue that there is perhaps a very   small benefit to tapering, just for insurance, but it’s very marginal in our view    It depends on which set of economists you’re talking about, because   economists are also involved in responding to the dealer survey  So at least this set of   economists who are watching these issues carefully took the view that we’re not likely to taper   March 15, 2011 10 of 165               We are certainly not against receiving input from the FOMC    I see  There may be some consequences about whether it then officially   becomes FOMC material; there may be some issues we need to think through    In this survey, we were able to make this inference about tapering without   adding an additional question because we already had a question about the size and duration of   the Treasury program  To preview what could happen for the next meeting, I think we do intend   to ask more extensive questions about exit strategy, very similar to what we did in early 2010    At that time, we got a very complete reading of their expectations of exit strategy, and I think we   would like to update that for the April meeting    Well, I’ll just repeat that I think there is perhaps a marginal benefit to   tapering to provide insurance against a market outcome, even if we don’t expect it  But our   judgment is that it’s a fairly marginal benefit at this point    I don’t have a lot of insight into the distribution of reserves between the   domestic and the foreign entities  I think that is something we would have to look at  In terms of   the FDIC fee, you are correct  the assessment fee will come into place April 1, and it will raise   the cost of keeping reserves on the balance sheet and doing the arbitrage that should keep other   short-term interest rates relatively close to the interest rate on reserves  We anticipate that this   could widen the gap between market interest rates and the interest rate on reserves by a couple of   basis points  That is essentially what we see in the markets  If you look out to federal funds   futures contracts in the middle of the year, they are trading around 14 basis points  That’s a   couple of basis points below where the effective federal funds rate is today   1  Thank you, Mr Chairman  It was a complicated intermeeting  period in financial markets, as investors had to contend with several significant global  developments affecting risk sentiment, with domestic events highlighting the fiscal  challenges facing the United States, with economic data that led to a sizable  downgrade to expected GDP growth in the first half, and with a notable further rise in  energy and commodity prices  While these developments led to some volatility in  asset prices during the period, they did not significantly alter investors’ perceptions  about the likely course of the economy or monetary policy on balance   As shown in the upper-left panel of your first exhibit, the expected path of the  federal funds rate is virtually unchanged from the last FOMC meeting  This outcome  is somewhat remarkable, given the number of important developments just noted and  the large number of speeches delivered by FOMC members expressing diverging  views on policy prospects  Current market prices suggest that investors expect the  federal funds rate to remain near its current level over the rest of the year and then to  move higher in the first half of next year  The Desk’s survey of primary dealers  shows a similar pattern, with respondents putting the highest odds on the first increase  in the federal funds rate target taking place in the first half of next year, although they  also see significant odds of policy tightening being delayed until the second half of  that year or later                                                     1 The materials used by Mr Sack are appended to this transcript (appendix 1)   April 26–27, 2011 3 of 244              This policy outlook appears to be based on investors’ expectations for a sustained  economic recovery and some ongoing concerns about inflation  Investors saw the  incoming economic data as weaker than expected, leading them to reduce their first- half economic growth estimates notably, but they apparently did not substantially  lower their forecasts for growth further ahead  At the same time, some of the factors  that have contributed to investors’ concerns about inflation intensified, as energy and  commodity prices continued their steep climb, as shown in the upper-right panel   The rise in energy and commodity prices put some upward pressure on near-term  breakeven inflation rates  More importantly, measures of the five-year, five-year  forward breakeven inflation rate also moved higher  This recent increase leaves the  Board measure near the levels observed over much of 2009 and 2010 but pushes the  Barclays measure slightly above its historical range  The increase in breakeven  inflation rates was associated with a modest rise in nominal Treasury yields over the  intermeeting period, as shown to the right   A notable development in the Treasury market over the intermeeting period was  the announcement that Standard and Poor’s had revised its outlook for the long-term  credit rating of the United States from stable to negative  Not surprisingly, market  participants were already focused on the budgetary imbalances facing the United  States and the uncertainty about whether the political process will produce an  agreement to address those imbalances  The S&P announcement prompted an  immediate rise in Treasury yields, as summarized in the bottom-left panel, but the  effect did not persist, as investors saw the report as conveying little new information   The fiscal difficulties facing the United States will remain at the forefront with the  looming debt ceiling problem  As shown in the panel to the right, the amount of  outstanding Treasury debt is projected to reach its statutory limit on or around  May 16  At that time, the Treasury would begin to employ a set of extraordinary  measures that allow it to temporarily finance the government without increasing the  level of debt subject to the ceiling  Our estimate is that such measures would allow  the Treasury to operate until mid-July  Yields on Treasury bills maturing around  these dates suggest that investors do not expect a significant market disruption from  the debt ceiling despite the uncertainties surrounding this process   Your next exhibit turns to some of the international developments that affected  financial markets over the intermeeting period  Japanese equity prices fell  dramatically following the earthquake on March 11 and the nuclear problems that  ensued, as shown in the upper-left panel  While share prices have bounced back  some, the Nikkei index is still about 7 percent lower than its levels ahead of the  earthquake, reflecting concerns about the economic consequences of those events   Despite these economic concerns, the yen strengthened sharply in the immediate  aftermath of the earthquake, as shown to the right  This pattern was likely due to  some unwinding of yen carry trades as global asset prices declined as well as the  anticipation of repatriation flows from insurers and retail investors   April 26–27, 2011 4 of 244              In response to the movement in the yen, the G-7 authorities announced their  intention to conduct a coordinated currency intervention on March 18  As  summarized in the memo that was sent to the Committee at that time, operations were  conducted by each central bank that day during their respective trading hours  In  carrying out our operations, the Desk conducted two rounds of yen sales, with each  involving $500 million of transactions  Following the usual procedure, half of the  funds for the intervention came from the System Open Market Account and the other  half from the Treasury’s Exchange Stabilization Fund, with the SOMA transactions  authorized by the Foreign Currency Subcommittee of the FOMC  Overall, the  operations were carried out relatively quickly, with no operational difficulties   Notable developments in financial markets also took place in the euro area  As  Nathan Sheets will discuss in his briefing, the Portuguese government requested  financial support from the European Union and the International Monetary Fund,  making it the third peripheral European country to do so  More recently, market  participants have become increasingly concerned about the possibility of a  restructuring of Greek sovereign debt  These developments led to a surge in the yield  spreads on the sovereign debt from these two countries, as shown in the middle-left  panel  Importantly, there has been only limited pass-through from these  developments to the pricing of Spanish and Italian debt, although some modest  spillover effects have been visible at times   Despite the ongoing problems in peripheral countries, the incoming data on  economic activity for the euro area as a whole has been relatively strong, and  headline inflation has been elevated  In response, the European Central Bank raised  its benchmark policy rate by 25 basis points at its April 7 meeting, and several  additional policy actions are expected by year-end  The realized and prospective  policy tightening supported the euro, which gained 4 percent against the dollar,  shown in the middle-right panel  More broadly, the dollar depreciated against all  major currencies except the Japanese yen, leaving the broad dollar index more than  2 percent lower over the intermeeting period   The potential risks from the various domestic and global developments and the  softer tone of the economic data did not manage to hold back US equity prices  As  shown in the bottom-left panel, the S&P 500 index gained more than 3 percent over  the intermeeting period  Equity prices had fallen sharply around the time of the last  FOMC meeting, in part reflecting greater perceived uncertainty in the aftermath of  the Japanese earthquake  But investors’ uncertainty about the outlook has since  diminished, as shown by the VIX index in the panel to the right   Returning to the bottom-left panel, one notable exception to the rally in equities  has been the financial sector  Although bank earnings for the first quarter have  generally met or exceeded analysts’ expectations, profit growth has been driven in  large part by reductions in loan loss provisions  Investors have increasingly worried  about the sources of ongoing earnings growth for these firms, leading to downward  pressure on their share prices   April 26–27, 2011 5 of 244              Your third exhibit turns to monetary policy operations  As of today, the Desk will  have completed $422 billion of the $600 billion of intended Treasury purchases, in  addition to the ongoing reinvestment of principal payments from our agency debt and  mortgage-backed securities  Overall, the total pace of the Desk’s purchases has been  running at around $100 billion per month, as shown in the upper-left panel  If the  FOMC were to complete the $600 billion in asset purchases in June and maintain the  reinvestment policy thereafter, as assumed in the Tealbook, the Desk’s purchases  would decline to an average pace of about $10 billion per month over the second half  of the year   The panel to the right shows the projected characteristics of the SOMA portfolio  as of the end of June under the Tealbook policy assumptions and compares them with  the SOMA portfolio at the time of the April 2010 FOMC meeting, when the  Committee last had an extensive discussion of its exit strategy  The most notable  changes to the portfolio over this period are the expansion of its size as a result of the  $600 billion asset purchase program, and the rotation of its composition from agency  debt and agency MBS to Treasury securities as a result of the reinvestment policy   The effective duration of the portfolio has increased slightly over this period and  remains well above its historical levels of two to three years   As Bill Nelson will discuss in his briefing on exit strategy, the Committee may  want to renormalize the balance sheet as part of its efforts to remove the current  degree of monetary policy accommodation  The policy discussion that occurred last  April suggested that Committee members were inclined to eventually sell the agency  MBS held in the SOMA portfolio as part of that process  Accordingly, the recent  decision by the Treasury to sell its agency MBS holdings may be of particular interest  to the Committee  The Treasury indicated that it would sell all of its agency MBS  holdings, totaling $142 billion, at a pace of up to $10 billion per month, depending on  market conditions   Overall, the market has effectively absorbed the Treasury’s operations to date  As  shown in the middle-left panel, MBS spreads widened on the announcement,  particularly in the higher coupon securities for which sales were seen as potentially  more disruptive to the market  However, as sales got under way and were met with  strong demand, those concerns diminished, and MBS spreads retraced  Treasury  yields also experienced some mild upward pressure from the announcement   However, consistent with the staff’s calibration of portfolio balance effects, this  response was small because of the limited size of the Treasury’s portfolio  A decision  by the FOMC to sell its MBS holdings could be more consequential for market  pricing and market functioning, given the much larger size of the Federal Reserve’s  holdings, highlighted in the middle-right panel   The bottom panels of the exhibit turn to the effects of the change to the FDIC’s  deposit insurance assessment system that was implemented on April 1  This change  has implications for the behavior of the federal funds rate and other overnight market  interest rates relative to the interest rate that the Federal Reserve pays on reserve  balances (the IOER rate)  In general, overnight market rates tend to remain relatively   April 26–27, 2011 6 of 244              close to the IOER rate because banks can borrow funds in the market and hold  reserves at the Federal Reserve  This activity represents an arbitrage opportunity in  which banks earn the difference between their borrowing rate and the IOER rate  The  new FDIC system makes this arbitrage more costly for domestic banks, as it imposes  a fee on all liabilities, including those used to fund reserve holdings  Banks therefore  require a larger yield spread to engage in the arbitrage activity, shifting their demand  for funds in a way that has caused overnight market interest rates to fall   As shown in the bottom-left panel, since the imposition of the fee, the federal  funds rate has traded at a level of around 10 basis points—about 4 basis points below  its average level in March  That decline is of the order of magnitude that the staff had  expected in response to the fee  Some observers have suggested that the FDIC fee  diminishes our control of the federal funds rate in a significant way  However,  although the FDIC fee creates a wider spread between the federal funds rate and the  IOER rate, the staff believes that it will not reduce the responsiveness of the federal  funds rate to changes in the IOER rate and hence does not diminish our control   A more surprising aspect of the market effects of the FDIC fee has been the  abrupt reaction of repo rates  We had expected downward pressure on repo rates  because banks would be less inclined to obtain funding in the repo market, limiting  the supply of Treasury collateral in that market  However, the Treasury general  collateral repo rate fell more sharply than the federal funds rate, moving to near zero  for several days, and has exhibited considerable volatility   As these events have unfolded, we have also observed a significant pickup in  activity at the Desk’s securities lending program, as shown in the bottom-right panel,  suggesting that more individual Treasury issues have traded with a scarcity premium   Note, however, that our securities lending program does not address the overall  shortage of Treasury collateral or the low levels of general collateral repo rates, as  participants have to provide us with Treasury securities in order to obtain specific  Treasury issues from us  For that reason, some market participants have argued for  the Desk to conduct reverse repurchase agreements to provide more Treasury  collateral to the market and to lift the repo rate toward the federal funds rate   However, given the volatility of the repo rate, it may be prudent to allow more time  for market participants to adjust their behavior and to assess where the repo rate  settles relative to the federal funds rate before considering any such steps   Your final exhibit summarizes some of the results from the Desk’s survey of  primary dealers  The survey this time included additional questions to gauge the  expectations of market participants about the FOMC’s strategy for removing policy  accommodation  To state the obvious, there is no presumption that the FOMC has to  follow market expectations, and those expectations can be shaped or redirected  though FOMC communications going forward   Market participants expect the Federal Reserve to take a number of policy steps in  the process of removing accommodation, as indicated in the upper-left panel  All  survey respondents expect the FOMC to change the “extended period” language   April 26–27, 2011 7 of 244              before raising the federal funds rate target, and nearly all expect the interest rate on  reserves to be adjusted at the same time as the federal funds rate target  As indicated  by the blue dots in the panel to the right, the median respondent expects the change in  policy language to occur three meetings before the change in the target rate   In addition, all respondents expect the Federal Reserve to employ its two  temporary reserve draining tools as part of the exit process, with a large majority  anticipating such a step before an increase in the target rate  The interquartile range  of responses, shown by the blue bar in the right panel, places the use of these tools  one to three meetings in advance of the target rate change, with the median response  just one meeting in advance   In terms of steps for reducing the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet, respondents  see asset redemptions as likely to occur relatively early  Indeed, nearly all  respondents expect the FOMC to begin redeeming its agency debt and MBS holdings  before raising the federal funds rate target, and about half also expect Treasury  redemptions to occur on this time frame  Other respondents expect Treasury  redemptions to occur either at the same time or after the target rate is increased,  leaving only 15 percent expecting them to never occur  The interquartile range of  responses on Treasury redemptions was the largest among all of the steps, suggesting  that there is more uncertainty about the timing of this action   Most respondents also expect the FOMC to sell assets  Of those expecting asset  sales, virtually all saw this step as occurring after the first increase in the federal  funds rate target, with the interquartile range of responses spanning two to six  meetings after the target rate increase  Dealers continue to place high odds on  Treasury sales in addition to MBS sales   These policy steps put the expected size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet on  a gradual downward trajectory  The median survey response for the size of the  balance sheet, shown by the dark blue line in the middle-left panel, is virtually  identical to the path that is realized under the Tealbook policy assumptions, shown by  the light blue line that is barely visible   Despite this decline, the balance sheet is still expected to be very large at the time  of the first increase in the federal funds rate target  As a result, there would  presumably be a large amount of excess reserves in the banking system at that time,  unless they were aggressively drained using term deposits and reverse repurchase  agreements  As shown in the middle-right panel, the majority of respondents  anticipate that reserves will still be $12 trillion or higher at the time of the first  increase in the target rate  The remaining responses were spread out over a wide  range, with some suggesting that draining operations would be used in very large  scale   We also used the survey to gauge the view of market participants on how  aggressively the reserve draining tools could be ramped up without creating market  dislocations  As shown in the bottom-left panel, respondents thought that we could   April 26–27, 2011 8 of 244              use the tools to drain about $500 billion of reserves over a six-week period, with that  total about evenly split between the two tools    The bottom-right panel addresses the effectiveness of paying interest on reserves  for controlling the federal funds rate  Specifically, it reports the expected gap (in  basis points) between the IOER rate and the effective federal funds rate for different  combinations of the amount of excess reserves and the level of short-term interest  rates  For example, with $15 trillion in excess reserve balances, the federal funds  rate would be expected to trade 16 basis points below the IOER rate when the latter is  set to 25 basis points, corresponding to the rates observed today   As can be seen by moving to the right on the table, the relationship between the  effective federal funds rate and the IOER rate is expected to tighten as the level of  reserve balances declines, with a fairly tight range reached at $500 billion of reserves   Even at very high levels of reserves, though, paying interest on reserves is seen as  providing fairly effective control of the federal funds rate  Indeed, with excess  reserves near their current level of $15 trillion, the expected gap only widens to  25 basis points as the IOER rate is increased to 2 percent   Finally, on a topic unrelated to the earlier material, I would like to request a vote  to renew our long-standing bilateral swap lines of $2 billion with Canada and  $3 billion with Mexico  Ahead of the meeting, Nathan Sheets and I sent the  Committee a memo recommending renewal of the swap lines at this time  Our  proposal is to keep the swap lines in their current form  Thank you    We have not been in active discussions about that, given the uncertainties   about the debt ceiling  I think there is general agreement that the SFP could be brought back up   to its previous size with a sufficient increase in the debt ceiling  But no, we haven’t had detailed   conversations about it recently    I think about the market-functioning aspects in many of the same ways—  though maybe not entirely  I think rapid sales could be difficult for the market to digest and   could result in a one-sided market where dealers have more trouble making markets and where   other participants are less inclined to participate, given the heavy flow coming from one single   seller  So I think the same concerns would apply if we are talking about a pace of sales that’s   very high     One thing we’ve learned from the Treasury decision, though, is that the pace that they   have set out, of up to $10 billion a month, seems to have been fairly easily digested so far It   April 26–27, 2011 11 of 244              does not seem to be raising any problems with market functioning  And $10 billion a month is   not a lot of net supply relative to the history of the MBS market  In the early 2000s, there was   $200 billion to $300 billion of net supply coming to the market each year—something on the   order of $20-some billion a month  There is not much net supply coming from fundamentals   today, so the Treasury adding their $10 billion to net supply hasn’t been too disruptive   There’s one difference  When you are selling assets out of your portfolio, these are   seasoned securities, or what are called specified pools; they’re not the production securities in   the TBA market  We had a little bit of uncertainty about gauging whether $10 billion was a lot   or not, because these were seasoned securities, but I think what we have learned from the   Treasury program is that the market has been able to digest that  The concerns about market   functioning, I think, would apply if the Committee were to consider much more rapid paces of   MBS sales than $10 billion    Yes, I do  As I said, I have many of the same concerns with market   functioning in terms of selling  But I agree with you, it is not the same, and there are some   things that are asymmetric  In terms of the available float, tradable float to the market, that’s   April 26–27, 2011 12 of 244              very different  When we were buying very actively, we were removing a lot of the tradable float,   and that was likely impairing market liquidity  And, of course, when we’re selling, we are   providing supply to the market that it can trade  However, as I mentioned, we are not selling the   most actively traded TBA securities in the market  We will be selling these more seasoned, more   specific pools, which may limit that benefit to some degree   The concern I was raising was that, if the market thought that there was a single seller   who would be in very aggressively, and maybe unpredictably, it would be harder for   marketmakers to make markets and provide liquidity to the market  So it is the uncertainty, I   would say, about what the effect of a very aggressive sales program would be that would limit   market functioning  But I want to emphasize that this would be at paces well above what the   Treasury decided upon  We think that there is some room to sell at a decent pace without   causing significant market disruption    Well, I think that would depend on what the FOMC communicated  And   then, given what the FOMC has communicated, we would decide if there were additional details   for the Desk to communicate  But I agree that communicating about the sales strategy would   help    Of course, in addition to the market-functioning aspects, as policymakers,   you will also worry about the market-pricing effect, because we would assume that more-rapid   sales programs would put upward pressure on long-term interest rates    The current level of the spread is constrained by the arbitrage, but it’s also   constrained by the zero bound on nominal interest rates, which is presumably limiting the spread   that we see  Let’s say the arbitrage hypothetically required 30 basis points  We know the fed   funds rate wouldn’t go to minus 5, so the zero bound is providing a limit on how big that spread   can get  I think what you are seeing is that, as IOER goes up, that limit goes away, and the   spread increases  Having said all that, at any level of the IOER rate, we think that arbitrage is   relevant and does put a cap on how big that spread can be, because if that spread gets too large,   firms will come in and do the arbitrage  So that’s why the spread only rises to 25 basis points,   even with such a large amount of reserves    Under the story I just told, you would expect the same gap at 1 and 2, and   that’s not consistently represented in the table  For some of the columns, you see that pattern—  that the gap widens a lot from 25 basis points to 100 basis points on IOER, and then widens only   April 26–27, 2011 14 of 244              marginally more as you go to 200 basis points on IOER  That’s true for all of the columns   except for the first one  So, my guess is that the gap that we will see between market interest   rates and the IOER rate could widen as we move up from current levels, but, for the reason you   noted, will reach a constant level, a steady-state level, well before the IOER rate gets to   2 percent    This is the draining capacity over a short time    I’ll speak for myself, and maybe not the staff as a whole  My own   impression is that these responses are pretty aggressive, especially on the reverse repo side  If   the mandate were to drain $500 billion of reserves or more, I think it may be prudent to spread   that process out a bit more than over one intermeeting period   When we do reverse repurchase agreements, we are taking funding away from dealers   and other participants in the market  So there has to be this change in short-term credit flows   because, ultimately, the reserves are going to come out of the banks; it requires a change of how   the credit flows  I think we are unsure about how easily the market adjusts as it moves through   that chain, and so I think there is good reason to be gradual and to give the market more time   than six weeks to make those adjustments   April 26–27, 2011 15 of 244              I think the capacity to ramp up term deposits quickly is perhaps a bit greater than reverse   repos because it doesn’t require any re-intermediation of credit  It’s just a change in the nature   of banks’ assets    The underlying market conditions coming into the FDIC fee were relevant    We’ve been conducting asset purchases, and that has left less collateral in the market than it   otherwise would have had; at the same time, the Treasury has run down the SFP, which also has   taken Treasury collateral out of the market  So there was a backdrop of less collateral available,   but it wasn’t causing significant disruption or problems for the market  What happened with the   FDIC fee was much more of an abrupt shift  Just to be clear, we had expected the repo rate to   move down roughly in line with the federal funds rate for the same reasons that apply to the   federal funds rate  But what happened was that the adjustment was more abrupt  It seemed that   the decision by some market participants not to do the arbitrage—not to fund themselves in the   repo market, pulling that collateral out of the market—really made it difficult for the market to   adjust in the short term  I would say that the things you point to provide a backdrop of some   shortage but not problems, but then the FDIC fee resulted in a much more abrupt adjustment    That is the background I’m talking about, and I think in part that upward   trend is related to us taking Treasury securities out of the market    Yes  There are different ways to measure this, but one way is to compare   average daily volumes among dealers  For federal funds, we’ve been seeing $40 billion to   $50 billion of transactions daily  For Treasury GC repos, just to the dealers, it’s been   $500 billion to $600 billion    Yes, I can  There’s been a slight decline in funding activity in these   markets as the FDIC fee was imposed, but it’s been fairly modest  Even at these new prices, it   seems like there is active intermediation of credit taking place, and, in that sense, the markets   continue to function   April 26–27, 2011 18 of 244              Another pressure point, however, is the implications for money market mutual funds  At   this point, essentially, Treasury-only money funds will be operating at a loss, and essentially the   fund complexes will likely be subsidizing those funds if they want to continue to offer them    They may choose to do so  Many of them feel that these types of funds are an important part of a   suite of products that they offer customers  As repo rates got extremely low, we did have several   money funds raise complaints to us about this phenomenon, with at least one indicating that it   couldn’t sustain some of its funds beyond the summer at these levels  So I think what we will do   is continue to reach out and listen to that type of anecdotal evidence  At this point, that was just   one fund, but we are going to try to get a sense of how widespread it is  There’s no doubt that as   Treasury repo rates and Treasury bill rates come in, that’s going to put additional pressure on the   profit margins of the money funds  The prime funds still seem quite okay  There is enough yield   pickup as they move into other products that we don’t think at this point that they’re generally   under pressure    I would just add, I think most of us would argue that the statement language   is a much better vehicle for conveying information to the market about the expected timing of   policy action  And, indeed, one of the reasons that in the memo we put draining after changing   “extended period” was just for that reason  I would argue that, through your communications,   you should try to make it clear—if you agree—that the draining patterns aren’t intended to be a   signal about the timing of policy tightening because I think the statement is a much clearer signal   in that regard    I think that in any period, the evolution of expectations of tightening is   going to tighten financial conditions in advance of the actual policy tightening  And in most   cycles that would occur exclusively through the FOMC statement, because you wouldn’t have   these other steps in the process, such as redemptions or reserve draining and so on  So I think   the ultimate effect on markets is going to depend on the same thing, which is how the   expectations of the policy evolve, and it is a matter of managing which policy steps are   conveying those signals    My own view, though, is that your big gun is the short rate  So a change in   the “extended period” language signaling an earlier, more rapid tightening of short rates, I think,   would be your most powerful instrument for tightening financial conditions    Right  And you can see that in the staff’s simulations right now  At the end   of the second quarter when the asset purchase programs finish, the staff estimates about 40 basis   points of effect on the term premium from our elevated asset holdings  So selling the assets   more quickly would shrink that effect  But, of course, you could achieve a lot more tightening   than that, if desired, through the path of the short-term interest rate and the signals that you send   about it    I agree with what Bill and Bill said, that the entire sequence could be   shifted and accelerated, but I was answering the question  Out of all the tools, what do you think   the most powerful tool is?  I think we would all agree, it’s still your traditional policy instrument    As I mentioned in my briefing, I think the markets are very sanguine about   the debt ceiling issue  It’s hard to find any evidence that they are anticipating a significant   problem  I mentioned the Treasury bill curve, which doesn’t show any effects  Implied   volatility of long rates has come down    Well, my point was going to be that many of us are surprised that there is   not a bit more concern  I think it’s uncertain how the Treasury would deal with the situation    We know they have a set of tools that they would employ  But if pushed to the brink, there is the   question of what other steps they may take to be able to service the debt   April 26–27, 2011 103 of 244              If it went to the worst-case scenario where there was actually a default-type event on US   Treasury debt, I think it would be a significant market event  And the effects would be in the   directions you would expect—a bigger risk premium priced into the Treasury curve, a weaker   dollar, and downward pressure on US asset prices if foreign investors and others reevaluate the   situation here  So I think it could be consequential if we got there, but certainly our hope and   expectation is that we won’t end up there   3  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Financial markets reacted sharply over  the intermeeting period to intensifying concerns about the outlook for economic  growth and to ongoing developments in European debt markets   As shown in the upper-left panel of your first exhibit, the expected path of the  federal funds rate shifted down significantly over the intermeeting period  Market  participants are now pricing in the first rate hike in the second half of 2012 and see a  shallower path for subsequent rate increases than envisioned at the time of the last  FOMC meeting  This timing is roughly consistent with the primary dealer survey  conducted by the Desk, shown to the right  Respondents reduced the probability of  the first rate hike occurring by the first quarter of next year, and they see considerable  chances that it will not take place until the second half of 2012 or 2013   The primary driver of the revision to policy expectations was the weaker-than- expected data on economic activity  As summarized by the economic news index of  one major dealer, shown in the middle-left panel, incoming data generally came in  well below the expectations of investors  Although market participants saw some of  the weakness in the data as transitory, they also appear to have marked down their                                                     3 The materials used by Mr Sack are appended to this transcript (appendix 3)   June 21–22, 2011 56 of 282              GDP forecasts to some degree and now perceive the risks to those forecast as  decidedly skewed to the downside   The revision to the expected path of short-term interest rates pulled down  Treasury yields sharply, with the 2- and 10-year yields declining 23 basis points and  37 basis points, respectively, as shown in the middle-right panel  The current level of  the two-year yield, at less than 40 basis points, is not far from the lows reached last  year, when the economy appeared weak and expectations of the asset purchase  program were building   The weaker growth outlook reduced some of the inflation pressures that investors  had focused on earlier this year  Indeed, most commodity prices have fallen in recent  months from their peaks  Moreover, even though realized inflation came in a bit  firmer than investors had expected, breakeven inflation rates declined notably, as  shown in the bottom-left panel  The five-year, five-year forward breakeven inflation  rate is now comfortably inside its historical range, and the five-year spot measure has  returned to around 2 percent   Even though it has come off its peak, the five-year breakeven inflation rate  remains well above the levels observed last summer, suggesting that inflation  expectations are higher now than they were at that time  Moreover, as shown in the  bottom-right panel, investors now appear to place much lower odds on a sustained  deflation than they did last summer, judging from the pricing of TIPS   The concerns about economic growth prospects also weighed on the prices of  riskier assets  Indeed, financial markets clearly switched to a “risk off” environment  over the intermeeting period  As shown in the upper-left panel of the second exhibit,  equity prices declined significantly, with the S&P 500 index shedding about 6 percent  since the last FOMC meeting, and high-yield corporate bond spreads widened  notably   Sizable asset price declines were also observed in private-label residential  mortgage-backed securities (RMBS), shown to the right  This development led to a  number of stories in the financial press about the negative market effects of the  Federal Reserve’s sales of assets from the Maiden Lane II facility  While those sales  put some pressure on the market, much of the change in RMBS prices is likely  attributable to the fundamentals  Indeed, investors’ concerns about housing prospects  continued to increase over the intermeeting period, and market participants moved  away from risk across a wide range of asset classes   Another area that faced considerable pressure over the intermeeting period was  the financial sector  As shown in the middle-left panel, stock prices of financial  institutions fell sharply in response to the weaker economic outlook, ongoing  concerns about the source of future revenue growth, and heightened concerns about  the expected capital surcharge for systemically important financial institutions  In  addition, Moody’s announced that it was placing the ratings of Bank of America,  Citigroup, and Wells Fargo on review for possible downgrade based on its view that   June 21–22, 2011 57 of 282              the degree of government support has been reduced by the new regulatory  framework   Despite the weakening in the US growth outlook, the dollar strengthened, shown  to the right, as investors also became more concerned about growth prospects outside  the United States  In addition, developments in European debt markets weighed on  the euro relative to the dollar   The situation in European debt markets remains very strained  Investors have  faced uncertainty about whether Greece will receive additional funding from the IMF  and the EU and the type of private-sector participation that will be required for such  support  The baseline assumption among market participants is that Greece most  likely will receive funds to meet its financing needs for now, but that it will  eventually have to restructure its debt  Against that backdrop, the spread on two-year  Greek debt over German debt surpassed 25 percentage points, as shown in the  bottom-left panel  An important consideration is the degree to which these pressures  are spilling over to Spanish debt markets  Spreads on Spanish government bonds did  increase some, but their levels remained below those reached late last year  Beth  Anne Wilson will cover these developments in more detail in her briefing   Dollar funding markets for European institutions have also shown a few signs of  increased pressure  Although the LIBOR spread to the OIS rate has held steady,  forward measures of this spread moved up late last week, as shown in the bottom- right panel, and the dollar swap basis also rose  The emerging concerns in funding  markets partly stemmed from the announcement by Moody’s that it was placing three  French banks on review for potential downgrade based on their exposures to Greece   Overall, the funding pressures seen in the market are still fairly modest, but we are  conscious that conditions can change quickly   Before leaving this exhibit, let me discuss the proposal on the liquidity swap lines  that Steve Kamin and I described in a memo that was circulated to the Committee  ahead of the meeting  The liquidity swap lines that are currently in place with the  European Central Bank, the Bank of Japan, the Bank of England, the Swiss National  Bank, and the Bank of Canada are scheduled to expire on August 1  In light of the  ongoing pressures on global financial markets and notable uncertainties about funding  needs in Japan and the euro area, our swap counterparties believe that an extension of  the swap lines is warranted   The staff’s view is that the swap lines continue to provide an important backstop  that has helped to maintain stability and confidence in dollar funding markets   Allowing the swap lines to expire in current circumstances would seem to create  unnecessary risks  Accordingly, the staff recommends that the Committee approve an  extension of the swap lines for a period of one year, through August 1, 2012  All  aspects of the swap arrangements other than the expiration date would remain  unchanged, including the expected pricing of any dollar funding operations at  100 basis points above the OIS rate  This pricing should ensure that funding from the  lines is attractive to financial institutions only during times of severe market stress   June 21–22, 2011 58 of 282              We will be asking for a vote to approve the resolution provided at the end of the  memo  If the Committee were to vote affirmatively, we would expect the five foreign  central banks to take corresponding actions as soon as possible  However, given the  schedule of its policy meetings, the Bank of Japan would not be able to take such an  action until July 12  Thus, our current intention is to announce the extension of the  swap lines on that day, if the extensions are approved by all central banks   Your next exhibit turns to the issue of the debt limit and the potential implications  for financial markets  As you know, the statutory limit on federal debt was reached  on May 16, and the Treasury has been using extraordinary accounting measures to  maintain its issuance of marketable debt since then  As can be seen in the upper-left  panel, these measures have kept the total debt subject to the limit unchanged since  May 16, whereas the debt would be about $85 billion above the limit in the absence  of such measures  The Treasury continues to project that, even with the use of these  measures, it will exhaust its authority to borrow on August 2, as can be seen by the  fact that our debt projection moves above the limit after that date   Without the ability to raise new funds through debt issuance, the Treasury would  have to either delay principal and interest payments coming due on its securities or  take other extraordinary steps to free up funds for servicing its debt  The scheduled  debt payments after August 2, shown in the upper-right panel, include weekly  maturities of Treasury bills beginning on August 4 as well as principal and interest  payments on coupon securities on August 15 and August 31   Market participants generally believe that missing a payment on Treasury  securities would have very detrimental consequences on financial markets  However,  current market prices do not appear to reflect much anxiety about the looming debt  ceiling deadline  For example, the Treasury bill curve, shown in the middle-left  panel, does not have an obvious discontinuity in early August  Moreover, the  anticipated volatility of longer-term yields over the next several months, shown to the  right, has not moved up meaningfully  Market participants appear to be assuming  that the Congress will reach a resolution for the debt ceiling before it becomes  disruptive   If the debt ceiling constraint is not resolved and the threat of a default on Treasury  securities intensifies, there could be a number of consequences for financial markets   It may be useful to think about those consequences along two broad dimensions  The  first dimension is the extent to which markets would reprice the amount of credit risk  in US Treasury securities  Treasuries have historically been viewed as having no  credit risk, and it is difficult to judge just how much that perception would change in  response to a default event  Any such change would presumably depend on the  length of the default, the manner in which it was resolved, and the evolution of the  longer-term fiscal outlook  It would also be shaped by the response of the rating  agencies and the behavior of key investor classes  Any increase in the risk premium  embedded in Treasury yields would have negative implications for the budget  outlook, given the elevated debt levels that have been reached  Moreover, such   June 21–22, 2011 59 of 282              circumstances could create a loss of confidence and an increase in risk premiums that  would weigh heavily on a broad set of asset prices and the dollar   The second dimension to consider is the possibility that market functioning could  deteriorate, particularly in the cash and repo markets in Treasury securities  Indeed, a  situation involving defaulted securities could induce operational problems for  financial firms or behavioral shifts in their willingness to participate in the Treasury  market  There would presumably be considerable uncertainty about the ability to  transact, about the trading and settlement conventions that would be in place, and  about the actions that other market participants would take  The result could be a  meaningful loss of liquidity in these markets and volatile price movements  Such a  disruption could be quite consequential to a broad range of financial markets and  activities   These circumstances would also raise important complications for Desk  operations  As highlighted in the bottom-left panel, there are a number of areas in  which our operations could be affected, including outright purchases of Treasury  securities, securities lending activity, and our ability to conduct repurchase  agreements against Treasury collateral  The Desk has begun a process of contingency  planning to ensure that those operations can continue in the event of a delayed  payment on Treasury debt   The Desk will also have to monitor conditions in short-term funding markets, as  they could be affected in ways that would warrant the use of open market operations   There is no clear course of action that we anticipate today  However, we should  recognize that this intermeeting period is highly unusual, and that conditions could  unfold in a variety of ways   To highlight the degree of uncertainty about funding markets, let me describe two  possibilities that have been raised in our discussions with market participants  Some  market observers are concerned that the looming debt ceiling is going to impose a  substantial squeeze in the supply of Treasury bills, as the Treasury attempts to  maintain its coupon issuance while its ability to borrow is limited  They believe that  Treasury bill yields and GC repo rates could be driven negative in response,  potentially inducing a number of unusual market issues  As shown in the bottom- right panel, these rates are already quite low, making the market vulnerable to this  outcome  Other observers are instead focused on the possibility that activity in the  repo market could dry up, leaving dealers and others in a scramble for liquidity to  fund their holdings of Treasuries  This outcome would put unusual upward pressure  on repo rates and other short-term interest rates  It is difficult to assess the likelihood  of these or other scenarios, and hence we will be watching the evolution of money  market conditions carefully   Your last exhibit focuses on recent developments affecting the SOMA portfolio   As of next Thursday, the Desk will have completed the $600 billion of purchases of  longer-term Treasury securities that the FOMC announced in November, shown by  the dark blue bars in the upper-left panel  Of course, those purchases came on top of   June 21–22, 2011 60 of 282              the reinvestment of principal payments on our holdings of agency debt and agency  MBS (the light blue bars)  In total, since the inception of the program, we have  conducted 133 outright operations, with an average size of about $5½ billion  In  effect, we have been in the market on every day possible since the start of the  program   Activity on the Desk will calm down a bit after next Thursday  At that time,  absent a change in the directive from the FOMC, the Desk will continue only with the  reinvestments of principal payments, bringing purchases down to an expected pace of  about $20 billion per month   As shown to the right, the Desk proposes keeping nearly the same maturity  distribution of purchases for the reinvestments as that used during the recent round of  asset purchases  The only difference in the proposed distribution is that the Desk  would combine the two maturity buckets beyond 10 years into a single group,  because otherwise the operations in that sector would be very small  Under this  distribution, the average duration of our purchases would remain between five and  six years  The Desk’s schedule of operations would also be modified to reflect the  slower pace of purchases  In particular, we would intend to conduct only one  operation per maturity bucket, or seven total operations, per month   The Desk would like to release a statement describing these operational details,  just as it did following the FOMC’s announcements of the reinvestment program last  August and the purchase program last November  We do not expect the Desk  statement to attract much attention  The proposed plan is to release the Desk  statement about 30 minutes after the FOMC statement, which would still be well  before the beginning of the Chairman’s press conference   By reinvesting principal payments from the SOMA, the FOMC would be deciding  to keep the total face value of domestic assets held in the SOMA steady at  $2654 trillion  As shown in the middle-left panel, our holdings represent about  17 percent of the outstanding stock of Treasury debt  That percentage is not  materially different from its level before the financial crisis, but our holdings of  Treasury securities are now skewed more heavily toward coupon securities relative to  bills  Overall, our purchases do not appear to have caused any material deterioration  in the liquidity and functioning of the Treasury market, as indicated by the bid-ask  spread reported to the right   Market participants generally expect the level of our asset holdings to remain  unchanged over the near term and then to begin declining at some point over the next  two years  As shown in the bottom-left panel, respondents to our dealer survey place  relatively low odds on additional asset purchases over a two-year horizon, but they  see considerable odds that the FOMC will begin to sell assets  You can see that from  the dark blue tick marks, which represent the median response to the survey  One  notable change since the March survey, which is shown by the orange dots, is that the  probability of MBS sales has risen considerably, presumably reflecting the FOMC’s  communications about its exit strategy   June 21–22, 2011 61 of 282              The survey also indicated that the sequence of policy steps expected during the  removal of policy accommodation was largely unchanged from the previous survey  and in line with the strategy described in the April FOMC minutes  As shown to the  right, this sequence is expected to put the overall size of the portfolio on a downward  trajectory that is very similar to the path assumed in the Tealbook  Thank you, Mr  Chairman    I didn’t learn that the minutes were going to be accelerated until yesterday    It’s certainly an option to have the statement come out earlier from everyone except the Bank of   June 21–22, 2011 64 of 282              Japan, with an indication that the Bank of Japan would be expected to take a similar action  If   so, we can bring it forward at least several days  I think the Bank of Japan didn’t want it too far   in advance of their action, but there’s some flexibility there  The other thing is, given the timing   of their meeting, we would like to release the statement in the morning  So perhaps we could   consider whether a release in the morning ahead of the minutes would still be acceptable  We’re   thinking of a 900 am release    That’s correct  There was a small amount of activity from Japan over the   life of the lines and a larger amount from the ECB, although still relatively small, at the   beginning of the lines  They haven’t been actively used in a while, but yet we continue to think   that their presence is a useful backstop    Yes, they’re open ended, with the exception of the line with the Bank of   Canada; the other four are open ended    That’s very hard to say  We’re in a very awkward equilibrium where the   markets assume there will be an outcome because not having an outcome would be so   catastrophic  However, that assumption means you don’t see any pressure in markets, and it   relieves the pressure on the political process  And the problem is that the markets may be   expecting this to go up to the last minute, so they may be expecting an eleventh hour solution  I   think that means that there’s a chance we won’t see any significant source of pressure in the   markets until we’re right against the deadline or so, perhaps late July or very early August    As I noted, this strategy of course will keep the duration of our purchases in   that same range of five to six years, which is slightly higher than the duration of the portfolio in   total  Our thinking was that that was a good maturity range to be in  It isn’t too different from   June 21–22, 2011 66 of 282              the maturity of the portfolio  It maintained the current policy and seemed consistent with the   idea of policy going on hold, which I think is how many FOMC members have described what   the stance of policy will be after June in terms of keeping the balance sheet unchanged  And we   thought that, from a communication perspective, this was also the simplest outcome, to simply   maintain that current distribution    In a portfolio-balance type of theory, a shortening of the structure would put   a bit of upward pressure on yields  We tend to think of the portfolio as having the effect through   the duration risk it removes, so if we shift toward shorter maturities, we’re removing less   duration risk, but it would be quite modest    On the first question, five-year CDS, which is the most liquid part of the   structure, has moved up modestly but not dramatically  The one-year measure, in fact, has   moved up noticeably, but we don’t put a lot of weight on that evidence because the CDS market   for US sovereign debt is very small  I think the net outstanding amount from DTC data is   something between $4 billion and $5 billion  So we’re pretty dismissive of that signal  We   June 21–22, 2011 67 of 282              would prefer to look at the yields on actual Treasury securities to make inference about the   likelihood being priced into the market   In terms of the Federal Reserve’s role and whether market participants are talking about   that, I have not heard a lot of discussion about that  As I noted in my briefing, we’ve begun   contingency planning  We want to make sure that our operations can be conducted in these   circumstances  We’ve also begun a process of thinking about how those operations might affect   the market and how that may interact with the debt ceiling; there are a number of issues there    For example, if we’re buying Treasury securities and there were securities with missed   payments, would market participants want to show us large amounts of those securities to get rid   of them and not have to deal with the market consequences?  If those particular securities have   cheapened a lot, do our existing procedures bias us toward buying them?  Would they have the   same incentives to give us those securities in securities lending?  And, last, might there be a   substantial need for funding if the repo markets dried up that we would have to meet with   repurchase agreements?  We have a list of those kind of issues that we’re working through, but   we’re not yet to the point where the market is really focused on that next step    There are some issues that I think are covered under the current directive    If upward pressure on repo rates were to drag the federal funds rate up as well, the current Desk   directive would mandate that the Desk do RPs and inject reserves, so those I’m taking as given    More broadly, in terms of how the operations may be affected or how the operations could be   changed in response to the consequences—that’s an area where I would seek consultation from   the Committee  I’m assuming the Committee does not want to structure operations for the sole   purpose of helping the markets through the debt ceiling problems  If you wanted to go to the   extreme, you could imagine operations like CUSIP swaps, where we would buy defaulted   securities and sell nondefaulted securities out of our portfolio  I’m sure there are a number of   very creative things we could do to help the markets through a debt ceiling problem  I’m   assuming there’s not an appetite to go to those extremes  However, there’s a lot of area in   between the extremes in terms of how the operations we conduct regularly will be affected, and   those are the things we’ll be sorting through  If we’re doing anything outside of our regular   operations or outside of what we see necessary to meet the directive, we would consult with   policymakers    Yes, absolutely    Yes  The authorization to the Desk for securities lending is in part based on   market functioning, so that’s a standing facility that I assume we would maintain  The   authorization for buying and selling Treasury securities, as would be needed for a CUSIP swap,   is tied directly to the directive, and the directive does not have a broad market-functioning aspect   June 21–22, 2011 69 of 282              to it  I think to design operations for market-functioning purposes that involve buying and   selling securities would require some kind of consultation with the Committee    Yes  We started with a half-page list of potential issues related to the debt   ceiling, which has now grown to four pages  There are a large number of issues we need to think   through in terms of how our systems work, how our pricing feeds work, whether the way we do   relative value analysis for valuing collateral that comes in or for buying assets outright is   affected by all of this—there’s a whole range of issues  We are working through them  I   wouldn’t say we’ve worked through them completely at this point, but we are now making good   progress    Yes, I think it would be useful to write out some of the Desk policy issues   that could arise in coming weeks and consult with the Committee on approaches they would like   to take and where you would like to draw the line  For example, I would assume we would draw   the line past what you just said  I would think we would probably want to continue to take   securities with delayed payments in open market operations  Excluding them could seem like a   very negative market signal about how we were assessing credit quality  But we could lay all   those issues out in a memo and get some guidance from the Committee    Over the next several years, probably about $100 billion a year  My   concern about saying “three to five” is that while you may be interpreting “three” as the outcome   if the sales begin late, the market wouldn’t know that from this  So the market could make the   inference that the Committee would consider selling at a pace of $300 billion a year  We   currently have $950 billion or so of agency MBS  By saying “three to five,” it at least opens the   door for interpretation that the sales would actually be at a faster pace than suggested by previous   communications     Sure  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I will review some of the  pressures in financial markets that had been observed as a result of investors’  concerns about whether a fiscal package would be reached and the associated risks  that the debt ceiling would not be raised in a timely manner  I will also describe the  extent to which those pressures have unwound today in response to the announcement  that the Administration and congressional leaders reached an agreement on a package   The mood in financial markets had clearly darkened last week amid the impasse  on the fiscal situation  The lack of progress toward a credible fiscal package and the  uncertainty that this created about an increase in the debt ceiling weighed heavily on  investor sentiment  Equity prices fell notably, with the S&P index losing about  4 percent, and the prices of other risk assets also declined  Volatility increased across  a number of asset classes, with the VIX rising above 25 on Friday   August 1, 2011 7 of 53              The effects on Treasury yields were more complicated  One might expect  concerns about the fiscal outlook to put upward pressure on government bond yields   However, Treasury yields finished the week lower, on net, in part due to the decline  in risk sentiment  The decline was also prompted by disappointing data on GDP  growth, which exacerbated investors’ concerns about the strength of the economic  recovery  Overall, the 10-year yield declined to around 28 percent by the end of the  week   In addition to the effects on asset prices, investors’ concerns about the debt ceiling  also had detrimental consequences for the liquidity and functioning of some financial  markets last week  Most notably, pressures emerged in short-term funding markets as  the uncertainty about the debt ceiling persisted into the latter part of the week   Money market funds and other market participants began to hoard significant  amounts of liquidity  In that process, they moved out of short-term Treasury repo  transactions and Treasury bills and into deposits at financial institutions, reflecting  their concern that the Treasury markets could become increasingly dysfunctional   Indeed, several major custodial banks reported substantial deposit inflows from their  customers, by enough to cause them to become concerned about their leverage ratios   For money market funds, the move to more-liquid assets largely reflected their  concerns about potential redemptions by investors  Funds concentrated in Treasury  assets saw the beginnings of what was feared to be a major outflow of investors, with  Treasury-only money funds losing more than 8 percent of their assets over the week   Other market participants also moved into cash balances in significant size in  response to the general uncertainties that they saw regarding the current market  circumstances   The heightened demand for liquidity put upward pressure on short-term interest  rates  These effects were particularly pronounced for repo transactions, perhaps  reflecting concerns that this market in particular would be disrupted  Indeed, the  general collateral Treasury repo rate moved from around 0 basis points to about  20 basis points by the end of the week  However, a broader range of short-term  interest rates were also affected  The federal funds rate moved higher over the week,  although it remained well within the FOMC’s target range  And the commercial  paper market tightened up late last week, with most issuers being forced into very  short maturities at higher rates   Some notable distortions also emerged in the Treasury bill curve, reflecting  concerns about whether debt payments will be made in a timely manner  Bills  maturing in the first half of August cheapened notably, with their yields reaching  about 25 basis points by the end of the week   In response to the demands for liquidity and the uncertainties facing the market,  trading conditions deteriorated in the Treasury repo market and the Treasury bill  market  It became more costly to transact, and the volume of transactions fell   However, liquidity in Treasury coupon securities continued to be healthy, as  evidenced in relatively steady bid–asked spreads and trading volumes   August 1, 2011 8 of 53              Overall, it is clear that financial markets came under increasing strain last week   Although we never reached widespread disruption to the functioning of the Treasury  market, the patterns just described suggest that market conditions had become quite  vulnerable to a meaningful deterioration if the debt ceiling situation had remained  unresolved   Fortunately, we did not run that experiment  The agreement on a fiscal package  that was reached yesterday will allow for a cumulative increase of more than  $2 trillion in the debt ceiling in several steps, which should be sufficient to meet the  Treasury’s borrowing needs through late 2012  This agreement initially sparked  some relief in the markets  The immediate reaction was for S&P futures to rise about  1½ percent from Friday’s close and for the VIX to decline  In money markets, bill  yields maturing in coming weeks fell modestly, as investors became more confident  about receiving payment in a timely manner   However, the improvement in financial markets has retraced over the course of  the day today  Equity prices have pulled back, in part because of a weak reading on  the ISM index, and the other movements in asset prices have either fully or partly  reversed  In addition, the upward pressure on short-term funding rates has intensified  this morning  The overnight repo rate for Treasury collateral has consistently traded  above 25 basis points and at one point touched 40 basis points  Similarly, the federal  funds rate has risen to around 20 basis points in today’s trading   This additional pressure in funding markets reflects the ongoing withdrawal of the  money market funds and other market participants from the repo market and other  short-term assets  Those firms that have been moving into cash in recent days have  little incentive to quickly reverse that decision, especially given the lingering  uncertainty about whether the fiscal agreement reached will be successfully voted  into law  In these circumstances, it could take several days to see some relief in  funding pressures   This situation raises important questions about Desk operations  Under the  current directive, the Desk would conduct RP operations if it believed that the federal  funds rate would move above 25 basis points in the absence of such operations  We  were on alert to this possibility this morning but did not act because the federal funds  rate was expected to remain inside the target range  A separate but important  question is whether the elevated level of RP rates itself warrants a decision by the  FOMC to conduct RP operations even if the federal funds rate remains inside the  target range  Bill English will discuss this policy consideration in his briefing   I will close by noting that other important risks to the market remain, including  the potential action of rating agencies, as mentioned by the Chairman  S&P had made  it clear that a downgrade of the longer-term rating of US sovereign debt was likely  unless progress was made toward a substantial fiscal package  While the current  package is sizable, it is unclear whether it is sufficient to prevent a downgrade from  S&P  This looming threat of a downgrade added to investors’ jitters last week, and  those pressures may continue if investors see a downgrade as an ongoing risk   August 1, 2011 9 of 53              It is difficult to calibrate just how much the market would react to an actual  downgrade by S&P  Our judgment is that a move to a AA or AA+ rating would not  force many investors to have to sell Treasury securities because of their investment  mandates  It also would not necessarily affect most of the collateral arrangements  that use Treasury securities  Thus, it is possible that the response would be limited,  especially considering that the downgrade would be coming against the backdrop of  meaningful fiscal adjustment    However, it is also difficult to trace out all of the potential effects, leaving us  fairly unsure about this judgment  More broadly, we cannot rule out the possibility  that the drama of recent days could have enduring consequences for the way market  participants, both here and abroad, view the quality of Treasury securities  Thank  you    The aggregate amount of reserves in the system isn’t going to change, but   this is a change in the flow of those investments  So essentially, the money funds are taking   money out of repo, and actually out of some bank liabilities, and increasing their holdings of   deposits at other financial institutions    Could I emphasize that point?  The market relies on a lot of firms to provide   key infrastructure  Those firms have very complicated systems  We’re talking about the   clearing banks, the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation, the dealers, and the brokers  What we   saw as the debt ceiling approached was an attempt by the industry to begin to contingency plan   basically through SIFMA, but it faced a considerable challenge because it did not know the exact   treatment of payments for which it was contingency planning, and, therefore, it was unable to get   to a well-coordinated, very effective approach across the industry  So I think the point that   President Lacker made about the banks applies equally as strongly to this set of market   participants    No, nothing to add  Thanks    Mr Chairman?    Could I return to item 7 for a moment?  Many of the items that were   considered today were considered in the context of contingency planning, if markets were to   become disrupted or go down certain paths  But the perspective on item 7 that you raised, and   that Governor Duke raised, was perhaps that RPs should be done in response to firmness in the   repo rate simply for managing financial conditions  The issue of whether the Committee is   comfortable allowing some short-term interest rates to increase sharply even if its federal funds   rate target is still being met—that, I think, is a more immediate issue, in the sense that we are   August 1, 2011 51 of 53              seeing firmness in the repo market today  If there were a concern that allowing the repo rate to   be elevated was detrimental to the economic mandates of the Committee, then that seems to me   to be a more immediate issue  Now, of course, there’s a decision about whether the Committee   wants to look at a constellation of broader rates in gauging the stance of its policy  And even if   the answer were yes, I guess there is an issue about whether you think this firmness in the repo   rate is going to persist  You could argue for not pulling the trigger immediately in order to see if   markets calm down and the repo rates return back into the range of 0 to 25  I guess I was curious   if the Committee has decided that it isn’t concerned about repo rates, if it has decided that it is   concerned about elevated repo rates but wants to allow more time to see if they come back down,   or if it wants to go ahead and lean toward some kind of an action in that direction   1  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Over the intermeeting period, financial  market participants became very concerned about the prospects for US economic  growth and had to contend with significant risk events related to the fiscal situations  in Europe and the United States  These developments led to dramatic declines in  equity prices and interest rates, and they prompted widespread discussion about  whether the Federal Reserve will deliver additional policy stimulus   The increasing pessimism in the market about economic growth prospects was  driven in part by the incoming economic data  The data indicated that the economic  recovery has been more anemic than had been appreciated, despite the degree of  policy accommodation that the Federal Reserve has put in place, and raised questions                                                     1 The materials used by Mr Sack are appended to this transcript (appendix 1)   August 9, 2011 5 of 162              about the extent to which economic activity will pick up going forward  Indeed,  respondents to the Desk’s primary dealer survey revised down their GDP forecasts  substantially, and most of them saw the risks around that lower forecast as skewed to  the downside  The dramatic movements in asset prices in recent days indicate that  investors’ confidence in the economy recovery has deteriorated even further   Based on this shift in the outlook, investors lowered the expected path of the  federal funds rate substantially, as shown in the upper-left panel (exhibit 1)  Current  futures prices suggest that the federal funds rate will remain below 50 basis points  through most of 2013  A similar revision took place in the policy expectations from  the Desk’s primary dealer survey  As shown to the right, the perceived likelihood of  the timing of the first increase in the federal funds rate target shifted back  dramatically, with considerable odds now assigned to 2013   The revision to the economic growth outlook has also brought the possibility of  additional policy accommodation back into the discussion among market participants   The primary dealer survey asked about the likelihood of various policy steps that the  Chairman discussed in his June press conference  As shown in the middle-left panel,  many respondents placed meaningful odds on those steps over the next year  In  particular, changing the “extended period” language, providing guidance on the  SOMA portfolio, increasing the size of SOMA, and increasing the duration of SOMA  were all given about a 20 percent probability by the median respondent, while cutting  IOER was given about a 10 percent probability  The perceived chances of policy  actions have likely shifted up notably since the time of the survey, given the  deterioration in financial conditions over the past week   The revision to expectations for short-term interest rates and the possibility of  additional balance sheet actions contributed to a notable decline in Treasury yields   As shown in the middle-right panel, the 10-year Treasury yield fell about 60 basis  points over the intermeeting period to around 235 percent   The decline in the 10-year yield was driven entirely by its real rate component, as  shown in the bottom-left panel  The 10-year real interest rate fell to around 15 basis  points—a remarkably low level that reflects the high degree of pessimism among  investors about the growth prospects for the economy  At the same time, 10-year  breakeven inflation rates stayed relatively high, reflecting in part that inflation has  remained elevated in this environment   The weaker economic growth outlook also caused an abrupt decline in equity  prices  As shown in the bottom-right panel, equity prices plunged over the past week  or two, bringing the S&P 500 index about 14 percent lower since the last FOMC  meeting  Other risk assets also suffered, with high-yield corporate bond spreads  widening notably and bank share prices falling sharply  The share prices of Bank of  America and Citigroup are down nearly 40 percent and 30 percent, respectively, since  the last FOMC meeting, with much of that decline occurring yesterday  Market- based measures of uncertainty surged, with the VIX piercing 40 percent   August 9, 2011 6 of 162              Investors’ concerns about growth prospects were exacerbated by ongoing stresses  in European sovereign debt markets, the subject of your second exhibit  As shown in  the upper-left panel (exhibit 2), pressures in European sovereign debt markets  intensified over the intermeeting period  This deterioration occurred despite major  policy steps taken by European leaders, including the July 21 agreement to provide  additional support to Greece and to expand the scope of the EFSF  Mike Leahy will  discuss this package and subsequent policy steps in more detail in his briefing   The initial market reaction to the package was positive, but this response was not  sustained  In particular, market participants began to question whether the package  provides sufficient safeguards to stem contagion to Italian and Spanish debt markets   As a result, spreads on those securities began to widen sharply in recent weeks,  reaching new highs  These conditions led the ECB to begin purchasing Italian and  Spanish bonds yesterday, bringing those spreads down significantly  However, there  remains a great deal of uncertainty about the strategy that the ECB will employ and  the potential scope for those purchases  These purchases are seen as a bridge to the  expanded use of the EFSF, which will include bond purchases in the secondary  market   The deterioration in sovereign debt markets once again translated into pressure on  European financial institutions, given investors’ concerns about the exposures of  those institutions to the affected countries  These concerns were amplified by  weaker-than-expected European bank earnings reports  As shown in the upper-right  panel, the equity prices of major European financial firms have fallen sharply in  recent months   In addition, some European institutions have increasingly found it difficult to  borrow in short-term dollar funding markets  As shown in the middle-left panel,  there has been a meaningful decline since late June in the amount of commercial  paper issued by institutions from Spain, Italy, and France, as money market funds and  other investors have reportedly pulled away from these firms  The reliance on short- term dollar funding remains sizable for institutions in France, but these firms  reportedly have had to collapse much of this funding into overnight paper in recent  weeks   The pullback of investors from providing funding to these institutions is also  apparent in the upward pressure observed in dollar funding rates  As shown to the  right, the three-month LIBOR has remained low, but the rate obtained by borrowing  in euros and swapping to dollars, a funding practice used by many European  institutions, has risen markedly  If the cost of dollar funding achieved through the FX  swaps market continues to rise, we could see some use of the liquidity swap  arrangements with other central banks, which provide dollar funding at a backstop  rate of 100 basis points above the OIS rate   Overall, the strains on many European financial institutions are intense, and the  liquidity positions of some of those firms have become more tenuous  The  considerable uncertainty surrounding the course of European sovereign debt markets   August 9, 2011 7 of 162              and the outlook for these institutions has been an important concern for investors that  has weighed heavily on financial markets   As shown in the bottom-left panel, the euro has held relatively steady against the  dollar, as the negative effects from European stresses have been counterbalanced by  the concerns about US growth prospects  However, the euro has weakened  significantly against other currencies, such as the Swiss franc  The strength of the  franc prompted the Swiss National Bank to take actions last week for additional  policy accommodation   Against the yen, the dollar has weakened notably, as shown to the right  This  movement led the Japanese Ministry of Finance to intervene in the market last  Thursday on a unilateral basis to weaken the yen relative to the dollar  The  intervention was sizable and prompted the yen to fall more than 3 percent, although it  has since retraced this movement to some degree  In addition, to further support  economic growth, the Bank of Japan moved toward additional policy accommodation  last week by deciding to expand its securities purchase program   Financial markets also had to contend with sovereign debt risks here in the United  States, the subject of your final exhibit  As I noted in our videoconference last week,  the lack of progress toward a credible fiscal package, and the uncertainty that this  created about an increase in the debt ceiling, weighed heavily on investor sentiment  and caused strains on the functioning of the Treasury market and money markets   Some of these strains improved substantially once the fiscal package was signed into  law, but this did not exactly put the US fiscal situation in the rearview mirror for  financial markets  Indeed, in recent days investors have been heavily focused on  S&P’s decision to downgrade the long-term credit rating of the US government   I will start with some of the dynamics that were observed around the time the debt  ceiling was raised  As I noted in our videoconference, concerns about the debt ceiling  led money market funds and other investors to move out of Treasury bills, Treasury  repo transactions, and some types of bank liabilities in favor of cash deposits at their  custodial banks  For the money funds, this decision partly reflected concerns about  redemptions by investors  As shown in the upper-left panel (exhibit 3), the outflows  from money market funds from July 21 to August 1 were substantial, particularly for  funds concentrated in Treasury securities  Since August 1, however, those flows have  begun to reverse   The shift in investor flows is also apparent if we focus on activity at the banks   The flight into bank deposits could be seen in the reserve balances held by some of  the large custodial banks, shown in the upper-right panel  Those balances surged as  deposits grew, but they too have begun to reverse  This surge in deposits caused  some of these banks to worry about their leverage ratios, and one of them last week  decided to impose a 13 basis point fee on deposit balances that exceed normal levels  for all clients of their custodial services   August 9, 2011 8 of 162              This pattern of investor flows has shown through to short-term funding rates   During the uncertainty surrounding the debt ceiling, the Treasury bill curve became  distorted  Bill yields in general moved higher over the period through July 29, as  shown in the middle-left panel, but the increase was disproportionately large for those  bills maturing in August, as investors became concerned about the possibility of  delayed payments on those securities and the range of operational and other problems  that could result  However, with the lifting of the debt ceiling, the bill curve quickly  renormalized, with bill rates currently near zero for securities maturing over the  remainder of the year   Similarly, the repo market has also recovered from the significant upward  pressure on rates that was experienced during the debt ceiling impasse  As shown to  the right, the Treasury GC repo rate jumped from near 0 basis points to above  25 basis points, driven by the withdrawal of money market funds and other investors  that provide funds in this market  Other short-term interest rates were also affected,  with the federal funds rate also moving higher  However, both rates have since  moved down sharply   As I noted on the videoconference, the spike in short-term funding rates left the  Desk on alert to the possibility of having to conduct repurchase agreements to keep  the federal funds rate within the FOMC’s target range  This was an extraordinary  outcome, given that the financial system has about $16 trillion in excess reserves  In  the end, we did not conduct any such operations, as the federal funds rate remained  within the FOMC’s target range   This episode caused some deterioration in market liquidity in the bill sector and in  the Treasury repo market  However, liquidity in the Treasury market more broadly  held up fairly well throughout this period  Indeed, as shown in the bottom-left panel,  the bid-asked spread on the 10-year Treasury note remained narrow, although it  jumped higher last Friday  Other indicators, such as trading volume and depth of  quotes, convey a similar message   Lastly, let me turn to the recent actions by the rating agencies  The most notable  development in this regard was the decision by S&P last Friday to downgrade its  long-term sovereign rating for the United States to AA+  The other major rating  agencies, Fitch and Moody’s, have maintained a AAA long-term credit rating for the  US government  However, Moody’s has the rating on negative outlook, and Fitch  has described the conditions for its rating in a manner that also conveys downside  risks   The decision by S&P appeared to further weigh on investor sentiment and raise  concerns about the economic outlook  Indeed, it came at a time when financial  markets were already very sensitive to growth concerns and vulnerable to negative  news  As shown in the bottom-right panel, equity prices fell sharply yesterday,  Treasury yields moved down notably, and the dollar was mixed—extending many of  the trends that had emerged in recent weeks   August 9, 2011 9 of 162              To summarize, I will simply say that we have had better intermeeting periods than  this one  Thank you    Well, certainly the path of the expected federal funds rate conveys that  As   you note, the dealer survey also asks about other steps in the direction of policy tightening  In   addition to what is shown in panel 3, there’s another side of that question, in which we ask about   the probability of a number of exit steps  Those probabilities are not that low, and they’re   particularly high over the two-year horizon  What you see is a relatively big difference between   the probabilities in the one-year horizon and the probabilities over the two-year horizon  So I   think the Desk survey suggests that there are decent probabilities being assigned to exit options   being adopted within two years, but more likely in the second year    I would say unchanged to slightly decreased, and perhaps decreased less so   than I would have anticipated in the sense that the probabilities over two years are still quite high   for many of these steps  We initiated this question in a new form in this survey, and we intend to   repeat it in this form  So we’ll have a clear time series to see how it evolves going forward   August 9, 2011 10 of 162               Extremely cheap  In fact, I think the dividend yield on the S&P 500 is   about equal to the yield on a 10-year Treasury at this point  In our models, the valuations are   very cheap, although it’s hard to incorporate these abrupt shifts in expectations about the   economy into the models  So that makes it hard to assess how much of it is pessimism about   growth and how much of it is valuation  I think the big picture here on equities is, obviously,   that the move has been very abrupt  Many of us were puzzled by how well equities had held up,   given how the macro outlook had been shifting  I think what we are seeing in part is just a catch-  up to that more pessimistic outlook, but then one that has intensified as confidence has eroded    We have ventured into a very negative dynamic in the equity market that’s given us this very   abrupt repricing    I believe what we’ve seen over the past month or two is the foreign bank   holdings coming down and the domestic holdings going up  I think this in part reflects some of   the funding pressures that have been faced by the European institutions, and that rotation, I   believe, has been around $200 billion  And with that rotation, the level of reserves is about   evenly split between domestic and foreign institutions    Yes    Can I add a comment?  In terms of your question about reserves, as I noted   in the briefing, we are seeing funding pressures emerge  We are seeing a lot more discussion   about the potential need for liquidity facilities  I mentioned in my briefing that the FX swap   lines could be used, but we’ve seen discussions of TAF-type facilities in market write-ups  So   the liquidity pressures are pretty substantial  And I think it’s worth pointing out that this is all   happening with $16 trillion of reserves in the system  I think that if we had started without that   degree of excess liquidity in the system, what we’d be seeing in terms of these pressures would   August 9, 2011 12 of 162              be much more severe  But even with that, we’re getting to the point where the market feels that   additional liquidity injections might be needed    Remember that the futures rate is going to reflect the mean of the future   distribution of short rates  So, the futures rate moving above 25 basis points in the middle of   2013, that appears to reflect a modal forecast that policy will be on hold and then some risk that   that policy could be tightened  Of course, the risks around the short rates are one-sided when   you’re at the zero bound    I was just about to come to that  The Board staff does look at a modal   forecast derived from interest rate caps, and what it shows is that the modal forecast is actually   farther out  I believe it is unchanged through 2013    If there were a statement that you were definitely going to tighten in the   middle of 2013, then possibly  If there were a statement that you weren’t going to tighten until   then or later if appropriate, then I would think not  In fact, that reassurance that you were willing   to say, “There will be no tightening until 2013, and we’ll continue to evaluate”—I think that   would probably, if anything, push down the expectations modestly    As for why these rates are at zero, that point is where we splice from the fed   funds to the Eurodollars  We have to make a federal funds-Eurodollar basis assumption that’s   probably a little bit too big  So my guess is that the true implied rates are in the low single digits    They’re not actually zero  If they were at zero, there would be a pretty good arbitrage   opportunity  But I just interpret that as policy being on hold    We should keep in mind that dealers are not always long duration  Their   positions can be all over the place  There’s no bias through which dealers should always want us   to do more to lower the interest rate structure  So I don’t think the conversations are distorted by   their self-interest  I think the conversations that we have reflect their views on what is   appropriate for policy to do, given the macroeconomic outlook  I think we’ve seen the perceived   probabilities of all of these policy actions increase, and I would argue they’re probably much   higher than reflected in panel 3 at this point because those dealers have become much more   worried about the outlook  They’ve seen the substantial tightening of financial conditions, and   they think some kind of policy response is appropriate    I do because it’s not clear that they all have a self-interest in this direction    Dealers are actually short duration in recent months and have been scrambling to cover,   according to some data  I will also point out that there are other surveys  Our surveys are   limited to the primary dealers right now, but there are broader surveys conducted by others,   including Bloomberg  I just read a story this morning that 51 percent of the respondents from the   Bloomberg survey expect some policy action this year  So I think what we see in the dealer   survey is also reflected in surveys with a broader set of respondents who wouldn’t have direct   interest in their dealings with the Desk    I would actually like to argue that the declines on Monday were not entirely   driven by the downgrade  I think they were a continuation of the decline in sentiment and the   concerns about economic growth that we had already seen develop very intensely over the   previous week  The downgrade did seem to add to those concerns  There could be several   reasons for that  For example, one is that it just further reduces the chances of having a flexible   fiscal policy response to economic weakness  And I do think that a lot of the pessimism about   the outlook is partly related to this idea that there aren’t many policy tools to address the   weakness in the economy  My point would be that the downgrade just added to that, but I think   the primary driver of all this is really the revision to the economic outlook    The last sentence of 3 seems very repetitive, doesn’t it?    “The Committee will regularly review the size and composition of its   securities holdings and is prepared to adjust those holdings as appropriate”  Isn’t that one of the   tools that’s covered now in paragraph 4?   1  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Financial markets continue to be  strongly influenced by concerns about economic growth prospects for the US and  other advanced economies, as well as perceptions of substantial risks surrounding the  European sovereign debt situation  These factors led to considerable volatility in the  prices of risky assets, large declines in interest rates, notable strains in short-term  funding markets for some financial institutions, and greater market expectations that  the Federal Reserve will deliver additional policy accommodation   Although US interest rates had already reached quite low levels at the time of the  August FOMC meeting, they declined further over the intermeeting period  As  shown in the upper-left panel of your first exhibit, the expected path for the federal  funds rate derived from overnight index swaps now reflects an even later liftoff from  the near-zero range   Much of the downward shift in policy expectations came in response to the  August FOMC statement, which indicated that the Committee expects economic                                                     1 The materials used by Mr Sack are appended to this transcript (appendix 1)   September 20–21, 2011 3 of 290              conditions to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate at least  through mid-2013  That statement prompted implied short-term interest rates two  years ahead to shift down by about 25 basis points, as investors interpreted the  statement as indicating a lower probability that the federal funds rate target would rise  before that time  Consistent with that interpretation, measures of implied volatility  for interest rates around that horizon also declined notably in response to the FOMC  statement     Additional evidence on the change in investors’ expectations is provided by the  Desk’s primary dealer survey  As shown in the upper-right panel, the perceived  chances of the first increase in the federal funds rate target occurring before the third  quarter of 2013 fell significantly, partly reflecting the forward policy guidance from  the August FOMC statement  However, respondents still attached about 20 percent  odds to the possibility that the first rate hike could occur before mid-2013, indicating  that investors do not see the policy language as an unconditional commitment   Instead, market participants reportedly see the policy guidance as “raising the bar” for  policy action before that time   The sense that the federal funds rate target will remain at its current level for a  long period was reinforced by the incoming economic data, which pointed to an  economy struggling to find its footing  Indeed, since the last FOMC round, primary  dealers slashed their GDP forecasts by roughly ½ percentage point per year for the  period from 2011 to 2013 and raised their projections for the unemployment rate at  the end of 2013 by nearly ¾ of a percentage point  Moreover, dealers see the  uncertainty surrounding the GDP outlook as unusually high and view the risks as  skewed to the downside   Against this backdrop, Treasury yields moved down notably, as shown in the  middle-left panel, with the largest declines in longer-term yields  The movement in  longer-term yields was partly driven by increased expectations that the FOMC will  implement some type of maturity extension program for the SOMA portfolio—one  that would involve sizable purchases of longer-term securities  As I will review in  detail later, market participants are now placing very high odds on such a move at this  FOMC meeting   At this point, longer-term real interest rates have reached extraordinarily low  levels  Indeed, as shown to the right, the 10-year TIPS yield has been hovering  around zero, which is well below its historical range  An alternative measure of the  real long-term interest rate based on the difference between the 10-year nominal  Treasury yield and a survey measure of long-term inflation expectations is also near  zero, which is again quite unusual relative to its historical norms   In my previous briefing, I noted that forward breakeven inflation rates had  remained relatively high even as real interest rates had declined, suggesting that  longer-term inflation expectations were well anchored  While that still appears to be  true in general, there are some signs that those expectations are coming under  downward pressure  As shown in the bottom-left panel, the five-year, five-year   September 20–21, 2011 4 of 290              forward breakeven inflation rate fell notably over the intermeeting period, moving  about halfway back to the levels seen last summer  Moreover, as shown to the right,  measures of the perceived odds of a sustained deflation derived from TIPS have risen  some   Investors’ concerns about economic growth prospects weighed on financial  markets more broadly, contributing to considerable volatility in risky asset prices and  a general sense of unease among market participants  The negative sentiment in  markets was exacerbated by the substantial risks that investors see surrounding the  situation for European sovereign debt and financial institutions   Broad equity indexes, shown in the upper-left panel of your second exhibit,  managed to move higher over the intermeeting period  However, these gains come  on the heels of the very steep declines that were observed ahead of the August  meeting, leaving the S&P index still about 10 percent below its levels in July   Moreover, as shown to the right, the volatility of daily changes in equity prices was  the highest observed since early 2009, and measures of anticipated volatility, such as  the VIX, have also been elevated   Returning to the upper-left panel, the downward movement in equity prices over  the past several months has been particularly sharp for financial institutions   Investors are concerned not only about the effects of weaker economic growth  prospects on bank profits, but also about legal risks associated with mortgage-backed  securities and spillovers from financial stress in Europe  Corporate bonds and other  private debt instruments have also priced in a riskier environment, with corporate  yield spreads widening to their highest levels since late 2009  Corporate bond  issuance by speculative-grade firms nearly came to a halt over the past month or so   As noted earlier, the situation in Europe remains a key focus of market  participants  Steve Kamin will review European developments in greater detail in his  briefing  The abridged version is that investors do not know the endgame for Greek  sovereign debt, they are not convinced that a sufficient backstop exists for the  Spanish and Italian sovereign debt markets, they see uneven progress toward fiscal  consolidation and economic reform where needed, and they are concerned about the  potential capital shortfalls for financial institutions that may arise from their  exposures to these markets and economies   Among the key risks, market participants in recent weeks have had to contend  with uncertainty about whether Greece will meet the necessary criteria for additional  disbursements of funds  Investors are not confident that a substantial debt  restructuring is avoidable in the near term, pushing two-year yields on Greek debt as  high as 75 percent at one point   Market pressures were also present for Spanish and Italian sovereign debt  The  ECB began conducting secondary-market purchases of Spanish and Italian debt in  early August, which, as shown in the middle-left panel, initially managed to reverse  the widening of yield spreads that had been observed before that time  However,   September 20–21, 2011 5 of 290              yield spreads on Italian and Spanish debt have again widened in recent weeks, raising  questions about the strength of this backstop  The ECB has purchased more than  €80 billion of sovereign debt since the August announcement, bringing the total size  of the securities purchase program to €150 billion   The ECB seems intent on handing these responsibilities over to the EFSF   However, European officials are still working to put in place the July 21 agreement to  increase the capacity and scope of the EFSF  Moreover, market participants already  view that package as insufficient to provide capital to banks as needed and to provide  a credible backstop for the sovereign debt of Italy and Spain   The challenges surrounding sovereign debt dynamics and the concerns about  European banks are now being exacerbated by what appears to be a sharper  slowdown in European economic growth than investors had anticipated a few months  ago  Against this backdrop, broad equity indexes in Europe have fallen substantially,  far outpacing the declines in US equity prices, as shown to the right  Share prices  for European banks have fallen even more abruptly, and their CDS spreads have  widened, reflecting investors’ concerns about the health of these institutions   Such concerns have led to significant strains in funding conditions for many  European banks  Money market funds and other investors have continued to pull  back from providing unsecured dollar funding to many institutions  At this point,  with the exception of a short list of top-tier banks, all unsecured funding has  collapsed to maturities of one week or less  Banks that instead rely on obtaining  dollar funding by borrowing in euros and using the FX swaps market to convert to  dollars have seen their implied funding cost move up sharply, as shown in the  bottom-left panel   A few signs of pressure have even emerged for secured funding markets  It has  become more difficult to borrow against less liquid collateral, with investors requiring  over-collateralization and higher rates for some transactions  Moreover, there are  some instances of investors cutting off secured funding against all types of collateral  for particular European counterparties  More broadly, however, secured funding  markets for more-liquid collateral have remained unimpaired for most participants   Moreover, US financial institutions continue to have adequate access to term  funding even on an unsecured basis  Thus, the situation does not represent a  widespread seizing-up of funding markets, but there are considerable risks that  funding pressures could become worse and more widespread   In response to the intensifying dollar funding strains for European institutions, the  ECB, the Bank of England, and the Swiss National Bank announced that they would  begin offering 84-day dollar funding operations in mid-October, using the liquidity  swap lines that are in place with the Federal Reserve  We believe that the presence of  these lines and the associated dollar operations have helped limit the deterioration in  dollar funding conditions, because market participants know that a backstop is in  place  The introduction of 84-day operations should serve to strengthen this role   The market response to the extension was favorable, with European bank share prices   September 20–21, 2011 6 of 290              rising and funding costs in the FX swaps market coming down immediately following  the announcement   With downward revisions to the growth outlook and considerable pressures on  European debt markets, the euro weakened against the dollar over the period since the  last FOMC meeting, as shown in the bottom-right panel  Moreover, the current  pricing of risk reversals shows increased demand for protection against significant  euro depreciation relative to the dollar over coming months  The broad dollar  exchange rate also moved higher over the intermeeting period   Your final exhibit provides an update on the evolution of the SOMA portfolio to  date and takes a closer look at expectations for additional monetary policy actions  based on the Desk’s primary dealer survey   As shown in the upper-left panel, the total amount of domestic securities in the  SOMA portfolio has held relatively steady at approximately $26 trillion since the end  of the asset purchase program in June  The MBS holdings in the portfolio continue to  be paid down, bringing them to $885 billion, and agency debt holdings have fallen to  $110 billion  The majority of the SOMA portfolio is in Treasury securities, with our  holdings at nearly $17 trillion, or just over 60 percent of the portfolio   Of course, the SOMA portfolio has reached these levels because of the asset  purchase programs that were implemented in recent years  When considering the  policy channel through which the SOMA portfolio can affect financial conditions, we  often focus on the aggregate amount of duration risk that the SOMA has assumed and  hence has removed from the portfolios of private investors  One measure of this  duration risk is 10-year equivalents, or the amount of 10-year Treasury securities that  would have the same duration risk as the aggregate portfolio  As shown by the dark  blue line in the upper-right panel, the asset purchase programs in total have raised the  amount of 10-year equivalents in the SOMA portfolio by roughly $1 trillion   This increase in the amount of 10-year equivalents in the SOMA portfolio in large  part reflects the growth in the size of the portfolio  However, a portion of it comes  from the increased average duration of the assets held in the SOMA as a result of the  asset purchase programs  The figure attempts to parse these two components by  showing how the amount of 10-year equivalents would have evolved had the portfolio  been expanded without the extension of duration  This series, shown by the light blue  line, suggests that the size of the portfolio alone accounts for roughly two-thirds of  the increase in 10-year equivalents  The remainder of the effect is driven by the  average duration of SOMA assets, which increased from the typical levels of two to  three years before the financial crisis to around four years today   Without any additional policy actions, the amount of 10-year equivalents in the  SOMA portfolio would remain around its current level  However, market  participants appear to see a high probability that the FOMC will take steps over the  near term to achieve additional policy accommodation  As shown in the middle-left  panel, the Desk’s primary dealer survey asked respondents for the odds that they   September 20–21, 2011 7 of 290              place on various policy measures that have been discussed in FOMC  communications   While dealers placed meaningful odds on a variety of policy measures, those  expectations were overwhelmingly skewed toward a maturity extension of the SOMA  portfolio  The median respondent placed 75 percent odds on such an action occurring  over the next year  Moreover, 16 of the 20 dealers indicated that their baseline  forecast included the announcement of a maturity extension program at this meeting   A maturity extension program would, of course, operate through the average  duration of the SOMA portfolio rather than its overall size  The median respondent  to our survey expected such a program, if adopted, to involve sales of Treasury  securities with maturities of 0 to 3 years and purchases of securities with maturities of  7 to 30 years  Most respondents expected the program to be between $250 billion and  $500 billion in size   The anticipation of such a program has been apparent in the recent movements in  longer-term Treasury yields, as I mentioned earlier  As shown in the middle-right  panel, the largest declines in Treasury yields over the intermeeting period took place  at the longest maturities  Moreover, those yields at times demonstrated an unusual  degree of sensitivity to negative economic news  Most notably, the response of the  30-year yield to the employment report released earlier this month was 3 to 4 standard  deviations larger than its typical size, presumably because the weak reading on  payrolls significantly raised expectations for a maturity extension program   Returning to the left panel, one can see that respondents also placed fairly  substantial odds on other policy steps over the next year  Respondents saw a  45 percent chance that the FOMC would offer explicit guidance over the path of the  balance sheet  In addition, they saw a 40 percent chance that the FOMC could  expand the balance sheet over the coming year  In their written comments, several  dealers indicated that they saw balance sheet expansion as the likely contingency plan  should the maturity extension program prove insufficient to improve the course of the  economy   The discussion of balance sheet expansion among market participants almost  always assumes that the purchases will be in Treasury securities  However, a few  mortgage desks have discussed the possibility of additional purchases of mortgage- backed securities  Some have pointed out that the MBS spread over Treasuries,  shown in the bottom-left panel, has moved up notably and is now above its historical  average  A few market participants have also considered the possibility that the  FOMC would decide to conduct coupon swaps out of higher-coupon MBS and into  the production coupon as a way of lengthening the duration of MBS holdings in the  SOMA   Returning again to the middle-left panel, respondents to our survey also saw a cut  in the interest rate paid on reserves as a possibility, with about 25 percent odds  assigned to that outcome over the next year  The majority of respondents thought that   September 20–21, 2011 8 of 290              this action, if taken, would involve lowering the IOER rate to 10 basis points or  125 basis points, with only 20 percent of the respondents assuming that the IOER  rate would be cut all the way to zero   Lastly, respondents placed meaningful odds on further changes to the guidance  for the federal funds rate  In their written comments, most suggested that this change  would take the form of explicitly identifying the thresholds for unemployment and  inflation that could prompt an increase in the policy rate, consistent with the  possibility raised in the FOMC minutes   Because respondents fill in their economic projections in the survey, it was  straightforward for us to ask about the economic conditions that they expected to be  in place at the time of the first increase in the federal funds rate target  In addition,  we asked for a range of alternative economic conditions that, in their view, would  prompt the FOMC to initiate increases in the federal funds rate  The average  responses are shown in the bottom-right panel, plotted as combinations of the PCE  inflation rate and the unemployment rate   The locus of points suggests that respondents see a tradeoff between the  variables—that is, the FOMC would wait for a lower unemployment rate if the  inflation rate were lower  Such a tradeoff is what one would expect if the FOMC  were setting policy along the lines of a Taylor-type policy rule  The point forecasts  for the liftoff tended to fall around the middle of this locus, with most respondents  expecting it to take place at an inflation rate of around 2 percent and with the  unemployment rate somewhere between 75 and 8 percent  Thank you    Certainly  I think those are very good points  As always, we want to look   at these market indicators of inflation expectations and inflation risks as having some noise, and   we want to look at the collective evidence on inflation expectations, clearly  And in the current   circumstances, there are some factors that could be contributing to the downward movement in   the breakeven inflation rates  You mentioned the flight to quality as one possibility, which I   think is important, and another one that’s been discussed is the expectations of the maturity   extension program  If it would be concentrated in nominal securities, the perception is that it   could also be contributing to the downward movement  Having said that, it’s moving down   pretty aggressively  It’s moving down at a time when markets in general are becoming more   concerned about growth  I think to some extent, this likely does reflect some shift in the   fundamental perspectives about inflation risks  And lastly, I’ll just comment that you’re correct   that the survey evidence generally suggests a more stable outlook for inflation expectations and   inflation risks, but we’ve generally found that the surveys often demonstrate more stability than   we think perhaps represents the true views on risks  So maybe we want to look at the evidence   as somewhere in between the surveys and the market-based measures    Yes   September 20–21, 2011 10 of 290               Well, that’s what the measure in the bottom right is  That’s a very good   point  It wouldn’t be distorted by these differences    That’s right  I think for the measure in the bottom right, distortion to the   implied deflation is less of a concern  Probably for the five-year, five-year forward breakeven   rate, some of the considerations you raised are relevant, though    Very little  There was just over $500 million in last week’s operation from   two institutions  It’s possible that with the 84-day operation, there will be more usage  The   pricing of obtaining dollar funding for three months is actually very close to the price of the   swap line    Whereas the current operations are 7-day operations, most firms, even   under strained market conditions, can get funding in the markets much cheaper than the pricing   of the swap lines  So we will see in mid-October if usage picks up with these new operations    In general, I think those are substitutes, and the staff would say that there   won’t be much of a difference in the effect on markets in terms of whether reserves are issued or   two-year and other short-term Treasuries are sold  There are some differences, of course,   though  The reserves have to reside in the banking system, and the Treasuries, instead, can be   more broadly held  So to the extent that leverage ratios matter or other bank-specific behavior   matters, you do have a difference there  But I think we would agree with the broad sense of your   question  We see the mechanisms of maturity extension or asset purchase programs as being   similar, with the effect coming more from the assets that are purchased than from the way   they’re sterilized or whether they create reserves or two-year Treasuries    Some respondents just think it’s a simple and logical step to put more of   that guidance into the FOMC statement  The FOMC statement right now obviously has very   strong guidance on one policy instrument and virtually none on the other, if you consider the   other to be the balance sheet  Having said that, I completely agree that with the exit strategy that   the minutes have laid out, the guidance on the short rate is, in effect, providing them with   guidance on the balance sheet  So that may limit the effectiveness of this step, but I think   respondents to the survey just see it as a logical step and maybe one that could have at least some   beneficial effect    They’re not scalable in terms of purchasing in this region  They’re also not   scalable in the ability to sell securities because obviously we just have a fixed quantity at the   short end of the yield curve    We did not do an extensive reach-out recently on this issue, but we always   have conversations with money funds  This has been in play for some time  I’d just say that you   do hear some anecdotes on the other side as well  They’ve been subsidizing; if we take another   5 or 10 basis points out of returns, there’s a limit to their ability to subsidize; and at least one or   September 20–21, 2011 29 of 290              two have suggested that they would close funds  Now, it’s hard to know whether that’s a   forecast or a way of trying to lean against this possibility  I think some anecdotes say it would   not be disruptive or important, but they don’t all go in that direction    I agree  The major surprise will clearly be on the MBS side  So I think you   would see a sharp reaction of the MBS spreads to the announcement  In terms of how Treasury   September 20–21, 2011 196 of 290              yields would respond, as Bill suggested in his briefing, the effect would be modestly less than if   the reinvestments went into longer-term Treasuries, but my guess is that, relative to market   expectations, the maturity extension part of it will essentially meet expectations and won’t   prompt much of a backup in rates  I think that the program is a little bit bigger than most people   assume, at $400 billion, and as I will talk about later, if you went with this proposal, we’d   actually have a maturity distribution that’s pretty skewed to the long end  Those two things   suggest that the maturity extension piece will meet expectations on the Treasury side in terms of   preventing a backup in rates    That’s correct   September 20–21, 2011 197 of 290               A few more things to note  Past FOMC communications have left this door   open, as Bill indicated in his briefing  At the same time, in terms of the longer-run strategy, the   Committee has emphasized the move to a Treasury-only portfolio  So I think there will be some   discussion of that and perhaps some confusion  The other thing is that there are broader housing   initiatives in play at the moment, and don’t be surprised if you took this step to see a discussion   of this step in terms of how it interacts with those other initiatives    No  In terms of effects, I think it would be very productive  I’m just   making a few points about how this will be discussed and what the market commentary will be    Yes  We have prepayment projections where we expect about $200 billion   of principal payments on agency debt and agency MBS by the end of June of next year  That   would be the amount under our current projections that we would be switching into mortgage   purchases  If those purchases pushed down rates by more than we had assumed in the Tealbook,   September 20–21, 2011 198 of 290              that number could be higher and result in even more reinvestment in MBS  I don’t think the size   of the rate effects we’re talking about will affect that too much  Another thing to note is that, at   $200 billion, we’re actually already pretty high relative to prepayment models produced by Wall   Street  So there’s a lot of uncertainty around that $200 billion number, and my guess is, under   the current rate structure, the risks are toward being smaller than that than being bigger    No  We don’t think there is dysfunction in the mortgage-backed securities   market at this time    And we do think the upward pressure on Treasury yields relative to the   other proposal will be limited  I was trying to explain in the answer to President Pianalto’s   question that even at $400 billion without the reinvestment piece added on, the maturity   extension program is still sizable relative to market expectations and is probably skewed more   toward longer-term securities than most market participants expect  I think those factors will   help limit any upward pressure we see on Treasury yields  It is hard to judge exactly what is   priced in  We should appreciate that there is some uncertainty about these market responses,   particularly about how far out on the curve we’re expected to go on the maturity extension   program  In general, it’s a fair assumption that the backup in Treasury yields will be quite   modest    Some of it is due to at least concerns about supply related to the discussion   about government refinance programs  The point is that those programs could cause a large   amount of refinancing of the higher coupon into the production coupon, and I think that is   putting some upward pressure on the production coupon spread    Sure  5  I will offer a brief description of how the Desk plans to implement  the Committee’s decisions regarding the SOMA portfolio   Following recent practices, the Desk intends to release a statement with  operational details on these initiatives at the same time as the release of the FOMC  statement  A draft of the Desk statement is provided in the handout for your  reference   Let me begin with the $400 billion maturity extension program   The Desk plans to distribute the purchases from this program across five sectors  based on the approximate weights shown in the table contained in the statement  This  distribution has been designed to extend the average maturity of the SOMA portfolio   For that reason, it allocates a much larger share of the purchases to longer maturities,  including those beyond 10 years, than in previous asset purchase programs  Of  course, this distribution could be altered if market conditions warrant   In terms of selling assets, the Desk plans to conduct regular operations to sell  Treasury securities with remaining maturities of three months to three years   Securities with less than three months to maturity will not be sold to provide the  markets and the Treasury with greater certainty about the maturity profile of SOMA  holdings  These operations will be structured to receive bids across a range of  securities and to accept them based on their attractiveness to market prices  We will  be selling roughly three quarters of the SOMA holdings in the eligible maturity range   At this point, the Desk anticipates conducting 14 purchase operations and 6 sale  operations per month  A schedule of both purchase and sale operations to be  conducted over the following calendar month will be released on or around the last  business day of each month  A schedule of operations expected to take place in  October will be released on Friday, September 30   Let me now turn to the agency MBS reinvestment program   Principal payments from holdings of agency debt and agency MBS will be  reinvested in agency MBS through purchases conducted in the secondary market   Based on current projections, the Desk anticipates that reinvestments will total about  $200 billion by the end of June, thus resulting in an average monthly pace of  purchases of $20 to $25 billion over that period  However, I should note that the  prepayment rate on the MBS portfolio is quite uncertain in the current environment,  and hence the actual pace of purchases could deviate meaningfully from our  projection                                                     5 The materials used by Mr Sack are appended to this transcript (appendix 5)   September 20–21, 2011 254 of 290              The Desk intends to conduct these purchases internally, rather than relying on an  external investment manager  Recall that we had established this capability by the  end of the earlier asset purchase program  We would expect to be active on most  trading days, and purchase operations would be conducted through a competitive  bidding process over an external trading platform  We will continue to rely on  external firms for middle-office support and custodial services   In terms of other operational details, we anticipate that the purchases will be  concentrated in newly issued agency MBS, as these securities have greater liquidity  and are more closely tied to primary mortgage rates, although the Desk may purchase  other agency MBS if market conditions warrant  We also would like the flexibility to  use dollar roll transactions to facilitate the settlement of our transactions  The  settlement conventions for agency MBS and dollar rolls mean that the SOMA balance  may fluctuate around $26 trillion   Purchases of MBS securities will begin on October 3, 2011, and the current  practice of reinvesting principal payments from agency debt and agency MBS in  Treasury securities will be halted at that point  The Desk will continue to publish on  the eighth business day of each month the planned amount of reinvestment purchases  for the next month, but we will no longer be including a calendar for the reinvestment  operations since we will be purchasing on most trading days in the secondary market   Thank you    We speak to Treasury regularly about debt management issues, and not   surprisingly, we’ve been discussing that in the context of a maturity extension program in recent   weeks  My understanding is that Treasury has no intention of reacting to our program in terms   of shifting its issuance any time soon into longer-term securities because we’re conducting the   maturity extension program  You should keep in mind, though, that they are on a course right   now that is extending the average maturity of their debt, and they’ve been doing that for some   time, consistent with the recommendation of their borrowing committee  The weighted-average   September 20–21, 2011 255 of 290              maturity of their debt will continue to extend, but that pace isn’t going to accelerate just because   we’re doing the maturity extension program    That’s right, but let me make a few more comments on that  The additional   maturity extension that’s going to be realized is already under way based on debt management   decisions they’ve made to date, and my sense is that they’ve maybe reached the point at which   they are ready to start to pull back from that objective  Yes, we will continue to see a   lengthening of the weighted-average maturity given past decisions, but I think we’ll see that   lengthening begin to slow and at some point stabilize    I believe the effects of the further extension that we expect would actually   be larger than the effects of the maturity extension program that has been proposed today  A few   things to note  One, that’s already priced into the market  The weighted-average maturity of   Treasury debt today is 62 months  As far as we can tell, the market expectation is that that’s   going to reach 70 months—another 8 months of extension—but we believe that’s fully expected   and priced into the market  Second, it doesn’t seem that Treasury is intent on purposefully   pushing beyond what’s in the markets and, if anything, seems to be shifting perhaps in the other   direction  And, third, we can think of these effects as being in place and then think about the   FOMC’s programs as trying to affect financial conditions around what would have been realized   under Treasury’s path   September 20–21, 2011 256 of 290               They’ve been clear that they will not be changing their strategy in response   to our program  There’s no ambiguity about that    Their strategy is that they realize the weighted-average maturity will   continue to lengthen, but that they’re going to start, over time, to make adjustments that should   cause that lengthening to slow and eventually to stop  They have not given a precise number of   what their weighted-average maturity target is  I’m not sure if they have one at this point, and   they’re engaged in a very active discussion of these issues with their own borrowing advisory   committee  I’m not sure  I don’t think it’s precisely settled in their mind exactly where they   want to end up, but it is my understanding that they do not want to continue to lengthen   indefinitely   2  Thank you  The exhibits are coming, but I wanted to say a few  words before actually getting to the handout  Frankly, after hearing about what’s  taken place in financial markets over the past couple of days, you may actually need a  drink  [Laughter]  So I think the innovation of beer at the FOMC meeting is a good  one  [Laughter]   Movements in markets yesterday and today have been dramatic  Let me give you  a few numbers  The S&P 500 index is off about 5 percent, European stocks are off  about 8 percent, some US financial companies, such as Morgan Stanley, have their  equity prices off 15 to 20 percent, and the 10-year Treasury yield has plummeted  about 30 basis points  My point is that, once again, the world appears to be shifting  under our feet pretty dramatically    One consequence of this volatility is that it actually makes it quite hard to prepare  a briefing that is timely  I think you will find that my prepared briefing provides very  accurate and insightful information about financial market movements through last  Friday [laughter], but I will do my best to modify accordingly  You’re going to  notice some tension here and there   The story from my briefing, and that was presented in the Tealbook, is that  financial market participants had generally become more optimistic about the outlook  over the intermeeting period in response to the perception of progress toward a  comprehensive policy solution in Europe and generally better-than-expected  economic data  This improved sentiment had lifted the prices of most risky assets  and had caused interest rates to rise  However, I had planned to note that the financial  environment remains volatile, and that it is uncertain whether this enthusiasm would  last  The sharp downturn in markets that we saw yesterday and so far today has  brought that point forward with an exclamation point   Let me turn to the exhibits  As shown in the upper-left panel of your first exhibit,  Treasury yields had increased significantly over the intermeeting period, with yields  at intermediate maturities moving up 25 to 40 basis points through last Friday  As  suggested by the news index shown to the right, the incoming economic data has  generally been better than expectations, supporting the upward movement in yields   In addition, developments in Europe have been an important driver of market  movements, with perceived improvements in the policy outlook usually associated  with increases in Treasury yields  However, taking into account the sizable decline  so far this week, Treasury yields are now only modestly higher, on net, over the  intermeeting period                                                     2 The materials used by Mr Sack are appended to this transcript (appendix 2)   November 1–2, 2011 97 of 282              The pattern of yield movements also reflects the impact of the policy decisions  that the FOMC announced at the September meeting  The decision to extend the  maturity of the SOMA portfolio appeared to pull down Treasury yields, with the  largest effects at longer maturities, as suggested by the pattern of forward rate  changes shown in the middle-left panel  When combined with the other  developments over the intermeeting period, the net effect through last Friday was to  leave forward rates out to 10 years somewhat higher, and forward rates beyond that  point somewhat lower, than they were at the time of the last FOMC meeting  And, of  course, with the events in recent days, that structure will be lower   The table to the right takes a closer look at the effects of the recent policy actions   As shown in the first column, longer-term Treasury yields declined substantially  immediately surrounding the September FOMC announcement  Moreover, this  movement passed through strongly to the 30-year swap rate, suggesting that the  effects of the program were not limited to only Treasury yields   Of course, the movement in a window around the FOMC announcement is not  necessarily an accurate measure of the impact of the policy actions, for two reasons   First, the policy actions were anticipated, and hence much of the effect was likely  incorporated into asset prices in advance of the meeting  Second, market participants  became more pessimistic about economic growth prospects in response to the  description of the economy in the FOMC statement, which likely contributed to the  decline in rates   To arrive at a better measure, the Desk’s survey of primary dealers asked for  estimates of the effects of the policy actions, controlling for these other factors  The  median response, reported in the second column of the table, shows that dealers  believe that the policy actions pulled down longer-term Treasury yields by 10 to  20 basis points, roughly in line with the staff’s estimates ahead of the actions   Dealers also thought that the maturity extension program had raised the two-year  yield by 7 basis points, apparently because of the additional supply coming from our  sales of Treasuries with maturities of three years or less  However, market  participants still expect short-term interest rates to remain at their current levels for a  very long period, which should limit any upward movement in the two-year yield   Indeed, as shown in the bottom-left panel, dealers see a greater than 50 percent  chance that the first increase in the federal funds target rate will not occur until 2014  or later   The figures reported in the table also show the effects of the FOMC’s decision to  shift SOMA reinvestments back into agency mortgage-backed securities  Dealers  estimate that this decision narrowed the option-adjusted spread on current-coupon  MBS by 15 basis points  This policy step came as a surprise to market participants,  and hence the effect on the spread occurred immediately after the FOMC statement   As shown in the bottom-right panel, that narrowing of the MBS spread reversed some  of the increase that had been observed since the summer, but the MBS spread remains  quite elevated compared with its levels early in the year   November 1–2, 2011 98 of 282              Before leaving this panel, it is worth noting that the MBS market has also been  affected by the FHFA’s announcement of upcoming changes to its HARP program   As summarized in the Tealbook, the FHFA made a set of changes that it estimates  will cause an additional 1 million mortgages to be refinanced  Not surprisingly, the  announcement led to a significant widening of the spreads on higher-coupon MBS  due to greater prepayment risk, and these spreads experienced considerable volatility  as market participants debated the potential scope of the program  Nevertheless, the  current coupon MBS yield was not strongly affected by the announcement,  suggesting that it did not have detrimental effects on current mortgage conditions   Your second exhibit turns to broader financial market developments and recent  events in Europe  European leaders have been working to put forward a more  comprehensive policy solution to address concerns about the capital needs of  European financial institutions and the sustainability of the fiscal situation in  particular European countries, including Spain and Italy  The news about these  policy actions and the associated shifts in investor sentiment have been the most  important factors affecting broader financial markets over the intermeeting period   Steve Kamin will review the policy announcements that have been made to date   I will simply note that they have fallen short of offering many of the details that will  be critical to their success  Nevertheless, markets were apparently reassured by the  willingness of European policymakers to consider comprehensive policy actions,  leading to considerable gains in the prices of risky assets ahead of and immediately  after the announcements  As shown in the upper-left panel, equity prices increased  sharply, with the S&P 500 index gaining nearly 7 percent through last Friday   European markets turned around even more aggressively, with the Euro Stoxx index  gaining nearly 12 percent over the period  However, the tone has turned negative in  recent days, including the sharp selloff in markets yesterday and today that has  reversed a large portion of the earlier gains   The improvement in risk sentiment had also been apparent in corporate bonds, as  shown to the right  Corporate bond spreads widened sharply into October, especially  for lower-quality issuers, and issuance slowed markedly  In recent weeks, however,  the high-yield bond spread sharply retraced some of its earlier widening, and  investment-grade spreads also narrowed   The reversal of safe-haven flows had unwound some of the appreciation of the  dollar that had been observed ahead of the last FOMC meeting  Through last Friday,  the dollar had depreciated against a broad set of currencies, particularly those that are  more sensitive to global growth prospects  The dollar’s depreciation against the yen  had been relatively modest, but that movement was enough for Japanese officials to  begin intervening again in the dollar–yen currency pair  The Bank of Japan entered  the market yesterday at the direction of the Ministry of Finance, executing over  $100 billion of dollar purchases on the day, which weakened the yen about 3 percent   Amid the volatility in recent days, the dollar has been appreciating again, leaving the  broad dollar index somewhat stronger over the intermeeting period   November 1–2, 2011 99 of 282              Even though the policy measures announced in Europe were met with a positive  initial reception in many markets, they did not put to rest the uncertainties  surrounding the situation  One worrisome sign is that sovereign debt spreads for  Spain and Italy did not improve meaningfully after the announced policy steps, with  Italian spreads actually touching new highs last week, as shown in the middle-right  panel  Those spreads have increased further today   As discussed in the briefing from two weeks ago, these broader market strains  have had important implications for short-term funding markets  The situation in  funding markets is largely similar to what I described in that briefing  In particular,  many European institutions face constraints on their short-term funding in both euros  and dollars, with limited access or high costs for funding at maturities beyond the  very near term  By comparison, most US institutions have not faced constraints on  term funding to the same degree as European firms  As shown in the bottom-left  panel, the spread of the three-month US LIBOR rate over OIS has continued to edge  higher, but a forward measure of this spread has been holding fairly steady   Moreover, some of the concerns about particular US institutions that had  intensified in September and early October have eased in recent weeks  As I had  previously noted, investors became focused on the vulnerabilities of several firms  with large trading operations and a heavy reliance on short-term wholesale funding,  including Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs  However, sentiment toward those  firms has improved in recent weeks, as reflected in the sharp narrowing of the CDS  spreads in the lower-right panel  In response to the earlier pressures, US financial  firms had stopped issuing longer-term unsecured debt, but in recent weeks we have  seen them step back into this market, albeit at higher rates than were available several  months ago  Overall, financing conditions for US financial firms do not appear to  be deteriorating, but a number of uncertainties remain that warrant close monitoring    Your final exhibit focuses on recent Desk operations and the evolution of the  SOMA balance sheet  The Desk has been implementing the range of policy decisions  that the FOMC made at its September meeting  In particular, we have begun the  Treasury purchases and sales associated with the maturity extension program as well  as the MBS purchases associated with the shift in the reinvestment strategy   To date, the Desk’s operations in these areas have proceeded smoothly, and there  are no signs that our activity is having detrimental effects on market functioning   Liquidity in the Treasury market has held steady, as indicated by the measures of the  cost of transacting in Treasury securities shown in the upper-left panel  Similarly,  liquidity in agency MBS markets has remained quite good, with a substantial majority  of our transactions taking place at prices below the indicative offer prices shown on  Tradeweb   These outcomes are encouraging, especially considering the magnitude of our  operations in these markets  As shown in the upper-right panel, our purchases  through June 2012 are expected to represent a sizable portion of the gross issuance of  Treasury securities and agency MBS over this period   November 1–2, 2011 100 of 282              Going forward, market participants are not convinced that the balance sheet  policies currently being implemented will be the final steps toward monetary policy  accommodation  Instead, as shown in the middle-left panel, respondents to the  primary dealer survey see about a 50 percent chance that the FOMC over the next  year will implement a further increase in the balance sheet or change its guidance  about the path of short-term interest rates  Considerable odds are also assigned to the  possibility of the FOMC offering balance sheet guidance, whereas respondents see a  cut in the interest rate on reserves or a further extension of SOMA duration as  unlikely  Respondents do not place high odds on any policy actions occurring at this  meeting   The panel to the right shows the primary dealers’ projections for the path of the  SOMA balance sheet  The median survey response has the balance sheet remaining  at its current size and then beginning to decline gradually in 2014—a path that turns  down only slightly in advance of the assumptions made in the Tealbook  However, as  can be seen from the 25th and 75th percentiles, the distribution of expected paths is  skewed to the upside, as more market participants anticipate an expansion of the  balance sheet over the next several years than an early decline in the balance sheet     Lastly, I want to highlight two other important developments regarding recent  operations by the Desk  The first of these is a structural change to our euro reverse  repurchase agreement portfolio  The Desk conducts reverse repurchase agreements in  euros using the sovereign debt from six countries as collateral, including Germany,  France, the Netherlands, Belgium, Spain, and Italy  As you may recall from an  earlier memo to the FOMC, the approach that had been in place did not differentiate  across this collateral in terms of the rates that we accepted for lending funds  Because  the market has increasingly differentiated the funding rates for this collateral, the  Desk was receiving increasing proportions of Spanish and Italian debt in its  operations   Last week, we began to implement our new approach of accepting rate offers that  are specific to each of the six types of collateral  The results from our first operation  are shown in the bottom-left panel  As can be seen, the offers that we received  demonstrated notable differentiation across the collateral types, with market  participants willing to pay more to fund Spanish and Italian securities  This new  approach will allow us to be more confident that the Desk is receiving fair market  compensation for the collateral that we accept and will allow us to better control the  allocation of this collateral for the SOMA portfolio    The second recent development to be highlighted involves MF Global  As you  know, MF Global experienced a rapid deterioration that led the firm, and the US  broker–dealer subsidiary that is a primary dealer, into bankruptcy  In short, investors  became skeptical about the viability of the firm given the size of its exposures to  European sovereign debt markets, its weak earnings for the third quarter, and the  associated downgrades of the firm by several rating agencies  With these events, the  firm found itself unable to sustain sufficient financing, even as it attempted to rapidly  sell parts of its business and shed assets   November 1–2, 2011 101 of 282              The path of MF Global serves as an example of the vulnerability of firms that are  heavily reliant on short-term wholesale funding  As shown in the bottom-right panel,  the firm had a narrow equity buffer, and its liability structure was relatively unstable   Indeed, the firm had little longer-term unsecured debt and, since it was not a bank, no  retail deposits  Instead, the firm had 61 percent of its liabilities in the form of repo  transactions and other trading liabilities  This structure left the firm very susceptible  to a liquidity run in response to any emerging questions about its capital adequacy   Of course, this is the same issue that I noted earlier in the discussion of investor  concerns about Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs  However, as can be seen in the  table, Morgan Stanley has a much larger share of long-term debt as well as some  retail deposits  The table also shows the figures for JP Morgan to offer a comparison  to an institution with a larger banking operation   The problems experienced by MF Global raised risks to the Federal Reserve  through our counterparty relationship with the firm  Our potential exposures were  associated with MF Global’s participation in our securities lending operations, in our  operations in Treasury securities, and in our operations in agency mortgage-backed  securities  The Desk began to exclude MF Global from some operations last  Wednesday and from all operations last Thursday  Yesterday, the Federal Reserve  Bank of New York announced that it had terminated its primary dealer relationship  with MF Global     Heading into the market open yesterday, our only exposure to the firm was from  seven unsettled MBS purchase transactions  These transactions, which totaled about  $950 million, were due to settle as far out as mid-January  To limit the risk to the  Federal Reserve from these transactions, on Friday we established a special  arrangement for the firm to post collateral to us on a daily basis  Based on  yesterday’s events, we exercised our legal authority to terminate the seven trades, and  we conducted trades with other counterparties to reestablish the same positions, using  the collateral that had been posted by MF Global to cover the additional expense of  those replacement trades  Given these steps, we do not expect to realize any losses  from our counterparty exposures to MF Global  Thank you    It could be happening  We don’t have a good quantitative estimate  The   reason we include TIPS is we don’t want to distort the decomposition of nominal rates into their   breakeven and real components  We want to have some presence in that market, and, of course,   when we calibrate the pace of purchases or the allocation of our purchases, we look at a variety   of measures to try to judge how much we could buy without causing market strains   Here I’m showing gross public issuance  When you compare it to gross issuance, it looks   quite small, but I think we did have some concerns that going too fast could disrupt the markets,   since this is a less liquid market anyway and there are a lot of buy-and-hold investors  Having   said all that, it’s possible we undershot, and indeed there were some commentaries by market   participants, such as Barclay’s, talking about our programs actually putting downward pressure   on breakeven inflation rates    I believe they have not made debt management decisions in response to the   effects of our program that would undo our program  They are certainly not looking at rates and   opportunistically saying, “Given what the Fed has done to the yield curve, we want to move   further out in our issuance”  Having said that, they were already on a course that was   lengthening the average duration of their issuance, and I think that lengthening will continue   over the near term  At one of the recent meetings, we talked about Treasury expecting to be on a   November 1–2, 2011 103 of 282              path toward a weighted-average maturity of about 70 months, the market having anticipated that,   and I think the discussion at Treasury essentially is not whether to go beyond 70, but whether to   stop at 70 or stop somewhat below that    They’re also considering a debt management innovation that would   probably reduce the amount of duration that they issue  They’ve asked the TBAC to consider the   appeal of floating-rate securities, which of course would allow the Treasury to reduce rollover   risk while not introducing duration into the market  If that were a product that they brought on   line and used in any size, that would actually help in terms of keeping duration out of the market    I initially had Goldman Sachs on the table  I am contemplating whether to   dig through my notes  It looks a lot like Morgan Stanley  I can send you the details  The point   is, both Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs look different from institutions with larger banking   operations in the sense that they both have some retail deposits but much less in the banking   operation, and hence they rely more intensively on repo financing  The point of this table is to   say that was true for MF Global as well, but of course to a much more extreme degree    I think it would be in the same ballpark now that the figures show   November 1–2, 2011 104 of 282               I will have to check on that    Yes, there are several areas we’re monitoring  MF Global, of course, had   essentially a large brokerage unit into futures markets  One area we’re watching is whether their   customers will experience any period of disruption and confusion about their ability to change   positions  There could potentially be odd short-term dynamics for futures markets   The second area is questions about whether the customers’ assets are truly fully there at   the institution, and if there were problems in that regard, you could see a loss in confidence in   other types of custodial arrangements or intermediaries   And the third area is whether there would be any consequences for repo financing, not   necessarily direct consequences associated with the unwinding of MF Global’s positions, but   broader concerns about whether repo funding for less liquid assets is as stable as the market had   assumed   I’m sure there are others, but those are three areas that we’re watching  Not having the   benefit of seeing markets today, but through yesterday, it looked like the markets were not overly   concerned with any of those systemic consequences, but that’s what we’ll continue to monitor    Are you specifically raising the question of whether Operation Twist passed   through to the private borrowing rates?  Or do you—    My assessment would be that Operation Twist put downward pressure on   Treasury yields, as I said in the briefing  All else being equal, the majority of that would have   passed through to private borrowing rates—maybe not the entirety of it, but the large majority of   it   What actually happened on the FOMC announcement was that private borrowing rates   did not go down for lower-quality issuers, that spreads widened immediately  But I would   interpret that spread widening as more of a reaction to the concerns about the economy and the   pessimism that was in the FOMC statement that apparently surprised market participants, rather   than a lack of pass-through from the Twist action itself     It wasn’t that Twist only affects Treasuries and nothing else  We do think that arbitrage,   all else being equal, would have pulled down the private borrowing rates  You see that in the   reaction of the 30-year swap rate  The 30-year swap rate, in terms of credit risk, is somewhat   complicated  It does have a credit risk premium in it related to the LIBOR that it is referenced   to  It is not the credit risk of lending to a firm for 30 years, but it is essentially the credit risk of   promising to lend to a bank that will be in the LIBOR panel for those 30 years  That means it   has a much smaller credit risk component than corporate yields  You can look at this and   basically, from the relative movement of swaps and Treasuries, assess whether Treasury yield   November 1–2, 2011 108 of 282              movements pass through to private rates, all else being equal, and then add on top of that the   effects on credit quality   In terms of assessed credit quality, for sure it has been a seesaw  The market repriced to   much wider credit spreads through early October associated with pessimism about the economy   and concerns about risks emanating from Europe  It is the same pattern we saw with the   financials and their CDS spreads, and so on  Then, as sentiment improved—which was the old   theme of the briefing, as Europe seemed a little better and the data came in—that is really what   led to a substantial narrowing of the corporate bond spreads  But my guess is, as we seesaw   here, if this pessimism we have seen in the past two days persists, we will again start to see some   upward pressure on corporate yield spreads    No, I don’t  We didn’t run down that story    Yes, that would be very easy for us to ask about  We just haven’t done it   yet    That is related to one of the three broad concerns I talked about  Would   there be uncertainty about the client’s ability to change positions?  Would there be confusion   about what the status of their assets was or not?  And as Vice Chairman Dudley mentioned,   without the quick transfer of the client accounts, it leaves this uncertainty  I don’t know enough   about the legal arrangements to answer the questions you raise  But how long that will take and   how transparent it will be in terms of when the customers will be able to reaccess their positions   is one of the big areas of uncertainty here    Right, exactly  You have these relationships not only at FCMs but also   through prime brokers, and so on  When we saw some of the pressure on the financials, such as   Morgan Stanley, through early October, there was a lot of focus on the prime-brokerage   relationships  We talked to some hedge funds who were actually trying to figure out how to   hedge those exposures, so generally, that is a piece of the story about stress at any institution    At best slightly more comfortable, but actually probably about the same    As I noted, what happened a few weeks ago with Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs was the   same dynamic  Taking Morgan Stanley as an example, based on their discussions about the   firm’s exposures, I think market participants weren’t convinced that the firm actually had   problematic exposures, but what they were convinced about was the fact that if the market got   too concerned, they could put Morgan Stanley out of business because of their reliance on short-  term funding markets  I think that contributed a lot to the jitters that emerged in early October,   and it is the same dynamic that ultimately brought down MF Global  But I do want to emphasize   that MF Global is a very different case than a Morgan Stanley, in terms of the aggressiveness—  relative to its size—of how MF Global was positioned    No    Right    The new primary dealer policy just increases the transparency about the   requirements  There was no reduction in the requirements to be a primary dealer  When we look   at the primary dealers as candidates, there is an extensive review  It covers quality of   management, the quality of their systems, their financial health, and so on  But we are at a   November 1–2, 2011 113 of 282              disadvantage  We are not a supervisor of this firm  There is a credit review  They passed the   credit review  But that doesn’t guarantee that they can’t go downhill  As we see in the market   price and everything, they went downhill very quickly and very unexpectedly    Right, that’s what I’m saying  Equity prices went down sharply on the   FOMC announcement  If the story were just a preferred habitat, so that Operation Twist only   affected Treasuries and didn’t affect corporates and that explained the widening of spreads, that   alone wouldn’t cause a big decline in equity prices  Clearly the market read the FOMC   statement as more pessimistic than expected and repriced equities and corporate bonds   accordingly    I would argue that what we have seen from the experiences with the Federal   Reserve policies is that there clearly is preferred habitat across the Treasury curve, across   maturities  I would imagine that, to a large degree, you would see some of that preferred habitat   pass through on the corporate side as well  I wouldn’t view corporates as a single asset class   where duration doesn’t matter  Are you asking if the degree of market segmentation is greater in   Treasuries than in corporates across maturities?  That is a bit harder    Right  Maybe I’m missing the connection there, but—    I’m not sure what the corporate arbitrage is here  I don’t think there is an   incentive for them to equalize their corporate yields across the yield curve or something, if that’s   what you mean      My sense is that it’s not being shrugged off as easily this time  There is a   lot of discussion about this, and it’s a serious potential problem  You see it in the prices  The   CDS spreads have come in much more or have come in even in cases where the cash spreads   have not, so I think you’re already starting to see some slippage in the prices  And if they are no   longer effective as a hedging instrument, it would have the implications that you raised    I think that’s what received a lot of attention in markets  Just to be clear, I   had thought the first two paragraphs of that statement were essentially marking to market in a   way that was pretty obvious  But market participants actually took a more negative signal from   it than I had anticipated    Yes, I would imagine their expectation is that that clause would be   repeated  We didn’t ask that explicitly, but certainly given the volatility in markets and the   November 1–2, 2011 199 of 282              uncertainties that they see, I think they wouldn’t be surprised to have that sentence repeated with   the word “significant”     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Concerns about whether an orderly  resolution to the European sovereign debt crisis can be achieved have intensified  further, dominating developments in global financial markets in recent weeks   Investors have come to view the measures that were agreed to in October,  including the possibility of leveraging the EFSF funds using private capital, as  inadequate to provide a credible backstop to European sovereign debt markets  The  absence of this backstop, along with the decision to include a larger degree of private- sector participation in the voluntary restructuring of Greek debt, has put considerable  pressure on European sovereign debt markets  Yields on Italian and Spanish debt  have increased over 100 basis points over the past three weeks, with the 10-year yield  approaching 7 percent in Spain and surpassing that level in Italy  Liquidity in these  securities has deteriorated significantly as the perceived risk has increased   At this point, the only backstop in the market is the purchases of sovereign debt  by the European Central Bank under its Securities Markets Programme  However,  the ECB is seen as somewhat reluctant to perform this role, and its purchases have  been paired with a constant reminder from European officials that the ECB cannot  provide monetary financing to governments  Many observers feel that the ECB will  not take a more aggressive approach until there is greater clarity on a longer-term  solution to Europe’s fiscal challenges, which will likely take some time   Given these circumstances, investors have increasingly considered the possibility  of a more disorderly outcome for the euro area, including broader debt restructuring  or changes in the composition of the currency union  Reflecting such concerns, core  European countries have increasingly been swept into the negative market dynamics   Ten-year yields in France, Austria, Belgium, and the Netherlands have all come under  upward pressure, increasing by 50 to 150 basis points since the most recent FOMC  meeting  Even German debt yields began to rise last week, with investors’ concerns  reflected in a very weak auction of 10-year debt   The anxiety about European sovereign debt is also apparent in the CDS written on  that debt  At this point, five-year CDS is at 555 basis points for Italy, 488 basis  points for Spain, 408 basis points for Belgium, 245 basis points for France, and  117 basis points for Germany  Those compare with a CDS rate of just 59 basis points  for the United States despite our own set of fiscal issues   The intensification of concerns about European sovereign debt has weighed on  the prices of risky assets broadly, with the S&P 500 index off about 10 percent since  the Friday before the most recent FOMC meeting  Over that period, corporate bond  spreads and other private debt spreads have widened notably, and Treasury yields  have fallen  The dollar has appreciated, including a sharp gain against the euro   The financial sector has been under the most significant pressure over this period,  with equity indexes for US banks and financial institutions falling 15 to 20 percent   This repricing appears to be driven by worries about direct exposures to European  markets as well as by concerns about the indirect channels through which an   November 28, 2011 6 of 40              unraveling of the situation in Europe could create difficulties for US firms  Equity  prices of many European financial firms have fallen even more sharply than those of  US firms over this period   For European banks, investors’ concerns have transmitted into greater difficulties  obtaining short-term funding  These firms have faced increasing costs for borrowing  euros in the market, with three-month euro LIBOR moving to a spread of nearly  100 basis points above the OIS rate  Moreover, some European firms have turned  more heavily to the ECB for funding, causing euro-denominated funding provided by  the ECB to increase sharply, particularly for Italian and French banks   European banks have also continued to face pressures on their short-term dollar  funding  As we have described before, consistent access to unsecured dollar funding  has been limited to tenors of one week or less for most European firms  Moreover,  the implied three-month dollar funding rate that could be obtained by borrowing at  euro LIBOR and using FX swaps to convert to dollars has moved up sharply,  reaching 200 basis points last week  Liquidity in the FX swaps market has worsened  for horizons beyond one month   Based on these conditions, the ECB’s operations to provide 84-day dollar funding  at a rate of 100 basis points above the OIS rate under the current swap arrangements  would be well in the money  Indeed, it is somewhat disappointing that the presence  of these arrangements has not provided a more effective cap on dollar funding rates  for European banks  As Steve Kamin will describe, the staff is proposing a reduction  in the pricing of the dollar swap lines to 50 basis points above the OIS rate  The ECB  and our other central bank counterparties hope that this repricing will encourage a  greater willingness of firms to participate at the dollar funding operations, and hence  result in a more effective cap on their dollar funding rates   The story for US financial institutions is more positive, as these firms have not  experienced notable difficulties obtaining short-term funding  Dollar-based LIBOR  rates have moved higher, even for the US banks included in the panel, and forward  rates suggest that this rise is expected to continue  However, the increase has been far  smaller than that in euro-based rates  Moreover, US banks are not borrowing much  in the term unsecured funding market, as they generally have considerable liquidity  from other sources   Another key consideration is that short-term secured funding markets appear to be  holding their ground  Indeed, repo markets continue to function normally for  Treasury and agency debt collateral  Even for nontraditional collateral, there has  been no meaningful change in haircuts, and bid–asked spreads have moved up only  slightly in recent months   However, even though short-term funding markets for US institutions appear to  be functioning fairly well, we see considerable risk that the funding situation could  change abruptly  The recent developments at MF Global serve as a reminder that  funding can dry up quickly for a firm that is seen as having too much risk exposure    November 28, 2011 7 of 40              Such concerns may be more pressing when markets are as volatile as they have been  of late, and it seems likely that this volatility will continue as investors have to  contend with a wide range of possible policy outcomes in Europe   Moreover, the US financial sector is still in the process of recovering from the  events of recent years and adjusting to a changed environment  A notable risk in this  regard is that at least one rating agency is likely to take near-term actions to  downgrade US financial firms, reflecting a systematic review of its government  support assumptions for these firms   Lastly, it should be noted that CDS rates and longer-term debt spreads for US  financial firms have moved up again, reaching very elevated levels  Indeed, as of last  Friday, five-year CDS rates were more than 500 basis points for Morgan Stanley and  more than 400 basis points for Bank of America and Goldman Sachs  These rates  imply that it will be difficult, or at least quite costly, for these firms to roll over their  longer-term debt as it matures   Overall, even though most US financial firms have ample liquidity today and are  not experiencing notable difficulties with short-term funding, the financial sector  continues to face a range of risks going forward, and it could quickly come under  significant pressure in response to a disorderly outcome in Europe  Steve Kamin will  now continue the presentation    Yes, 120 percent   November 28, 2011 11 of 40              1  Financial markets have remained volatile, with investors heavily  focused on the policy steps taken to address the European sovereign debt crisis and  the associated pressures on bank funding   Market sentiment had improved notably in advance of last week’s summit of  European Union leaders, as investors hoped for considerable progress toward  establishing mechanisms that would ensure fiscal discipline by European  governments and strengthen the support available to those governments if needed   Many market participants thought that those steps would open the door to more  aggressive purchases of European sovereign bonds in the secondary market by the  European Central Bank  These expectations contributed to a sharp narrowing of the  spreads on Spanish, Italian, and French debt, as shown in the upper-left panel of your  first exhibit   However, market expectations apparently got a bit ahead of reality  Important  policy steps were in fact agreed to at the EU summit, as Steve Kamin will review   However, they do not put to rest the risks associated with sovereign debt, and many  uncertainties remain about the implementation and enforceability of the steps taken   Moreover, comments by ECB President Draghi ahead of the summit were seen as  backing away from more aggressive bond purchases, and ECB officials gave no  indication after the summit of a shift in that posture  In response to these  developments, the spreads on those debt securities again turned higher in recent days,  reversing much of the earlier declines   Needless to say, market participants see the situation surrounding European  sovereign debt as very uncertain, resulting in remarkable volatility in these securities  and very poor liquidity at times  This is not the type of environment that is conducive  to attracting private capital back to the market, which is of great concern considering  that Italy and Spain have financing needs in excess of €500 billion next year  These  tensions are further exacerbated by the decision by S&P to place the long-term credit  ratings of 15 euro-zone countries and the EFSF on negative credit watch  Moody’s  yesterday also indicated that it would review the sovereign ratings of euro-area  countries   In contrast to the uncertainties surrounding the support of sovereign debt, central  banks took clear and decisive steps regarding the provision of liquidity to the  financial sector  The ECB announced that it would extend its fixed-rate, full- allotment operations in euros to a horizon of three years, and it made several  adjustments that will help loosen the constraints that some banks are facing on the                                                     1 The materials used by Mr Sack are appended to this transcript (appendix 1)   December 13, 2011 4 of 198              availability of collateral for such operations  As shown in the upper-right panel,  banks have been tapping the ECB’s facilities for larger amounts of euro liquidity in  recent months, with much of the increased borrowing coming from French and Italian  banks   Of course, central banks also took actions to address global funding needs in  dollars  On November 30, the Federal Reserve, along with five central bank  counterparties, announced changes to the liquidity swap arrangements, including the  decision to reduce the rate on those transactions to 50 basis points over the OIS rate   The reaction in financial markets was favorable  The implied dollar funding rate that  could be obtained through FX swaps fell about 40 basis points after the  announcement, as shown in the middle-left panel  Moreover, while the dollar LIBOR  rate did not react, a forward measure of the rate came down about 15 basis points, as  shown to the right   The first set of operations by the foreign central banks to inject dollar funding  under this new pricing saw a meaningful pickup in demand  In particular, the ECB  received nearly $51 billion of bids at its 84-day dollar operation last week, spread  across 34 bidders, and about $1½ billion at its 7-day operation  This outcome was  seen as encouraging, as the broad participation suggested that the stigma around the  swap lines had been reduced  The Bank of Japan placed nearly $5 billion at its  84-day operation earlier today, while other central banks saw minimal participation in  their operations   The policy measures taken in recent weeks have also affected the amount of risk  that investors perceive for the financial sector  Five-year CDS rates for major  European and US financial institutions, shown in the bottom-left panel, came off  their peaks in response to the swap line announcement and to hopes about the  outcome of the EU summit  However, these measures remain quite elevated, as the  tensions surrounding the European situation are seen as presenting some systemic risk  for the financial sector  In addition, some of the largest domestic banks and broker– dealers were downgraded by S&P as a result of a new methodology that the company  is employing  However, the downgrades were largely expected and did not elicit any  notable response in financial markets   The financial stress in Europe, along with increasing evidence of a sharper  slowdown in European economic growth, caused the euro to weaken notably against  the dollar, as shown in the bottom-right panel  The dollar has strengthened more  broadly since the summer, as indicated by the trade-weighted index, in part because  of safe-haven flows into dollar assets   As highlighted in the upper-left panel of your second exhibit, US equity prices  have also been driven to a large extent by European developments  After falling early  in the intermeeting period, equity prices rebounded sharply in response to the swap  line announcement and in expectation of possible actions at the EU summit  On  balance, the S&P index ended the intermeeting period modestly higher   December 13, 2011 5 of 198              Equity prices were also supported by the backdrop of favorable US economic  data  As shown in the upper-right panel, the economic data generally came in above  expectations, leading investors to revise up their projections for fourth-quarter GDP  growth  However, judging from the Desk’s survey of primary dealers, market  participants have not raised their GDP forecasts over the next two years  Indeed,  respondents continue to expect the recovery to be modest, with the median forecasts  of GDP growth in 2012 and 2013 coming in at 21 percent and 25 percent,  respectively  The unemployment rate is expected to remain elevated, and inflation is  expected to be low   The strains that are present in Europe are seen by market participants as an  important factor weighing on the outlook for the US economy  In its survey, the  Desk asked how the dealers’ forecasts for 2012 US GDP growth would be affected  by a timely and convincing resolution of the European fiscal and banking situation   As shown in the middle-left panel, the responses were fairly evenly distributed over a  wide range, suggesting that it is difficult to calibrate the effects  Nevertheless, many  of the responses indicated fairly sizable effects, with the median response at  ½ percentage point of annual GDP growth  In addition, market participants likely see  the situation in Europe as presenting significant downside risks around the baseline  forecast  Indeed, many respondents to the survey indicated that the risks to their GDP  forecasts are skewed to the downside   The subpar economic outlook has supported the view that monetary policy will  remain accommodative for a long period, which has kept Treasury yields at very low  levels  As shown in the middle-right panel, Treasury yields were little changed, on  balance, over the intermeeting period, with the 10-year yield currently near 2 percent   Primary dealers continue to nudge out their expectations for the path of the federal  funds rate  As shown in the bottom-left panel, respondents see a nearly 50 percent  probability that the first policy tightening will not occur until the second quarter of  2014 or later   The Desk’s survey also asked primary dealers about the likelihood of additional  policy steps  As reported in the bottom-right panel, while dealers are generally not  anticipating such steps at this meeting, they see considerable odds of several types of  actions taking place over the next year, with an 80 percent probability assigned to  changing the guidance for the federal funds rate and a 60 percent probability assigned  to expanding the balance sheet further  While we did not ask about it in the survey,  market participants seem to expect that further balance sheet expansion, if it occurs,  will be partly or fully concentrated in MBS   The survey also included a question about the likelihood of two structural changes  to FOMC communications over the next year  About 75 percent of respondents said  that they expect the FOMC to provide more information on its policy objectives, such  as specifying its longer-run inflation goal  A similar portion expects the FOMC to  provide information about participants’ assessment of appropriate monetary policy in  the Summary of Economic Projections   December 13, 2011 6 of 198              I should briefly note that the publication of the Desk survey questions did not  attract a large amount of attention and was generally described as a useful step toward  greater transparency  Our plan is to publish aggregated responses to the survey the  day after the release of the FOMC minutes   Your third exhibit turns to recent Desk operations and developments in the  SOMA portfolio  The Desk continues to implement the reinvestment program into  agency mortgage-backed securities  This program will prevent a further decline in  our MBS holdings, shown by the red area in the upper-left panel  In fact, these  holdings will slowly increase to crowd out the light blue area on the chart, as we are  also reinvesting our maturing agency debt into MBS  Over time, if this reinvestment  approach were maintained and no additional policy steps were taken, the MBS  holdings in SOMA would settle at about $1 trillion, or just over 35 percent of the  domestic assets held in the portfolio   We have had no difficulties executing our MBS purchases, and those transactions  appear to have taken place at prices close to those observed in other market  transactions  This pattern can be seen in the chart on the upper right, which shows  our execution prices (the red dots) relative to the range of prices reported by broker– dealers on those days through the TRACE system (the blue area)   In an important change to the MBS program, the Desk implemented a margin  requirement for our unsettled MBS purchases  Recall that our MBS purchases settle  on a forward basis over periods that can extend out several months  This creates a  counterparty exposure when unsettled trades move in a favorable direction for us  because the failure of a dealer in those circumstances would leave us having to  replace those unsettled trades at a higher price  As I noted in my briefing at the  November FOMC meeting, ahead of the failure of MF Global, the Desk asked for  cash margin from that firm to cover this risk  We have now moved to a regime in  which we require this type of margining from all of the dealers to reduce such  exposures   The amount of margin that the dealers have to post as collateral is updated every  day based on the market value of our unsettled transactions  The middle-left panel  shows the amounts that dealers had provided as of last Friday  In aggregate, the  margin from dealers that day totaled nearly $2 billion  Even though the margin  requirement is an additional burden for the dealers, we have seen no obvious  deterioration in the quality of the bids that we receive on MBS purchases since the  new regime went into place   I also wanted to highlight another development related to our MBS reinvestments,  which is that the Desk has been engaging in dollar roll transactions  As mentioned  earlier, the MBS purchases that we conduct could be for delivery in any of the  subsequent several months  The Desk makes a judgment about which settlement  month to operate in based on the expected amount of production of MBS in those  months  However, subsequent changes in production and other factors can cause  either a scarcity or abundance of securities that are available for settlement  In   December 13, 2011 7 of 198              response to such developments, the Desk has been engaging in dollar roll transactions  to adjust the timing of the settlement of our trades  In particular, using dollar rolls,  we brought forward the settlement of some of our purchases of 35 percent coupons  from January to December   In terms of our other set of current open market operations, the Desk has been  implementing the maturity extension program in Treasury securities  As shown in the  middle-right panel, to date the Desk has purchased just over $107 billion of securities  in the 6- to 30-year maturity sector and has sold about $100 billion of securities in the  0- to 3-year maturity sector  Thus, we are roughly one-fourth of the way through the  $400 billion program  As can be seen, these operations have been well received, with  sizable bid-to-cover ratios  The table also shows the difference in the duration  between the securities that have been purchased and those that have been sold  Given  that difference in duration, the program so far has removed, on net, about $100 billion  of 10-year equivalents from the market, despite little change in the overall size of the  SOMA portfolio   The final two exhibits focus on the euro-denominated reverse repurchase  agreements that are held in the SOMA portfolio  As you know, these investments  accept six types of sovereign debt as collateral—that from Germany, France, the  Netherlands, Belgium, Italy, and Spain  As shown in the bottom-left panel, the  volatility of this collateral has increased over the second half of 2011, particularly for  Belgian, Italian, and Spanish debt  This volatility has reduced the effectiveness of our  2 percent haircut on this collateral in these transactions, raising the risk that the  SOMA would face losses in the event of a counterparty default   However, the shift to our new approach of accepting offers that are specific to  each of the six types of collateral has helped to offset this risk  Under our previous  regime, about 60 percent of the collateral being presented in these transactions was  Belgian, Italian, and Spanish debt, as shown by the light blue bars in the panel on the  bottom right  With the new regime, we have eliminated the incentive for our  counterparties to deliver us disproportionate amounts of that collateral, and we have  imposed other steps to better control the distribution of collateral  In response, the  collateral in these transactions has shifted significantly toward German securities, as  indicated by the dark blue bars   Overall, as you can see, we have had a lot going on at the Desk in recent weeks    It’s mostly your fault, but we’ll put a little bit of blame on Europe, too    What we’ve done with that question to reduce the information content that   this question could present, is to ask about this entire range of possibilities on both the easing   side and the tightening side  And we ask about probabilities for this meeting one year ahead and   two years ahead on both sides  We wanted to present a full range of possibilities that has been   discussed in the public    Well, what it is intended to mean is to provide explicit guidance on the path   of the SOMA portfolio  To some extent, the Committee has already done this in that its exit   principles have laid out sequencing of portfolio adjustments relative to the adjustment in the   funds rate    Right  The exact question is “provide guidance over the period over which   the SOMA will remain at the current level”  But that’s in the wording of this question for a   number of surveys now    We are comfortable with the performance so far  That was an area of the   yield curve that we were somewhat worried about as we structured the maturity extension   program  Of course, the reason we ended up proposing such a large allotment that far out was to   get the duration effects within the maturity extension program  Given the limits of that program,   you have to shift your purchases farther out to get the effects  But we did have some concerns   because the liquidity of the bond sector is not as good as the rest of the curve, and as you saw, in   asset purchase programs where we had the flexibility essentially to choose wherever on the curve   we want to operate, we tended to focus more in the 2 to 10-ish sector in part because of the   greater liquidity  Having said all that, I think we’re comfortable with the performance so far    There are no obvious problems being created by our purchases  We’re seeing some worsening of   liquidity out there in recent weeks, but we attribute that more to year-end effects, so we’ll   continue to watch that    You’re right  Inventories have fallen a lot, and that’s part of a story that   market participants have been telling about liquidity being very poor in corporate bonds  Some   of that has likely had to do with the large shifts in investors’ risk preferences and at times with   concerns about all types of risk assets  Again, in part it may have to do with approaching year-  end  It’s something we can continue to watch, but, yes, liquidity hasn’t been great in corporate   bonds    That’s correct    You’re asking about how much of the total stock of pass-throughs—    Right  Alternative A in the Tealbook has an asset purchase program of   $500 billion focused in mortgage-backed securities  We made a judgment that that was within   the capacity of the Desk, in terms of the flow and the stock that we’d end up taking out under   that program  If the Committee were interested in scaling up the program meaningfully above   December 13, 2011 11 of 198              that, we’d have to explore just how far we think we could go, but at a minimum it would   certainly require extending the duration of that program so that it’s executed over a longer   period    The $500 billion?    Probably not quite to 30 percent, but we could check the number and let   you know    We struggled with this  I will admit that’s not an overly precise question    [Laughter]  We wanted to at least try to calibrate some of the effects of Europe in the baseline   forecast, and it was actually hard to write a question to do that  We wrote it in terms of   measuring how things would improve if there were a policy solution, but of course, we couldn’t   be overly precise by what we meant by a policy solution  Take that question for what it’s worth    We gave some sense of the calibration of these effects, but we’re all   realizing it’s not a very precise question    We have primarily been interested in using the survey to get the views of   financial market participants  At times we’ve gone beyond the primary dealers to include a   number of buy-side firms who would have views, but again, still in a set of respondents closely   associated with financial markets  I’d like to view the purpose of this survey as really trying to   gauge the expectations incorporated into asset prices  That doesn’t mean there are not other   groups beyond financial market participants who have very informed views about these issues,   but I wouldn’t leave it to the Desk to explore those    The $40 billion per month was calibrated based on the gross amount of   MBS production that we are seeing  The $40 billion, on top of the $25 to $30 billion a month of   reinvestment you are already doing, would be a good chunk of the gross production  Of course,   in terms of net supply, there is basically no increase or very little increase in the mortgage   market  Even though this is calibrated to be not too much of gross production, we still need to be   displacing investors over time  That will introduce a limit on how far you could go with this    But you could go through 2012, because that’s what was calibrated to be comparable to the   $500 billion in A3  You could go well beyond that since you are spreading it out, but obviously   not indefinitely, because you are basically eating up a larger and larger share of the market
