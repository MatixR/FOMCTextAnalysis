1  Yes  I am going to refer to the charts that were distributed  They  don’t have a cover on them, but the words “Smoothness of the Federal Funds Rate”  are at the top of the first chart  For some time, economists have noted that monetary  policy rates in major industrialized countries tend to change only gradually A case in  point is the intended federal funds rate, plotted in the top panel of exhibit 1 As can be  seen, the stance of policy is typically adjusted in sequences of relatively small steps in  the same direction  Over the sample shown, nine out of ten of the policy actions  moved in the same direction as the previous change  Moreover, nearly all of the  policy moves in the sample were 50 basis points or less     The smoothness of the federal funds rate can be captured more formally by   estimating simple monetary policy rules that measure the systematic response of the  policy instrument to key macroeconomic variables  An example is shown in the  bottom left panel  In this equation, as in John Taylor’s original specification, the  quarterly average level of the federal funds rate is assumed to respond to the current  output gap and the inflation rate over the previous year  However, in this version we  also allow the previous quarter’s federal funds rate to enter the equation  Estimating  this rule using real-time data from 1987 through 2000, we find that the coefficient on  the lagged policy rate is strongly significant and not far below unity—a finding that is  common in the research literature This coefficient causes predicted movements in the  federal funds rate to be more inertial than otherwise       Right, so the R² is very high—it’s 096—reflecting that the lagged   dependent variable soaks up a lot of the explanatory power                                                     1 The materials used by Messrs Sack, Tetlow, Croushore, and Rudebusch are appended to this transcript (appendix  1)   January 28-29, 2003 10 of 195      One can also express the R² in terms of the model’s ability to predict   interest rate changes instead of the level, and there it falls off a good degree—down to 042  So   part of this, as you noted, is that the level of the funds rate is very predictable     Of course, simple rules such as this one provide only a rough  description of actual policy decisions, and it would not be surprising if the parameters  of these rules would change over time  One possible incidence of this is hinted at by  the easing of 2001, highlighted in the bottom right panel, which was more rapid than  would have been expected under the policy rule estimated through 2000  This  episode brings into sharper focus the question of the appropriate speed of adjustment  for monetary policy, which is the topic of this briefing  More specifically, we  investigate whether gradual movements in the federal funds rate are desirable in terms  of achieving the macroeconomic objectives of the Federal Reserve—maximum  sustainable employment and price stability     As summarized in the top panel of exhibit 2, we consider the monetary policy rule   that would be optimal assuming that the FOMC desires to limit squared deviations of  inflation from a target level and of the unemployment rate from its equilibrium level  over all future periods  Inflation and unemployment deviations are penalized equally,  and the target for core PCE inflation is taken to be 1½ percent  Note that  policymakers do not have a direct preference for smoothness in the federal funds rate   The exercise also assumes that FRB/US is the correct characterization of the  economy  We can compute the policy that maximizes the assumed objectives of the  FOMC given that model, assuming that the policy is required to have the same form  as the estimated rule from the prior exhibit     As shown in the middle left panel, the coefficients of the calculated policy rule,   which we will refer to as the “optimal” rule, differ considerably from those of the  estimated rule  In particular, the optimal rule is much more responsive to current  economic conditions, as indicated by the larger coefficients on inflation and the  output gap, and is much less inertial, as indicated by the smaller coefficient on the  lagged federal funds rate  We will focus on both of these characteristics, since each  of them would increase the volatility of the federal funds rate relative to the estimated  policy rule      January 28-29, 2003 11 of 195    The more aggressive nature of the optimal policy rule can be seen by looking at  its prescription for the path of the federal funds rate going forward, assuming that the  economy will be subject to the sequence of shocks implied by the Greenbook  projection  As shown by the dotted line in the middle right panel, the optimal rule  calls for an immediate easing of policy to zero percent in order to boost output toward  potential more quickly and then a substantial tightening over the second half of this  year to unwind the accommodative stance of policy  By contrast, the path of the  federal funds rate under the estimated policy rule, the solid line, is much more stable   The panel also shows the policymaker perfect foresight path that appears in the  Bluebook (the dashed line labeled PPF)  This path is computed from an exercise that  is similar to the one just described, but with two important differences  First,  policymakers are endowed with more information, including knowledge of the  sequence of shocks that will be hitting the economy in the future  Second,  policymakers are assumed to have a preference for a smooth path of the federal funds  rate  This latter assumption importantly influences the shape of the PPF path  If the  smoothing preference were removed, the PPF policy would push the federal funds  rate immediately to zero  Thus, the PPF exercise also suggests that monetary policy  should be much more aggressive in the absence of a preference for smoothing     At first glance, it might seem surprising that the optimal policy calls for   movements in the funds rate that are so much more aggressive and volatile than those  observed  As described in the lower panel, these characteristics of the optimal rule  hinge on three key assumptions underlying this exercise  First, we assumed that the  private sector continues to form its expectations as if the FOMC were following its  historical policy rule, even when the true policy differs considerably  This  assumption implies that large policy moves have sizable effects on the yield curve  and on real activity, because private agents do not expect those actions to be quickly  reversed  Second, we assumed that the FOMC knows the structure of the economy  with certainty and in particular faces no uncertainty about the impact of its policy  actions, no matter how drastic they are  Third, we assumed that the FOMC is able to  observe the current state of the economy perfectly That is, there is no measurement  error in the macroeconomic data or in policymakers’ estimates of potential output and  other unobserved variables  Under these circumstances, there is nothing to prevent  the central bank from pushing very hard on the economy to achieve its objectives;  hence the optimal monetary policy responds aggressively to macroeconomic variables  and is quick to reverse course  But clearly these three assumptions do not hold in  practice In the next three exhibits, we investigate the implications of relaxing each  assumption in turn     MRTETLOW  As just noted, the finding that the federal funds rate should be   very aggressive under the optimal policy depends crucially on the manner in which  private agents form their expectations, the subject of exhibit 3  The previous exercise  assumed that those expectations are formed under the belief that the FOMC is  following its historical policy rule, even if that rule is changed going forward  In  practice, private agents are likely to take into account changes in the way policy is  implemented   January 28-29, 2003 12 of 195      Consider what happens when the private sector understands the policy rule that   the central bank is actually using  As summarized in the top panel, if policymakers  are following an inertial policy rule, private agents will expect the initial response of  the federal funds rate to a macroeconomic shock to be followed by additional policy  changes in the same direction  Moreover, those actions will be expected to unwind  only gradually as the shock dissipates  Expectations of this persistent response of  policy will be incorporated into current asset prices and economic decisions, thus  bringing forward the effects of those future policy actions  As a result, an inertial  policy response can have an immediate and sizable impact on economic variables,  even with relatively small movements in the federal funds rate in each period  By  contrast, the large but transitory movements in the federal funds rate that were found  to be optimal in the previous exhibit will be less effective, because private agents will  recognize the change in the policy rule and look through the near-term swings in the  interest rate     To illustrate the importance of this consideration, we conduct an experiment in   which the public forms its expectations as a weighted average of forward- and  backward-looking terms  As the middle panel notes, the degree of forward-looking  behavior is governed by a single parameter, φ  When φ equals zero, the model  corresponds to the version of FRB/US used in exhibit 2, in which expectations are  formed using a “backward-looking” vector autoregression (VAR) model  When φ  equals unity, expectations are rational—meaning that households and firms fully  understand the structure of the model and the policy rule in forming their  expectations      With this set-up, we can calculate the optimal policy rule for different degrees of   forward-looking behavior  As shown in the bottom left panel, the optimal coefficient  on the lagged federal funds rate moves higher as the parameter φ increases  That is,  the optimal monetary policy rule becomes more inertial when the public is forward- looking, since expectations of future policy actions lead to larger and more-persistent  movements in bond rates and other asset prices that effectively counterbalance the  persistent effects of macroeconomic disturbances  Note, however, that the historical  estimate of the coefficient on the lagged federal funds rate (076) is reached only  when expectations are formed in an almost completely forward-looking manner  The  bottom right panel shows the complete optimal policy rule for three choices of the  degree of forward-looking behavior  As just noted, in the case in which φ equals  unity, the coefficient on the lagged policy rate is quite high—even higher than that  from the estimated rule  Nevertheless, the coefficients on the output gap and inflation  are about three times larger than their estimated values  Thus, the optimal rule still  calls for much more volatile movements in the federal funds rate than are observed     Another possible source of gradualism in policy setting is parameter uncertainty,   the topic of exhibit 4  In the analysis so far, policymakers have been assumed to  know the exact structure of the economy; uncertainty has entered only through  additive error terms  To see the effects of this assumption, consider the situation in   January 28-29, 2003 13 of 195    the top left panel, which shows the relationship between the output gap (plotted on  the horizontal axis), and the real interest rate, r, relative to its equilibrium level, r*  (plotted on the vertical axis)  The solid line represents policymakers’ best estimate of  the level of the output gap that would be realized at any given setting of the real  interest rate  But because of an additive error term, the realized outcome could lie  above or below the central estimate, as indicated by the shaded region  As noted in  the top right panel, the amount of uncertainty is not affected by the policy decision   For this reason, it turns out that additive uncertainty has no effect on the optimal  policy setting  That is, policymakers should ignore the uncertainty and set policy  based on their best estimate of the likely outcome for macroeconomic variables     However, this framework neglects the obvious fact that policymakers face   considerable uncertainty about the values of key parameters in their models of the  economy  To see the implications of this type of uncertainty, suppose policymakers  are unsure of the value of the policy multiplier, as shown in the middle left panel   The policymakers’ best estimate of the relationship again is represented by the solid  line, but the actual slope of the relationship could be higher or lower  In those  circumstances, policymakers face more uncertainty about the outcome for the output  gap the further the real interest rate deviates from its equilibrium level, as indicated  by the shaded region  As we note in the middle right panel, this example highlights  the key implication of parameter uncertainty—that uncertainty about future economic  conditions will be importantly affected by current monetary policy decisions—a  factor that policymakers should take into account in formulating those decisions   Under the objectives assumed, policymakers will tend to shade their policy actions  toward choices that reduce uncertainty about future levels of unemployment and  inflation  Of course, the middle left panel presents just one specific example of  parameter uncertainty  Many other parameters are also unknown, in which case the  variance-minimizing policy will not be to hold the real interest rate at its equilibrium  level  In general, the effects of parameter uncertainty depend crucially on which  parameters are unknown and on the variances and covariances of those parameters     Unfortunately, the complexity of FRB/US makes it difficult to incorporate   parameter uncertainty directly into simulations of that model  But we can quantify  the effects of parameter uncertainty using the simpler VAR model utilized to  characterize expectations in FRB/US  As summarized in the bottom left panel, the  VAR captures the dynamics of key macroeconomic variables, including inflation and  the output gap  In addition, the VAR provides a convenient measure of parameter  uncertainty—namely, the variance-covariance matrix of the estimated coefficients   We can use this measure to assess the effect of parameter uncertainty on the optimal  monetary policy rule     The results are shown in the bottom right panel in two steps  We first compute   the optimal policy rule that ignores parameter uncertainty by assuming that the  estimated coefficients from the VAR are known with certainty  As shown in the first  line of the table, the optimal policy under those assumptions is much more aggressive  than the estimated policy rule, as reflected in the larger coefficients on the output gap   January 28-29, 2003 14 of 195    and inflation and the smaller coefficient on the lagged policy rate  These findings are  qualitatively similar to those found earlier using the FRB/US model  However, when  we allow policymakers to recognize that the coefficients of the VAR are uncertain,  they choose a policy with smaller coefficients on inflation and the output gap and a  larger coefficient on the lagged interest rate  Parameter uncertainty therefore moves  the optimal rule in the direction of the estimated rule, but it seems to fall well short of  explaining the observed degree of smoothness in the federal funds rate       May I also try to clarify that?  The estimated policy rule from our analysis   would actually be consistent with your impression of the 2001 episode  That episode did look as   if the policy moves were much more rapid than would have been predicted by the estimated   policy rule  It’s hard to assess because there are only a few data points in a quarterly policy rule    But if you let the rule choose a different coefficient on the lagged funds rate for that episode, it   will put it pretty close to zero  So that episode, in the context of this rule, actually was a very   rapid policy easing relative to the average pace of policy adjustment seen from 1987 to 2000     In a recent research paper that I wrote with two colleagues, we show that it   is possible to estimate policy rules directly allowing for both factors  So we don’t necessarily   have to turn to the term structure evidence to separate them  What our paper and several other   papers have found is that clearly Glenn’s point is right  There are variables omitted from the rule   that have serial correlation, which gives some impression of gradualism  But that’s not the   whole story  In fact, when we apply these methods to our policy rule and allow for serially   correlated errors, that decreases the coefficient on the lagged federal funds rate from 076 to   056  So it reduces the degree of inertia in these rules, but there’s still a significant amount of   gradualism     Right     I think we would agree on the general point of our briefing  We’re   bickering about what the coefficient is on the lagged federal funds rate in the estimated policy   rule, but these issues don’t affect our calculations of the optimized rules and don’t affect the   main conclusion of our briefing  What we find is that these optimized rules result in very   aggressive, very volatile movements in the federal funds rate—more volatile than we see in the   data regardless of what the exact rule is  Recall that we said there are two aspects in which   policy is too smooth  The coefficients on output and inflation appear to be smaller than under   January 28-29, 2003 30 of 195    the optimal rules, and the coefficient on the lagged funds rate tends to be bigger  Even leaving   aside that second part, as Glenn alluded to in his last exhibit, these types of exercises that we   perform would still recommend larger response coefficients and more-aggressive movements in   the federal funds rate       When I said term structure, I meant the evidence that Glenn presented        It might be useful to point out as well that, while policy actions three, four,   or five quarters ahead are hard to predict, it’s not that they don’t get built into the term structure    The Board staff produces an expected path of the federal funds rate based on our readings of the   futures markets, and it commonly has policy actions built in at those horizons  In fact, the   current forecast is a good example  Policy is expected to be on hold until the fourth quarter of   2003 and then, according to our path, about 150 basis points of tightening is built in for   subsequent years  So it’s not that future actions don’t get priced in at all but that they’re not very   predictable      Well, that’s true; that could be the case as well     Actually, I think there’s surprisingly little research relating to that   explanation compared with the huge amount of literature on parameter uncertainty and model   uncertainty  As far as I know, financial fragility has more or less slipped by       Right, and I’m getting the impression that financial fragility is important!    [Laughter]     We do know a few things, though  First, markets actually have become   better at anticipating our policy actions since the early 1990s and especially since 1994  Second,   January 28-29, 2003 36 of 195    presumably markets have become better at trading and allocating risk as well  These   developments in the economy bear on this issue  But in terms of research indicating what   financial fragility does to the optimal rule, there hasn’t been very much     Another point is that, while the more aggressive rules would create   volatility in the short-term interest rate, it’s not really clear what they would do to the volatility   of prices of longer-lived assets such as long-term bonds or stocks  To the extent that these rules   are better at stabilizing the macroeconomy, they could actually reduce the volatility of those   asset prices  In other words, such rules would clearly make the volatility of the term structure   more negatively sloped  So in terms of the fragility aspects, there are a lot of subtle points like   that to think about     I’ll take the other side  If policy is inertial, what we highlight in exhibit 3   are the benefits of inertia when markets and agents are forward-looking  You provided some   very nice examples of exactly what happens in these models  In these models, policymakers by   assumption are committed to the optimal rule, which has inertia  That gives them the benefit of   bringing forward effects of anticipated, drawn-out policy responses  As you said, for example, in   the fall of 1998, expectations were that those easings would not be quickly reversed  Now, that   does imply that there will be other situations in which policymakers might want to do something   different, but they’ve committed themselves to this gradual rule  Mike Woodford has done a lot   of the research on this theory, and he talks quite a bit about the fact that policymakers often find   themselves confirming expectations of policy actions that were built in in advance  It’s   important to confirm those expectations in order to get this channel operating and to get markets   bringing forward the effects of policy actions  I think you gave some good examples of what is   going on in exhibit 3
