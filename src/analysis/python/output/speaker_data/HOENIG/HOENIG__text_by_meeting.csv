4486,1991-10-01,HOENIG," As a matter of fact it is and that's a warning to all of you  Mr Chairman, do you want to hear from our District?  I appreciate that  -25-    10/1/91  I might just make a couple of comments that might be of some value  Our District economy has been growing fairly modestly, and I think it's particularly important that this has happened in the manufacturing area as well Our automobile manufacturers are operating at capacity And while our aircraft industry, which is important in parts of our District, had a downturn in the first half, it is anticipating some recovery, which is good news for us I might mention that residential construction activity in our area has been picking up, but nonresidential has continued to languish, although not as seriously as in other parts of the country I might even mention that in Denver, although there's not a lot of activity, there is an appearance that lease rates are firming up and that is important to us  In agriculture, the situation is very similar to what you've heard here There is some strengthening in crop prices but cattle prices have been falling fairly importantly and we anticipate about a 10 percent decline in agricultural income in our part of the country Energy also is weak, particularly in the natural gas area It has been very harmful to our Oklahoma area where prices have been down and therefore rig activity has been falling as well  On the national economy, I would like to mention that our analysis is, like others, very similar to what is in the Greenbook We are a little more pessimistic in the consumption area and net exports but a little more optimistic on the investment side We think it might be even stronger if long-term rates were to continue to come down We are also in agreement with the projections on inflation being less than 4 percent We think that's a very important focus as we go forward because that will help long-term rates to come down and that will have a much more important stimulus on the national economy So with that, Mr Chairman, I'll make my remarks short Thank you  ""B"" symmetric "
4508,1991-10-30,HOENIG," Mr Chairman, this is Tom Hoenig Our region hasn't seen a lot of change since the last meeting It had already gone through a bit of disinflation and I don't see a lot of change from that Attitudes, though, continue to worsen We've had some meetings with business groups, and they are very pessimistic There is still a lot of blame being placed on the banks and, quite frankly, I think the banks have tightened their underwriting standards fairly significantly in reaction to the dramatic losses they've suffered over time So, there is that [tightening] in standards out there that the    10/30/91  business community is seeing and it is only worsening their attitudes  As far as policy goes, I would feel comfortable easing 1/4 percentage point right now As for going further with the discount rate, I don't think it would hurt to wait until next Tuesday when we can have a full airing of views and discussion of this and, based on that, then decide on the discount rate and on a further cut [in the funds rate] "
4528,1991-11-05,HOENIG," May I ask a follow-up to Tom's question? As you described the economy, there were some fundamentals in terms of real estate and some adjustments in leverages and so forth that are going to be constraining If we ease now, what in your judgment is the risk of pushing inflation [up] and compromising our ability to bring it down in the future, given these fundamental adjustments that probably should continue regardless?  The Tenth District continues to outperform the nation to some extent, although if we keep talking about it we may talk ourselves out of any improvement It's doom and gloom from a number of people, although the numbers continue to show some improvement For example, most of our automobile plants continue to operate at capacity Now, in aviation manufacturing, there has been a decline in production over [the level] a year ago and that's primarily due to a drop-off in foreign demand The District's oil and gas exploration activity remains lackluster, as it does elsewhere Drilling rigs were up very slightly in October over September and are still well below--about 23 percent below--year-ago levels In  -14-    11/5/91  agriculture, cattle prices have turned [up] and are now back to the break-even point And in the grain area, prices have increased, which has been a help in that sector Finally, the indicators of construction activity in our District quite frankly have been improving Building contracts awarded in the District in August were up 11 percent over year-ago levels Residential awards are increasing in most of our states And we're even seeing some improvement in non- residential contracts in Colorado and in New Mexico So, the District's economy is consistently showing improvements  As far as the national economy goes, we continue to forecast sustained growth although slightly weaker, as the staff is projecting Our forecasts are for a little better growth than the staff has in the first half and a little more moderate growth in the second half We see a little stronger inventory investment and some continuing strength in consumer spending; even though the attitudes are down, we don't see that dropping sharply As for inflation, we anticipate the inflation numbers will stay modest and actually fall somewhat below 4 percent So, that is how we are viewing things right now Thank you  Mr Chairman, I have some concerns about easing now in terms of inflation down the road I assume that there may be a discount rate cut If that's the case, that would make for an announcement from the Fed and then I would recommend the possibility of a 1/4 point cut on asymmetric [language toward] easing based on new information that may come to you So, I'd be slightly different  I totally support taking this action tomorrow for the very reasons that Governor Angell, Governor Kelley, and others have expressed We need to get it out "
4549,1991-12-02,HOENIG," Mr Chairman, this is Tom Hoenig Activity in our District is moving mostly sideways Agriculture is showing some weakness and energy continues to be quite weak There is some activity still in the residential construction area and some non- building contracts for infrastructure [projects] in the western part of the District Manufacturing is pretty mixed The auto industry has still been producing; [they] suggested when we talked to them that they will be cutting back shortly In the food processing industry and in nondurable goods some jobs are still being added in our area and that is balancing things out In the retail sales area, I would really prefer to say that it's a little too early to tell We've had mixed reports; some are indicating that while [dollar sales] are down the volume seems to be a little better But generally they are pretty pessimistic in that area I think that is in part due to the press as well Overall, our District continues just to hold its own; it's not showing any significant improvement At this point there's no sense of a terrible downturn or of [conditions] being great either "
4569,1991-12-17,HOENIG," Thank you, Mr Chairman Our District growth continues to be slow and we see no real improvement in [prospect] in the near future In agriculture, we expect declines in income of between 5 and 10 percent this year and we anticipate similar declines next year Activity in the oil and gas areas of our District continues weak Drilling operations activity as of November is down about 30 percent from the year before and there are no signs of any significant improvement there Manufacturers, particularly the auto companies that are operating in our District, are now increasing their furlough periods The General Motors plant is going to go out for four weeks starting I think this week or next week In the construction area, our District has seen improvements As I mentioned last time, it's partly because we've had such deflation; but we've seen good residential activity and some nonresidential activity in parts of our District  As far as the national economy goes, our staff feels that its projections are generally in line with those in the Greenbook We're not quite as pessimistic for this quarter or the next quarter, but we're certainly not as optimistic about the rest of 1992 For inflation, our forecast is very similar to the Greenbook forecast We see no really strong inflationary pressures going forward  As for the implications for policy, then, we think there is room for easing, although our preference is along the lines of what Governor Mullins said in that we think it's something we ought to be prepared to do down the road but would wait and choose our time I think that would be perhaps a more effective way of going forward Thank you  I agree with your recommendation "
4604,1992-02-04,HOENIG," Mike, I want to ask something relating to the single-family residential area because it's an important part of the projections as we come into 1992 Given the comments on restructuring of debt that have been made and some of the demographics, can you explain to me again why we're going to have such a strong residential recovery even without the fiscal stimulus which, if I understand it, was not part of this projection? [Your forecast] seems very optimistic to me  We think our District is growing somewhat more slowly; it might be described as flat at best In the agricultural area, because of the subsidized grain shipments, the wheat price that we've talked about has gone up and that, of course, has been positive But livestock prices, which had fallen sharply, have only come back slightly And we're still projecting a slowdown in agricultural income, which has [adverse] effects on suppliers to that industry Also, with natural gas prices being so weak, the energy industry, which is a very important resource in our District, is suffering As someone said, the rig count for us is about the same as for the nation--about 33 percent less than it was a year ago--but very weak; and employment in that sector is very weak as well In manufacturing, we are involved in the auto industry Shifts have been eliminated and cutbacks in production schedules have caused unemployment to increase in that industry; layoffs of about 1,000 people in Kansas City were just announced recently General aviation has also seen some modest falloff, but for us that is important The construction industry has been positive, particularly in the residential area Some significant gains have occurred there, and that has been the most positive note out of the District  On the national economy, our projections are less robust than those in the Greenbook, partly because we have seen such a poor fourth quarter for the economy and we look at what impact that would have going forward We see a slower increase in the first quarter, or perhaps no increase at all, and a pickup after that, putting our projections below the central tendency [unless] we assume that there will be some modest fiscal package, which would bring us back up toward the central tendency With that we see unemployment in the same range as the staff projection and inflation without the fiscal stimulus probably being within the same range or lower So, that is how we see the national economy as well as the District economy  Given the circumstances that we have today, I would not be in favor of the tunnels I think what we have now does give us the flexibility we need to move toward price stability, and that's what should be our focus As for the alternatives here, I am in favor of alternative I for the reasons that have been given That gives us the flexibility we need to continue to move toward price stability, and to adopt either of the other alternatives I think would give an incorrect signal at this time  Yes  I, too, am inclined to follow your recommendation First of all, I'd start by saying that there is a lot [of stimulus] in the pipeline and we should be patient However, as I mentioned yesterday, our projections are that the real economy might actually grow more slowly than what is in the Greenbook forecast, and that gives me some pause I also am concerned about the growth of M2, which I think has been erratic and too slow So, I am inclined to go with ""B"" asymmetric toward ease, but I would wait until we have some more information on the real economy and on M2 before I would charge forward "
4627,1992-03-11,HOENIG," Tom Hoenig in Kansas City I'd like to report that our District is pretty much status quo There is some slight improvement in the retail sales area, which is a positive sign to us Auto sales have picked up a little also The housing area has been very robust, as others have reported, but how sustainable it is, I think we'll just have to wait and see In the agricultural area, our folks report that there has been some increase in the weaker credits in the banks that are related to agriculture However, the borrowers are better prepared to deal with that and, with the stabilization of prices somewhat in livestock and the increases in grain prices, they are pretty optimistic [for the period ahead] The energy sector here is still very weak Jobs and the rig counts continue to fall; right now the rig count is about 25 percent below a year ago So, that area is not picking up at all That pretty much describes the view  Permits at this point, although refinancing is also very strong New home sales are up a fair amount from a year ago and the inventories in that market are dropping "
4653,1992-03-31,HOENIG," Our District continues to show a mixed performance on balance with very slow recovery [emerging] For example, our employment in January was up about 01 percent over the prior month As for the positives, one is retail sales Retailers around the District tell us that there has been a pickup in sales and they are, as we've been saying, cautiously optimistic that that will continue Construction-wise, we are still seeing improvement January was about 12 percent over a year ago for the District, but that was primarily in residential Commercial property continues to be fairly weak, with vacancy rates in Colorado, for example, still in the 24 percent area and higher than that yet in Oklahoma So, that sector is going to remain weak; but residential [construction] has been very strong Manufacturing is mixed for us In the auto industry there are still plans to continue with two shifts, but there has not been enough optimism for them to reverse [the decision] in process of being implemented to lay off 1,000 employees in Kansas City Also, other manufacturers we talk with are seeing some pickup, but it's very modest and they're not at all convinced that business is going to continue strong as we go forward They're waiting to see Economic activity is also being dragged down a bit with some defense cutbacks Martin Marietta in Denver, for example, is laying off 1,000 workers; and Allied Signal in Kansas City is laying off about 750 So that's a bit of a drag offsetting the anticipation of stronger sales in the auto industry Clearly, our weak sector is energy It's still very weak The rig count is down 25 percent from a year ago--not as much as in Louisiana, but down As you may have read this morning, Oklahoma has passed a law trying to restrict production of natural gas in an effort to boost its price; we'll see how successful they are In agriculture, the outlook is a little mixed In the grain area, there is some optimism with regard to prices In the cattle area, there is more pessimism Land values have remained virtually unchanged because of some concerns about pricing going forward So, our economy is mixed, although people are trying to be optimistic  Nationally, we generally agree with the Greenbook although our forecast is not quite as strong We anticipate and we're optimistic that the economy will grow a little less than 2-1/2 percent over the year However, we differ a little We think investment will be a little stronger and consumption a bit weaker than the Greenbook is projecting On the inflation front, we are also about in line with the Greenbook in terms of seeing core inflation continue to trend down So, that's where we see things right now  Mr Chairman, because the Greenbook and our forecast agree that the economy is improving and because year-to-date, at least as Gary said, the money numbers are near the midpoint, I'm comfortable with alternative B At the same time, I recognize that the money numbers that have just come in cause us to flinch But more importantly, I can support the asymmetry [because], although our economy is being projected as stronger now than it was in February, it still remains a very modest recovery by any [historical] comparisons and it is in my mind still a very tender recovery Therefore, I feel comfortable with the asymmetric language toward ease "
4680,1992-05-19,HOENIG," Mike, just to follow up on your comment on inventories You say that in the revised first-quarter numbers inventories are playing a more important role but that should not have an adverse effect going forward That is what I think I heard you saying Can you go through that again as to why we would not have some repercussions from that?  Thank you, Mr Chairman Our District economy is growing, but it's still very slow and somewhat mixed As others have mentioned here, the agriculture area is subject to some uncertainty due to the dry weather Also, in our area cattle is a very important industry and, although prices are up, there's a lot of uncertainty there With this environment of uncertainty there has been some very reduced activity in the agricultural sector; in fact our banks' loan-to-deposit ratios in that sector are at their lowest levels in some time, at just over 50 percent Manufacturing is mixed to flat, I would say In the aircraft industry there has been some slowing in shipments recently And in our auto industry, there has been activity but no real expansion in activity, with some modest gains overall in employment Our energy industry is suffering very significantly The level of drilling activity in both oil and gas is at post-World War II lows and [the outlook is] not at all good Everyone one talks with is blaming it on some of the regulatory restrictions as much as on some of the economics, so that is a very sore point in our area As to the construction side, construction activity in the residential sector has been very high but our anecdotal information now suggests it is backing off from those highs just as you hear is happening elsewhere  On the commercial real estate side, there is some increased absorption but still enough vacancies out there that we're not seeing any significant pickup in prices An important factor we've heard in very recent conversations is that in some of our areas the lease rates remain extremely low And until those pick up we don't really expect that the price levels are going to pick up at all That includes Denver, where there has been some activity; still, lease rates are very favorable, and though we have had some sales we're not seeing a real pickup in the prices or bidding to any large extent  On the national economy, our projections are very similar to those of the Greenbook There are some differences We are looking at a little weaker consumer spending and residential investment, and a little stronger government spending and stronger still business fixed investment On the inflation front, we're very much in line with the staff forecast; we may be a little more optimistic on inflation but not enough to make a real difference overall at this time Thank you  Mr Chairman, I certainly would support ""B"" As far as symmetric or asymmetric, my preference would be toward asymmetric I may have heard some good things about the real economy, but I don't consider it all that much stronger than where we were some months ago when we were talking about being willing to live with money growth above the midpoint And now suddenly we're very satisfied with it being at the bottom [of the range] and are satisfied that [it will be sufficient] to carry us forward We're now relying on an accelerating velocity that we really can't predict I don't see that there is all that much strength going forward But I certainly can live with symmetric language given that we would have a consultation if there's other news coming forward "
4705,1992-06-30,HOENIG," On Charts 5 and 6, just to make sure I heard what you said, is the projected improvement in our export figures due more to the devaluation of the dollar than to the economic activity in this country?    6/30-7/1/92  Okay, thanks  Thank you, Mr Chairman Our District continues to grow very sluggishly in my opinion We have seen some job growth in construction, particularly residential construction, over the last year This is primarily in our northern area, in Omaha and in the Denver, Colorado area Beyond that, agriculture is at best steady; we've seen some production loss in wheat because of the weather but that is being helped a little by some firmer prices So, we don't expect a drop there but we're not seeing [that sector provide] any strength to the economy, as it has in the past Our manufacturing sector was very sluggish through the first quarter; while we have seen some improvement there anecdotally, it really has been very modest at best Others have talked about the auto industry; we've not seen any pickup in jobs in plants in our area, at least to this point Our energy sector is, as it has been, very, very poor for a lot of different reasons, so it's not generating a lot of activity in our region of the country So, we expect continued growth but at a rate less than we're seeing for the nation as a whole  As far as the national economy goes, we also are very close to the Greenbook projection, which we would note was adjusted down in the period going forward; that's consistent with our view We see the economy growing very sluggishly and we're sensitive to that That is consistent with the type of credit activity we're seeing on loans and what is being reported to us So, we think there is a downside risk to the economic recovery right now and, although we see improvement in the inflation rate, we think that downside risk is something to be alert to as we go forward with the policy discussion  I would support your approach, although I have a lot of sympathy for Jerry Jordan's comments The difficulty, as others here have said, is that we are in transition; we are uncertain In that position, changing targets--whichever way--leaves open so many    6/30-7/1/92  questions that I think it will only confuse the participants, and that is unwise So, I'd go along with your recommendation I'd carefully explain it and, as Jerry Corrigan said, make a little [comment] on our record and our commitment to price stability in that context I think that will be accepted better than our suggesting that we know something when we don't  As I look at the discussion that we've had and your models, I prefer your second model as well I think it is suggesting that we still have an environment in the economy generally of great uncertainty and the building of liquidity And in that context staying where we are is, as Jerry stated, a tightening In addition, it's not just the money numbers but other financial information and the financial environment that suggest that we could and should ease My strong preference, then, would be to ease now; however, I can live with an asymmetric directive It's consistent with where I was at least last time And if the information comes in, given the way you answered President Keehn, I can live with that  The ranges we have now reflect an expectation that these [aggregates] are going to fall below [for the year], and I think we should drop that last sentence because it only adds-- "
4731,1992-07-02,HOENIG, This is Tom Hoenig; I certainly agree with the immediate announcement and with [unintelligible] 
4742,1992-08-18,HOENIG," Our District continues to show sluggish growth in most sectors except for real estate construction in some areas As for the farm economy, it's stable but as you've heard elsewhere prices are down and that is bringing the prospects for our ag sector toward the down side as we go forward; there may even be a decrease in [farm] income depending on what the near-term future holds Manufacturing in our District is flat The aircraft industry is feeling the effects of slumping foreign sales Our auto industry is not pushing production at all and that is showing through In energy, we have had some pickup in the rig count, but that is a very sluggish industry and we are not going to see much economic activity coming from that sector As far as the real estate area goes, our residential sector does show some strength There is a considerable amount of refinancing But we are also seeing new construction in some parts of our District, particularly in Denver where what is almost a boom situation in residential housing gives us some pause  -21-    8/18/92  I would add a couple of anecdotal points We have talked with bankers in our region and we also hear and observe that the problem is not that they are unwilling to make loans but [that there is little] demand for loans But that is a very unique situation Beyond that, though the banks will say demand [is the problem], where their [loans] have picked up or they want to add [loans], they have changed their underwriting on the margin--how many guarantees and how much collateral they require In one instance when they did that we observed that they were able to add significant amounts of loans, some of it taken from other banks who wouldn't change their underwriting I'm not talking necessarily about throwing out all caution, but just that some changes will make a difference I think banks in our region as they anticipate the need to bring their capital levels up are keeping their underwriting standards higher than they might otherwise and are trying to build those capital levels; and it is showing through in terms of the level of their lending activity  As far as the national economy goes, we have some differences with the Greenbook quarter-to-quarter, but overall our GDP projections are now similar We've adjusted ours down and we've adjusted our inflation expectations down as well I see the national economy, with the things that are going on right now, in a sluggish mode, and as I listen to comments here I think we can anticipate further sluggishness The situation does in fact suggest that perhaps we need to take a more forceful action  I would be more with President Forrestal's alternative now, but I would accept your argument of holding back and thus would accept ""B"" asymmetrical "
4769,1992-10-06,HOENIG," Mike, I'd like to follow up on Ed Boehne's question If I understood you correctly, you were saying that within the context of having provided a fair amount of liquidity for the readjustment, you are expecting things to improve down the road next year and beyond based on where rates have already fallen But if the improvement doesn't happen, you suggested toward the end of your comments that we might have to make substantial reductions in rates to move the economy along Having said that, is your discussion about a    10/6/92  modest reduction now an insurance policy on the rates that have already come down or did I misunderstand you?  Our District continues [to expand] at a very modest pace overall and employment is up just a little over last year The agricultural sector is flat; there may be a little decline in [farm] income, even though crops are good, because prices are less robust Manufacturing is basically flat Our aircraft industry is suffering because of the reduced demand overseas Our manufacturing of autos is either flat or there is significant [unused] capacity So, there is not a lot of activity there As far as construction goes, the residential sector is still strong throughout the District and in some areas the nonresidential sector remains good In the energy sector, the movement in natural gas prices is in a sense positive I think more fundamentally than the effects of the hurricane there has been an improving trend; supplies have been brought into a little better alignment with demand so prices are increasing nationally In talking to people in that industry, though, they say if that were to continue, they wouldn't really have resources until sometime next year, so that's not an immediate pickup for our District at all  On the national scene, we have no real differences with the Greenbook We're not quite as pessimistic for the fourth quarter Fundamentally, we're looking at the negative numbers and adjusting our projections of real activity down a little Also, like the staff, we do not expect inflation to be a major problem  With regard to policy considerations, I have to admit I'm a little more ambivalent about easing than I was last time, partly because we have talked to business people, as others of you have, and they're saying that interest rates are not a problem right now We don't need it, given the other aspects of the economy and the so- called headwinds we've talked about Credit growth is a little better and I have some concerns about the foreign exchange situation But on balance I'm personally still comfortable with easing because we are looking at a continued [sluggish] and maybe even weakening economy And while I say that credit is improving, it's still weak in every way The monetary aggregates, M2 and so forth, are still weak by every definition And price inflation is not at this point a major issue; we don't see inflation picking up again given these other factors and, therefore, we have some room to ease And on the margin I feel that easing would facilitate this restructuring that is still in process, even though we don't know where the equilibrium may be We know it is in process and there are still significant adjustments that have to take place So, as I wash all this out, I have to come down on the side of some further ease  To repeat myself a little, Mr Chairman, I came in a little more ambivalent, and I think we have had a very good discussion The preponderance of views is that ease is appropriate I think now would be the time [to ease], having had the discussion, and it would be a deliberative move However, given your [explanation], I can live with ""hard asymmetric"" "
4796,1992-11-17,HOENIG," Mr Chairman, our District continues to show some modest improvement and considerably more optimism looking forward Our agricultural sector is really trading off between improvement in our livestock business and some deterioration in our grain business, so that overall we have flat prospects for that sector this year and into next year The manufacturing sector is a bit mixed Our aircraft manufacturers are still weak The auto sector is mixed because production at our GM plant is still very slow whereas Ford is going to be investing significantly in its plant in Kansas City, which I think will bring in some jobs Other than that, activity in our nondurable goods area is ""decent,"" as they say, looking forward The rise in natural gas prices has spurred drilling activity in the District; the third quarter was up over 20 percent from the second quarter, although that doesn't bring it back to anywhere near what it was a little more than a year ago But we are seeing some pretty robust [growth in] activity there right now Our construction area is still doing pretty well That is particularly so in the Denver region where economic activity is coming back rather strongly right now In fact, for the region construction activity is up fairly dramatically over a year ago, well over 10 percent Our employment levels are up over last year--our estimate is about 06 percent--and the anecdotal reports we're getting from our directors are uniformly positive in terms of their reading of the environment and their own attitudes The banking industry in our region, with a couple of notable exceptions, is really quite strong; earnings are strong across the region, and I think there's a little more of an attitude of making an effort to get into the lending business again, although [bankers] are keeping the lessons of their past experience close [to mind] Overall, I see some general improvement in our region  -11-    11/17/92  As far as the national outlook, as we look over two quarters ahead our view is very similar to the Greenbook on average although our timing is somewhat different, which I don't think is significant We're looking for inflation to be in the 3 percent range So, we are fairly comfortable with the Greenbook projections as we look at the national economy Thank you  Let me talk about the short-term issues first The economy is showing strength--more strength than I saw last time-- and I think it is real There is a fair amount of liquidity in the system to accommodate future growth should that continue, so I don't  -40-    11/17/92  think we would be hurting things by staying where we are So, I am inclined towards alternative B As for asymmetry or symmetry, I'm inclined at this stage to go with symmetrical language partly because we meet again fairly soon and partly because I think the economy is fundamentally stronger Even though I recognize the downside risks from the trade situation and all these other factors that we have talked about, I think we do have a fundamentally better economy  As for the long-term ranges, I think they should be lowered, and my preference is for 2 to 6 percent [for M2] I believe that's orderly and consistent with what we may see going forward As to when to announce it, I don't have a strong preference It's something that takes explanation, though, and if we try to put it in a letter we won't have the opportunity to explain it, which is so important We need to weigh that against what may be bad timing next February But we have to do something next February, and that is the normal timing So, I guess I lean toward doing it later in the [usual] form  Yes  In terms of what Mr Gonzalez is asking for--and that is a detailed record of some kind as well as timeliness--as Jerry said, to have cameras in here or to have an immediate release of a detailed transcript or memorandum of discussion would inhibit the process under all these circumstances Going back to your issue that the public has a right to know at some point, I think we have had in the past, as I've read this material, a position that says, yes, we would be willing to accommodate them with a detailed memorandum of discussion again if we could have some assurances that there wouldn't be premature release of that material to the public through a FOI request That issue still stands and we can be consistent with protecting the deliberative process and making [a detailed transcript] available if they're willing to protect that over time And, as we apparently did in the past, we can make some compromise in terms of what others are talking about here--releasing the results in a more timely way than we do now, which is waiting until after the next meeting That may be of more value in essence to the public than having the TV cameras in here "
4818,1992-12-14,HOENIG," I presume that what we're talking about is a response both to the letters that were sent to the Presidents and the letter sent to you, Mr Chairman Is that correct? "
4831,1992-12-22,HOENIG," Mr Chairman, our District continues to improve modestly, although we would note that the anecdotal evidence is much stronger than the statistics are showing Our energy activity continues to improve, especially in gas drilling Our agricultural area is sound, with improving livestock prices offsetting some of the    12/22/92  negatives from the lower grain prices But overall, our agricultural income is still solid Construction activity generally is improving a little more modestly, but the single-family housing area is very strong, particularly in the western part of our region In manufacturing, although we continue to hear about expansion plans by Ford Motor Company in our area, that expansion has not taken place yet Our manufacturing job growth is flat for the time being We hear a lot of optimism from our small business groups They are still saying that they would like to expand even more but are having some difficulty getting credit from banks; that's on their minds still  On the national front, we anticipate growth as we look out to 1994 similar to that of the Greenbook, although our path is a bit different and a little more modest inintially Still, we end up about in the same place We are a little less optimistic on consumer demand, though We also see improvements in inflation We've revised that somewhat; it's not quite as favorable as we thought earlier Overall, though, we think the economy is expanding at a persistent pace going forward into 1993  Mr Chairman, I agree with ""B"" symmetric I feel that the economy is in a continued modest expansion [phase] But there are some underlying [concerns] that you and others have identified, including where we are in the employment picture, the deficit picture, and the spending picture So, I think we would be well advised to stick with ""B"" symmetric at this point "
4855,1993-01-06,HOENIG," Mr Chairman, this is Tom Hoenig I want to ask Don if there was consideration given merely to responding once again that the Committee as a whole thought it best to respond as one body and not get into [a position where] some of us were responding and some of us were not responding [Individual responses could result    1/6/93  in] having different views coming out now as Chairman Gonzalez has introduced legislation "
4874,1993-02-02,HOENIG," Just one question on savings Given some of the demographics you showed here, I'm curious as to why you are expecting the saving rate to stay as low or lower than we might otherwise have thought  Then this could be more of a temporary--  Mr Chairman, our region of the country continues to grow slowly, steadily however, with strong agriculture and construction sectors and less robust manufacturing and energy sectors First of all, I would say that our employment picture is mixed, with fairly decent employment growth in the Kansas City area and in Colorado and New Mexico, and fairly poor employment growth in other parts of our region, particularly in Oklahoma Although that is the case, the optimism is uniformly good even in Oklahoma where there's less job growth A lot of efforts are going forward to encourage employment growth where [possible] In the agricultural area, as you well know, increased livestock prices last year kept farm incomes higher than originally expected However, I'm pleased that as far as the land prices go, there's a little speck of renewed optimism in that they have stayed fairly flat Construction activity is very strong, obviously helped along by residential construction And though there has been some modest slowdown since November, our construction levels are still a good 25 to 30 percent higher than they were a year ago Manufacturing is generally sluggish There is a stable environment in the auto industry, particularly at GM where there's a lot of uncertainty in our area And [activity at] our Ford manufacturing plants is very good We, too, are affected by the announcements of [cutbacks at] Boeing, which will affect our Wichita area Generally that will be handled gradually, but it will be a drag because it's a very important part of that economy Nevertheless, overall there should still be some good job growth in Kansas, particularly in the Kansas City area In the energy area, natural gas drilling has fallen off since the end of the year because of tax changes Nevertheless, the number of rigs operating is still 50  -15-    2/2-3/93  percent over what it was a year ago and that is at least a positive event in our part of the country So, overall, we [anticipate] steady growth for the region going forward  As far as the national economy goes, our projection, allowing perhaps for some differences in fiscal policy, is very similar to the Greenbook forecast We have a little slower growth in the first part of the year but that picks up For the year as a whole our projection is very similar to that of the Greenbook both for GDP and for the inflation picture  Don, I've read this and listened to what you said One thing that bothers me as we look at these simulations of alternative strategies is that you've given reasons for and against why velocity can increase, but this is very dependent upon having the velocity at a rate that has only been reached, I think, three times in decades How confident then can you be on the arguments for why velocity should continue to be very high?  Mr Chairman, I understand where you're coming from on your proposal and I don't see many options Like others around here, I am very bothered by it because we are setting a target that we know we will not be making any time in the near future And  -45-    2/2-3/93  that will cause us a lot of grief as those who are pushing us follow up on this and see that we cannot and did not make it That perhaps emphasizes Governor Mullins' point that we've got to find a way to explain by other means what we're doing or we will be under heavy, heavy, criticism going forward despite the fact that we dropped the range down 1/2 point But it's a 1/2 point that I think we're not going to make right away and that really bothers me  You're suggesting that if we dropped small time deposits out we'd have a fairly fast growing M2, which would only add more confusion  ""B"" symmetric  I think alternative ""E"" should be pursued and looked at more carefully because we are starting with an agreed upon premise that we should be as open as we reasonably can And I don't think announcing an action, whether it's [in terms of] the fed funds rate or reserve pressure is inconsistent with that; I think it is consistent with being open And I doubt that it's going to compromise our ability to have discussions and come up with reasonable policy So, that is one avenue that we ought to pursue pretty vigorously "
4918,1993-03-23,HOENIG," Mr Chairman, our District recovery continues on track for the most part Tourism trade is still good in the region Oil and gas activity, though, is still subdued after the year-end peak and that does not look to be building up Construction activity in the District remains strong; there has been some weather-related slowdown, but that [strength] will reemerge In the agricultural area, there is a degree of greater uncertainty, although aggregate income should remain good for our region But the facts [about] the grain loan repayment and what the Russians can afford after the more recent crisis have put a real pale on things and I think that has been partly responsible for the lower prices Secondly, in the cattle industry there have been some very significant weather-related losses in the area That has driven up prices to their historic highs but on balance it probably has hurt that industry, and that may have some degree of impact Nevertheless, overall our District will continue to grow at a moderate pace, still better than the nation as a whole  On the national economy, in terms of the GDP growth we see things about in line with the Greenbook We are a little less optimistic on consumption and a little more optimistic on residential investment Overall, we don't really differ too much with the Greenbook On the inflation front, our view is that inflation has come up a little but that doesn't really portend problems going forward, although I think it also says that our gains on inflation may have run out So we're in this steady state and we'll have to make some decisions along those lines in the near future Thank you  Mr Chairman, I support your proposal My own view is that we're in a stage where we're looking at a moderate recovery The issue is whether inflation will stay at the current level or begin to rise We don't know at this point And because we don't know, I don't think we should be acting as if we do So, I would feel comfortable where we are and I strongly support symmetric language I don't think we should be trying to tip our hand or anticipate at this stage On the language, I prefer the alternative language at this time "
4943,1993-05-18,HOENIG," Mr Chairman, I'll start with our District, which continues to show a very moderate pace of growth In agriculture, winter wheat is in good condition and our cattle feedlot operations have rebounded from some winter problems Construction has bounced back from the winter-related slowdown; it now has strengthened in all areas In gas and oil, prices of natural gas have improved from year-ago levels and drilling has leveled off I would point out that drilling has not picked up and is not expected to accelerate until there is more confidence in the price gains and that those prices will be stable Absent that, they are very reluctant to push forward on any exploration or drilling Manufacturing in our area remains sluggish and it is consistently operating below capacity as we hear from area business leaders Banking has been extremely profitable in our region Bank earnings are at record levels in the first quarter In fact, in Oklahoma banks have reported returns on assets of higher than 2 percent  Looking ahead for the District, we think moderate growth is continuing Despite some expectations that cattle prices will come down and wheat prices may also, we still think income in '93 will be at a level close to that in '92 In construction, there is now a whole pipeline of activity that bodes well for the summer in our region In energy, although prices have risen we don't expect a lot of activity unless those prices remain stable [or] rise In manufacturing, the possibility of a turnaround, as I've said before, has been set back by some continued restructuring As an example, Boeing is laying off about 7,000 people in Wichita  At the national level, we continue to expect moderate growth and moderate inflation as we move through '93 We expect GDP growth of about 2-1/2 percent and inflation of just over 3 percent fourth quarter-over-fourth quarter I might add that an important reason we scaled back our growth projection is because in talking with business  -16-    5/18/93  leaders around the District we heard a lot of anecdotal evidence [pointing in that direction] They are thinking about or have put [plans] on hold because of expectations about taxes--particularly Federal, but even the states are talking about very dramatic increases in taxes So businesses are focusing now more than ever on cost containment and trying to get their profits up I think this is one reason businesses are raising prices; they want to see if the higher prices can take hold This has been complicated in the health care industry because in some sectors, like medical devices, activity has virtually stopped because of the anticipated health care program Also impeding renewed spending is this continued effort by businesses that we've spoken about for some time to pay down debt and to consolidate their positions in an environment of increasing uncertainty If I heard it once I heard it a hundred times in the last three weeks Business people are very, very concerned about the environment of uncertainty, so they are trimming back or are holding back a little more than they would otherwise Having said all this, there is still a willingness to go forward where opportunities show through in a strong way, as we're seeing in the western part of our District So we pared back our projections--not quite as much as the Board staff--to the 2-1/2 percent level for growth Those are my comments, Mr Chairman  Mr Chairman, my inclination is to say that although there is some pessimism, it is fiscal-related My own bias is that these inflation numbers are bothersome and that tightening would be the better path if I were convinced that they were permanent At this point I am willing to wait and see a little longer So, I would leave [policy] the same When we do act, though, I think it should be by vote, so I would also say symmetric for now "
4966,1993-07-06,HOENIG," Thank you, Mr Chairman Activity in our District continues not unlike what it was the last time I reported Farm income remains good within our District, helped by continued strong cattle and livestock prices; and our wheat harvest should be reasonably good Construction activity is being led importantly by residential construction in the Denver and Omaha areas; nonresidential building remains brisk through the second quarter Oil and gas drilling has picked up ever so slightly; thus that industry is remaining stable after some period of pretty significant decline Manufacturing for us, as you've heard from others, remains sluggish Some companies are hesitating; in a couple of conversations I've had, particularly with those in food processing and the nondurable goods areas, my contacts said they had just put off some additional expansion And one company's chairman said that they do not hire without his permission These are companies with several hundred employees So, the uncertainty is having an effect, I think, on some of these activities in the manufacturing sector  Looking ahead for the District, I think farm income should continue strong, with good harvests and continued good prices in the cattle area In construction the flow of new contracts is good, so we think activity there will remain good for our District With some weakening in the prices in the oil and gas area, it appears that this slight improvement that we've seen may not be long-lasting; we just don't know at this time Manufacturing, until we get some of the uncertainty out, I think is going to remain a little more sluggish than it might otherwise be  I have talked with individuals about credit and credit access in our region That has improved although we do still get some feedback that it's hard to get loans; that is much less the case than it was a few months ago And the evidence, in terms of increases in credit outstanding, would suggest that that area is improving  At the national level we, like others, continue to see modest growth Our forecast is also somewhat stronger than the Greenbook, led not by consumption but by somewhat stronger projections in residential activity, business fixed investment, and not quite as negative a change on the government spending side What that suggests to us, though, is that in this world of uncertainty--and especially as it relates to inflation--without some change in policy over the  -30-    7/6-7/93  forecast period we could see inflation at a somewhat higher level than is projected in the Greenbook Thank you  Mr Chairman, I understand where you're coming from with regard to moving these targets now I have some concern because we have spent a lot of time talking about the uncertainty of these M numbers and where they're going and trying to discount them in a sense as targets If we now go in and lower the targets, I think we are risking a great deal in the sense that if we change the targets, [the implication is that] we must know something; that will be the presumption if we bring it down If we aren't sure at this point, aren't we better to say we aren't sure and that, therefore, we're leaving the range unchanged until we know more, rather than raising suspicions?  But what we are then doing is changing the concept from one of targeting to one of forecasting where M2 might be given [emerging] circumstances--some of which are out of our control-- in terms of its velocity  I would support no change at this time I would have a slight preference for symmetry; but having heard the arguments for having already made one change, changing back may be awkward now But on the merits of it, I think symmetry would be appropriate "
4995,1993-08-17,HOENIG," Thank you, Mr Chairman In the Tenth District the economy, as I say every time, continues to grow modestly Retail sales seem to be holding up Construction activity has so far been strong; this strength is primarily focused, though, on the residential area Oil and gas drilling has picked up in the past and that's primarily due to the gas portion of that industry Coal output in Wyoming has slowed, though, primarily because of the transportation problems in getting that coal to the Midwest and South There has been some interruption there but it should be very temporary since inventories are down Manufacturing activity remains quite sluggish We've seen some continuing drop-off in jobs in that sector just as we've seen nationally The effect of the flooding is likely to reduce crop output in our area in Nebraska, Missouri, and a little in Kansas particularly in corn and soybeans; but there's not much effect on the wheat crop as we see it right now On the whole, prospects in agriculture should remain healthy despite this reduction in crops because of price effects Construction activity should remain good, focused on housing We have one matter [of concern] in the Denver area That airport has about 13,000 infrastructure jobs; the work is to be finished [soon] and they have to out-place that And of course the vacancy rate in Denver, while improved, is still rather substantial, so I think they'll have a bit of a transition issue in that area We also think that our natural gas drilling activity should remain fairly good But as far as manufacturing goes, we see no real signs of strength except perhaps with the auto plants that should be at full capacity Generally, manufacturing is very weak in our area  At the national level, as I've heard many others say here, we are revising our estimates down; we are a little more optimistic than the Greenbook but not enough to matter And we see inflation in check, but we are not of the mind that it's improving very significantly; we're still looking at around the 3 percent range Slack in the economy, though, should keep inflation at least not worsening And the outlook for growth in 1994 continues to look very modest to us In one sense the uncertainty has changed from what the  -14-    8/17/93  fiscal package will be to what the effects of the fiscal package will be and then we add on health care [uncertainty] to that So we see a very uncertain future and pretty modest growth going on into 1994  May I ask Don this question? [Laughter] If we leave it asymmetric for a long period of time and do nothing, do we not give away credibility with that kind of directive?  Mr Chairman, I think a symmetric directive is appropriate and I don't think that changes our long-run strategy toward price stability, which is what we should have This is an operating paragraph and it should communicate what the Committee is thinking I don't see any inclination to change in the intermeeting period Therefore, I think we build credibility making that change now as far as our future actions go So, I'm for symmetry "
5020,1993-09-21,HOENIG," Thank you, Mr Chairman Our District continues to grow modestly, as I've said time and time again Construction remains reasonably good in our area mostly due to housing, primarily in the western portion of our region in Denver Energy has posted gains and that's tied to the natural gas industry, which is still fairly active in our area Banks' earnings are doing extremely well; in the second quarter, as for the nation, they were very strong In fact, in Oklahoma, which I think was once the worst in the nation, banks earned in the second quarter something on the order of 1-1/2 percent on their assets I was in Oklahoma last week and there were a couple of banks actually talking about making loans! That's the first time they've said that in almost a decade They said they wanted to wait two more quarters, though [Laughter] I'm only half kidding! The service industry is generally solid, although not as good as the nation Where tourism is very important, it's a little disappointing Manufacturing is really weak; durable goods employment actually has declined over the last year in our region, about 2-1/2 percent we estimate, and that has to do in part with the aircraft industry Prospectively in our region, we expect more of the same in terms of slow growth Low mortgage rates should keep housing starts strong in our region, especially in the mountain area where there is a bit of in-migration from California going on Agriculture will report solid income, we think, due importantly to livestock prices; and crop losses will not be sufficient to offset that, including [those associated with] the effects of the flood and of the drought, and also some freeze that we had in portions of our region In manufacturing, though, we see nothing that would show any strong improvement in our region, so we think it will continue to be rather slow as we go forward  For the nation, we expect moderate growth, as everyone else does, although we are somewhat stronger than the Greenbook We also expect modest inflation, about the same as the Greenbook Some of that comes from a little stronger growth in business fixed investment and a little more accumulation of inventories, but basically we see very modest growth going forward Because of our stronger growth projections, we see employment being a little better than what the Greenbook shows but, again, not enough to change how we view the economy into 1994  ""B"" symmetric "
5041,1993-10-05,HOENIG," Mr Chairman, Tom Hoenig I just have a question If I hear what you are saying, in your discussions with them you are going to emphasize that we do release the minutes, that there is accountability in that, and that those who dissent [are duly recorded] The Memorandum of Discussion is only going to come up if-- but probably when--you get a question from Mr Gonzalez And these are the options you're defining now  So we're not bringing it up as a possibility?  You want to resist it if at all possible, which is what I think we should do  Okay  Didn't we give a response to him last spring on our views on that? Those were fairly short "
5059,1993-10-15,HOENIG," If I understand, you're not talking about a legislative proposal here, going back, but how we should approach the likelihood that someone is going to request or require us to release these transcripts It's how we approach that issue I would agree with Governor Angell that 14 years would be an appropriate time for the transcripts, but I have the impression from Virgil and from you that the sense was that we are going to be challenged on this very quickly and that we are not going to be able to rely very much on the Justice Department to protect us So what preemptive [measures] do we take based on that? I'm quite discouraged by this because, as many have said in their statements already, I think it will discourage open discussion in these meetings But given what you've said, I don't know that we have any other alternative than what Bill McDonough suggested, with some modifications from Dick Syron, as to how we approach this inevitability  This is Tom Hoenig The only comment I have on that--in many ways I agree with Tom--is that the difficulty is that these transcripts are known [to exist] and if we now say we're not going to keep those any longer either, I think it is an explosive issue Given some of what the Chairman has said already, I think it would give tremendous fodder for those on that Committee who want to anger others I think it would give them a powerful tool And that's why I think Bill McDonough has a legitimate point in how we approach this  But do they know now or will they find out or are--  Don, if we won't be there to get [the transcript] in the pouch, can we stop by your office and get it Monday?  -23-    10/15/93 -24- "
5077,1993-10-22,HOENIG," Mr Chairman, this is Tom Hoenig I basically agree with the proposal I have one question in my mind The idea of transcripts is now out there; and they exist In opening up the legislation, or even in the negotiations, I get the impression that the only thing that will be acceptable is in fact some form of transcripts, verbatim nearly And the issue in terms of opening up the legislation will be whether we can negotiate for a long enough period to pass before those are released and how much editing can be done I have the sense that the Memorandum of Discussion now would probably not be well received Am I wrong on that? "
5108,1993-11-10,HOENIG," Ted, it may be too soon to know this, but you mentioned these other countries and the negotiating on the rest of this arrangement Is that proceeding well or do we know at this stage? "
5123,1993-11-16,HOENIG," To follow up a bit on Governor Phillip's question, we really have two issues before us How we respond to Mr Gonzalez and the issue on releasing this to the public If I understand it, one of your options is to release lightly edited historical transcripts to the public Is it an option to generate the equivalent of a memo of discussion and hold the raw [transcript] 30 years? Or is that--  Yes, in order not to be releasing even lightly edited transcripts to the public that could be misinterpreted just six years back, could we say we'll prepare memos of discussion going back and we'll hold the raw [transcript] for 30 years Is that an option?  Okay, for the raw transcripts So that's what gets--  I see  That's because once we've done that, we'd have to release the [transcripts], the way it looks under FOIA  Okay, and that's not the case with a lightly edited version? The Archivist is saying that if we release a lightly edited transcript, then we do not retain the raw [transcript]?  Okay  Mr Chairman, I would start by perhaps echoing a little of what President Boehne said Whatever proposal we come forward with, if it is not accepted we should take the opportunity to present our case again in a hearing before the full Committee I think it needs to be reiterated that we are indeed the most open central bank in the world and that we do release very detailed minutes now I don't think that is appreciated as much as it perhaps should be  I understand that And I'd say that if what we propose gets no acceptance whatever, we should take the opportunity to present our case again before the whole Committee and reiterate those points We just absolutely have to It's very important to show how open we are and how detailed our minutes are What is happening, and we can see it now, is the very beginnings of disrupting the process What one may say in an open discussion, what may be a speculative gesture for discussion purposes, is likely to be taken out of context if this information is released quickly after a meeting So, I think that's very important  As for your proposals then, given the answers to the questions that have been asked, I see that we probably must go back and release lightly edited transcripts as you are suggesting with the proper redactions and so forth I favor five years minimum going back because there are [issues] of privacy here And there is the fact that very detailed minutes have been released in the past Going forward, appearance is an issue; and if there is not a big difference between Memoranda of Discussion and lightly edited transcripts, perhaps lightly edited is a better way However, the Memorandum of Discussion is fine with me I feel very strongly that [the lag] should be five years, not three years, because the longer the time period the less disruptive it will be to the process, which is so important That's why I would go for the five years  My first choice is lightly edited without annotation; my second is raw with annotation  Ten and five  Edited first; MOD second  Mr Chairman, our District's economy continues to grow at a moderate pace as it has for several months There are really no major changes Construction remains strong with most of the growth in housing Nonresidential construction will slow a little because of some major infrastructure projects coming to completion, but I don't think that will have a significant effect on our region The energy sector has slowed slightly because of lower prices Our services and retail areas remain solid The manufacturing area remains sluggish but there are some signs of improvement, especially  -70-    11/16/93  in the non-durable goods portion of it As we look ahead we think that [the regional economy] is going to continue as it has in recent months with moderate growth We expect to see housing starts continue to do well Energy activity should remain steady although we don't see any real boost there Agricultural incomes should be good both from crops and in the livestock area Manufacturing should remain steady with perhaps some signs of improvement So overall it is going to continue as it has in the past  On the national level we are expecting [activity] to be somewhat stronger than the Greenbook shows going into next year and throughout the year And for us that means GDP growth of around 3 percent or a little more We also see because of that perhaps a little more pressure on inflation So that will be a major concern of ours as we go forward in terms of our projections and what that means for policy For now our fourth quarter looks about like the Greenbook That's all I have  ""B"" symmetric "
5154,1993-12-21,HOENIG," Mr Chairman, our District is continuing to grow; actually it's showing some indications of faster growth through the last half of this year and we think going into 1994 Construction activity is still strong and should continue to be so We note that Intel is building about a $1-1/2 billion plant in New Mexico, adding about 1,000 jobs, and there are some other activities throughout the District Services seem to be good and improving, although perhaps not quite as strongly as some of the information we're getting on the national level Manufacturing in our District is either stabilizing or actually improving, with smaller job losses in durables and some real job growth in the nondurables sectors We still have some declines--McDonnell Douglas and American Airlines in their maintenance operations are laying off [workers]--but that's being offset with other job gains in manufacturing The farm economy is stable despite the flood Stronger grain prices are offsetting some weaker cattle prices and we may see some earnings pressure there in '94 The energy sector actually is holding its own despite the fact that the oil part of that is dead in our region Gas activity, though, is positive; and while there are some obvious relationships between the two, the gas prices are still holding and we have some drilling activity going on there  Within that context I'd like to provide you some anecdotal data; they are not data as such and they are not systematic but they are, I think, worth noting In the area of prices, for example, land prices are sensitive in our region In Wyoming we've had some sales and, in one recent sale, a fairly large ranch sold for perhaps 10 to 15 percent above what they expected; and this was to local neighboring ranchers, not outside investors coming in In north central Kansas, while the general trends are still for price increases around the level of inflation, we've seen sales recently that are maybe 5 to 10 percent above what the trend line would suggest In areas like Denver and Albuquerque we're hearing more and more comments about boom-like conditions We're seeing more speculation in residential real estate; and loan growth is fairly strong, especially in areas such as Denver, parts of Omaha, and Lincoln So we're seeing some activity there In the energy sector, as I've said, while oil prices are down gas prices are at least holding their own But in the sale of land or lease arrangements for exploration some of the large independents have told us that those leases are selling at levels significantly above what they expected So there are these signs out there of strong activity  -12-    12/21/93  and some price pressures It's not systematic yet, but we're hearing this more often  As for the nation, we expect solid growth next year In the first quarter we see a bit more of a drop-off than the Greenbook but following that, for the year as a whole, we don't see the drop-off that the Greenbook has projected We expect some continued growth that will not allow the inflation back-off that the Greenbook [projects] Now, whether that will turn out to be the case, we are not certain But from what we're seeing in our District and what we're analyzing nationwide we think there is going to be some fairly good growth, around 3 percent throughout the year, and that inflation will stay at least that high throughout the year  Mr Chairman, as I said earlier, I think the information and evidence are mounting that we do have an economy that will sustain itself through next year [with] inflationary pressures So I am inclined to see the rates moved modestly up to be, in a sense, anticipating that But I'm certainly willing to see how it goes after the first of the year And for that reason I also feel very strongly that it should be an agreed-upon action by this Committee So I would agree with your proposal  Two questions, Mr Chairman Number one Your proposal would have other members of the Committee or their senior aides coming over as a condition for individuals from Chairman Gonzalez's group coming over? In other words, these others have to be included--  Right  -47-    12/21/93  I want to make sure that something doesn't occur where just they come over and look at it themselves  I agree it would be, so I'd feel much more comfortable with your proposal knowing that there have to be other individuals there The second question is Not that my memory is that short, but is there a possibility that we can take a look at those parts of the transcript where we had conversations ourselves so that if we get a call we'll know what it is exactly?  In that case I would support it "
5183,1994-02-03,HOENIG," Mr Chairman, our District continues to grow at a very steady pace on the whole Within the District, though--as I mentioned I think in November and I'll say it again today--there is a little more of a boom-like atmosphere in the western and the northern portions There is very strong housing and a shortage of labor in that industry Manufacturing is doing better, especially in the nondurable goods area The slow areas are energy, except for natural gas, which of course is a little more on a roll right now Also, we think we will have modest activity in the agricultural sector because of the floods and the effects from that  At the national level, our view is that inflation may run a little higher than in the Greenbook forecast for a couple of reasons Our GDP projection is a little stronger than the Greenbook's, especially in the second half of the year But also we have estimated a little lower unemployment rate and we have a little higher, I guess, natural rate of unemployment in our thinking than the Greenbook and that is generating added price pressures as we see it in our projections I would add to that on the other side a point that may be of interest in terms of the amount of liquidity that is in the system In talking with some fund managers, it seems to us that an  -19-    2/3-4/94  attitude is developing--almost a bandwagon effect--in terms of the flows of some of these funds into investment opportunities they are seeing We are hearing a lot of this going on--emerging markets and those sorts of things--from these fund managers, and we take note of that I think it is having some impact on attitudes in the economy That, Mr Chairman, is how it looks  Mr Chairman, I understand the sensitivity of this I have a hard time understanding how this would not be precedential If we say it is desirable to announce this time because it makes sense and we've got this issue of a Friday and so forth, I think it will be difficult from a credibility point of view to argue against announcing in the future should we want to make that argument Even if we have to start our meeting earlier tomorrow, I'm wondering if we cannot position ourselves to know whether we want to take an action tomorrow, and then do so Then, as the questions come in, we can validate that we did in fact take an action so that we're not making a statement which sets a precedent I think we are going to set a precedent  Well, we may not be forced but I think the credibility of our position will be compromised  I'm uneasy about that, but I understand what you're saying  Mr Chairman, I think yesterday's discussion and this morning's indicate that we really need to take action now As for the amount, there is an economic case for doing 50 basis points now and I think it would in the longer term give us a more stable environment Bill McDonough's arguments are valid to some extent in terms of what kinds of reaction we would get, but I think those would take care of themselves and we would really be better off with 50 basis points  I think we should stay with the current targets as we have them, no changes And in my view we should not be projecting 1995 "
5209,1994-02-28,HOENIG," Mr Chairman, this is Tom Hoenig May I ask Bill or Joan a follow-up question? It has to do with the earlier comments about the uncertainty of this other shoe hanging over the market and the possibility of this creating uncertainty Is it your feeling, Bill or Joan, that the markets, knowing what's out there, will self-correct between now and the next meeting or are we going to be dealing with this until we act again and bring some firmness to the market? That's really an area that's bothersome to me "
5225,1994-03-22,HOENIG," Mr Chairman, I have to admit some ambivalence toward this I think that to use the swaps, as the memos themselves imply, to influence exchange rate levels is risky business I do agree with Bill McDonough that they can be used to stabilize markets My question is about the size of the proposed increase From the material the rationale for the number that we are shooting toward now, the $6 billion total, wasn't clear to me other than perhaps that the economies are larger This is a larger number but it's not necessarily the right number for any particular reason Is that a fair interpretation?  Thank you, Mr Chairman To begin with our District, I will tell you that it's growing at a strong pace now Recent employment numbers show a growth rate for the District as a whole above 3 percent This is showing up in manufacturing not only of nondurables, which I've reported on before, but of durables as well, reflecting our auto industry and our aircraft industry, which for our region has shown some expansion Construction in the region generally is very strong I spoke with  in the Kansas City region just last week, and he indicated that the activity prospectively for the next 90 days is as high as he's ever seen it, higher than the 1985-1986 period As a result of that, they are seeing some strains in terms of getting access to labor, but not necessarily in wages yet, and also in materials  Agriculture is stable; there is a tradeoff between some increases in price in the grain side which is in effect hurting the cattle side to some degree Energy in our District is still modest, with oil being a negative but natural gas being a positive, and there has been some drilling activity as a result of that Banks financially are strong and are also seeing an increase in demand for loans And their attitude toward making loans I would say is very positive Just to talk a little bit about prices in the region, we are not seeing systematic increases yet in the data Land prices are increasing but at a rate only slightly above the inflation rate in the last survey that we did, and the same is true in some of the labor markets However, on the anecdotal side, I'm getting increasing information that some price pressures are beginning to emerge The same that I talked to said that they are seeing materials prices move up sharply He quoted a figure as  -32-    3/22/94  high as 15 percent in some of the materials that they were bidding for In land prices, I've reported at other meetings that in the rural areas of Nebraska, Kansas, and Wyoming we have seen land prices move up In some cases, we have seen them rise sharply and the impetus is not from outside buyers but from neighboring operations trying to expand So we are beginning to see that  On the national level, we continue to view the outlook as we did at the last meeting in that we see inflationary pressures that are increasing more rapidly than shown in the Greenbook--not by a lot but I think by enough to matter We see that widening as we go out into 1995 There are three reasons for that in our judgment Number one, generally we expect growth in GDP to be above that in the Greenbook Secondly, we see the unemployment rate coming down more than the Greenbook; the difference is small but combined with faster GDP growth it's important And finally, as you know, we view the natural rate of unemployment as being somewhat higher than the Greenbook So the combination of all those factors, in our minds, adds up prospectively to the emergence of significant inflationary pressures Thank you  Mr Chairman, from our point of view, in terms of the evidence we have seen, there is a very good economic case for a move of 50 basis points now I think we need to get to the higher level sooner rather than later Based on listening to your remarks on the markets, however, I'm inclined to go with Governor Lindsey's proposal If we are trying to bring some certainty to the markets, I think an asymmetric directive would be wrong because when it is read after the May meeting, it would reintroduce uncertainty in the period  -49-    3/22/94  between that meeting and the July meeting Such a directive means that we might do something between meetings and I think it would confuse people So, I would favor a symmetric directive to go with the 25 basis points And if the the numbers on the economy differ from our expectations, we can have a conference call and make the decision at that time  I support the subcommittee's recommendation I think we have in a sense committed ourselves to this and I think Bill McDonough's point is well taken We should get decisions out to the market and the public as soon as we are making them, so I support announcing "
5247,1994-03-24,HOENIG," This is Tom Hoenig I support this I have a question When you say this program is identical to the last one, will our relationship be with the central bank or will it now be with the Ministry of Finance until the central bank--  And the fact that the status of the Bank of Mexico will change April 1 will not affect it?  Okay, thank you "
5261,1994-04-18,HOENIG," Mr Chairman, this is Tom Hoenig I agree with where you are on this I think that we're systematically moving in the right direction, which is what we talked about last time, and that this is the right time to move again "
5278,1994-05-17,HOENIG," Thank you, Mr Chairman My question has been answered  Thank you, Mr Chairman Our District continues to be healthy Housing has remained very strong, although many now expect that perhaps some slowing will come with higher interest rates Manufacturing continues to improve Our auto plants are still producing at very high levels The energy area remains mixed but natural gas activity is still good Farm income may be hurt a little by some fall in cattle prices, but grain prices should be good, and therefore income should be reasonably good overall An executive with one of the larger rail lines in our region that goes to the West told me that activity has never been this high Not just whole shipments to fill backlogs but intermodal transportation volumes are at record highs, and shippers are increasing their prices and the increases are sticking  The banking industry has not been this strong in our District in three decades Our classified asset levels are as low as they've been since the data have been collected We had the lowest number of banks losing money since the '70s, and earnings are above 13 percent on assets Loan-to-asset ratios have risen from a low of about 48 to over 50 percent Loan demand, judging from what bankers tell us, is picking up There is this issue that was mentioned earlier with some interest rate rises--the FASB rule and what it might do to the banks and their level of activity That has not been a major concern to date Capital ratios at our banks are averaging over 8-1/2 percent So things are generally good in the region  As far as the national outlook, we have differences with the Greenbook in some individual areas, but overall we are fundamentally in line with the Greenbook growth projections We do have a little higher inflation projected than does the Greenbook, partly because of basic natural rate of unemployment issues and those sorts of things Other than that we're in line with the Greenbook That concludes my comments  I endorse the proposed moves, both of them The economic case continues to exist for this move and I think we do have a window of opportunity for making it I support symmetric language I am a little concerned about the statement giving the impression that we are satisfied or that this pause may run a while, although I can't think of a better way of saying it That's the only concern I have, Mr Chairman "
5302,1994-07-05,HOENIG," I need to ask Don and Mike for a clarification When you were answering questions earlier about the fact that you assumed a higher short-term rate, Don, you said that in terms of aggregate demand you had different alternatives including maintaining  -19-    7/5-6/94  the same rate or changing the rate What were some of the factors that went into the picture? As you have it here, the staff forecast must presume a fairly strong growth rate without this increase in short-term rates What were the factors in terms of your aggregate demand forecast that you considered in making this assumption of a higher rate?  Why you raised the assumption  And that's taking into account in your model the effects of the moves to this point?  And so you still see continued stronger growth?  Thank you  Thank you, Mr Chairman The Tenth District continues to grow at a very good pace Some early signs of price pressures have emerged and we have reports of high prices and short supplies of some construction materials and scattered reports of labor shortages in the District Also, we continue to hear of some increases in land prices; right now our land prices seem to be rising year-over-year at about twice the CPI rate of inflation At least to date, we do not see any upward pressure on consumer prices in the region Construction activity and especially residential construction are vigorous Manufacturing continues to rebound and we see growth shifting from nondurables to durables manufacturing with emphasis on autos and airplanes Higher oil prices have boosted drilling activity only a little in the District District crops are generally in good shape Of course, we have seen a sharp drop in cattle prices, and that has triggered some significant losses to some of our producers in the cattle industry  Looking ahead, we think the District economy should remain strong on the whole A rise in construction activity is anticipated, although residential construction is expected to level off during the remainder of the year We also think a strong national economy should maintain a rebound in manufacturing The outlook for firmer oil prices still points to only modest gains for the energy industry in the District As one of our directors pointed out, that industry is affected by so many different factors that they are very cautious in terms of going ahead with energy exploration Losses in the cattle industry, we think, will drag down our farm incomes this year despite the good outlook for crops  -25-    7/5-6/94  On the national outlook, incorporating the latest first- quarter revisions, we expect that real GDP will be just slightly over 3 percent for 1994, assuming an unchanged monetary policy Economic growth is projected to slow in the second half of the year as past increases in interest rates begin to affect, or continue to affect, interest-sensitive spending Nevertheless, we think growth should remain slightly above potential in the second half, and as a result we expect overall CPI inflation to rise to around 3 percent on the year for 1994 and to continue at that rate in 1995 Thank you  Mr Chairman, thank you I have two comments First, on the debt aggregate, I tend to agree with your suggestion for bringing that range down As Bob Parry was saying, a lower debt range would make it more consistent with the monetary figures If that could be done, as Don described, without raising other issues or having other things read into it--  That is the other option, yes The second thing I want to comment on, though, is your reference to the 1996 projections I very much agree with you there It is, I think, unwise for us to be presenting specific projections into 1996 because they are often looked at as goals and also lead to the presumption that we know more than what we are really able to predict into 1996 If we do it, we would be well served in the long run to do so as Don suggested, by your making general statements about the 1996 outlook and not committing us to specific numbers  Mr Chairman, I would point out that even our more pessimistic projections suggest that the economy is continuing to build some inflationary pressures and that they will occur through the end of the year And so I think there is a need to move It's not a matter of whether but when I agree with you in the sense that I think doing so now would get things confused as to why we are doing it in terms of the international market The law of unintended consequences might take over and we could have some further problems from that With that in mind I would be inclined to take the ""B"" alternative with asymmetry toward tightening, and would look for an opportunity to do more I have no problem about doing so in the intermeeting period if we have the opportunity As far as announcing, I'd say we are down that track, and we need to announce I think the announcement should be very brief and it should say at most that no action was taken "
5342,1994-08-16,HOENIG," Mr Chairman, the Tenth District continues to grow at a very healthy pace Construction activity remains strong, although perhaps somewhat slower than the boom environment we saw just a few months ago Manufacturing continues to improve, especially in durable goods, and we have seen continued employment growth there Oil activity appears to be strengthening due to the firming in prices; that is no surprise The agricultural sector will be okay, as record yields in a couple of the crops will be offsetting the lower prices that are expected And the cattle market has strengthened as well From what we see, our economy in the region should continue to be strong going forward  I want to share with you some data and anecdotal information that we have on bank activity in our District We have seen some increased interest in the use of the discount window in the last several weeks For all District banks, loan-to-deposit ratios have  -11-    8/16/94  increased from about 56 percent in March to an estimate of about 65 percent in June At banks that inquired about borrowing, loan-to- deposit ratios have increased from around 60 percent to almost 75 percent So we are seeing some liquidity interest there This reflects loan growth of about 14 percent in our District The reason given by banks for this growth is very strong loan demand across the board, not just in agriculture It's interesting that this also is true of our larger banks; some of the smaller banks that have come and asked us about borrowing have indicated that their upstream banks have been less willing to lend to them because of their own liquidity needs associated with outside lending, which is reflected in their increase in loan-to-deposit ratios as well This is supported to some extent by the fact that deposit growth in our banks, on which they rely heavily, has grown at about half the rate of that for loans Also, both the larger and smaller banks around the District report that they have eased their credit standards, that the loan demand is there, and that the banks want to make loans We see some heavy competition throughout the District for loans So the banking environment has changed, I think rather dramatically, in the last two years  On the national front, we like others, see GDP growth going forward above its potential if we leave policy unchanged and we also see the inflation rate pushing up well above 3 percent next year So basically, we are in agreement with the staff's forecast and see some increasing pressures in the future  Mr Chairman, I, too, agree with your policy recommendation Given my comments earlier, I think that it is the appropriate action to take I also agree that if we only did 25 basis points, it would create uncertainty rather than what I think we can accomplish with this move So I agree "
5366,1994-09-27,HOENIG," Thank you, Mr Chairman The Tenth District economy remains strong, but there are some signs of slowing By that I mean slowing to a pace more in line with the national rate, so the regional economy is still very strong overall We are seeing some slowdown in residential construction which suggests that some of the earlier policy moves may be having an effect, but the slowing is modest We also are seeing some slowdown in the ag area and what happens there will depend a lot on prices Our energy sector remains  -23-    9/27/94  sluggish On the other side, we have manufacturing that is very strong, especially the durables side and automobiles Our services industry is very strong and our retail sector is strong Commercial construction, in contrast to residential, appears to remain fairly good, and we still are seeing some scattered shortages in the labor market We also are hearing continued comments about resource price pressures in steel and in paper manufacturing This has been going on long enough that individuals in these firms feel that something has to give Their margins are coming under pressure and how much more they can be squeezed is on their minds So, in contrast perhaps to our other contacts, I think they are thinking about inflation  As we look forward, we do think the District economy will continue generally strong There may be some further slowing, particularly in the construction area, but we think manufacturing will remain good in the context of strong national demand and as the foreign sector has its effect on our manufacturing Overall, conditions in our District are generally good and I think they will stay that way for some time  On the national level, we see growth slowing slightly this year, but we think it will stay above the potential rate and remain above 3 percent on the year We think that's also true for inflation as we end out the year Looking beyond that, and assuming we hold monetary policy unchanged, we see some slowing of the expansion next year toward the natural rate But we still see an environment where inflation is rising in a 3 to 3-1/4 percent range So that is a concern to us as we look to the future for the economy, especially as we see our own District remaining fairly strong Thank you  Mr Chairman, I would support your recommendation However, I would note that there are inflationary pressures in train I think they are fairly evident, and we might be well served if we were to act sooner Therefore, I would support your asymmetric proposal, and if the data come out at all strong, I would encourage you to move before the November meeting "
5392,1994-11-15,HOENIG," Mr Chairman, the Tenth District remains strong, and the strength is spread generally across all our states Activity is robust in most of our key industries, although there may be some signs of a slowdown in single-family housing; that has yet to be determined Our farm income has weakened in 1994 The current data show that the number of payroll jobs in the District increased by about 3 percent in September over a year earlier, about the same as the nation I should note, though, that New Mexico had job growth in the neighborhood of 5 percent and only Kansas and Wyoming added jobs at a rate less than the nation, although not a whole lot less Manufacturing continues to improve with most of the strength in the durable goods industry The District's key automobile assembly plants have completed their model changeovers They have told us that they expect gradually restored production toward capacity levels In general aviation, aircraft production, another of our key durable goods industries, improved in the third quarter with billings up significantly over the second quarter and over a year ago Energy activity improved just slightly in October, but farm income is down due to poor livestock prices, and that will be offset just slightly by the record harvest that we expect or are having As we have been  -19-    11/15/94  seeing for the past few months, construction remains robust across the District But as I said, there are some signs of slowdown in the housing permits area Anecdotal reports point to some shortages in labor, and that includes unskilled labor in our area Upward pressure on wages appears to be increasing Loan growth in our District continues to be strong although slightly less than last summer; it was extremely robust last summer  Turning to the national economy, my view is that the economy has considerable momentum Domestic spending remains strong; export growth is trending upward With the exception of housing, it is difficult to see any immediate signs of a slowdown Indeed, activity appears to be picking up in several industries, particularly manufacturing At current interest rates, I would expect real GDP growth to remain above potential for at least the next three quarters As a result, with the economy already at more than full employment, an upturn in inflation seems inevitable We already are seeing inflationary pressures, not just at the early stages of production but at the final stages as well As Bill McDonough said, inflation starts out very slowly, and that is what we are seeing On a year-over-year basis, virtually all the price indices as well as the employment cost index and average hourly earnings have either bottomed out or are showing increases in recent months So, it seems to me that the issue before us now is not whether inflation will be picking up, but how much and over what time horizon  Mr Chairman, I agree with your recommendation completely I am convinced that the sooner we move on this, the less we will have to move later I am not at all inclined to say that we have to look to a 150 basis point increase at any time Right now the 75 is before us; I think that it is a wise move I also think we should make as little comment about this as possible, in line with what Bob Parry is saying in terms of the dollar or whether we should pause I think it would handicap us needlessly  I don't have a question In terms of this conversation and where it has drifted, I am not quite sure what we are deciding here, but--  What I understand, Mr Chairman, is that we have been operating in a very restricted way in the sense that if there is a disorderly market or some other fundamental development, you and others come together knowing that this Committee is generally  -58-    11/15/94  reluctant to intervene But it depends on circumstances and the proposed intervention is thought through pretty carefully I assume that's how we are talking about going forward from here If it is, I feel comfortable with that If we are talking about changing to large, multiday operations for different reasons than this limited context, then I would have trouble with that "
5416,1994-12-20,HOENIG," Thank you, Mr Chairman The Tenth District economy continues to grow at a healthy pace and gains remain spread across all states and all industries Our bank directors are almost uniformly positive about current conditions and the near-term outlook for our region One key example comes from the transportation industry, where reports show strained capacity resulting from very strong demand for shipments of coal, autos, building materials, and a variety of other products In almost every part of the District, we continue to hear reports of shortages of labor, spanning both skilled and unskilled Consistent with these reports, current data show nonfarm jobs in the District up almost 3 percent in October from a year earlier, about equal to the nation Most states added jobs at rates close to the District average, but a couple--New Mexico for example--were substantially over the average  Manufacturing continues to improve, with most of the strength in the durable goods industries Our contacts in the District's key automobile assembly plants tell us that they are operating at capacity levels following the changeover to new models Major expansions are under way in the District for plants producing computer chips and other computer equipment Construction activity remains robust across the District Most of the recent strength has been in public projects with some modest slowing in home building The energy sector is at least stable over the past few weeks, but farm incomes are probably on the weaker side for us, especially in cattle and hog production Bank credit continues to increase at most District banks, with strong loan growth offsetting some modest decline in securities  At the national level, we are looking for growth in the last quarter to be as much as 5 percent I look for that momentum to carry forward into next year I also share the view that the economy is currently operating beyond long-term potential levels Such measures as the unemployment rate and capacity utilization certainly suggest that and perhaps even an overheating economy At the current policy stage and looking forward to next year, I think we do have continued inflationary pressures that confront us as we enter 1995 With that, to avoid going over the fence, I'll shut up  Mr Chairman, I would agree with those who say that we need to take some action at some point I think that that should be now, not later The best environment is to do it now while sensitive to market concerns I happen to think Governor LaWare is correct By delaying we would risk having to do more later and having more adverse effects, so I would prefer doing something now  -35-    12/20/94 "
5453,1995-01-13,HOENIG," I thought there was some collateral, for part of the drawings at least, at the New York Bank; is that not correct? "
5469,1995-01-31,HOENIG," First of all, I agree on immediate announcements, and I like the way we have done it That is, when we take no action, we say there is no announcement Regarding the statement, I think it should give no reason or be extremely brief We started making announcements to make sure there is no advantage to anyone Our procedure takes care of a lot of that and is one of the reasons I am pleased with it Now, if we take it a step further-- especially when we have a change only in the fed funds rate, and start explaining--we open ourselves up even more to misinterpretation, I think Every word is taken a different way, and that causes more confusion than it settles Except in very rare instances, and there are always instances one can think of, we should minimize any comments  If I may, it seems to me that the last part of that should be stated the other way There is a presumption that if there is no policy change, the meeting would end with no announcement An exception would be made if there is a policy consideration to be served, which we would discuss at the meeting Is that what I heard?  Thank you  I would say the current situation is such that as much as I would like to turn the tape off, I don't think we can Having said that, I must tell you that I think Governor Lindsey is right First of all, I believe the tape has had some chilling effect on our discussions I see a lot more people reading their statements I think it is harder to be as candid as some of us might otherwise be But more importantly, I think if we do start seeing the threat of a subpoena or inquiries, that will have a clear chilling effect, and it could happen at the most critical of times for monetary policymaking We are in a sense confined to this outcome of leaving the tape on for now I hate to see this enunciated as a formal policy I would like to see our options preserved for the time when we can seize the opportunity to turn the tape off  As the Chairman has defined the proposal now, I could live with it But as a concept, let me just say, number one, I think that we are a consensus-building body and our success has been very much built around that I also think that nuances and  -30-    1/31-2/1/95  differences are reported and defined in the minutes so that the outside world can see them I believe it would be a mistake to begin having concurring statements unless they are extremely limited I would define that as almost never if not never Otherwise, we invite into the process, as Bob Forrestal said, a feeling of obligation to state a view because one's view is not quite the same as the view expressed by another member or a member wants to get his or her name on the record But more importantly, if there are differences, I think concurring statements invite a proliferation of statements That then opens up even more the issue of releasing the minutes sooner This could take us down a very rocky road  Mr Chairman, as all issues go, I think both arguments have merit I believe a couple of things one, for us to change our emphasis, there needs to be some kind of legislation, and that is partly what this is about Among the alternative approaches that have been discussed, I am inclined toward something like the Neal amendment because I think that price stability is a necessary condition for long-term growth At the same time, I would not be  -49-    1/31-2/1/95  strongly inclined toward a numerical target, because I think there is a measurement problem with that So, I prefer the language in the Neal amendment regarding the objective of price stability I think that having that would not negate our need to maintain balance, but it would give us an emphasis toward price stability that is necessary for long-term growth It also would give us the important discretion to handle shocks or to allow for events to take place which monetary policy can address within a clear mandate toward price stability in the long term that in turn will give us a better opportunity for long- term growth That is how I would approach it  When you say ""go first to the Treasury,"" the Treasury then is providing the backing, not the ESF?  Okay  Let me just ask How big is the ESF right now in terms of its assets?  Ted, why is the Federal Reserve involved in this? Is it because of a liquidity problem for the ESF?  The latter would have us involved for how long? For the ten years that was mentioned earlier?  Okay  I have to ask you, when you say ""lock up""-- Are we committing to this now? Is this something that, if we have a change of heart after our discussions later, we can not take back because we are in this now?  I understand and I hear what Tom Melzer said What the Chairman is saying is that things are changing quickly Yes, we have approved it, but what are we buying into? That's what I just do not know  Just a clarification question to you, Peter You talked a little about, and the Greenbook also referred to, some backing off in the growth of foreign demand for US exports But this morning you are still talking about continued robust growth Am I understanding you correctly? Is there still some backoff in your projection?  You are not looking for a change in Europe or elsewhere?  -80-    1/31-2/1/95  But otherwise the outlook is still pretty strong?  Thank you, Mr Chairman The Tenth District economy remains strong, bolstered by healthy gains in its key industries across the states Our directors from all parts of the  -89-    1/31-2/1/95  District report a robust pace of business activity A director from our utilities industry reports strong growth in electricity sales to important industrial customers including manufacturers of steel, automobiles, and plastics In the transportion industry, growing demand for shipments of coal, automobiles, and other products continues to strain capacity A national manufacturer of home improvement products in our District reported exceptionally strong sales over the last year His company has, for the first time in several years, successfully passed increases in prices to his customers Director reports about shortages that I commented on previously are not coming in strong Whether that is because some have stopped reporting because they already have done so several times or because conditions have changed is not certain  Recent employment data confirm anecdotal reports of economic strength Nonfarm jobs in the District were up nearly 3 percent December over December this past year, nearly matching the national average Three of our states including New Mexico had job growth twice the national average District manufacturing activity continues to strengthen, with most of the improvement in the durable goods industries Our contacts in the automobile industry tell us that the District's assembly plants are operating at very high rates of capacity Construction activity remains brisk but the industry's mix is shifting Housing construction is slowing, while commercial and public works construction is strengthening The energy industry remains weak due to crude oil and natural gas prices The agricultural sector has strengthened on improvements in livestock prices Bank credit continues to increase at most of our District banks, with strong loan growth more than offsetting runoffs in holdings of securities Our bank directors remain very positive about economic conditions  At the national level, I believe there is still considerable momentum in most sectors of the economy I think this momentum will extend well into the second quarter of this year, at least We are perhaps beginning to see some moderation, but it is a moderation from a very high growth rate and it leaves overall growth well above potential I do remain concerned about inflation prospects I am pleased that we have not yet seen an acceleration of inflation at the consumer level Anecdotal evidence as well as our experience over the postwar period suggest it is a matter of time More specifically, I agree with the Board staff's assessment that rates of unemployment and capacity utilization are currently at inflationary levels Given the lag structures, I still would expect to see a gradual increase in inflation in final goods this year  Mr Chairman, I support your recommendations for a 1/2 percentage point increase and a symmetrical directive I would like to say that whether or not we move now is based on whether we think it is prudent on the basis of the evidence The preponderance of the evidence I heard today and your arguments suggest to me that moving now is appropriate I am sensitive, too, to whether we are forward-looking or not, but there is one nuance in terms of what Governor Blinder said that is important as well That is, if we wait because we have this whiff of a slowdown and if we are reasonably convinced that there is increasing inflation in train, we will come perhaps to the point where we get just another whiff with a little increase in inflation and find ourselves asking what we should do now It will be harder to make the move then because we will have both rising inflation and this whiff of a slowdown at the same time So, I think now is the prudent time to move A move will help staunch inflation going forward I think buying the insurance now and heading off further inflation and a larger move later, as Governor Lindsey said, is the right thing to do I support you  In the material that was given to us last night there are statements about--I don't know if they apply to the $20 billion--the issuance of guarantees What are they?  Would that be constrained by the total of $20 billion?  So the ESF could only advance or guarantee that amount?  A follow-up to that Is it anticipated that we would not have to advance the full amount--our $6 billion or the total of $20 billion--but that that amount is the maximum we would make available? In other words, are we announcing this amount so that the markets will feel more comfortable and will come in, and hopefully that will keep us from having to go in with the maximum of $20 billion? Or is it assumed that we are going in for the full $20 billion?  Mr Chairman, I think my questions have been answered I have a general understanding of what is proposed here There are two aspects to this One is to contain the immediate crisis and the other is to assure that it does not recur in two years or whenever I am very unclear on the process to assure that it does not recur, as you said that you are  In another sense, I think it is unprecedented for us to come into this process with so much uncertainty I will defer to your judgment This is important and must go forward But I have a lot of sympathy for what Tom is saying I am uneasy about it If it weren't for the magnitude of this crisis and your involvement, I would have grave reservations about doing this I defer to your judgment "
5494,1995-03-10,HOENIG," Mr Chairman, this is Tom Hoenig I have a question I know that you can't describe the circumstances in detail, but it seems to me that things have quieted and the market is not short So, what kind of circumstances might we be talking about to undertake this intervention?  I think we need fairly clear reasons for going in Coming in just to show the flag can create questions and uncertainty In my view, things have settled down and I would wait for an event before I tried to show the flag I would do so only if that would make the Europeans feel more comfortable I'm not sure it would do us a lot of good  Yes, something noticeable "
5512,1995-03-28,HOENIG," Mr Chairman, since it is proposed to increase the access to Class I from 4 to 7, that means the same number of people can have access to Class I and to Class II as you noted It might be of some value, at least to us, if we could also move up by 3 the access to Class II I don't know if there would be any problem with that; at least I want to raise it as a possibility  I think it would be desirable to allow a few more people to have access to less important information for the experience of reading it and understanding it  I'm sorry I made my suggestion!  Mr Chairman, the Tenth District economy remains strong, with strength evident throughout the region Our directors are uniformly reporting robust growth in all District states Moreover, recently revised employment data confirm the strength of the District economy Nonfarm jobs were up 42 percent in January over the previous year New Mexico, for example, continues to rank among the top states in terms of job growth Six of our seven District states are experiencing job growth above the national average Manufacturing is a leading source of economic strength; factories in the region are generally operating at high levels of capacity Durable goods makers have been adding jobs at a rapid pace Retail sales are generally buoyant across the region, although automobile sales have shown some weakness recently In the construction sector, a recent surge in office construction has more than offset the slowing in the housing sector Notwithstanding the recent strength that I am reporting, there are signs that overall activity is beginning to slow Our quarterly survey of manufacturers suggests that activity has begun to cool somewhat Fewer factory managers are reporting gains in production and shipments than was the case last fall Also, loan growth in District banks has moderated lately from the rapid growth of  -27-    3/28/95  the fourth quarter last year Manufacturers report steady increases in prices of materials, with more of these hikes being passed through to final product prices Reports of wage pressures, however, are still isolated  Turning to the national economy, recent signs of moderation in economic activity to a more sustainable level are, of course, welcome But whether that moderation will be sufficient to cap inflation--to echo what others have said--is still an open question I believe that, on balance, there is upside risk to the forecast over the year as a whole I would like to mention some of the reasons The interest-sensitive sectors of the economy may show more strength than was projected, particularly if the recent run-up in bond prices is sustained Notwithstanding Mexico and South America, export growth may outperform our expectations, given the decline in the dollar Firms may be more aggressive in investing in new plant and equipment, especially given their capacity levels, and less aggressive in paring inventory growth than we currently believe Moreover, recent national bank lending data are consistent with an economy that is still growing at a fairly strong pace As for inflation, I agree that the core level of the CPI is likely to move up to the 3-1/4 percent range this year But if the economy comes in stronger than expected and if the dollar continues to weaken, I think inflation could move higher I do not look for much help on the labor cost side because traditionally labor cost movements have lagged inflation movements, suggesting that the best news on this front may be behind us The implication in my view is that the risks continue to lie on the side of inflationary pressures Thank you  Mr Chairman, given the data coming in, I can wait as you are suggesting But as I said earlier, I am concerned about the upside risks especially for inflation, and I am concerned about the inertia Don was talking about that can take place With that, I would very strongly support asymmetry toward tightening and would encourage us to move sooner rather than later "
5531,1995-04-28,HOENIG," Peter, this is Tom What are the reserves of Mexico?    4/28/95  Thank you "
5544,1995-05-23,HOENIG," Mr Chairman, the Tenth District generally remains strong with some signs of modest slowing starting to emerge Overall, though, the District's sectors generally are continuing to exhibit strength and our directors do report consistently healthy growth across the region For example, recent monthly employment data show broad-based growth Our nonfarm jobs in the District were up almost 4 percent in March from a year earlier In six of our seven states the rate of job growth is exceeding the nation's pace, and New Mexico continues to rank among the top states Manufacturing activity remains robust across the region Durable goods producers have been adding jobs at a fairly consistent rate, even recently In fact, while there has been some reduction in overtime in our auto manufacturing plants, they have continued in some instances to hire new workers in the last three months There is strong growth in nonresidential building within our District We also have seen loan growth continuing at double-digit rates over the last two months  As I said, though, there are some signs of slowing in our regional economy There has been a little sluggishness in retail  -18-    5/23/95  sales according to reports from our directors and some of our other District contacts Residential building activity also has slowed recently And as others have mentioned, wet weather has led to substantial delays in planting spring crops, pointing to a slightly more difficult year for some of our farmers Overall wage/price pressures remain moderate in the District, but there are very scattered indications of emerging pressures  On the national level, our view is in line with the Board staff's projections We also believe that the projections are subject to considerable uncertainty Our sense at this stage is that the risks to the projections remain on the up side A couple of examples I think that consumer spending could remain strong in future months as employment income continues to grow Consumer confidence remains relatively good and household balance sheets are in good condition I think there is some potential strength in our export sector, given the depreciation of the dollar, as others have indicated The housing sector could turn stronger with long-term rates having come down a little So, I think there is some risk on the up side and that is a possible area for continued inflation concerns While I agree that the situation is uncertain, I think we do have to be diligent in watching those inflation numbers Thank you  Mr Chairman, I agree with ""B"" symmetric I do have concerns, as I mentioned earlier, that the inflation may be more than cyclical, and I agree that it is wise to wait and see "
5569,1995-07-05,HOENIG," Mr Chairman, the Tenth District economy remains moderately strong, but signs of slowing have emerged in recent months as I reported earlier For example, District employment growth slowed in March and actually turned down slightly in April and May, and the decline was rather broad-based However, total employment in May was still almost 3 percent higher than a year earlier, and our unemployment levels across the states are consistently below the national average In addition to slow employment growth, activity in the energy industry remains weak in our region, and the farm economy has been hurt recently by unfavorable weather and weak prices Other indicators, though, point to continued underlying strength in our District In construction, we have had recent job losses, but an upturn in housing permits and other construction contracts suggests the decline will be reversed in the months ahead In manufacturing, our survey of recent conditions indicates that this sector continues to expand, albeit at a somewhat slower pace District manufacturers also indicate that they still are operating at relatively high rates of capacity use Retail sales other than automobiles have been holding up quite well in recent months Moreover, retailers are generally optimistic about their prospects, although some inventory trimming has occurred Confirming some of this underlying strength in the District, loan growth at our banks remained relatively strong in May after moderating somewhat in earlier months this year Against this backdrop, wage and price pressures are easing to some extent We are seeing price increases in raw materials and manufacturing and we still have some shortages in labor in District markets But price  -20-    7/5-6/95  increases for finished goods have moderated and prices remain relatively stable on the retail side  On the national front, our projections are relatively similar to those of the Greenbook We believe the economy is going through a pause and an adjustment phase right now We expect that there will be a couple of quarters of growth below trend, but at the current level of fed funds we would also expect the economy to return to growth near potential by the fourth quarter and into next year This view is based on the fact that the fundamental determinants of consumer spending and business fixed investment are positive The outlook for net exports, while less robust than earlier thought, remains generally sound Inventory excesses do not appear large enough to require a prolonged correction This outlook permits the labor market and the industrial sector to return gradually to levels of activity consistent with more stable inflation We are looking for inflation to be capped at about 3-1/4 percent, which is not quite as optimistic as the Greenbook Looking beyond that, we see continued growth near the economy's potential in 1996  Mr Chairman, I agree with where you are coming from We have systematically deemphasized these ranges because they have not been reliable, and I think it would be presumptuous at this stage to conclude that we know where velocity is going to be And so I would feel comfortable with alternative I for the 1995 ranges; I would leave them where they are for 1996, although alternative I, which includes a higher M3 range, is acceptable to me for next year  -46-    7/5-6/95  Mr Chairman, after listening to the Committee's discusion yesterday and today, one of the things that strikes me--it feeds a little bit off the Bluebook--is that if we take the outcome in the baseline forecast as reasonable and desirable, then we might go with a no-change policy In our own Bank's view and in my view that outcome is reasonable, and in their comments around this table a lot of people said that they found such an outlook reasonable This suggests to me that the real funds rate may be where it should be at this stage There is no strong evidence that it is not When we look at the risks, yes, there are downside risks But as others have pointed out, the strong financial markets, the favorable banking conditions, and our own Bank's projection point to upside inflation risks, and that leaves me inclined to leave policy unchanged There is a statement in the Bluebook to the effect that if we want to insure against a possible further slowdown, we might want to ease But I am concerned that that insurance comes with its own price When we vote for monetary stimulus, we are also increasing the risk of further inflation In addition, some members want to ease in anticipation of prospective shocks that have not yet materialized The odds of such occurrences are unknown and that, too, leaves me uneasy about moving at this time So, I think it would be prudent for us to adopt an asymmetric directive and wait for information rather than to move at this juncture based on the projections and the evidence that we have about the real fed funds rate    7/5-6/95 "
5596,1995-08-22,HOENIG," A quick question In your answer to one of the earlier questions, you talked about inflation flattening out I thought I read in the Greenbook that you were really somewhat more optimistic about inflation coming down somewhat In your projections by quarter, you have a pretty significant decline Yet, given where we are in the cycle and given where we are with your projections on output, that seemed a little optimistic to me, although I read your rationale Is there one particular reason why you are foreseeing the improvement?  Thank you, Mr Chairman I will start with the District economy, which remains relatively strong and actually shows fewer signs of weakness than it did the last time we met This firmer tone in the region's economy is evident across a wide range of indicators The broadest gauge of improvement is that the District's employment levels have in fact leveled off after some earlier declines this spring and are up substantially over a year ago Manufacturing remains sound It's not growing significantly but remains sound, with plants operating at relatively high levels of capacity and firms generally satisfied with their inventory levels The District's construction industry shows signs of improving from this spring's slowdown We have seen some movement in contracts in the commercial as well as the residential side Our directors are reporting improving consumer confidence and rising retail sales, and this has been evident this past July Finally, confirming the overall strength in the District, loans at our banks have resumed growing at a healthy pace after slowing earlier in the summer Indeed, we see some signs of increased deposit rates as loan and deposit ratios move up, and there seems to be a drive for increased funding at the banks  There are a couple of weaker spots The energy industry as you know continues to languish due to low prices The District's farm economy has been hurt by a poor wheat harvest, especially in Oklahoma and Kansas, and by financial losses in the cattle industry Despite the overall strength in the economy, wage and price pressures remain subdued; we have seen only spotty movements in prices  At the national level, we concur with the general assessment that the inventory correction is for the most part behind us and that the economy will be rebounding as we go forward Looking out over the remainder of this year and into next year, I anticipate a pickup in activity, as does the Greenbook, to the 2 to 2-1/2 percent growth range Factors contributing to this pickup are continued strength in consumption and business fixed investment and a modest turnaround in residential construction  On the inflation side, I am not as optimistic as the Greenbook While we are reasonably confident that inflation will be capped at the 3 or 3-1/4 percent level, I do not expect core inflation to move much below 3 percent, if at all With most measures of the economy still operating at or above capacity and likely to do so for some time, I think the fundamentals indicate that price pressures will remain firm I will stop with that comment  Mr Chairman, I support your policy proposal "
5620,1995-09-26,HOENIG," Thank you, Mr Chairman The Tenth District economy remains really strong, with only a few signs of weakness here and there The improvement observed at midyear has been sustained, with strength reflected across several areas Employment has posted healthy gains over the last few months in our region Manufacturing staged a pretty good rebound in August from what we can tell, especially in the durable goods area including automobiles And the nondurable goods area, which had been a little weak in our area, is now holding pretty steady as we go forward In fact, some of our directors report that homebuilding activity has increased but housing construction still can not keep pace with the strong demand in some parts of our region We are anticipating some improvement in commercial building activity in the months ahead as indicated by lower office vacancy rates in most of the metropolitan areas in the District Activity in our energy industry has picked up a bit, especially in Wyoming On the other hand, the District farm economy continues to be weak; it is hurt especially by the cattle industry which is particularly important to our region The recent weather in the northern and western parts of the District may have hurt some crop yields, but we don't expect a big fallout from that Growth in bank credit has slowed as is true elsewhere in the country, and we think that may reflect the effects of inventory adjustments While the District economy generally appears to be strong, wages and final goods prices show no persistent signs of accelerating, though we are finding that some labor markets remain tight And we are getting indications from our manufacturers that prices of materials are continuing under upward pressure  Looking at the national economy over the remainder of this year and into next year, I expect growth to remain slightly below trend, but in the 2 to 2-1/2 percent range, which is similar to the Greenbook forecast Now, I think such growth is appropriate, given where the long-run potential seems to be and given the current level of resource utilization in the economy And that brings me to the issue of inflation I am still a little less optimistic than the Greenbook While it seems likely to me that inflation will be capped, I question whether the overall core inflation rate will drop much in the next year, in 1996 at least  Mr Chairman, I agree with your recommendation of ""B"" symmetric The reasons for me, however, are that I think the projections on the growth of the economy are reasonably accurate, and as I said earlier I am not quite as optimistic about the inflation outlook as the Greenbook I think we are in a good policy position As for the fiscal outlook, though both the Greenbook and our own projections view some fiscal restraint as possible, we don't know whether it will be more or less than we are assuming and we won't know for some time So, I am very comfortable with where we are right now  Mr Chairman, I support the thrust of this bill and most of the specifics I agree with the premise on which this bill is based, and that is that by promoting long-term price stability monetary policy supports long-term economic stability as well So, given that premise and given that belief, I support the bill I also think that the proposed bill does give us flexibility in terms of the short-term effects of our policy and it gives us room to maneuver generally I would like to see more specific language that takes into account supply shocks or other factors One can rationalize doing that with the proposed language, but I would feel more comfortable if those types of shocks were specifically recognized in the legislation to give us a little more wiggle room in terms of policy actions that  -45-    9/26/95  we might need to take in the short term But otherwise I do support the thrust of this bill very much "
5645,1995-11-15,HOENIG," Mr Chairman, I just want to comment on the background of the informal arrangement with the Japanese The memo that we got was very helpful In the phone calls that I received, there were two issues that warranted some explanation One was that the arrrangement was a bailout, and I think that notion followed upon the Mexican deal The other was that the discount window was somehow involved and that we would be lending at the basic discount rate to subsidize the Japanese Dispelling those distortions became the duty of the day I think these issues are still a matter of concern among some individuals in the market or in the banking industry, or wherever else the distortions persist I think it was good that we got the memo and as much information as we did because we received a lot of phone calls related to this fear of subsidizing the Japanese  I think the individuals I spoke to realized that That's why they were saying that if a problem were to occur, we might get involved in a discount window loan; and lending at the basic discount rate would mean a big subsidy The issue was why would we allow that, and on and on it went Because they had this piece of misinformation, their concerns multiplied very quickly  Mr Chairman, the Tenth Federal Reserve District continues to be relatively strong Since the last meeting, for example, payroll employment in our District continued to grow faster than the national average District manufacturers continue to operate at or near full capacity In recent surveys, many of them suggest that their operations have pretty much rebounded from the summer slowdowns In addition, retail sales have been solid throughout the District and most of the retailers we have talked to expect a good holiday season Our directors are reporting that commercial construction activity continues to be fairly brisk, offsetting a bit of a slowdown in home building Reflecting the generally healthy tone of the economy in our District, growth in bank credit has picked up recently, supported by gains in consumer and real estate lending While our economy is generally stronger, there are a couple of areas that have shown some weakness energy and agriculture Low oil prices continue to hold down activity in the District's energy industry, and financial losses in the District's cattle industry are likely to limit the improvement in farm incomes, which some of us were expecting Wage and price pressures remain relatively subdued despite the overall strength of our regional economy and despite some spotty reports of wage pressures at the lower end of the wage scale  On the national level, the outlook in my opinion remains favorable By that I mean that, on the real side, I am looking for growth to be about 2-1/4 percent over the next several quarters While I note the strength in the third quarter, I see economic activity returning to this more moderate pace as we move through this quarter into next year But even with this slowing, the economy remains fundamentally strong in my view, except for government spending and inventory investment I expect most other sectors to contribute to growth over the next several quarters A growth rate in a 2 to 2-1/4 percent range is entirely appropriate, I think This is especially true with the economy continuing to operate a bit beyond capacity, by most measures at least With regard to inflation, I believe that we need to continue to be cautious I'm pleased with some of the more favorable inflation numbers But despite this morning's report, I think it is important to acknowledge that core CPI inflation is likely to rise this year over last, and with resource use still at fairly high levels, wherever one believes the NAIRU is, we are not likely to see a real easing in inflation below that 3 percent mark as we go forward I think that has to be kept in mind as we proceed from here Thank you, Mr Chairman  Mr Chairman, for the reasons that you outlined I agree with your analysis and I support your recommendation of ""no change"" Because I don't think we should be trying to guess which way the economy is going at this stage, I feel that a symmetric directive is quite appropriate "
5670,1995-12-19,HOENIG," Mr Chairman, the Tenth District economy remains strong overall, with only a couple of our directors indicating some evidence of slight slowing Payroll employment in the District, for example, has been growing at a fairly healthy pace with gains in all our District states Among other signs of strength, District manufacturers continue to operate at levels near or at capacity, especially in our durable goods industries Our directors also report that retail sales appear to be holding up during the holiday season, although sales probably will grow less than they did a year ago in some areas Finally, construction activity has been brisk throughout our District, typically the building of roads and other public infrastructure While the economy in the Kansas City District appears to be generally strong, a few sectors are giving us some mixed signals One of those, of course, is the farm economy, which has been helped by higher crop prices, but financial losses continue to hurt the cattle industry, which is a very important industry within our region While oil and gas drilling activity has picked up recently, the District energy industry remains lackluster overall, with the workforce continuing to shrink somewhat  The final point I would make on the District is that, to date at least, upward pressure on wages and prices has been limited Labor markets remain tight in many parts of the District, but reports of rising wages, though evident, still remain scattered  For the national economy, I believe that, given current policy, conditions are such that growth for the next several quarters will be about 2 to 2-1/2 percent and inflation will be 3 percent, perhaps a little less In this environment, moreover, economic resources will continue to be used at or near capacity levels A little concern has been raised here about consumer spending and fiscal drag As for consumption, I think it certainly needs to be monitored, but I believe it can be maintained at levels consistent with the income growth projected in these GDP forecasts Consumer debt, while it indeed has increased relative to income, is not at historical peaks, and I think it would allow consumption to continue upward Also, if we assume that consumer debt burdens are excessive, I am not sure that monetary policy can address that issue in the longer run As regards fiscal policy, I agree that the budget debate should not be a consideration for us Reasonable estimates suggest, though, that the deficit reductions in 1996 are likely to be quite small Thus, any drag on the economy from fiscal actions will be limited in the foreseeable future at least I also would point out that lower yields in long-term debt markets have been stimulative That suggests to me that in the context of developments in those markets our policy has been neutral and not slightly tight Thus, overall, we have an economy slowing to potential and inflation capped at only 3 percent, and that is something that I think we should keep in mind as we go forward  Mr Chairman, I would prefer that we not change the funds rate right now given the projections of our economists in  -46-    12/19/95  Kansas City and in the Greenbook However, given that we are talking about a small adjustment and given that there would be the expectation, which I would fully endorse, of no discount rate change, I can accept your proposal at this time "
5694,1996-01-30,HOENIG," Thank you, Mr Chairman To answer Cathy's question on changes in consumer confidence, I am struck by the fact that I have a pretty good report for my District, and I am beginning to wonder if I ought to give it or not! Our District economy continues to be strong overall with only a few signs of weakness in a couple of areas that I will mention For example, gains in payroll employment during the fourth quarter were solid throughout our District District manufacturers continued to operate at or near capacity, with a couple of exceptions Good growth in the durable goods manufacturing sector has continued Our directors report continued strength in commercial construction activity in many, if not most, parts of the District and even some modest pickup in residential  -16-    1/30-31/96  construction Capital and loans are still available and even plentiful in some cases  Although the District economy is generally healthy, there are a couple of weak spots energy activity remains sluggish despite some recent price increases, and continued financial losses in the cattle industry are hurting our farm income outlook even though crop prices are at their highest levels in some years Wage and price pressures remain modest in the District despite overall strength in the economy Labor markets remain tight in some parts of the District and some of our manufacturers continue to report shortages of skilled labor Despite that, upward pressures on wages and prices remain subdued  For the national economy, our projections are very similar to those in the Greenbook On the real side, we agree that the outlook remains favorable, with real GDP likely to run at or perhaps a little below potential Because of the mild overshooting in the level of resource use that we have experienced, however, I think we will see an inflation number that is comparable to last year's, about 30 or 31 percent So, I think the Greenbook is a little optimistic on that front Also, with growth running somewhat below potential, I expect unemployment to drift up a little this year Still, we are essentially in agreement with the Greenbook, and we share the view that the economy is on sound footing at this time Overall, the fundamentals remain sound or satisfactory as we look to the future  I prefer Alternative I I agree with the staff and those members who say it is too early to know where velocity is or what its growth rate will be I also think that if we change the ranges now, we will have things backwards If we are changing them because we think the growth rates will be much higher rather than because we want to target what we think should be higher growth rates, knowing what velocity is, we could come up with different answers I don't think we have enough information in either case, and I don't think that we should signal to anyone that we do  Mr Chairman, I think most of the people who plan for the future try to do so with a goal in mind They should state that goal, and I think such a statement can serve very well I favor the idea of having a price stability goal because price stability does achieve all those objectives that we talk about Having a stated goal is a form of discipline that is especially useful during difficult times when it is easier to drift away from it The caveat that I have is similar to Bill McDonough's I think if we were to do that, it would have to be done very carefully within the context of Humphrey-Hawkins because that's the law of the land We have to be consistent with that law not only in substance, which we may be able to do by setting the goal, but also in appearance There is a debate going on in the Congress right now I would like to get us to the point where we have this goal, but I think we ought to let the debate play out If we do adopt a goal in the interim, we should couch it in terms that are very clearly consistent with Humphrey-Hawkins  Mr Chairman, I would prefer not to move at this time We have an economy that is growing at about potential There are continued inflationary pressures They are not strong pressures, but I think we will be making little or no progress on inflation I realize we are long into this expansion, but there is also a lot of noise in our current data In my view, it would be wise for us to wait and gather more information to help us determine with more  -56-    1/30-31/96  assurance where we ought to be and where we will be down the road So, I think the wiser course would be for us to wait "
5718,1996-03-26,HOENIG," Mr Chairman, I think that is accurate We    3/26/96  think the depletion of herd inventories has just begun, at most, and meat prices probably reflect that expectation in the context of rising grain costs The dominant factor is a strong supply of red meat that has not been liquidated yet  A lot of mad ranchers, but no mad cows! [Laughter]  Mr Chairman, the economy in the Kansas City District continues to grow at a fairly strong pace, with recent developments pointing to greater strength now than I reported at the last meeting Recent revisions to our state employment statistics showed stronger job gains in the Tenth District in 1995 than previously thought, running at a year-over-year rate of about 27 percent Moreover, all seven states in the District added jobs at a fairly robust pace in January Principal sources of our strength are in the manufacturing and construction sectors District manufacturing continues to operate at high levels of capacity, and our general aviation industry is doing very well right now Our survey of factories throughout the region also indicates considerable optimism about the next six months In addition, our directors are reporting continued strength in commercial construction and some expansion in housing activity As reported to us, loans are readily available at our banks to both commercial and other borrowers  Although District activity is generally strong, there are a couple of weak spots The region's energy industry remains lackluster despite some higher oil and natural gas prices in recent months Another weak area is agriculture, where a continued slump in cattle prices and continued dry weather are hurting the income prospects for many in that sector However, those farmers who do harvest a crop should do well in light of the high grain prices right now  Wage and price pressures still remain modest in the District, although labor markets appear to continue to get tighter More of our directors are reporting tight labor markets for entry-level and some skilled jobs as well Prices of raw materials are showing some increases  On the national front, I think that the fundamentals remain strong, and we expect, as the Greenbook does, growth at about the potential rate of 2 percent With the capacity in the economy being used at its current level, the rise in core inflation from 1994 through 1995 probably will continue, and I think that is a risk we have to keep in mind as I have said before That concludes my comments  I agree with your recommendation "
5740,1996-05-21,HOENIG," Mr Chairman, the Tenth District economy continues to grow at a strong pace with most indicators pointing to little change since our last meeting Recent employment reports show that the number of jobs in the District grew again in March and that employment in all seven of our states is growing at rates above the national average Manufacturing and retail trade remain principal sources of strength in our region Our survey of factories throughout the region indicates a recent rebound in production schedules and optimism about the next six months In addition, building activity is running above a year ago and our directors report continued strength in commercial construction The recent runup in oil prices and a more favorable outlook have boosted energy activity in the District Drilling activity, for example, has shown steady increases over the last three to four months, and energy employment actually rose in March, the first increase in recent memory  While economic activity is generally solid in our District, the agricultural sector remains weak, and the District's very important cattle industry is mired in a deep slump The liquidation of cattle herds appears to have begun One of our large packers said that their average slaughter rates are up 12 to 14 percent a month over three months ago Although our wheat crop is now expected to come in at about half its normal size, the rains that we have received point to a more favorable outlook for other crops, corn for example  Price pressures are still stable, but I do want to share some anecdotal information I am aware that the plural of ""anecdote"" is not ""data!"" With regard to the labor markets, our discussions suggest that highly skilled workers are getting some fairly good wage increases That would include Boeing-type employment in Wichita Those increases are having a ripple effect and are causing some gains down to the bottom end of the pay scale--such as increases to $600 an hour for entry-level clerks In the crafts area, business agents for workers in our area tell us that they have not seen such strong demand for their workers since the late 1960s and that their ability to negotiate favorable wage settlements has improved dramatically So, we are seeing some increasing anecdotal evidence that suggests rising wage pressures going forward  On the national level, our forecast is in line with that of the Greenbook In the very near term, we continue to see growth at a rate above that of the first quarter With the long-term interest rate increases that have occurred, we anticipate that the rate of expansion will fall back toward the economy's long-term growth potential later in the year With regard to inflation, I am less  -14-    5/21/96  optimistic than the Greenbook and increasingly concerned about the upside risk of greater inflation While current inflation does reflect the effects of supply shocks, I, like others around the table, believe that the economy is operating fundamentally at a level where the unemployment rate is around its potential and capacity utilization around its potential Accordingly, I see the upside risks of inflation as noticeably higher, and we should take that into account  Mr Chairman, I would prefer that we tighten now I think we have consistently underestimated the strength of the economy over the last several months and earlier, going back to last fall We are looking for the economy to continue to be strong We are no longer talking about capping inflation We are talking about seeing it creep up, or move up, and that is the wrong direction because we want positive economic growth over the longer term In my view, we may be compromising the sustainability of the expansion if we allow inflation to get much higher than what we are now projecting At a minimum, we should have an asymmetric directive toward tightness  Mr Chairman, I will repeat a little of what Bill just said We have a goal for inflation and maybe we should define more clearly what we mean by price stability in the long term Our discussion so far today has shown the difficulty of putting that in 1998 terms We would spend a lot of time discussing whether we have a forecast or goal and not a lot of time on whether it is consistent with price stability We would be right back where we are anyway So, if we go with the proposal, I think it will create more confusion over time than it will provide clarity "
5764,1996-07-02,HOENIG," Mike, I have a question on the housing sector We are seeing some quite good increases in the average price of houses in our area and some buying in the expectation of further increases That may help to explain the run-up in mortgage rates What do the data show more generally about housing prices? Are you seeing any of that in the data for the nation or is that just a local phenomenon?  Do you see it in terms of anticipatory buying more generally?  Mr Chairman, the economy in our District continues to grow at a relatively strong pace, with gains spread broadly across most of our industries Manufacturing and construction remain major sources of strength in our region Factory jobs in the District rose again in April, and industry contacts indicate that production schedules remain strong In addition, our directors report brisk activity in construction, although slightly less than earlier in the year Retail sales also continue to improve across the District While retailers and automobile dealers report modest sales gains, most expect sales to strengthen further during the remainder of this summer Energy activity continues to strengthen in our District despite somewhat weaker crude oil and natural gas prices Drilling  -21-    7/2-3/96  activity increased in May for the fourth consecutive month and is up noticeably over a year ago The agricultural area remains weak both in the cattle industry and with crops where prices are good but some of our producers got about half a crop at most, some none  While economic activity is generally solid across the District, we have seen signs of very modest price pressures in the retail sales area However, there continue to be strong indications of tight labor markets With regard to the anecdotal information, a major distributor of housewares headquartered in our region indicated that there actually has been a small decrease in the prices of the products that they purchase for sale across the United States, perhaps in the neighborhood of 1 percent, in contrast to consistent 2 percent increases in the last several years However, their wage costs are rising The average increase this year will be in the 4 percent range for new entrants, 6 percent for those in the training or the sales areas, and even higher for other workers So, they are experiencing differing pressures in their costs of doing business  On the national level, I am broadly in agreement with the Greenbook and look for second-quarter growth of 3-1/2 to 4 percent, with growth moderating toward 2-1/4 percent near the end of the year Looking into next year and assuming current interest rates, I would expect growth to remain slightly above potential Like the Greenbook, I believe the risks are largely on the up side Virtually all sectors look solid While we would expect higher long-term interest rates to temper demand, it is possible that interest-sensitive sectors of the economy may be more resilient to higher rates than we formerly believed Thank you  You have lost me, Mr Chairman; I don't know where to go from there!  To address the question as you framed it in your discussion with Janet Yellen and Al Broaddus, I would like to observe that from my perspective the evidence as presented in Dave Stockton's paper and others is that high inflation is bad Everyone agrees with that It also is clear that, given the purpose of money, zero inflation properly measured is where we should be over time Our experience shows that even modest inflation causes distortions over time in terms of incentives and signals in the economy and that inflation therefore lowers productivity In my view that requires that we take the legislation that is in place now and pursue stable prices seriously I think the mandate is there In implementing that mandate, I would agree with Bob Parry and Al Broaddus that we ought to start somewhere I would accept 2 percent inflation as the interim goal if we can agree on a reasonable timeframe in which we would move systematically toward that goal I think we would be much better off doing it over some definite time period than arguing over whether we have a proper measure for zero inflation So, I think moving toward lower inflation, defined as 2 percent, is a good intermediate goal When we get there, we can see how the markets and producers react and discuss at that time whether inflation ought to go to zero and whether we have the right measure for inflation  Hasn't all the discussion allowed for taking shocks to the system into account? It is not that we would immediately react dramatically to bring down the rate of inflation  Mr Chairman, I am for leaving the ranges unchanged First of all, Dave Lindsey made a good point in the sense that, although his chart on velocity suggests more stability over the past 2 years or so, it is still too early to come to any firm conclusion Secondly, I think changing the ranges systematically involves more than explanations It involves raising questions in people's minds as to whether we have changed our attitude about our long-term goal for inflation Governor Lindsey makes a point in terms of 2 plus 2, but I think that requires another discussion It is 2 plus 2 for some, but it may be another number for others, depending on what they view as a proper measure of inflation, and that would affect where they want to set the ranges So, a lot more discussion is required before we undertake to change these measures systematically  Don, I want to follow up on your reference to financial markets in terms of policy actions now or later It strikes  -80-    7/2-3/96  me that there has been a fair amount of run-up and perhaps even some artificiality in some of the financial markets, such as those for IPOs or indeed whatever market you want to talk about You indicated what the effect might be on the stock market if we made a tightening move now But if there is a certain degree of artificiality, what would be the effect of waiting, and what is the relative risk that we run by letting that market run up further and then moving versus moving now and letting the market adjustment occur and spill over to the real economy?  Mr Chairman, after listening to you, I have a better sense of the difficulties in this process--the uncertainty about the model or analytical framework that we use to assess the incoming data I also appreciate Bill McDonough's comment that we need to have the public's confidence and support I think, though, that we ought to be careful before we abandon the model we have been  -87-    7/2-3/96  using, as some members have said already I would be reluctant to abandon such a model given our past experience Our projections suggest that there will be increases in inflation, although the change in our inflation measures introduces a confusing element Given the upside risks that are associated with the projections and weighing that against the downside risk of a small tightening move, I think there is a very good case for moving now If I were voting, I would put it in that context But I probably would say that the asymmetric directive toward tightening that we have on the table gives us an appropriate direction for policy and we can wait for increasing evidence at least until August I would be willing to wait that long, but I really think that a small move now would have tremendous benefits in the long term  Mr Chairman, I appreciate the breadth of this discussion and for my purposes would like to put it in a different perspective In my view, the first issue relating to our swap lines is our attitude toward intervention That has been the reason for their existence, why they have been maintained and renewed My own preference is for us to intervene on a very limited basis, and I think that also has been a very strong premise for some time for many on this Committee I believe that should continue We have foreign currency balances that provide us with a mechanism for intervention should we choose to use those balances in circumstances that we deem appropriate As they have evolved over the years, our swap lines have been of very limited use, and I think they present a confusing picture about our role and intentions going forward We should phase them out As far as the timing is concerned, the European Monetary Union provides us with an opportunity We may not be in a position to choose the exact timing, but it is an opportunity to phase out the swap network in a rational way without raising a lot of questions or uncertainties I think we should take advantage of that opportunity  That brings me to the issue of liquidity, whether we call it reverse repos or lending to others I am very uncertain about that and would not want to indicate my leanings at this time because I think we need more information and a broader discussion I know on the basis of some of the documents that I have seen in the past that there has been a very strong reluctance to get involved in the appearance or the reality of lending to another central bank or other international financial institution So, I would like to know a little more about the potential liquidity needs, what countries would be involved, and how we would set general criteria for providing funds if we are going to move down that road I certainly would hesitate to do it very quickly Perhaps it is my own ignorance, but I believe we need more information on the table before we move to a decision And I think that is a separate issue from swaps in principle  I think we should do that over time in future meetings "
5790,1996-08-20,HOENIG," Mr Chairman, the economy in the Kansas City District, like other parts of the nation, has slowed, in our case from a very strong to a still strong rate of growth; it just is not as strong as it was a few months ago Our directors confirm the positive tone in the region's economy, with many reporting healthy gains in businesses throughout the District The rail transportation industry, for instance, is reporting solid gains in rail traffic, and operations are at full capacity right now The signs that regional growth has slowed through the summer include indications in our latest manufacturing survey of slower growth in output than in our previous survey last spring Construction contracts and housing permits, consistent with data for other parts of the country, also have shown some easing, but it has to be emphasized that the easing has been from very high rates On the agricultural side, grain producers continue to do very well at currently high prices while the cattle industry is still suffering somewhat Our labor markets continue to be tight Reports of wage pressures, while still sporadic, are becoming more frequent now, and we are seeing some efforts to address those pressures through improved benefits So, I think inflation prospects are worsening somewhat in our regional economy  On the national economy, we continue to see an outlook for growth along the lines reported in the Greenbook I do not see a lot of differences in our projections and those in the Greenbook We agree with the Greenbook that, even if the expansion slows somewhat, the rate of inflation will register a very modest 1/4 point increase this year and maybe another 1/4 point next year, all other things held constant I think that is the outlook we have to deal with here today or in the next few meetings Thank you  Mr Chairman, I believe that we should increase the federal funds rate now at least 1/4 percent As I read the evidence, inflation is not slowing I think that is a fact and that the indications are that it will rise I would also argue that even small but persistent increases in inflation over time can have a fairly dramatic effect on the purchasing power of the dollar when compounded Also, in the context of our currently strong economy and the objective of sustaining growth over the long term--and I recognize that policy involves balancing risks--I believe that a small increase now would bring more benefits in terms of moderating the inflationary pressures that are facing us than the risks it would incur of accelerating the economic slowdown that is worrying us to some degree I think it would be prudent for us to take this action now The economy can afford this action, and I think the long-term benefits would be greater for us "
5814,1996-09-24,HOENIG," Thank you, Mr Chairman The Tenth District economy remains strong, and I do not have a lot to add to my previous reports I would point out that our directors continue to report healthy business conditions throughout our District Retail sales and home building appear to be holding up well in nearly all parts of the District Manufacturing continues to operate at high levels of capacity; employment levels remain high; rail shipments by one of our major companies are up about 5 percent this quarter over an already strong second quarter Crop producers are expecting a sharp boost in income as very large crop yields should be combined this year with good prices So they are very optimistic The cattle industry is showing some improvement as well, although ranchers are still losing some money and feeders are making just a little Wage and price pressures appear to have increased in the District according to the anecdotal reports In addition, price increases for replacement equipment and machinery parts are being reported to us somewhat more often as we go around the District Having said that, when we shake  -13-    9/24/96  everything out in terms of the anecdotal evidence, our retailers are still feeling the pressure from rising costs, but we are not seeing a lot of it being passed on into higher prices at this stage  On the national economy, I have no quarrel with the Greenbook forecast We see the outlook much as it is being shown there, with all major sectors in relatively good shape As pointed out in the Greenbook, methodology changes are serving to lower the CPI numbers, but when these numbers are adjusted and prepared on a consistent basis I agree with the projection that core CPI inflation will be trending up over the next two years I think we have to be aware of that I also have noticed, not only in our District but a little more widely on the basis of anecdotal reports, that there is a bit more of a speculative bent to the economy in terms of types of investments in land and in some of the asset areas I believe we should at least take note of that at this stage Thank you  Mr Chairman, I am uneasy about waiting I think that cost pressures are building I, like President Moskow, was fascinated by the productivity discussion and would like to see that analysis If I were voting, I would say that I prefer to move now, but I would accept your recommendation  Just a follow-up, Peter I want to make sure I understand the reason for your average duration proposal Did you choose the 18-month duration because that leaves you within the bounds  -44-    9/24/96  of intervention amounts that we have done in the past? What is the reason for the 18 months if it does not relate to that?  I am sure someone would assume that  -52-    9/24/96  SPEAKER(?) We could use the profits to support our ""airforce""! "
5839,1996-11-13,HOENIG," Mr Chairman, the economy in the Kansas City District continues to grow moderately and consistently Our directors and other business contacts generally report healthy economic conditions throughout the District Retail trade appears to be holding up well across all seven District states A recent survey of District manufacturers conducted by our Bank found that moderate  -14-    11/13/96  expansion of production schedules is in place at this time Despite some generally favorable anecdotal reports, employment has leveled off in recent months It was unchanged in September and up just a little in August Improved conditions in our agricultural sector have raised income levels somewhat, and we are seeing some drilling activity in our energy sector as well Overall consumer and wholesale prices now appear to be rising slowly but consistently across our District Labor markets are indeed tight, and we are hearing more frequent reports of wage pressures for our manufacturers as well as for our retail and service industries  For the national outlook, our projections are very similar to those of the Board staff Over the next several quarters, I look for real GDP to advance at around the trend rate of 2 to 2-1/4 percent There remains, as others have mentioned, some uncertainty about consumption, but we believe that the underlying fundamentals are good Looking at other sectors of the economy, it appears that we can expect solid economic growth in the fourth quarter For example, the industrial sector continues to expand, and housing activity should remain healthy, given the declines we have seen in long-term interest rates While we have a CPI inflation rate that is now reported to be running around 3 percent, allowing for the methodological adjustments being made to this measure, that still reflects an upward move in the inflation rate I think this has been noticeable over the last 18 months As it has in the past, the rise in inflation continues to concern me Thank you  Mr Chairman, I continue to have two concerns One is that the risks of inflation remain on the up side, as depicted in the projections that both the Greenbook and our staff have laid out In that kind of atmosphere and related attitudes going forward, I am concerned about signs of a potential financial bubble Having said that, what you have defined is an environment involving a fair amount of uncertainty about activity in the real economy, where that may be going, and some uncertainty in the outlook for inflation So, I would be inclined to move now, but I could accept your recommendation of ""B"" asymmetric  -36-    11/13/96 "
5864,1996-12-17,HOENIG," Mr Chairman, I will keep my comments brief because economic conditions in the Kansas City District have not changed a great deal since the last time we met Our regional economy has continued to grow consistently, although at a moderate pace On the anecdotal side, our directors and other business contacts report solid economic growth throughout our District Retail sales have been robust during the first two weeks of the holiday season Manufacturing remains healthy Homebuilding has been strong Of the major sectors, I think the only moderately weak area has been nonresidential construction Estimated employment, reinforcing these other reports, actually increased in October after remaining flat for most of the year Our farm and energy sectors continue to improve Our grain sector reported excellent crops and is doing quite well at current prices We are again seeing some of that translate into purchases of equipment as farmers take some of their sales proceeds and reinvest them Our cattle industry is profitable on the feed side, although ranchers are still losing money In our energy sector, current prices have encouraged small but persistent increases in drilling activity Wholesale and consumer prices appear to be rising slowly but consistently throughout the District Our labor markets, as I have said before, continue to be tight, and we are hearing more reports of wage pressures  On the national level, I do not have a lot to add to what I have heard from Mike Prell today We are in general agreement with his forecast I would note, and again raise some concerns about, the fact that both we and the Board staff are projecting rising core inflation, even allowing for the technical adjustments The higher inflation would be even more apparent without these technical adjustments That concludes my comments  Mr Chairman, given that I also agree that the risks are on the up side, I support your recommendation "
5889,1997-02-04,HOENIG," Mike or Ted, I have a question on your oil price comments I don't  disagree with your projection of a decline in oil prices But I am hearing more from individuals  in the energy industry that, given their current outlook for world oil demand and the limited  ability of producers to accommodate that demand, they are increasingly of a mind that these  prices will stay higher longer As you judge this and from what you hear, do you have any  inclination to move away from your baseline projection toward a higher price scenario?  Okay Thank you  Thank you, Mr Chairman The economy in our District continues to  do well Our directors and other contacts report solid growth throughout the District  Manufacturing remains quite healthy Construction activity, while off slightly due to weather  conditions, is keeping pace with activity of a year ago I might mention that  who is involved with indicated that they had a very strong year  covers much of the western part of the United States, and what is happening to them provides a  pretty good idea of developments in the area's economy more generally I would like to share  some of that In terms of monthly year-over-year data, had  increased more than 6 percent for the sixth consecutive month in December Shipments of the  leading commodity groups were all posting increases, with energy products up 11 percent--a lot  of that being coal hauled out of Wyoming Intermodal shipments were up 8 percent; finished  automobiles were up 4 percent despite some lingering effects of the auto strike, and automotive  parts were up 11 percent This activity continued through January, and while results were under  budget last month they would have been on budget except for the weather conditions in the  western part of the system So, with this very good start for 1997, they  are looking for a very good year again  Reinforcing this generally favorable information from our District and from  particularly, we also saw some pretty sharp increases in District employment  for both October and November And on the basis of some of the anecdotal information we are    2/4-5/97  getting, such increases seem to be continuing in December In our region's energy sector,  drilling activity is up significantly over a year ago because of the effects of the cold weather on  oil prices Retail prices, I must continue to report, are not showing any sizable increases, but  wage pressures continue to be reported in our labor markets and these are becoming more  prevalent  On the national level, while I may differ on the components, I am in broad agreement  with the outlook presented by the staff here today In particular, I expect real GDP to grow at or  slightly above its long-run potential this year and on into next With GDP growth coming in  faster than expected in the fourth quarter of last year, I think the economy is further beyond its  long-run production capacity than we thought in December  I want to make one specific observation on the topic of inflation Coming back to my  question earlier to Ted Truman, I have some concern that the energy price increases that we saw  last year may not be as transitory as we may have thought Energy prices may come down but  perhaps not as much we had originally thought, given some of the conversations we have had  with contacts in the energy industry I also am concerned that the moderation in compensation  costs, particularly in the benefits areas, may be reversed as we go further into this year Looking  ahead then and given the current stance of policy, I would expect the economy to continue to  grow above trend, perhaps only slightly so, and inflation to creep up systematically as we look  forward to the next 12 to 18 months  At the risk of proving your point here, [laughter] let me just say that I  agree with you on the alternatives With regard to the issue raised in our earlier discussion, I too  am a little nervous about picking an inflation number and target path That's not because I  wouldn't like to see lower inflation happen, but I see problems I noticed in this morning's  discussion that we had at least two interpretations of the monetary aggregate ranges within this  group And if we went outside of this room, the number of meanings would be multiplied by  however much We would have the same problem with inflation targets In other words, when  an event occurs, does it mean the same thing to me as it does to you? I think we could begin  talking about some of the wrong things in an environment reminiscent of the debate about how  many angels can dance on the head of a pin I want to be very careful about that because I sense  that right now we are migrating from the CPI to the PCE We have not really discussed that  issue but we appear to be migrating there So, a 2 percent inflation rate may mean something  different now as we migrate That is why I am cautious about picking numbers For me, the  inflation number is zero whatever the measure, and then it matters what affects us in moving  either toward or away from that number, whatever the measure I think that is what we have to  keep in front of us  I think so  Mr Chairman, I understand your argument I have to confess,  though, that I have some concerns about waiting The market is now aware that we experienced  very strong economic growth last year and that we are seeing some of the effects of that growth  in terms of capacity use and so forth As we go down the road, I do not think that the public will  be able to distinguish between a growth rate that is slowing from 2 percent to nothing versus  slowing from 3 percent plus down to 2 percent or a bit less So, if we do not move now, I think  people will be even more convinced that we will not take action under circumstances of slowing  growth We may therefore find ourselves more paralyzed at the next meeting, and that could  cause us some problems that will be very difficult to deal with  I understand  But I think that perception exists In any event, we now see at least a  reasonable consensus that higher inflation is in prospect, and that is what we should act on If we  do not move when we have that sort of consensus, I think we will find ourselves in a more  difficult position in terms of taking action down the road  Okay "
5913,1997-03-25,HOENIG," Thank you, Mr Chairman The Tenth District economy continues  to grow at a robust pace As reported by our directors and other business contacts, growth is  strong across the board in all District states and in just about all industries Our  manufacturing survey suggests that firms continue to project strong production activity as  they look forward For example, one of the high-tech firms, Sun Microsystems, announced  plans to build a one million square foot plant in Denver and to add between three and four  thousand employees Reinforcing some of this anecdotal evidence, we know that District  employment growth in the last year has been somewhat higher than that for the nation as a  whole We know that bank credit has been growing in our region; it has been down more  recently, but that is seasonal The farm economy and the energy economy in the District are  both in good shape for now One crop, winter wheat, never has been in better shape in most  people's memory, so there should be an excellent harvest this year, assuming the weather  cooperates In the drilling area, activity is very high, higher than a year ago, and even though  both oil and gas prices have slipped somewhat, our producers remain profitable Retail  prices generally are holding steady, but wage pressures are continuing to rise Most of our  directors and other contacts describe our labor market as tight, and this includes both our  smaller manufacturers and some of the larger firms, such as Boeing and Eastman Kodak, that  have operations in the District  Nationally, I think the best way for me to describe our outlook is to say that we are  basically in agreement with the direction of the Greenbook forecast, though we do not see as    3/25/97  much strength in some of the components But in terms of where we see real growth,  nominal growth, employment levels, and inflation, we are fundamentally in agreement I  will not comment more specifically other than to note our concerns about the inflation  outlook as presented in the Greenbook and in our own projections  Mr Chairman, I support your recommendation on the federal  funds rate Though I might prefer asymmetry, given your comments I would also support  symmetry "
5935,1997-05-20,HOENIG," Peter, in your statement, you said that you thought there were  more adjustments to come in the dollar/yen I don't know if that had to do with portfolio  adjustments Can you elaborate on that just a little?  Thank you, Mr Chairman The economy in the Kansas City  District remains strong, but as others around this table have mentioned with regard to their    5/20/97  regional economies, growth in our District has slowed a bit from the-rapid pace of late 1996  and early 1997 Manufacturing and services remain the primary engines of growth in our  seven states Manufacturers are operating at high levels of capacity, and growth in  service-related jobs is quite brisk Manufacturing activity has been slowed somewhat  because of strikes The six-week strike at the GM plant in Oklahoma City has idled about  3,500 workers The strike issue centers on GM's earlier decision to cut about 900 temporary  workers from its workforce and, as reported to me, that has resulted in a union complaint that  the cut is too large The union wants GM to hire some permanent workers, several hundred  in fact There also is a steel strike in Kansas City that is affecting about 1,000 employees  The issues there are outsourcing and pension benefits; they do not currently involve wages  Data for the District states suggest that our employment has been about flat since March,  indicating some easing in the region's pace of growth  Our farm economy and energy sectors are in good shape The District's winter  wheat crop is in good condition despite freeze damage in some local areas Soybean prices  have risen, and this is going to be beneficial to producers in our area Solid cattle prices are  giving the cattle industry its best profits in a couple of years In the energy sector, the recent  drop in oil and gas prices has not yet affected production Drilling activity is much higher  than it was a year ago In fact, there are some reports of capacity constraints in areas like  Wyoming where reported shortages of trained crews are hampering activity  Retail prices continue to hold steady in our District The labor markets are tight  and we continue to hear reports of wage pressures An informal survey of firms in our region  conducted by our Branch directors indicates tight labor markets in nearly all cities in the  District Labor shortages are pronounced for entry-level workers, as you have heard from    5/20/97  others here, and also for computer and other high-tech professionals Several firms are  reporting bigger wage hikes than normal, although the number of such firms is about the  same as a month ago or so So, we are not seeing an acceleration  On the national economy, we anticipate as does the staff forecast that the  expansion in economic activity will moderate in the second quarter after unusually rapid  growth in the first However, our estimates do not have the expansion slowing as  dramatically in the immediate future as does the Greenbook Consumer and business  confidence remains high and income and employment growth appears solid and able to  support substantial growth going forward Despite this and the fact that resource utilization  has continued high, inflation has been surprisingly well-behaved Thus, while I remain  concerned and alert regarding the inflation outlook, it is difficult to assess its near-term  course with any great certainty  Returning for a moment to District developments, like Jerry Jordan I have done  quite a bit of traveling, and what I found particularly interesting in my meetings with labor,  consumer, and business groups is a uniform view that the Fed should ease off in terms of  contemplating any preemptive move I found that an amazing change because when I went  out before, I heard many people saying that we were doing a good job, that we needed to be  vigilant, and that we needed to be ready to act I no longer hear that One group, a rural  group, said that ""you guys need to chill out,"" to use their phrase What I am saying is that  while we can build a case for a move, the fact that we have not seen the anticipated rise in  inflation come through is leaving a very large number of people less patient with any kind of  action It is a noticeable change from 6 or 8 months ago, and I wanted to report that today  Thank you    5/20/97  Mr Chairman, like some others around the table, I would like to  move steadily and persistently toward price stability as measured somehow This will  require some further tightening and I think the economy could absorb that tightening rather  well However, it is also very apparent to me--I commented on this earlier--that this will  require a further debate, perhaps within this Committee but certainly with the public We  will have to make a greater effort to educate the public before they will accept the need for  some further tightening of policy For that reason, I would accept and support your  recommendation and encourage us to make a very conscientious effort to improve our public  educational activities "
5956,1997-07-01,HOENIG," Thank you, Mr Chairman Economic activity remains strong in the  Kansas City District, with only a few signs of slowing Our directors and other business contacts  report solid economic growth throughout the District Retail sales have been robust and  manufacturing remains quite healthy Two strikes that I mentioned at our last meeting have  ended satisfactorily, with some 4,200 or so workers back to work Conditions have continued to  improve in the District's farm and energy sectors The District's wheat harvest is under way and    7/1-2/97  expectations are that we will have the largest crop since 1994 Also, cattle prices have improved  and ranchers are now making modest profits In the energy sector, drilling activity registered  another small gain in May despite some decline in oil and gas prices Tempering some of the  positive economic news for our District, construction activity has tended to level off and total  employment fell slightly in April even after adjustment for strikes  Retail prices are holding steady in the Kansas City District, but labor markets are tight  and we continue to hear reports of wage pressures Many firms continue to have difficulty filling  entry-level positions and hiring skilled workers Our quote of the month is from one of our  directors in Southern Oklahoma who reported that labor markets were so tight in his town that  everyone was working who wanted to and some were working who did not want to [Laughter]  Several branch directors and other respondents that we survey informally reported above normal  wage increases in their markets, especially at the entry level For example, the owner of one of  our large retail chains reported that entry-level wages have increased somewhere in the  neighborhood of 10 percent plus over the last year However, this rate of increase is spotty; we  do not see wages pressing up at those rates uniformly across the District  On the national front, despite the more moderate pace of growth in the second quarter,  the economy appears to be fundamentally strong We would agree with much of what was said  in the Greenbook We expect real GDP growth to pick up somewhat in the second half of the  year and then likely move toward trend in 1998 Consumer spending should grow at a relatively  strong pace Contributing factors are solid employment, high levels of consumer confidence, and  substantial gains in the stock market Spending on business equipment should also remain  strong, rising in response to corporate profits and elevated stock prices While there is a great    7/1-2/97  deal of uncertainty about the inflation outlook, and we share that uncertainty, our projections for  economic activity and those in the Greenbook certainly suggest that the inflation risks remain on  the upside We continue to be sensitive to those risks in our analysis of the economy With that  I will stop, Mr Chairman  Thank you, Mr Chairman I have a couple of comments First, I  agree that this is a good paper and the right time to be talking about this issue It is an issue that  has to be put in the context, as you mentioned, of the more important goal of sustainable growth  When we put it in that context, it becomes a very important discussion item From that  perspective, what has been brought to the table is the realization that, regardless of the price  measure we may have in mind, we are not at price stability That is something we should keep in  front of us, continue to talk about, and introduce to the public at some point so as to broaden its  education on this issue With that in mind, I think we should take the paper and this discussion  to the next step, namely what it might mean from a policy standpoint and how we might proceed  With regard to your point about looking further ahead, ten years or whatever, to  anticipate what will be happening in the economy, I agree that conditions then will be  substantially different However, I am not convinced that prospective changes over that period  will be substantially more pronounced than those we have gone through over the past 10 or 15  years How we deal with the changes ahead is part of this discussion of how we measure prices  and define price stability We are constantly refining our thinking on that, and I think that is  what we will have to continue to do going forward In that regard, having this analysis and  working definition of price stability is very helpful and can assist us in our discussions as we  work toward making progress in achieving our price stability objective  Mr Chairman, I also agree with your suggestion and would prefer to  stay with alternative I I want to comment, though, on a point that Jerry Jordan made As I read  the Bluebook this time, I found myself facing a choice If I concluded that I wanted to use these  aggregates as indicators of our projections, then I would choose one alternative If I decided to    7/1-2/97  use them as targets with an assumed velocity, I would choose another If we do get to the point  where we are starting to put weight on these aggregates, I think we will need a careful discussion  of how we want to use them Otherwise, we are going to have split votes as we tend to do on  issues such as the interpretation of alternative I versus alternative II  I would like to see clearer language We might want to negotiate  whether this is it, but I think we definitely could use clearer language  Mr Chairman, I can accept your proposal today with no difficulty  However, I do want to make a couple of comments I will preface them by observing that I  understand the complexity of the issue that was raised in our discussion over the last couple of  days and illustrated by the models in the Bluebook But I also must confess that I am a person of  the price stability faith With that in mind, I think it is interesting that as output has  strengthened, inflation has declined Though there are difficulties involved in explaining that, as  you have pointed out, Mr Chairman, it is a fact that we have seen an improvement in output  even as inflation has fallen from modest levels to more modest levels We need to keep that in  mind I also believe, however, that we are not yet at price stability So I have to wonder if some  small increase in the federal funds rate might not be wise I see the desirability of some  tightening not just as an insurance policy against increasing inflation but as a further step toward  price stability where the tradeoffs between recession and inflation are less dangerous in my  opinion We may have an opportunity here, if not now then at some time in the near future, to    7/1-2/97  move toward price stability if we do it carefully In my view, that is one of the objectives in  addition to preventing higher inflation that we should consider as we contemplate policy in the  future "
5982,1997-08-19,HOENIG," Thank you, Mr Chairman As far as our District goes, not a great deal  has changed since our last meeting, so I will summarize developments and highlight a couple of    8/19/97  them for you Generally, we have a robust economy that is growing modestly; we have strong  production and increased sales overseas Our manufacturing sector is operating at high levels of  capacity, including the airline industry with Boeing and the auto industry with GM and Ford The  energy companies are continuing to expand in the District and are experiencing some production  backups because of supply constraints Bank lending picked up in July, with banking contacts  reporting a fair amount of activity With regard to the agricultural sector, you may have read about  our excellent wheat crop Kansas will have a record harvest of just under 500 million bushels, and  that comes after a spring forecast of a decline in production There is some pressure on the corn  crop and current estimates are coming in a little lower than earlier forecasts How that will turn out  remains to be seen  One of the topics about which we have talked a lot at these meetings is the cost of  worker benefits We had interesting conversations with an executive of They  are estimating that premiums probably will increase by 3 to 8 percent in 1998, partly because  capacity is being wrung out of the system and demand continues to increase  We are seeing some indications of moderating growth in our District Our employment  growth has fallen over the last two months for which we have data, the last one being June We do  not know if that slowing is partly due to the fact that we have such low unemployment rates to  begin with The rate is 2 percent in Nebraska and around 4 percent in some areas that are  experiencing our worst unemployment Also, manufacturers are saying that while their production  is still expanding, the growth is moderating Some of them are rethinking their projections and are  forecasting more modest growth going forward In construction, we have seen some moderation in  our region, especially in housing The latter is concentrated in the mountain areas around Denver  and Albuquerque, and it may be in part the result of a slowdown in in-migration However, the    8/19/97  moderation in those areas is being offset to some extent by pickups in the eastern parts of the  District Overall, District business activity is good, but there are some mixed signals and slowing  in some areas  On the national front, our projections of GDP and inflation are similar to the projections  presented here by the staff We do not have any real disagreements We currently see the economy  expanding at a pace a bit over potential, with only slight increases in inflation I will end with that,  Mr Chairman  Agree "
6005,1997-09-30,HOENIG," Thank you, Mr Chairman The Tenth District economy continues  strong Our manufacturing sector is still operating at very high levels of capacity District retailers  are again experiencing good sales after a slowdown this summer The energy sector is strong The  District farm economy is in uniformly good condition; that includes both our grain and cattle  industries The construction sector has shown some slowing over the last several months but from  elevated levels to more moderate levels of activity We have seen some slowing in our labor  markets, but that may be due largely to the fact that we had very low unemployment to begin with,  anywhere from 2 percent to 4 percent across the District In the circumstances, our labor markets  remain quite tight and we are continuing to see some evidence of wage pressures across the board  That includes entry-level workers, technicians, engineers, and so forth Wages for entry-level jobs  are now reported as starting at about $10 per hour in the Denver area, and entry-level wages are  rising elsewhere in the District Mike Prell and others have mentioned that medical costs are  expected to increase, and we too are seeing evidence of that In fact, who is an  executive with said that they expect premium increases of 4 to 6 percent or  higher and that half of the health plans in Colorado are now losing money So, they are going to  push to recover their rising costs    9/30/97  On the inflation front we have not seen widespread increases in prices, but there are  indications of higher prices in some sectors such as the transportation industry Some of our major  railroads have pushed through price increases Their customers have complained, but since the  trucking industry is doing the same thing, competition is not forcing the railroads to back off  On the national level, I would be skeptical about pushing the concept that we are  experiencing a new paradigm I do think, though, that business cycles do not repeat themselves  exactly as we have seen in the past A host of special factors seem to be affecting various parts of  the economy, but fundamental economic forces may well come back to bear on the course of this  cycle I am alerted to that possibility when I look at the level of resource utilization throughout the  economy, and that makes me skeptical of the explanation that we have a new paradigm that will  last I do not mean to ignore some other developments, which I will keep in mind when Don Kohn  presents his alternatives to us a little later These include a real fed funds rate that remains high in  an historical context, core CPI inflation that has been trending lower, pipeline inflation that is  essentially absent right now, inflation expectations that continue to be stable for now, inflation  indicators that are pointing downward, a dollar that is higher at this point, and long-term rates that  are lower than they were somewhat earlier That is the other side of the coin that everyone is  talking about and debating, and we have to keep it in mind as we raise concerns about the level of  resource utilization and its implications for inflation Thank you  Mr Chairman, without putting odds on what we need to do at the next  meeting, I think I understand where you are coming from, and I can support your recommendation "
6028,1997-11-12,HOENIG," Mike, I had a question in reading the Greenbook As you look out  beyond this year, you are forecasting a slowing in GDP growth, and even though you have  reduced the rate of increase in inflation, the inflation trend is still positive As the Greenbook  explains the surrounding circumstances, it seems that the primary reason for the continuing  inflation is the projected decrease in productivity, which raises costs Are the inflation numbers  being driven by labor costs?  Even with the GDP numbers coming down markedly?    11/12/97 30  Mr Chairman, the Tenth District economy continues to perform very  well I am going to focus my comments on anecdotal information partly because that  information, though not different from the statistical evidence, is in some sense at a higher pitch  as suggested by various stories coming out of our District First of all, manufacturing continues  to do very well, but there is a very persistent commentary that firms are continuing to do  everything they can to substitute capital for labor The reason is labor shortages, especially in  the low-paying, repetitive-type jobs  Members of our advisory groups corroborate our information that loan growth is  moving up One of our advisory panel members, a CEO, received a call from a major banking  firm that asked whether they should put the firm down for a $50 million or a $100 million line of    11/12/97 44  credit next year The bank did this without knowing what the firm's plans and loan demands  might be This story illustrates a very strong desire by banks in our area to increase their loans to  business borrowers On the other side, there are credit card fish stories that are scarcely  believable I heard one involving, for me, a new high in indebtedness by an individual In a  credit check for a new loan application, one of the banks in our region found that the individual  had debts on several credit cards totaling $180,000 The individual was using advances on new  cards to keep them all current Whether that person was trying to support a business endeavor or  just consumer purchases was a question in the bank's mind, but they did not consider the  application long enough to get into that kind of detail!  With regard to bottlenecks, the Greenbook mentioned some delays in rail  transportation and we are finding evidence of that in our region One firm in Tulsa leased some  trucks to go to Memphis to pick up some of its raw materials because the railroad bottlenecks  were keeping the firm from getting its supplies on a timely basis  On the salary issue, we are seeing continued escalation in the high-tech areas One of  our states was losing their programmers because of an average 25 percent increase in  programmer wages in their job market With regard to worker benefits, we are hearing from  organizations like PCI in Colorado that they are decreasing the waiting period for their workers  to get into 401(k) programs Other employers are increasing their use of stock grants to entice  people to stay or to come on board with them On medical insurance costs, we are hearing from  Kaiser Permanente and Blue Cross/Blue Shield of cost increases of 5 to 10 percent on renewals  and 9 to 12 percent on PPOs for next year Finally, though on the other side, we had some  meetings with a couple of labor representatives and, for example, the one from the International    11/12/97 45  Brotherhood of Boilermakers was talking about wage increases totaling 2-1/2 to 3-1/2 percent  However, the contracts were for 5 to 7 years, and the wage portion was not renewable though the  benefits portion was One of our major companies also indicated that they had now signed a  five-year contract That says something about future inflation expectations  Briefly on the national level, the only comment I would make is that we have a very  strong economy and very strong demand for labor I do not think the Southeast Asian crisis will  necessarily have a contagious effect on our economy So, we have very strong growth, but in  terms of its potential for inflation, I continue to be struck by a number of offsetting factors how  well balanced the economy is at present, a core rate of inflation that continues to decline, the  continued absence of pipeline inflation, persisting expectations of stable inflation, and from the  standpoint of monetary policy a historically high real fed funds rate So, the dilemma on the  national front continues to puzzle me Thank you  Mr Chairman, I agree with your policy conclusion I would point  out, though, that I do not agree with you because of the Southeast Asian uncertainty I agree  simply because, although I am very concerned about the momentum in the economy, I do not  think that we can offer an explanation for raising interest rates today that would be acceptable to  the public, given the price data and the analysis behind those data So, I agree with you on  policy "
6053,1997-12-16,HOENIG," Thank you, Mr Chairman The economy in the Kansas City District  continues to do well Reports from our directors and other contacts suggest a healthy business    12/16/97 43  environment throughout the region Manufacturing activity remains strong, especially in our  durable goods sector Our manufacturing employment has grown about 16 percent over the past  year, and that is quite a bit higher than the national average Our most recent survey of  manufacturers found that production, shipments, and new orders are all increasing at least  moderately District exports of manufactured goods to Asia represented less than 3 percent of  our total shipments in 1996, so we don't think there will be a strong direct effect on District  manufacturing from developments in that part of the world Retailers reported higher sales last  month and expect a very robust holiday season across the District Our regional farm economy  continues to do well  As strong as this District report is, there are some signs of slowing Construction  activity has been flat, as are indicators of future construction activity Housing permits grew at a  rate of only 2 percent in October, down from a 13 percent rate the month before The value of  total construction contracts fell 6 percent in October, resuming a downward trend from earlier in  the year District energy activity has edged down somewhat for three consecutive months  Actually, the rig count in our District is now only about 1 percent higher than it was a year ago  Business loan activity is only modest throughout the District  Labor markets, though, remain tight in most of the District, and reports of wage  pressures have become more common in the last couple of months However, there is still no  evidence that these pressures are showing through to prices The District's unemployment rate  remains a full percentage point below the national average Almost all the firms we have  contacted are reporting labor shortages, and a substantial majority say they are raising wages and  benefits in an effort to attract and retain workers The labor shortages are especially severe for    12/16/97 44  some skilled positions As one rather frustrated Kansas City employer said, he now feels very  much like the owner of a sports team in his efforts to set salaries for data processing workers He  is being told to negotiate with the workers' agents, and he is only half joking about that But, as  I said, the higher wages are not enabling firms to raise prices  On the national front, like others, I expect to see strong economic growth for this  quarter followed by a slowing toward trend over the next year This slowing is caused in part by  the restraint on some economic activities in the United States stemming from the Asian financial  crisis However, domestic economic fundamentals remain quite healthy, and I think they will  keep the economy growing at a pace around trend through next year At this point, I expect  inflation to remain modest over the next year or two despite the tight labor markets, partly  because the appreciation of the dollar will keep import prices down for a while I think the  downward revisions in the utilization rate of manufacturing capacity also suggest less price  pressure than we might have thought previously Inflation continues to be low and stable, and  inflation expectations remain subdued and are declining at the moment Low inflation and  inflation expectations in fact may help damp future wage demands as we face these tight labor  markets  Finally, although I recognize the upside risks and I believe they are real for both the  growth forecast and the price environment, I do not see any evidence, at least not any  overwhelming evidence, that action is required at this time Thank you  Thank you, Mr Chairman I would support your recommendation on  the ""B"" alternative, and I certainly would not disagree with you on symmetry I will tell you that  I, like others, remain concerned about the tight labor markets and the possible effects they may  have on inflation, but I do not conclude that monetary policy has necessarily been overly  accommodative I say that partly because, as has been noted, the real fed funds rate has been  above its long-run average I know that average should not be equated to the real long-term  equilibrium rate, but still it has been relatively high I would also mention that while M2 growth  has been above the upper bound of the Committee's range, it has not been substantially above  that range and it is projected to moderate As I mentioned earlier, the utilization of  manufacturing capacity is near its long-term average after the latest revisions Perhaps most  importantly, as you also noted, inflation has been quite stable Core inflation has been stable or  declining, pipeline inflation is basically nonexistent, and various measures of short-term and    12/16/97 79  long-term inflation expectations are stable or declining Long-term rates have fallen in this  environment So, I do not think that right now we are in a position to change monetary policy  Thank you "
6078,1998-02-03,HOENIG," Thank you, Mr Chairman The Tenth District economy  continues to do well on balance Manufacturing continues to operate at relatively high  levels of capacity utilization and is a source of strength for the District as a whole  Significant investments are still being made in our region Examples include the recent  announcement by Intel of a billion dollar upgrade to its New Mexico plant and the  expansion by Sumitomo of its New Mexico plant that manufactures computer chips  Construction activity generally has been flat in the District, but flat at a very high level  We still find firms in the construction industry that are trying to import labor into the  region The farm economy is generally in good shape, although developments in Asia  remain a concern for some in agriculture as well as in other sectors of the regional    2/3-4/98  economy For example, IBP, which is a large processor of beef and pork, has seen a 50  percent drop in its international sales, with Asia especially contributing to that Also,  Japanese customers are negotiating very hard for better deals to circumvent the effects of  the stronger dollar Some firms we have talked to, as I think Bob McTeer mentioned was  happening in his District, are having a little trouble because a number of their Asian  customers cannot obtain letters of credit, and that has hurt the exports of those firms to  that part of the world  Still, District labor markets remain among the tightest in the nation, and the  number of firms reporting larger-than-usual wage increases is rising To illustrate this in  terms of our current labor market situation, District unemployment was about 3-1/2 percent  in November and the participation rate was estimated at around 70 percent, in contrast to  the national level of about 67 percent About half the firms that we spoke to are raising  wages more than usual to attract and retain workers As an example, one manufacturer in  Colorado reported average wage increases of about 8 percent last year A furniture  warehouse in the Omaha area reported 10 percent increases at the lower end of their pay  scale and, as I mentioned, IBP for all of its concerns about Asia reported that they had to  increase wages over 15 percent last year because labor markets were extremely tight for  them Firms also are reporting a variety of incentives to retain workers, including the  expansion of benefits for their employees Overall, therefore, we have a very strong  economy in the region  At the national level, we expect growth into next year at a pace very similar to the  Greenbook forecast Having said that, we have also found ourselves spending a lot of  time trying to make sure we could rationalize our forecast We looked at the same factors    2/3-4/98  that others already have mentioned, including the outlook for inventory adjustments, the  strong dollar, a fed funds rate that in our opinion is not accommodative at this time, and  other factors bearing on a forecast of some slowing in final demand But when we try to  feel comfortable with that forecast, we remind ourselves of the very strong economy in  the fourth quarter and apparently into the early weeks of this year If the markets do not  become unsettled, I think there is every reason to expect consumer demand to stay strong  And unless we have a somewhat more negative multiplier effect from Asia, we are left  with some real upside risks to this forecast On balance, this seems to be a time to wait  and see Thank you  I am going to sound very similar I prefer alternative III in order  to bring the ranges into a consistent formulation, but given the uncertainties surrounding  the M2 and M3 forecasts, I can very easily accept alternative I as well  Don, I may not be asking this correctly but from reading the  Bluebook and listening to you, I had the impression that if we allow the unemployment  rate to fall below the NAIRU after a positive supply shock, analysis suggests that inflation  will re-emerge Intuitively, there is the differing view that if we have a meaningful  supply shock and it persists, we can in fact let the unemployment rate come down to  below the NAIRU and not have inflation spike up That seems to be part of the issue  today Could you give me a little more explanation in terms of whether you are letting  the model drive this result or whether there are other considerations?  It's a part of the struggle we have been having over the last year  Thank you  Mr Chairman, I support your recommendation I think it is  interesting that we are in a period when we are benefiting from a productivity supply  shock and wondering if it is wearing off, and at the same time we are waiting for a  demand shock from Asia and wondering how hard it is going to hit the economy I think  that describes our situation and it tells us to ""wait and see"" and that symmetry is right "
6105,1998-03-31,HOENIG," Thank you, Mr Chairman The economy in the Tenth Federal  Reserve District remains quite healthy It appears to be growing at a faster rate than the nation  so far this year For example, we estimate that total employment rose at an annual rate of 7  percent in the first two months of 1998, quite a bit faster than the increase for the nation Some  of the surge in employment was due to the warm weather, which had a favorable effect on  construction activity in our region, but other sectors also added jobs across the District Labor  markets remain quite tight, with some continued evidence of wage pressures coming through  As in the last several months, about half the firms we have contacted said that they were  responding to labor shortages by raising wages more than normal  District firms report that they continue to operate at very high levels of capacity  Manufacturing remains strong The farm economy continues to do well, although there are some  signs of weakness related to developments in Asia For example, contracts in the food industry  show reduced exports to Asia this year District energy activity also has slowed in response to    3/31/98  the sharply lower oil prices The District rig count has fallen about 20 percent since the  beginning of the year Retail sales have been quite healthy in the District, partly due to good  weather, but again the gains have been broadly based across the District  Despite the concerns about credit quality nationwide, lending standards in the District  as they are reported to us do not appear to have deteriorated a great deal At the same time, we  are beginning to hear anecdotal stories of some speculative activities I will share just a couple  with you In one of the resort areas in Colorado--not Vail or Aspen but one of the more  modest resort areas--condominiums were offered for sale prior to construction The prices that  were considered minimum in the bid process could not cover the required cash flow even if the  condominiums were rented every day of the year Yet, people were standing in line to buy one  unit at a minimum and they were often going for two Another example relates to the recent  experience of a small investment firm with a good reputation that offered shares in a new fund  They were trying to raise about one- half billion dollars for investment purposes They started  the new fund in January, and when I asked them recently how they were doing, they indicated  that so far they had been offered about $1-1/2 billion to invest One of their examples of investor  interest was that although they did not want to take more than $20 million from any one investor,  a couple of them insisted on their taking at least $60 million So, some of the anecdotal reports  that we are getting suggest a degree of optimism and speculation that we have not seen for some  time in our region  More generally, our forecasts relating to the broad domestic economy are not unlike  others We see a very strong economy and one that we expect will remain strong The  contributing factors are the obvious ones low interest rates, high consumer confidence, strong  incomes and employment, and, of course, the stock market We do expect some moderation in    3/31/98  growth due to weakness in net exports and to inventory corrections that might occur However,  we think that the risks to the expansion are on the upside in the context of improvements in  productivity that may continue on a more permanent than expected basis as a result of persisting  high rates of investment and further improvements in technology But we also recognize that  inflation has been held down by some temporary factors How temporary is, of course, the  question These factors are the prices of food, oil, and imports As these favorable price trends  unwind, I think we're going to see some fairly substantial pressures toward increased inflation,  given our forecast of an economy that remains very strong on the domestic front Thank you  Mr Chairman, I can accept your recommendation as you presented it  There is information that suggests we can wait the relatively high real federal funds rate, fairly  low and trendless inflation right now, and bond markets that are signaling benign inflation  expectations But there is also an issue of timing I believe we should move fairly soon, if not at  this meeting, because of the information on the economy Our labor markets are obviously tight,  aggregate demand growth remains quite robust, monetary growth is accelerating even though  there is uncertainty about velocity, and finally, there are increasingly frequent reports of large  amounts of global liquidity seeking investment outlets and accelerating the inflation of assets  These developments do give me some pause and some concern So, yes, I can wait, but I have a  sense of some pressure to act on a relatively prompt basis  Mr Chairman, could I comment on whether we should make such an  announcement? In earlier discussions, I have expressed some sympathy with what President  Parry was talking about regarding announcements because I believe more information is of  value However, like others, I think that if we release a statement on this occasion, we will have  set a precedent and we will have to continue making statements going forward I do think that  requires a fair amount of discussion of what the impact will be and how we want to manage that  For that reason, I would also encourage you to prepare the markets in a sense through a very  carefully drawn up speech that outlines the issues that we face and gives the market more  information than would a short statement after each meeting "
6131,1998-05-19,HOENIG," Peter, I have read your memo on our securities lending program Just  for my benefit, perhaps, is there some compelling reason for the Federal Reserve to be lending on a  daily basis? Is there fear of a market failure? I know we have increased our lending in certain  crises, but I am a little unclear as to why we should expand our daily lending of securities as you  propose It is not clear to me what sort of market inadequacies we as a central bank should be  trying to remedy Is there a problem in the securities market that is impeding smooth trading  activity whose resolution would be facilitated by this expanded program? I would appreciate your  clarifying that for me  Does it require that you go in on a daily basis to provide this  ""marginal"" help, if that is the right word?  I can see utilizing this for a situation involving a Drexel or some kind  of strain, but being there constantly on a daily basis seems more than necessary That is my  reaction to it I am not an expert, obviously  Right  Okay  I take it that you feel more comfortable going to a price constraint  rather than depending on the current quantity limits  Your words were subtle Is the Treasury comfortable with this?  I have just one final question, Mike If I understood what you said  about the stock market, you described it as a possible source of excess demand in the economy that  would cause us to be concerned Is that what you are saying?  Mr Chairman, the Kansas City District economy continues to grow  at a solid pace, without a lot of change since our March meeting Manufacturing remains quite  healthy Our survey of manufacturing for April found moderate increases in production, shipments,  and new orders Retail sales remain robust Real estate sales and construction activity still look  strong Over the past year, we have seen median increases in housing prices ranging from 8  percent in Denver and Kansas City to as high as 15 percent in our smaller Omaha market There  has been more REIT activity in the District's housing markets District energy activity continues to  slow despite some firming in oil prices  Our farm economy remains stable, but there are some signs of weakness District  wheat production is down in terms of acreage, but the quality of the crop is excellent So, perhaps  there will be some pressure on wheat prices The beef and pork industries are under some pressure,  but overall those industries appear to be stable for now    5/19/98  District labor markets remain tight, and there is continued evidence of wage pressures  Even so, there is still very little or only modest pressure on output prices  Turning to the national economy, like others we have raised our projections to reflect  the very strong first quarter That does turn our attention to the issue of inflation In that regard,  some of our discussions have focused on the issues that we've been talking about around this table  First, with regard to pressures on resources, I am convinced that the tight labor markets across the  country suggest that wages and labor compensation more generally are going to increase more  rapidly That outlook concerns me especially if the productivity growth numbers decelerate as has  been reported most recently On the other hand, capacity utilization is below its historical average  Secondly, we are watching carefully the temporary factors affecting inflation,  although what we mean by temporary may be changing, especially as we look at food and energy  prices that are still basically stable though no longer falling In energy, nonoil import prices  continue to benefit our economy If these benefits run out, we may well see rising inflation But  whether and when they are going to run out is the question  Finally, like others here I am concerned about the financial side of the economy I am  concerned about the high levels of money growth It remains to be seen if the projections of slower  monetary growth are going to materialize I see that as a very important factor for us to consider  because I think the rapid growth of money is carrying over into the financial sector where money is  looking for places to be deployed for a high rate of return that people have come to expect  Mr Chairman, I concur with your recommendation and would like to  make a couple of comments I am very mindful of the Asian situation, though I would not use  international considerations as a primary motivation for not changing our policy I think the  stability of the US economy needs to be our foremost consideration I come out this way because,  as I look at the US economy, I see a variety of factors influencing the outlook that do not paint a  clear picture They do not provide an easily defined rationale for moving now Moreover, I don't  find the argument that we should tighten policy at this stage for insurance or preemptive reasons a  very acceptable rationale either We need some hard data to justify a policy move In particular, I  think we need to watch the productivity numbers If those point to a clear policy course, we should  act On that basis I would be willing to wait and see "
6156,1998-06-30,HOENIG," Let me ask, Jerry, was the nature of your question to ask how far they  have left to fall?  Jerry, to return to your two descriptions of internal deflation or  external devaluation, my observation of what is happening in Japan is that they have experienced  an enormous amount of deflation that has not been recognized; they have put it off I am  referring to the portfolios of their banks, which are exerting enormous pressure As these  unsupportable liabilities to cash flows are being valued down and eventually recognized, I think  we are seeing the effects in the form of both internal deflation and external devaluation I think  they have a distance to go Their public estimates of the losses are now anywhere from $250  billion to $500 billion That is a lot to work through The fiscal issue is how much of the losses  they are going to bail out through government spending I think they have a long way to go  It has the highest unemployment level  Thank you, Mr Chairman Since we had a very fine report on the  Tenth District earlier, I will keep my comments relatively brief [Laughter] I will say, though,  that the District economy remains strong Our directors and business contacts report signs of this  strength everywhere Consumer spending is brisk, manufacturing is solid, and housing sales and  starts are robust Labor markets generally remain tight across the District    6/30-7/1/98  There have been some significant developments in the ag markets recently, and I  thought I would touch on that for a few minutes Overall, the agricultural situation is weakening  as farm prices continue to sag The District's important wheat harvest is well under way and a  large crop is expected, although about 10 percent smaller than the bumper crop that we had last  year In addition, recently planted spring crops are well established and are enjoying excellent  growing conditions Damping the farm outlook, however, are low farm prices Wheat, soybean,  and pork prices are running more than 25 percent below levels of a year ago Corn prices are  down about 12 percent Part of the problem stems from the drop in demand from Asia Wheat  exports to Asia have been especially weak, contributing to the low hog and cattle prices and  widespread losses in the first half of this year The weakness also results from prospects for  large supplies of both crops and livestock this year If weather patterns are normal this summer,  crop inventories will build for the second straight year If these low prices persist as the futures  markets currently suggest, we expect that farm income in the nation will fall about 5 percent In  our District where livestock is more important, farm income could drop as much as 10 percent  In real terms, farm incomes are sliding to near the lowest levels in this decade  Lower farm incomes will, I believe, lead to some rise in farm loan problems this year  However, most banks had strong portfolios coming into the year and should be able to absorb  likely increases in delinquencies Moreover, rising farmland values and strong cash rents  continue to indicate that many farmers still have strong balance sheets On a more positive note,  of course, the weak farm prices will moderate any upward pressures on food prices  On the national front, I think private domestic demand is fundamentally strong Even  though domestic demand growth may slow over the forecast horizon, I believe that it will remain  at or even above the long-run trend The first-quarter revision suggests that the economy carried    6/30-7/1/98  over more momentum than previously estimated, and so far the second-quarter consumption data  support that view Even though the expansion should slow this year due to the expected  inventory correction and the worsening of the trade deficit, I think the slowing will not keep real  GDP from growing above the long-run trend I recognize that inventories and the decline in net  exports are a significant risk to the expansion  Recent developments on the inflation front have caused me to revise upward my  inflation expectations for the year The increase in core inflation we have seen so far this year is  larger month-over-month than I had anticipated I also expect inflation to increase further next  year, perhaps as past favorable inflation factors unwind While I remain reluctant to draw strong  implications for inflation from the labor markets, I don't think we can ignore the upward  movement in wage gains arising from very tight labor markets In addition, we are seeing a  divergence between growth in domestic demand and growth in GDP To the extent an  accommodative monetary policy may be generating the strong domestic demand, I think we  should worry a little about inflationary consequences  Finally, the continued strong growth in the monetary aggregates, M2 and M3, suggests  to me that monetary conditions have become more accommodative Having said this, I am  aware that favorable offsetting factors continue to exert moderating influences Pipeline  pressures are small; capacity utilization has been declining; and the dollar, of course, is and has  been appreciating In addition, the historically high real federal funds rate appears to be  consistent with a slower expansion  I weigh all this and balance it out as follows The expansion recently has shown signs  of slowing to a more moderate pace, but I expect it to continue growing above its long-run trend  for at least the foreseeable future Also, as temporary favorable factors unwind, I think inflation    6/30-7/1/98  is likely to pick up later this year I see evidence accumulating to suggest that monetary policy  has become more accommodative As a result, there is a risk that inflation will rise more than  what I would be comfortable with However, I recognize that the data relating to the extent of  this risk remain mixed, and I also am aware of the unfolding events in Asia So, I look forward  to our policy discussion tomorrow  Much has already been said, but I want very briefly to reiterate some  of President Jordan's comments If I understood correctly, this model's parameters were  developed in a period when we had declining inflation I believe it is very important, though,  that we look at it in the context of zero inflation and a stable economic situation and then  evaluate the effects of shocks I believe that would be very important A broader discussion or  conference on this issue probably would bring out that kind of analysis  I am open to suggestions  Mr Chairman, I, too, believe in the price stability approach for setting  the long-run ranges In my view, there continues to be a long-term relationship between money  growth and inflation, and I think we will be returning to the use of money aggregates in the not  very distant future Therefore, I would support either alternative I or alternative III  Thank you, Mr Chairman I agree with your proposal I am willing  to wait and see if the growth in domestic demand slows and I am mindful of the international  situation, but I have a couple of comments I believe domestic demand is stronger than is  consistent with long-term price stability We have to be very much aware of that My other  comment is that I do not want Japan's paralysis to become our paralysis in terms of what is the  right thing to do I am very mindful of that Yes, we should wait, but I don't think we  necessarily should wait until everything is perfectly clear Thank you  Mr Chairman, as I looked at this issue and went back and read some  of its history, it seemed clear to me that the whole idea of the tilt as it was designed in an earlier  period was to allow compromise and build consensus It is an internal mechanism for  decisionmaking I think the way we announce actions now is the correct way, and releasing the  tilt will not add to transparency because the directive language relating to the tilt is  incomprehensible If transparency is our goal and we want to have the context of our thinking  in our release of information to the public, then I believe Governor Gramlich has a very good  point We should then focus on putting the minutes together because they incorporate the full  context of our decision, and we could release them earlier But I think trying to come up with a  statement at the end of this meeting to be released to the public at 215 pm and to frame it in the  context of the discussion at this meeting is an almost impossible task for anyone So, I would  focus on getting the minutes in good shape as soon as possible if we want to release them early,  and that would be the way to enhance transparency I do not think immediate release of the tilt  as currently drafted, or probably could be drafted, will do anything but confuse "
6182,1998-08-18,HOENIG," I move that we start the meeting  Peter, I think you just answered this question, but given the confusion  in the market, I will ask it again When you made your earlier comments, you indicated that the  market has suddenly begun to think about deflation though it is uncertain about that prospect  How is that reflecting itself in the market? In other words, how is this new attention to deflation  manifesting itself in the market's actions?    8/18/98  Better than mine!  Thank you, Mr Chairman The Tenth District economy continues to  do relatively well Year-over-year employment growth as of June was better than 2 percent,  slightly below the national average Consumers are still buying at a fairly brisk pace  Manufacturing for the most part remains strong, although in some areas, especially in Colorado,  our contacts have seen some effects from the fallout of the Asian crisis Construction remains  high for the District as a whole; we are experiencing a modest slowdown but from extremely high  levels Our agricultural sector is an area of weakness Like the Seventh District, we are    8/18/98  experiencing very large grain harvests and large supplies of meat, both beef and pork That is  having a depressing effect on farm prices and farm income Labor markets remain very tight in  the District We are receiving more reports of wage pressures going forward  Perhaps the most interesting change that is occurring, though very preliminarily, is in  the area of psychology We hear more negative talk even though we are enjoying a very strong  economy People talk about the good times, but they are more concerned about whether the latter  can continue Some of that concern relates to the outlook for energy I think it is important for us  to try to keep tabs on such attitudes as we go forward  Turning to the nation, I think our District largely reflects national economic trends Our  projections point to strong domestic demand that is being offset to an important extent by the  external sector We also do not rule out some possible retarding effects from the stock market  correction We continue to have supply shocks that are having favorable effects on prices As I  add all that up, I see a fairly tame projection for inflation going forward I cannot help but  wonder, given Peter Fisher's earlier comments on the markets' efforts to assess the outlook for  inflation and the risks of deflation, whether we are not seeing some of this negative psychology  and uncertainty spreading a little more widely I think that bears watching as we go forward  I support your recommendation for alternative B Frankly, I have  mixed emotions about the symmetry issue If I were asked, I would probably retain the  asymmetry at this point, given the strong domestic demand, but I am very comfortable with  symmetry as well "
6205,1998-09-21,HOENIG," Mr Chairman, this is Tom Hoenig Let me begin by saying that I  support what you are suggesting today I do have an observation and a question The observation  is that the economy in our part of the country, and the domestic economy more generally as others  have said, remains relatively strong In fact, it is unusual to be thinking about easing when we  have an unemployment rate of about 4-1/2 percent We have an unusual set of circumstances My  question relates to the liquidity issue Maybe you or Bill McDonough could comment on some of  your observations and discussions in the international arena that are of particular concern to us I  would be very interested in getting your impressions  Thank you very much I will say that that is consistent with some of the  conversations we have had out here While we still see a lot of activity in financial markets, there  is a great deal of concern about liquidity and increased caution in those markets To return to your  question, Mr Chairman, I can support what you are suggesting here today  I appreciate that Thank you very much "
6223,1998-09-29,HOENIG," Mr Chairman, after reading the memo and participating in several  discussions of this question, my inclination is to go with Option 1 With regard to that option,  the simpler and more straightforward the language, the better Indeed, I would simplify the    9/29/98  language even further For the symmetric alternative, I would say something like ""in view of the  currently available evidence, the Committee believes that developments are equally likely to  warrant a decrease or an increase in the federal funds rate"" If the decision were for a tilt, I  would have the sentence say ""in view of the currently available evidence, the Committee  believes that developments are more likely to warrant a decrease/increase than an increase/  decrease in the federal funds rate"" I think that wording is understandable and straightforward  I also would like to see the minutes released even sooner than is contemplated in this  memo if that is physically possible That's because, as I said the last time we discussed this  matter, the minutes provide context for the Committee's decision If we are going to be more  transparent, sooner is better than later in that regard I know there are physical limitations  involved in the production of the minutes  In sum, my preference would be to put simpler language in the directive, release it  promptly, and then publish the minutes as soon as we can to give context to our decision  We need an interpreter to figure out what all that means That is true  even for us, let alone the public  Yes, I would be in favor of releasing it promptly after each meeting  with the simpler, clearer language  Ted, I have a question on Europe Some of the discussions that I have  heard in terms of whether Europe should lower its interest rates are that as they move toward  convergence, their interest rates are coming down in effect Do you agree with that?  Thank you  Mr Chairman, if you were to ask how the Tenth District is doing  today, you would get two answers If you looked at any metropolitan area, you would see that its  economy is still very strong, with tight labor markets and unemployment rates that are extremely  low When you looked at retail sales, you would find that they remain very strong If you  looked at housing, you would find it strong overall You also would hear a lot about changes in  attitudes in the sense that while business conditions are strong, people are much less confident    9/29/98  about the future We are seeing some of the effects of Asia in our manufacturing sector, in  health products for example, and we have anecdotal indications that at least some firms are  backing off on plans to invest in plant and equipment as they look to the future But, currently,  the metropolitan area economies are still in very good shape in our District  In the rural areas and in the energy sector, we get a completely different answer  Contacts in the energy industry, as you already heard for some other Districts, are very  pessimistic about the outlook for oil Natural gas, which is more predominant in our region, is a  question mark; its prospects depend on how the winter goes Contacts in the agricultural sector  are very pessimistic I know you have heard some of the statistics, but I would note that we  normally export about 40 percent of our agricultural products to Asia So demand is down  Nationwide, but I would say that percentage is not too far off the  mark for the Tenth District as well We are having some bumper crops this year, 20 percent  increases in some areas That is on top of earlier increases So, prices obviously are down Our  banks are saying that their loan portfolios currently are in satisfactory condition, but they  anticipate loan problems going forward They already are contacting us and others about what  the attitudes of examiners are going to be with regard to carrying over loans and so forth So,  there is a fair degree of bearishness in that sector of the economy and concern especially among  banks in the rural areas However, we need to put that in the context of the District as a whole,  which still appears to be generally sound  On the national economy, I think the most likely outcome next year is for real GDP  growth to slow to below trend and for inflation to remain moderate I am concerned about  further downside risks to the domestic economy Therefore, I believe a slight easing of policy    9/29/98  would be appropriate at this time But I, like Ed Boehne, would be cautious and deliberate in  adjusting policy at this time I don't think we would be behind the curve after a small move  I want to add a couple of points relating to policy First, while I see growth moving  down toward or below the economy's long-term potential, I am not as pessimistic as the  Greenbook at this time I think that is why I also am cautious about how deliberate we are in  adjusting policy Second, I believe there are significant downside risks to the outlook, as I  mentioned These stem from the fact that there are significant slowdowns in the economies of  Latin America and Canada that could cause our own economy to grow more slowly We need to  keep that in mind In that context, inflation should remain moderate in the near term, and a  number of factors should help to keep it in line for the foreseeable future I would not, however,  recommend a more significant easing I am mindful of the fact that our record in forecasting  growth slowdowns has not been overly accurate in recent years, and therefore I think we should  be cautious As others have mentioned, M2 is growing strongly So, I think a deliberate ease in  policy would benefit the economy, and I would go cautiously forward with it Thank you, Mr  Chairman  Mr Chairman, I also support a 25 basis point reduction As to the tilt,  I would much prefer no tilt for a couple of reasons Number one, I don't think the facts today  warrant it Number two, I think you are correct in your observation that events will drive what    9/29/98  we do next, and changing circumstances may well require a discussion at a telephone conference  before a decision is made "
6247,1998-10-15,HOENIG," Bill, this is Tom Hoenig Just a clarification on the spreads I realize  they have widened and I understand that the junk bond side of the market has dried up The  spreads on investment grade corporates have increased, but it seems to me that has not occurred  so much because corporate rates have risen as a result of perceived unusual risks Rather, the  reason is that the flight into Treasuries has lowered rates on Treasuries, thus causing the spreads  to widen Is there a perception of unusual risks in the investment grade corporate obligations? I  know there is such a perception with regard to junk bond securities  Thank you  Mr Chairman, this is Tom Hoenig We had a board meeting and I have  done some traveling throughout the District recently I don't have much that is different to add to  our discussion, maybe just something on the edges Basically, people in this region are aware of  the turmoil in the financial markets, and there is a sense of concern about what it might imply for  the future I did get a sense and specific comments to the effect that, as things have settled down  and the fundamentals have remained reasonably good in the District, people were more  concerned in August and early September than they are today Things have not fallen apart on  them thus far, and they tend to the view that that does not necessarily have to happen  The outlook for regional investments is a mixed bag, and it does not provide a lot of help  for the analysis of national trends Our contacts in the energy sector and in some areas of  manufacturing are saying that they are pulling back on their investment plans If the cash flows  on the energy side remain weak or weaken further this quarter, they indicate that there will be  some additional pullback There are a couple of areas of strength, though One is heavy  construction--road construction and so forth--where there is a tremendous backlog because of  large fiscal expenditures on highways and other public projects In some of the service  industries, it is full speed ahead even with the current uncertainties  I want to share one anecdote It involves a major firm that is constructing an office  building, partly for its own use They were working with a major investment banking firm to  arrange the financing, and they had secured a pricing that was 100 basis points over some    10/15/98  base rate Because of this financial turmoil the investment bankers came back and said the  interest cost would be 300 basis points above the base rate In the meantime the base rate went  down 100 basis points, so the net interest cost was up by 200 basis points But that still worked  out to a rate of 7-1/2 percent and the rate on their old mortgage was 8-1/2 percent So they decided to  go ahead full speed on that project We have these widening spreads, but the question is what  kind of impact they are having on the real economy I would not draw a conclusion necessarily  from that anecdote other than to give it to you  As far as consumers go, a lot of consumer lending is still going on, and our area lenders  are very much involved with equity lending at an equity to debt ratio of up to 130 percent  In sum, there is concern about the future in our region, and we sense a great deal of the  uncertainty that others here have talked about However, the fundamentals remain reasonably  good The outlook is prospectively somewhat mixed in our region, but still generally favorable  on balance  Mr Chairman, this is Tom Hoenig I would not object to the 25 basis  point reduction in the fed funds rate I am uneasy about making this move this soon after our late  September action I don't think there has been enough change since the September meeting to  warrant the rate cut, but I certainly understand that it is in some ways an insurance action and I  would not object  If I may express an opinion on the discount rate, I would much prefer a 1/4 point reduction  so that it comes in the same as the reduction in the funds rate That combination does not sound    10/15/98  quite as alarmist as one involving a larger discount rate With reference to the earlier period that  you mentioned, Don, I think those actions might have been justified during a more difficult  period for the economy In any event, the discount rate is someone else's call to make "
6271,1998-11-17,HOENIG," Mr Chairman, after listening to this discussion, I would mention first  that I think the solution that you and Al Broaddus proposed of placing ""intermeeting period"" at    11/17/98  the end of that sentence strikes me as a good suggestion I would then take out the sentence we  have been talking about I agree with Governor Kelley that it is confusing It confused me and I  think it will confuse others The authority is clear in the previous statement without that  additional sentence, especially if we put in a reference to ""intermeeting period""  I agree with that  Mr Chairman, I have just two comments The first is on the issue  that is on the table right now I understand where Peter is coming from, but I would feel more  comfortable if the TIPS market were deeper; with time it may become deeper, and in that event  we would have less impact on it I recognize that Peter has had discussions with Treasury  officials and that this may be worked out, but I certainly would feel more comfortable if we  waited  On the second point, I would like to come back to Governor Rivlin's inquiry about the  discount window This is not the time, but I know that some work has been done on how the  discount window could be put to better use Some papers were written and some options were  explored but not followed up I think there were some good suggestions in those papers that  could make the discount window an instrument that the market might be more comfortable using    11/17/98  and in the process help us smooth or reduce some of that volatility in the market I would  encourage us to revisit this matter  Thank you, Mr Chairman Let me say a few things about the Tenth  District The regional economy is still growing moderately There are some signs of slowing in  the data and in some of the anecdotal reports from business contacts, but the degree to which  growth is slowing is not at all apparent Employment growth continues to be steady in our  District, although it is slightly behind the national economy Manufacturing activity, as others  have reported for their regions, is slowing in our District as well Our factory survey in October  was flat On the other hand, retail sales are generally good across the District, and some of our  retailers have indicated that they are anticipating a very strong holiday shopping season The  construction sector remains generally strong Some builders are reporting an easing of activity  but one of our largest construction firms, which is active in both the Midwest and the Pacific  Northwest, indicates that some of this has been due to the REIT activity that others have talked  about; the firm feels that reaction probably has been very healthy in terms of stanching some of  the excess that they thought was building in their markets Energy activity remains weak,  obviously due to the low oil and gas prices and the uncertainty there Our agricultural sector has  tended to stabilize a little; although prices are still low, they have stabilized and crop production  has been good There has been a recent infusion of funds by the Congress, but my contacts in  both ag and the ag banking sector assure me that next year certainly will be a disaster Despite  signs of slowing, the District labor markets are still very tight More than half of our Beigebook  and business contacts are talking about raising wages more than what they consider normal  Still, we have not seen the effect on prices in the District at all    11/17/98  On the national front, our outlook and the Greenbook are quite different in terms of  the projections for the next five to six quarters, with the Greenbook showing a much sharper  deceleration in growth than we are projecting Beginning with slower growth in the fourth  quarter, the Greenbook has five quarters of below-trend growth whereas we have growth in line  with trend or slightly below As a result, we have a less favorable inflation outlook, although we  do not anticipate that inflation will be a substantial problem  We think the risks are more balanced than they were at the time of the last meeting  We believe that the financial markets are more stable and are pricing more realistically We  think domestic demand is remaining fairly stable, and it could actually be stronger depending on  the stock market and other factors because, as others have reported, consumer confidence is  relatively high On the downside, manufacturing could slow more than we're expecting,  especially given the international uncertainty But on balance, we think that it would be prudent,  given that there are only five weeks to the next meeting, to wait and watch in this intermeeting  period  Mr Chairman, for reasons that others have cited, my preference  would be to wait I think President Poole said it best, that we could be pouring gasoline on this  economy I have concerns that a bubble economy syndrome may be building I believe it was in  place before the more recent events, and I think it may again come into being as a factor You  mentioned the stock market, and that gives me real pause    11/17/98  However, like others, I am not going to dissent for several of the reasons that they  gave One, the point you made, is that I do not see inflation as an immediate threat Secondly, I  understand the international circumstances that we face; I'm not sure this easing move is going  to make a whole lot of difference to those circumstances, but we will see Thirdly, I might hold  others to their statement that if this easing does prove to be more than we need, we will be firm  in our resolve to move back if that is called for "
6294,1998-12-22,HOENIG," Mr Chairman, our District economy continues to chug along at a  pretty good pace We have some weak areas, and one of those, of course, is agriculture The  impact is not as dramatic as I mentioned last time because of the recent transfer payments to that  sector The concern is the longer term We don't know what the Freedom to Farm Bill will  mean or whether transfer payments will have to increase in the future if these price pressures  continue That is an issue in our part of the country  The other weak area is energy Obviously, the low price of oil is hurting our District  economy right now, although we, like others, are more diversified now Of course, mining,  especially the coal industry, is under a lot of pressure; capacity and price pressures are quite  damaging to that industry right now, I am told  Conditions in the manufacturing sector are more mixed in our region Activity in  some manufacturing industries is slowing as a result of competition with foreign, especially  Asian, products Our electronic components manufacturers are feeling some pressure On the  other hand, our auto industry is doing well as are some of our metals manufacturers that are  exporting They have worked very hard to increase their productivity and they probably are    12/22/98 41  going to have their best year ever in some instances So, we see mixed signals in the  manufacturing sector  Of course, housing is strong as are services, including retail Our banking industry is  quite active right now Our banks are competing very vigorously for loans and they are  competing on price They tell me their margins are certainly narrowing as a result We continue  to have tight labor markets There is some relief perhaps around the edges in some of the  manufacturing industries that have seen a slowdown But as a general principle, labor markets  are still very tight  As for the national outlook, I would describe our view as having come closer to the  notion that growth will slow toward trend because of two factors that are not completely  predictable I think we will have very strong domestic demand going forward We have the  continuing impact of recent rate cuts, and M2 growth is quite strong I think those portend a  stronger economy and some future upside risks for the economy Obviously, though, capacity  has increased in the economy and that will help restrain some of the price increases We also  have the external sector exerting deflationary pressures and we see many uncertainties with  situations like Brazil So balancing out those two effects, I would say that growth will come  back toward trend but that the upside risks are noticeable  I am speechless! But I'm going to say a couple of things anyway  First, I support your recommendation completely Without getting into bananas or agonizing, I  would caution us about how we look at the need for future policy actions Here I associate  myself a little with Bill Poole I think we need to look at the actions we take in terms of the  risks, especially the risks to the domestic economy, and the systematic forces that are in play that  lead to the upside risks our policy easings, the rapid monetary growth, strong domestic demand,  and robust income growth I think those factors do give us pronounced upside risks    12/22/98  On the other side, the downside risks, as Governor Rivlin said, are risks of shocks,  which are impossible to forecast I'd suggest that we consider not holding off too long on the  unwinding of our recent easing actions as we worry about the downside risks from shocks that  might occur but also might not occur So I want to be thinking about unwinding our earlier  actions unless some real shocks emerge  Mr Chairman, I like option 3 I agree with the language in the  middle sentence that includes both the coming months and the intermeeting period I would have  no problem with deleting the sentence on the money supply but I certainly would not get into an  argument if we left it in  Mr Chairman, it is a good suggestion and I am in favor of it I think  we should learn from it and then decide if we need to do anything differently sometime in the  future But I'm very comfortable with it now "
6318,1999-02-02,HOENIG," May I add to that question? You mentioned in your memo,   Peter, that at a time of market crisis it had proved helpful in the past to raise the lending   limits above those that were in place It would help me to understand this issue if you   explained that   Thank you, Mr Chairman The Kansas City District continues to   do well and its economy is basically sound Our weak areas continue to be agriculture   and energy, and there has been some slowdown in certain areas of our manufacturing   sector Of course, there is some concern on the manufacturing side about the Brazilian   situation, particularly if that were to spread to Mexico, on which we are much more   dependent Having said that, the economy otherwise is doing very well even in some of   the manufacturing sectors as well as in the housing sector and construction generally   Retail sales continued strong, even in January Overall, our major cities are still   booming   On the national front, I expect the economy’s growth to moderate toward trend   this year with low inflation, as others have said In other words, basically we see the   economy continuing to grow The issue we face continues to be very strong domestic   demand set against the backdrop of weak international demand, which is further   complicated by the possibility of adverse shocks That has not changed much in the last   several months Nevertheless, compared to last fall I believe that the risks to the outlook   are now far more balanced because of the earlier rate reductions taken to offset the global   financial turmoil As a result, as others here have indicated, I am becoming more focused   on the potential upside risk to inflation if we continue to maintain our current monetary   stance To me, a key issue for this Committee at this meeting or very soon is whether,   when, and how fast the policy actions of last fall should be unwound Thank you   Don, having looked at the analysis in the Bluebook and at the   various charts, including Chart 3, and having listened to your comments this morning, I   want to talk a little about something I mentioned yesterday That is the possibility of   wanting to unwind the actions we took earlier Last fall we were projecting growth in the   fourth quarter to be less than half the growth we apparently got, and we were expecting   even lower growth in the first quarter of this year We took actions to ease partly because   of those projections and the financial turmoil that was occurring We have moved into a   much more stable financial environment  You did mention the idea of perhaps   unwinding our easing moves I assume for the sake of discussion that one reason we are     2/2-3/99 96   not looking more favorably at unwinding at this juncture is the continuing concern and   uncertainty about external factors Is that why you touched on it but did not really   develop an alternative for unwinding our earlier actions?   That’s a good point   Mr Chairman, I am satisfied with your recommendation As I   mentioned yesterday, we have put some additional stimulus into the economy over the   last several months and I think there is a case to be made for some unwinding of that,   perhaps in the not-too-distant future Depending on unfolding developments, that might     2/2-3/99 117   be appropriate to mention in your Humphrey-Hawkins testimony, as you suggested So I   am fine with your recommendation  "
6346,1999-03-30,HOENIG," Mr Chairman, the economy in our District continues to   perform quite solidly Employment growth in February was a bit flat, but we think that   may have reflected an absence of supply of workers as much as anything Retail sales   and construction are both very strong in our metropolitan areas, and our surveys show a   very high level of consumer confidence Manufacturing activity, as in other areas, has   cooled off a little, and the number of manufacturing jobs in the District fell a bit in   February and is actually below year-ago levels That’s the first time we’ve seen that   since 1992 Energy activity declined in January and, of course, people on the producing   side have hopes--from their vantage point--for the oil price increases that they see   stemming from the OPEC discussions The District labor markets remain very tight,   even with the weakness I talked about in manufacturing, and we have seen in our surveys   a slight uptick in wage pressures District labor markets now have an unemployment rate   of about 33 percent, and that actually may understate the real decline slightly because we   have a very high participation rate, well above the national average   The other area of some weakness, obviously, is the agricultural sector That   sector continues to struggle with good supplies and a falloff in demand, especially from   Asia And we are hearing more and more discussion about whether a farm aid package   will be needed again in 1999 as in 1998 As for how that will go, we’ll have to wait and   see Even with the continuing troubles in agriculture, economic growth in our region is   strong, driven by the strength in the metropolitan areas and even in some of the rural   areas   On the national level, our forecast is fundamentally very similar to the   Greenbook’s The difficulty is that we have as much confidence in our forecast as Mike   Prell does in the Greenbook’s In any case, the projected strength in the economy leaves   us a bit uneasy I want to raise again, though it may be a little early in the meeting, the   issue of where we were last summer and the actions we have taken since then as an     3/30/99 22   insurance policy I think those easing actions were wise But as I look back over the   three years ending in 1998, we have had for much of that period a funds rate of about 5½   percent, steady growth, and declining inflation And I can’t help but continue to wonder   if we should not be unwinding some of our easing if the circumstances warrant With   that I will stop Thank you   Mr Chairman, understanding the difficulties of these   decisions, I would still recommend that we tighten and that we present the tightening as   an unwinding of the actions that we took in the midst of the crisis last fall Last summer   we were continuing to experience strong growth in economic activity and jobs We took   some easing actions because of the Asian crisis We introduced additional stimulus into   this economy, which is playing out now I think we could legitimately and forthrightly   explain a tightening move as an unwinding of those earlier actions; that would make it   more acceptable In the long term such an action would be healthy   Having said that, I would make the directive symmetric if the Committee   adopts a no-change policy, as it appears it might, because we probably will not act during   the intermeeting period and I don’t think we should suggest otherwise So my preference   is to unwind However, if we don’t, I would not have an asymmetric directive  "
6369,1999-05-18,HOENIG," Thank you, Mr Chairman The economy in the Kansas City   District remains quite strong Employment edged up again in March; retail sales remain   generally strong; and construction indicators are quite strong   The price of construction materials has increased significantly so far this year,   both in the region and more broadly As a side note, I will tell you that about 10,000   homes and businesses were destroyed or severely damaged by the recent tornadoes in   Oklahoma and Kansas While the short-term effect is obviously devastating, that does   imply some additional building boom coming our way That will be a factor in our   District More specifically, though, one of our directors who is in the construction   industry has seen sizable price increases on materials in that industry since the beginning   of the year Prices of rock, gravel, and aggregates are up 10 percent, lumber 6 percent,   concrete 4½ percent, and sheet rock, of course, is up about 50 percent   While manufacturing activity has been a little sluggish in the District up until   recently, it is picking up Some of our manufacturers are seeing an increase in demand   from Asia, and that includes China, despite some of the other developments in that   region Also, at least from our directors’ point of view, some of the recovery in   aluminum prices reflects increased demand in Asia Energy activity within the District     5/18/99 33   has steadied in the sense of not declining any longer; firms in that industry are waiting to   see to what extent these energy price increases will stick before making their own plans   for future activity   Wage pressures appear to be increasing in the District, at least somewhat Our   unemployment rate is about 34 percent and we have a very high participation rate, so we   have very strong pressure on our labor markets In fact, in the construction industry,   which is obviously under the most pressure, and in the crafts industries such as carpentry   and plumbing, contracts for wage increases of 5½ percent per year for the next three   years have recently been signed in our area   Retail prices have edged up, as someone else mentioned And I would echo   the point, based on talking with business people in our region, that there is a hint of a   different attitude toward price increases There is a sense of challenging the status quo   and seeing if perhaps price increases will stick this time, with more of an expectation that   they will Whether that will occur will only be known in time, I realize   The farm economy remains fundamentally weak Supplies are large and   export demand has not picked up that we can see Despite this, farm finances remain   strong, and there is a lot of anticipation about what will come out of Congress this year   on that issue Our land values have remained resilient despite these kinds of pressures,   although our last survey indicated about a 1 percent decline in land prices in the   aggregate   Turning to the national economy, I see another year of strong economic   activity While growth in GDP may moderate, I think it is going to moderate to a rate   well above its longer-term trend and remain significantly stronger than the FOMC central   tendency forecasts from our February Humphrey-Hawkins meeting I must say that I am   struck by the strength of the domestic economy Over the last four quarters private   domestic spending has grown about 6¼ percent and we are forecasting that it will grow   about 5 percent this year If one put trend productivity at a very optimistic 4 percent-­  higher than I think one might expect--and added on 1 percent for labor force growth, that   would result in potential output of, let’s say, 5 percent And private domestic spending at   least has been growing faster than that Offsetting this, of course, has been the weakness   in net exports; in a sense the deterioration from the external sector has been the relief     5/18/99 34   valve But I think some of the relief now is coming from domestic demand rather than   the weaker external or foreign demand That is something we have to keep in mind in   terms of the pressures on global resources going forward   In sum, what I am saying is that I see increasing upside risks to our forecast   Look at the Greenbook forecast, for example, which shows a $450 billion deficit in net   exports by the end of next year--though I know the staff may reduce that--and still good   growth in the 3½ percent range Should our domestic demand or foreign exports pick up,   we could have even stronger growth The point is that against this background I have   become, as I think Al Broaddus has, increasingly worried about the current stance of   policy and our ability to maintain low inflation going forward   Don, since you spent a fair amount of time on whether we   should go asymmetric or symmetric, my question has to do with the wording in the   directive that relates to the tilt The way the current wording reads, the tilt applies to “the   intermeeting period;” it does not say that we might act on the tilt at the next meeting or   the meeting after that How important is the fact that it is confined to the intermeeting   period and not longer term in influencing your thinking of whether we should put that   language in the directive?   Mr Chairman, I felt last time and I feel now that we could   appropriately identify an immediate move as an unwinding of our earlier effort to   stabilize financial markets--an effort at which we were successful I would prefer that   explanation At the same time, I would buy your recommendation today in terms of the   tilt I would be careful about what the announcement says with regard to the period to   which the tilt may apply, whether it is the intermeeting period or some longer period, but   I certainly would accept your tilt recommendation  "
6391,1999-06-29,HOENIG," Karen, on your chart 12 entitled “US Current Account to GDP   Ratio” what assumptions do you have for your baseline?  How did you get the baseline?   In the Bluebook, okay   Refresh my memory, what is the import elasticity used in the   baseline?   Thank you   Thank you, Mr Chairman The Kansas City District’s economy   remains quite solid, as I reported last time Retail sales are well above year-ago levels   Real estate sales and construction activity remain quite healthy Manufacturing activity   actually shows some further signs of improving, following an earlier period of weakness   Factory managers are reporting to us that capacity utilization is up considerably from   earlier months this year and nearly back to year-ago levels Energy activity has   continued to improve in June according to our producers in the region The farm   economy remains in a deep slump, and I would say that we are hearing increasing reports   from rural America that the farm downturn is beginning to hurt Main Street and that we   are going to see some repercussions on the banks   Having said that, the labor market in our District remains extremely tight The   District’s unemployment rate edged down to about 3½ percent this past month And   there is now some additional anecdotal evidence that persistently tight labor markets are   limiting growth in some District areas Just as one example, American West announced   it will move 180 jobs from the Kansas City area because it cannot find people to fill the   jobs there Now, where they are going to move them to isn’t all that clear, but certainly   they can’t fill the jobs in the Kansas City area   Turning to the national scene, I continue to expect the trend in economic activity   to moderate by the end of next year For now, though, I foresee another year of strong   economic activity, with real GDP growing on average about 4 percent this year and   slowing to an average of just above 3 percent next year   As for my views on the inflation outlook, I would note a couple of points Similar   to what Bob Parry just said, my stronger forecast represents yet another upward revision   in the outlook I notice in the consensus forecast that others share that view I continue   to be impressed by the momentum of the US economy as we make these adjustments,     6/29-30/99 34   and I also continue to be impressed by the fact that the inflation numbers are still coming   in at a modest level   Having said that, I still judge that the risks on the inflation outlook are on the   upside First of all, as I have said before, the funds rate is 75 basis points less than it was   a year ago when the economy was already expanding at a fairly good pace  Since then,   the financial turmoil that occurred last fall has largely subsided, risk spreads are in fact   lower, and growth is projected to remain strong So in that context, I think the stance of   monetary policy is accommodative When one looks at M2 growth, while it has slowed   most recently, it remains relatively strong--increasing by about 8 percent over year-ago   levels And as others have noted in a different context, there are some signs that inflation   expectations are rising The inflation premium embedded in the Treasury inflation-  protected securities has been rising since last fall So, while recognizing that inflation is   modest, I believe there is some upside inflationary risk in the context of this very strong   economy right now   Yes   Don, I am going to try to ask this question clearly In the   Bluebook and in your comments you touched on a couple of issues One was whether we     6/29-30/99 74   need to move 50 basis points over the course of this year and then how we might go   forward from there My question is If one were to assume for the moment that we will   need to move 50 basis points, what is the best way to go about that?  If we say 25 basis   points now, assuming we move at all, that would create uncertainties regardless of the tilt   of the directive we adopt A symmetric directive would give a false sense to the market   and to Main Street that we’re satisfied with that 25 basis points, and things would begin   artificially moving forward again If we say 25 basis points, asymmetric, that would raise   uncertainty as to how much and when the next move will be If we say 50 basis points,   symmetric--suggesting that is sufficient at least for now--would that create more   disruption because it’s larger than the market expects?  Or would that settle the market in   the sense of saying, “This is what we’re doing and it’s enough”?   Thank you   Mr Chairman, I support your recommendation I came into this   meeting wanting at least a discussion of a 50 basis point increase, and I got that, which I   appreciate very much It was very helpful  Along those lines and in listening to you, my   assessment has been shaded in terms of the issue--the issue being the degree and the   durability of productivity improvements that we’re all trying to decipher So, I would go   with the 25 basis points It is a move up, which I think is appropriate And it represents a   continuation of the gradualist approach on which we have built a pretty high degree of   credibility over time, and that has served us well   Given all that, I would very strongly support a symmetric directive for this   meeting I believe it represents the consensus of the FOMC and I don’t think we should   be anticipating the next move until one of two things happens--either we get new   information that addresses some of the earlier issues you raised, or we as a group have a   change in judgment If either occurs, then we can change the rate again in the   intermeeting period or at the next meeting I think that is the right approach in terms of   dealing with the market and the information we share  "
6414,1999-08-24,HOENIG," Peter, I have another question along those lines When you brought   this before the Committee the concept, as you’ve just suggested, was more or less as a   lender of last resort But the frequency of use over the period strikes me as being far more     8/24/99 8   than last resort; it seems to me to be part of an everyday facility Why the frequency of use   if it is a last resort facility?   We probably should expect at least as much usage going forward?   Mr Chairman, I understand the importance of Y2K concerns, but I   want to follow up a bit on what Jerry Jordan was saying I know that Peter Fisher and others   have scrubbed this proposal pretty carefully, but in terms of the analysis I’m not as clear as   I’d like to be And I am a true believer in the law of unintended consequences When you   want to do things and get them done for the right reasons, you think of all the positives But   without some fairly rigorous analysis, you tend not to think of the other side I worry, given   the speed with which we’re taking this forward, that we may not have thought of all the   negative consequences, and that leaves me uneasy   One other comment I would make is that necessarily--and I understand the reasons-­  there is a great deal of vagueness in this proposal; one uncertainty is even the strike price I     8/24/99 28   hope in structuring this that we keep in mind many of the conditions we have in the special   liquidity facility as we go to these individual dealers, because we are treading on new   ground as far as how we conduct monetary policy And even though the authorization is   temporary, it does have implications going forward that I haven’t had the opportunity to   think through I hope that as the details are worked out we will be briefed again on what is   being decided with regard to the strike price and the reservation price I know you have to   talk with the dealers, but it leaves me uneasy to think that they might be structuring this   program So, those are my concerns I know Y2K is important and I don’t diminish that,   but I do have these reservations that I wanted to raise   That does give me some solace   I understand   Very good   Thank you, Mr Chairman The economy in the Kansas City   District remains quite healthy It has slowed from the rather strong pace of last year but   remains overall a very strong economy Employment has improved modestly, although the   growth rates have slowed, but we suspect that is as much a supply issue as a demand issue   Construction activity remains brisk; it’s down a bit from the torrid pace of last year but is   still very strong, and we are continuing to see price pressures on resources in that industry     8/24/99 53   Manufacturing activity remains subdued compared with past very high levels, but through   our surveys we have picked up an obvious increase in demand for exports coming from   some of the improvements in Asia and South America Others have spoken of activity in   the energy sector In our District the rig count is up about 25 percent from last April, but it   is still about 25 percent below a year ago Nevertheless, there is some pickup in activity in   that sector   As for wages, there are wage pressures They are not accelerating sharply, but we are   now well aware of steady pressure on wages Our labor markets are extremely tight and our   unemployment levels are very low Our participation rate is very high and that is affecting   our labor markets I’ll share a bit of anecdotal information on both sides of this issue In   Colorado, contracted with 600 software engineers in India because the   firm could not find anyone in their own area to do the job In Kansas City, our major   construction companies have imported skilled workers generally and in particular have hired   bricklayers and others in the higher skilled professions from both Canada and Mexico to fill   a crying need In fact, we have found in talking with school districts throughout the region   that they are having a problem replacing math and science teachers who are being recruited   and hired away by private industry On the other side, we had an interesting discussion with   one of the major accounting firms, which has changed its accounting and operations systems   to bring automation into its work papers and analysis The firm is counting on productivity   improvements to the extent that it is actually budgeting for the improvements by budgeting   down the number of people it will bring on board That’s a fairly risky position on their part   but they really are looking for some productivity improvements because they are paying   very high premiums for professional help   I will talk just briefly about our farm economy I know that the Northeast and East   more generally are in a drought That is not the case in our area We are expecting a very   large harvest; for both corn and soybeans we think it will be a record The wheat crop, with   even less planting, was very strong I talked with one of the major co-ops last week and   they are actually bringing back on line elevators that they had abandoned earlier in order to   store the surplus they have Livestock producers are doing better; cattlemen are actually   making money and, of course, the hog industry is now making money On the financial   front, the farmers did come in with much stronger balance sheets this season Frankly, the     8/24/99 54   benefits from government payments and prospective increases in those payments are really   going to buoy their net income flows So, while we are seeing a deterioration in some farm   operations--and as a result of that, in some Main Street operations--we are not seeing major   problems surfacing in loan portfolios The nonperforming loans are increasing, but nowhere   near as sharply as they did the last time we went through this kind of situation   Turning to the national side, I will only add a bit to what others have said I would say   first of all that we are projecting continued economic growth, though not as strong as the   Greenbook projection Certainly, some of the favorable factors seem to be reversing, but we   do see strong domestic demand And if the global economy picks up as we believe it might,   we may have some strong pressures on the demand side in the economy that we have to be   mindful of as we go forward With that I’ll stop   Mr Chairman, I agree with your recommendation on the rate   increase, and I strongly support the symmetric directive I say that because if we do in fact   make the ¼ percentage point move, we can sit back and analyze its effects, analyze the data,   and then move again when a change is called for I don’t think we need to have an   asymmetric directive of any kind  "
6437,1999-10-05,HOENIG," Call it drought insurance   Thank you, Mr Chairman The Tenth District’s economy continues to   operate at a relatively high level of activity Our year-over-year employment growth was 13   percent, and that is from already high levels of labor participation and employment Retailers have   reported that sales are flat but at high levels, and they expect to continue to experience good levels   of activity Despite the slowing in employment growth in some areas, construction remains our   fastest growing sector in the District Energy activity in the District has turned around   significantly--60 percent above the level in March--although it is still slightly below year-ago   levels in terms of employment   In manufacturing, few jobs have been added but that is due in part to cutbacks by Boeing in   Missouri and Kansas Taking that into account, exports of manufactured goods out of the District   are estimated to be at pre-crisis levels So there has been a very strong recovery in that area   The District’s unemployment rate edged down to about 34 percent in August and we   continue to have tight labor markets We hear an increasing number of anecdotal reports of wage   pressures, especially in our metropolitan areas such as Denver and Kansas City Consumer prices   have shown very modest increases, although on the input side prices of some manufacturing and   construction materials have edged up or have increased significantly, depending on the particular   type of input one is speaking about   The farm economy, of course, is the area that remains weak But government payments are   keeping farm incomes and finances at good levels and recent legislation may put farm support   payments at or near the record levels that we saw in the 1980s Overall, though, the District is   doing very well     10/5/99 28   At the national level, I have no major disagreements with the Greenbook I understand and   recognize that forecasting is a risky business in and of itself I think it is important, then, to look at   the circumstances we face at this time Demand is very strong--some would suggest excessive-­  with GDP growth well above 3 percent when, in thinking about labor growth and productivity,   potential may be in the 3 percent range In many ways we are comfortable with that because   inflation remains modest and productivity gains continue But it is important to look at some of the   other factors that are in play The strong demand is being accommodated importantly by a trade   deficit and a current account deficit that are at record levels Personal saving rates are estimated to   be in the negative range, labor costs are rising, and labor demand remains very strong When we   talk to business people about wage pressures, they give some indication that they’re paying “above   normal” to retain workers But the definition of “normal” is moving higher So we’re continually   seeing an increase in the so-called normal rate that gives me some pause   When I look at the demand in the economy in terms of both the consumer and corporate   sectors, consumer debt is rising to record levels and corporate debt is increasing I think we have to   take that into account Margin credit is rising to record levels as well The question for us, of   course, is whether monetary policy is accommodating this debt increase We’ve had two recent   funds rate increases and that is worth noting But at the same time, the growth rates in the   monetary aggregates remain at or above our projected targets I think that has to be taken into   account as well as we look at all these other factors So, I believe our policy involves some   continued upside risk for inflation and we should be mindful of that as we enter the policy   discussion phase of the meeting   Thank you, Mr Chairman I listened to your arguments with great interest,   and they are very persuasive At the same time, my own view is still that we should move the   funds rate up ¼ point now While I believe productivity is truly increasing, as I said earlier, I think   there are other important imbalances in the economy that, if addressed now, will result in a better   economic performance in the long term We should take advantage of that opportunity now Also,   to the extent that the productivity increases are positive in terms of the second derivative and are     10/5/99 65   continuing, we can act now to address some of these other imbalances and not affect those strong   gains We should keep that in mind as we consider monetary policy today   On the issue of symmetry, I personally would like to leave the directive symmetric My   reason is that I don’t think there has been a major change in our attitude The last two times we   met, we increased rates We’re obviously alert to the possible need for more firming We’re aware   of it today Because we don’t take an action today doesn’t mean we’re not as concerned as we   have been, especially as the data come out However, if asymmetric is the way the Committee   wishes to go, I think we’re in the stew here in terms of announcing The law of unintended   consequences has manifest itself on this and we are somewhat bound to announce how we are   leaning, although I will tell you that our original announcement does not say that we’re necessarily   going to disclose our decision on symmetry But that’s not what many people read So I think   we’re compelled in a way and I would have to suggest that we disclose our decision if we go   asymmetric But I think we’d be wise not to go asymmetric   Mr Chairman, given President McDonough’s earlier comments and my   own sense of this, is it necessary to spend so much time on the labor markets in this press release?   Right But could we take out the labor market reference?   Well, if we’re going to do that, there are a lot of other things I’d like to list   I’m not convinced   I’m okay with the latest changes  "
6459,1999-11-16,HOENIG," Mr Chairman, the Tenth District also continues to do quite well; we   have not seen a lot of change since our last meeting On the basis of our surveys of District   activity, there has been some slowing in the residential housing market from the earlier rapid   pace and a bit of slowing in some areas of retail sales   In the manufacturing sector, the picture is somewhat mixed While domestic demand   has slowed some, there has been a pronounced pickup in foreign demand in some of our   manufacturing industries For example, a foundry and some of the metals manufacturers in our   District have seen a very strong pickup in foreign orders Our energy sector continues to expand   right now as they look at these favorable prices We are primarily natural gas driven and, of   course, weather has some impact But even with some of the current mild weather patterns, our   producers still see a good outlook as they judge their supplies   Mike Moskow mentioned the weakness in the agricultural sector We, too, have had   very strong production this year, so prices remain low and that sector is very much dependent   upon the continued strength in transfer payments One of the secondary elements in our     11/16/99 29   agricultural and rural areas is that, frankly, there has been strong demand for autos and especially   trucks as these transfer payments have been made So, actually, cash incomes remain fairly   good, and that has been reflected in a strong economy in some of those agricultural areas   Overall, though, economic activity in our District is extremely strong Labor markets are tight   everywhere We hear constant discussions about the difficulties that firms are experiencing in   their efforts to find workers to fill jobs   Let me turn very briefly to the national outlook We, too, see the growth in GDP to be   at better than a 3½ percent pace, and we also are taking into account some of the improvements   in productivity in that outlook Looking forward, we see the foreign sector picking up and   offsetting some of the deceleration on the domestic side So as we look at these various   elements, the preponderance of evidence suggests to us that the risk to the forecast is on the   upside in terms of total demand within the US economy   Personally, I still think there is a good case for acting now, though we haven’t quite   come to that discussion, whether one looks at it as preemptive or as a reversal of the insurance   policy we took out a year ago We took that insurance in the face of a very strong real economy   Its effects are still working in the economy and I think that factor is aggravating the upward risk   that I see Thank you   Mr Chairman, I think both your recommendations for a ¼ point   increase in the funds rate and a symmetric directive are prudent, and I support them   Mr Chairman, I’m inclined to echo what Governor Meyer just said in   terms of the impression we create in the market Rather than give you another iteration of that   concern, I’ll leave it that So, in terms of this statement, I’m in agreement with Governor Meyer   Thank you On the alternatives, I strongly prefer alternative I In my   view it’s more honest in the sense that we are balancing the risks If we weren’t, we could take   the action only at the time of the meeting So I think it is the better way of expressing how we   see the likelihood of developments in the future rather than implying that we have our finger on   the trigger So I strongly prefer alternative I   In terms of the proposed amendment to paragraph 2 of the Authorization, I welcome it   because the Chairman’s authority to initiate a policy action between meetings has been a source   of confusion in this Committee for as long as I’ve been a participant in these meetings This   defines and clarifies his authority and his responsibility for consulting with the Committee so we   won’t differ on what we think we’ve done in adopting symmetry or asymmetry I consider it a   clarification It puts some understandable parameters around the Chairman’s authority, which I   think is a good idea So I’m in favor of that   Larry, could you clarify your position?  Are you saying that this   paragraph should have stronger language?   All right  "
6484,1999-12-21,HOENIG," Thank you, Mr Chairman The underlying trends in the Tenth   District economy have not materially changed since our last meeting The economy remains   healthy, with manufacturing actually showing some continued rebound I am hearing more   comments throughout the District that higher interest rates have slowed some construction   sectors, especially residential building Growth in home sales in the District was about 3   percent third quarter over third quarter this year compared with about 10 percent last year   At the same time, we are hearing from several of our business contacts that increases in   public works construction such as roads--actually jails for the most part--are offsetting the   falloff in other construction   While private construction is slowing, manufacturing is continuing to show good   signs of strength Our Beigebook contacts reported high levels of capacity utilization last   month The recently released data on third-quarter manufacturing exports also showed   continued improvement in foreign demand for District factory goods Based on reports     12/21/99 20   throughout the District, holiday shopping centers are quite busy; seasonal sales are very   strong and many retailers are reporting the best season that they have had in five years   While the number of business contacts reporting labor shortages increased slightly last   month, it was probably not a significant increase  Moreover, most of the increase came in   the manufacturing sector, which has been expanding production in the last couple of   months The District’s unemployment rate is about 3¼ percent Except for New Mexico   and Wyoming, all District states have unemployment rates below 3¼ percent, and some are   much below that District contacts report that wage and price pressures remain subdued,   however; that is no different from what I have been hearing for some time and have reported   in past meetings   Our energy sector has actually strengthened with the increase in prices and there are   some signs now of wells being uncapped but very few new starts at this stage The farm   economy remains fundamentally weak, although there is some improvement in cattle prices   But for now that sector will continue to rely on transfer payments for its health   Turning to the national economy, my view of the outlook has not changed   fundamentally since the November FOMC meeting The economy obviously continues to   grow well, with few signs right now of rising inflation I expect economic growth to slow   over the forecast horizon based on our actions earlier this year And, frankly, I find it highly   unlikely that with an unchanged funds rate we would have growth in the 4 to 5 percent   range as suggested by the Greenbook My view of the Greenbook right now is that it   provides a reasonable description of the upside risks to the outlook rather than the most   likely outcome In my mind the risks are balanced We do have upward pressures; there’s   no question about it But there are some other factors, such as our last three funds rate   increases, that I think need to play out   I agree with most people that core inflation is likely to rise to about 2¼ percent or   maybe 2½ percent in the year 2000 and beyond However, at this point I am not convinced   that it will rise to a rate higher than 2½ percent in 2001 So in that sense, I think we do have   some time to look at how things develop in the near future Thank you   Don, just listening to you tells me how difficult it will be to craft   any kind of asymmetric announcement today Wouldn’t it seem practical to have this be   one of those announcements where we say as little as possible--something along the lines of   we met, we didn’t do anything, and we’ll see you next year?   I prefer the symmetric one, Mr Chairman After all we have   invested in Y2K preparations, with options and special liquidity programs, changing our   bias as we get to this point near the end does not seem to me to be the best thing to do To   my mind the symmetric language makes clear to the market that a smooth Y2K transition is   still our priority and that we will get through that period before we take up the issue of   tightening again So, I much prefer the symmetric directive   Governor Ferguson, I’ve listened to all of the arguments, and they   are all good arguments When I sort through them, I’m back with the original   recommendations of your Working Group We can fool with this language to the nth degree   and something is going to be wrong with it Your draft language talks about risks and I feel   more comfortable personally talking to the public about risks than I do talking about which   way we are going to move the next time we take a policy action   The issue of the Chairman’s authority to make intermeeting policy moves is a tough   one, Al, and I have some sympathy for your point of view But it is related to a   longstanding practice and this amendment to the Authorization does codify that practice To   my mind, in some ways it sets the boundaries more clearly If some future chair abuses the   authority, that is something the Committee will have to deal with But the way the   Authorization reads now gives me a sense of confidence that it would be used only in the   most dire circumstances, and I think the Chairman has to have some flexibility to act in a   crisis So, I can generally accept the Working Group’s recommendations  "
6507,2000-02-01,HOENIG,"  Mike and Dave, with respect to your simulations, let me ask   something that I think has been hinted at around the edges in two or three previous questions  In   the Greenbook prepared last time for our December meeting, you had an assumed increase of 75   basis points in the funds rate in the works  In this Greenbook you have an increase of 125 basis   points  If one looks at these simulations, the analysis suggests that we are behind the curve          44  unless scenario 1 occurs  So let me ask what you think the odds are of scenario 1 materializing    Everything else suggests that we are behind the curve    That’s interesting  Thank you    Thank you, Mr Chairman  The Tenth District economy has not   changed appreciably since our last meeting and on balance remains very healthy overall  Labor   markets do remain tight but wage pressures, though increasing, are not increasing dramatically   that we can tell  Our agricultural sector continues pretty much as it has been, with low prices and   high subsidies making the outlook for that sector appear fairly stable  One thing I might mention   about this expansion is that rural America really has shared in some of the good times  Job   growth in our region has been nearly as high as that for the nation on average and, of course, in   our scenic and recreational areas it has been substantially stronger  So, we’ve had good uniform   growth in jobs across the rural areas as well          65  Let me talk a little bit about the oil sector  Even with the sizable increases in oil   prices, the effects on levels of activities in our region have been relatively modest so far  In   talking with our director in that industry, he said that the industry right now is still budgeting in   their capital budgets at around $18 per barrel for oil  They feel that if OPEC can manage to do   so it will maintain the price at between $20 and $30--not wanting it to go over $30 because that   will spark interest among other oil producers  So that seems to be forestalling the price  They   are watching developments, in terms of adjusting their capital budgets around those numbers and   those price levels  Unless we see an accelerating price level, his judgment is that exploration   budgets won’t increase dramatically     Let me mention another local anecdote  The Kansas City Southern Railway runs a   railroad through Texas, Monterey, and all the way to Mexico City  I was visiting with the head   of that company last week and he told me that the volume of traffic on the railroad over the last   18 to 24 months has increased by a good 50 percent in both directions  He said it was striking   how much business capital investment was being made all along that railroad  He said that the   state of technology at the manufacturing plants was as good as it gets and that the quality of the   products coming from there was as good as it gets  Interestingly, though, he also noted that   shipments of finished goods, not just intermediate goods, are also expanding dramatically along   that route as people’s incomes and prospects improve  That may be a sign of more positive   things to come   Let me turn to the national economy  Basically, I’m convinced that the US economy   is experiencing the effects of excess demand and that, based on the evidence, pressures probably   are building  While my projections are not as strong as those of the Board staff, it’s a matter of   degree and not direction  I see a greater likelihood that this demand will increase and continue to          66  outpace supply, even though the signs on the supply side are good  In my view this does put   increasing pressure on prices  And the situation is complicated a bit further by what we refer to   as “imbalances” that are also persisting, with levels of debt rising and the current account deficit   increasing as well  All this to me suggests that there is perhaps room for us to think about   increasing rates modestly as a minimum response  I’ll stop there  Thank you     Mr Chairman, changing these ranges is always a dicey issue these   days because no matter what we say or what we do, there are more interpretations than there is   reality  At the same time, I could be talked into it because I think there is a building consensus   that the rising trend in productivity improvements is real  And if, in fact, we are willing to   accept that--and there may be some who are not--then moving the targets does make some sense   in terms of their consistency with price stability  And I do agree with what Jerry Jordan was   saying about how we might have reacted to productivity shocks in earlier periods, but I think   things are a little different now  On balance, I could come down in favor of raising the ranges     Mr Chairman, I support your proposal completely  I believe the   increased risk of inflation is there, so I think we ought to say it  Also, I am very much in favor of   25 basis points for several reasons  First, while the models show direction, I agree that they   don’t show it with precision, so I think we should proceed gradually  Secondly, we are in an   environment where core inflation has been very modest, and we need to recognize that as we   begin to pave the way for higher rates  And thirdly, some imbalances remain out there, which   we are trying to take into account, but we don’t want to shock the system either  So I think   continuing the steady path that we have been on is the appropriate approach  Therefore, I   support your recommendation  "
6532,2000-03-21,HOENIG,"  Mr Chairman, walking into this meeting, I had an uneasiness about   this issue similar to what you have just expressed  So I will make my comments a bit briefer  I              - 16 -     know we have an immediate problem  But, depending on what we assume going forward about   the Treasury’s plans and budget surpluses--and what happens in the immediate future regarding   the demand for Treasury securities--there is a question of the mechanics in terms of how the   Federal Open Market Committee will choose to implement its policy in the future  What you are   suggesting implies I think a broader study that is commissioned by the Federal Open Market   Committee regarding our ability to implement policy in the future  We are now being asked   about that frequently--what are the best available options and how do they affect the mechanics   of monetary policy  So, in addition to Peter and Don, I would suggest that two or three others--  either members of this Committee or Reserve Bank directors of research--take a look at this issue   at the broad level, especially if we are talking about putting off the completion of the study until   either late this year or next year  I think it would be very beneficial to us to have a broader   participation in a study that is commissioned by the full Committee    May I ask the question a little differently?  Let me ask Peter and Don   the question  Do we need to extend this temporary authority before the study is completed?  Is it   so important to the effective conduct of open market operations that waiting until the study is   done before we address this issue is critical?  That was my basic question in terms of the study    Mike, I’d like to explore Jerry's question a bit differently  As I read   the Greenbook and the comments you made today, three factors seem to me to be in play  How   we weigh those factors in a sense rationalizes whatever policy we pursue  One factor relates to              - 38 -     how we judge the position of real interest rates in the context of the budget surplus we talked   about earlier  Another is the productivity issue, which is more dominant and has a very   important role in how we think of the economy going forward and whether we are taking the   right action  The third factor is the output gap on which the model is based--and the cyclical   factors and the NAIRU that are influencing it  Would you discuss for a minute how you weight   these factors?  I’m wondering which one is dominating your thinking in this model because that   affects how you rationalize your position going forward          Mr Chairman, activity in the Tenth District, as in other Districts you   have heard from, continues to be very strong and is little changed from last time  On balance,   there has been less of an impact than we might have expected from the higher interest rates and   from the higher fuel costs  Labor markets remain quite tight and wage pressures exist, but to   date we have not seen any strong move upward in the wage settlements  Part of our slow labor   growth may reflect the fact that our unemployment rate is so low; many firms are having   difficulty finding labor for some of the available jobs  Higher interest rates, as I said, have not   really produced any slowdown  The housing market and retail sales continue very strong in the   District, and auto sales remain brisk despite the higher oil prices   In terms of price increases, competition remains very strong and we hear a lot of   discussion about the need to move prices up as costs increase  But the business people I have   talked with continue to say that they are unable to make price increases stick, and that that is a   problem for them  The farm economy remains in a slump  Farmers have received the subsidies   we’ve talked about  They are aware of that; but they are also aware that people are beginning to   question that  In some sense that makes them all the more concerned about next year  There's a   note of desperation in some of their voices as they talk about it  And now there is talk about   drought conditions, and that has only exacerbated their concern  I think we're hearing more, not   less, from some of the agricultural sectors in the District   Let me turn to the national scene and policy for a minute  My outlook remains   virtually the same as it was at the last FOMC meeting  In my view part of the strength we saw              - 63 -     late last year and so far this year reflects the fact that we were slow to unwind some of the rate   decreases we took in the fall of 1998  Still, looking forward, I see some modest slowing in the   economy, primarily due to an expected settling down of the stock market--perhaps--and the   limited supply of labor, the higher real interest rates, and some elevated prices  Having said that,   though, I do expect inflation to rise this year as a result of developments that are now in train,   including the unwinding of some of the past favorable factors and continued strong demand in   this economy  I think the rise in energy prices is having some effect on the psychology in the   marketplace  And if we do see higher inflation expectations begin to emerge, I think we will see   that built into wage and financial price expectations   I am not convinced, however, that we need to be tightening aggressively  I think the   gradual pace of tightening that we have followed is wise  In fact, because of the uncertainty   surrounding the projections, it would be of some concern to me if we began an aggressive   tightening program  An aggressive mode has its own set of risks that I think we ought to be   aware of  So, I remain oriented to a gradual course of policy action as we go forward  I think   history has shown that to be the prudent approach  Thank you    I agree with your recommendation, Mr Chairman  I do want to make   a comment  When you say “strategy,” given the level of uncertainty that we've talked about   here, I want to clarify that our strategy is not necessarily that we are on a course to continually   increase the funds rate  I favor a strategy that says we know there are upside risks and are   prepared to move, but one that does not assure people that we're going to move in the future    Depending on how that is viewed, I think there can be quite a difference in terms of the message   that we would be delivering  It wasn't clear to me what conclusion in fact we may be coming to   here    Right                - 87 -      Right  With this move we will have moved 125 basis points since last   June and 50 basis points from where we were at the start of the year  It may be appropriate to   move again in the future, but by saying the balance of risks is on the up side, I also want to be   clear that it is not a sure thing  Our strategy isn’t to move these interest rates up 1/4 point until   whenever    Thank you    I agree    Al, I was anticipating your comment--that’s all!  "
6553,2000-05-16,HOENIG,"  Mike, I'm struck by your last comment that we've perhaps tended   to do too much late in the game because we did too little in the early stages  But does doing   too little in the early stages justify in anyone's mind doing too much later?    But if we are behind the curve, do we want to overreact in an   attempt to correct that?    Right  I like that answer      Mr Chairman, the Tenth District remains generally healthy    Employment growth is still running around 2 percent and we have an unemployment rate of   about 3 percent  But I thought I would take just a minute to convey some anecdotal   information on the District, which supports what Mike Moskow said in his comments in that   to some degree it shows a change in the tone within the District     First on wages and prices, there has been a subtle move toward pressing for higher   wages and some efforts to raise prices  We met last week with both our economic advisory   council and our board of directors  Fairly generally we heard from labor, including unions,   that they are beginning to ask for a little more on the wage front, 4 to 6 percent  But also they   are focusing very heavily on the benefits side, recognizing rising health-care costs and   wanting to keep those benefits up and recognizing, too, that benefits are the nontaxable   portion of income gains  Even among the non-union groups, there is continued pressure for   wage increases and we are hearing more about that   On the pricing side, we are still hearing the story that firms cannot pass on their   higher costs through price increases, but we are hearing about more attempts to do so  In our   area of Oklahoma and of Colorado there have been attempts to move prices up, say, 4 or 5   percent  Of that, maybe 1 percent will stick; but the fact is that the 1 percent is sticking  So,   we do see that taking place  Nevertheless, we are also hearing from the same individuals that   they sense some slowing in their regional economies  The obvious case is real estate  We are   seeing a fairly significant drop in housing demand in the Lincoln, Nebraska area, for example,      62  and some slowing, though not a decline, in Kansas City  Denver remains very strong, and we   are also seeing some carryover of that strength reflected in manufacturing, especially if it is   related to the real estate sector--in home improvement, say--though there’s just a hint of that   Turning to the national economy, our projection is very similar to that of the   Greenbook except for one important difference, which is that the moderation in growth in our   forecast comes with a less aggressive interest rate move  Having said that, with the   information we are getting on wage pressures, I would agree with those who suggest that we   will need to continue to move rates up somewhat  One thing I want to caution about, and I   hinted at it earlier in my question to Mike Prell, is that I think we want to be careful not to get   “sweaty hands"" with respect to our policy of gradualism in moving the funds rate up  From   one point of view, we started this tightening when the funds rate was 4-3/4 percent and it is   now at 6 percent  We know that a good portion of the effects of that increase has not yet   played out  We know there are lags in policy  We know that the budget surplus is increasing,   and that has an impact that we have to keep in mind  Considering that and the lags, it seems   to me that the gradualist approach with quarter-point increases is still appropriate rather than   suddenly moving forward to a more aggressive policy  That is particularly noteworthy   because, while we may not be at the right rate yet, we started at 4-3/4 percent and are now at 6   percent, which certainly makes more sense today than it did a year ago  So, while I would   readily agree that we need to keep the pressure on the economy, I think there is something to   be said for staying with a gradualist approach  Thank you    Mr Chairman, everything you said convinced me that a 1/4 point   seems right  Inflation is not taking off and in fact a lot of the evidence suggests some easing off   in the expansion  Moreover, I don't think we should be validating the market necessarily  I think   we should be looking at what is in front of us, and 1/4 point with asymmetric language seems   most appropriate  A year ago when we were at 4-3/4 percent on the funds rate, there was a better   case for moving more aggressively in the sense that we had put in a lot of stimulus  And yet we   were very cautious in moving up  It seems to me that we have been on a pretty good track in our   policy actions and if I had my preference, I would stay on that track  I'll put that view on the   table for consideration  "
6577,2000-06-27,HOENIG,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Let me begin by noting that economic   activity in the Tenth District is still very solid  Having said that, it is also true that we are seeing   mounting evidence of slowing trends within the region  It starts with manufacturing, which   certainly has slowed, with firms clearly reporting smaller usage of capacity  Our latest surveys   of purchasing managers in the region--in the front range of Colorado--suggest that   manufacturing activity is slowing fairly substantially, at least more so than the national average    Also, in some of the conversations we’ve had, business executives have indicated that some   projects are being deferred  We are also seeing evidence that retail sales have softened  In   addition, housing activity, which had weakened in April and May, is reported to have weakened   in June as well  Nonresidential construction activity remains relatively strong, but many of the   executives in that industry are telling me that a more cautionary attitude has emerged and that   they are expecting some slowing as recent interest rate moves begin to have a greater effect on   them  Our energy sector is benefiting from the current level of prices, especially the gas drilling   area, which is fairly active  But in that industry, of course, there has been a downsizing from   earlier periods, so it is harder to get skilled labor for drilling operations and, therefore, activity   is coming up rather slowly  One                                                                 involved in gas drilling   in a fairly significant way says that inventories are low now  Consequently, if demand were to           63  be strong as we go through the year, he feels there will be a surge in prices of natural gas as we   move into the winter   District labor markets still are tight  We don’t hear quite the sense of urgency about   that situation as before but labor conditions clearly are very tight  And price pressures are   similar to what we’ve reported in the past There are some efforts to raise prices but still a lot of   competitive pressure holding them down  Our farm industry, especially on the commodity side,   remains weak  But with recent additions to government payments, farm incomes will be steady   overall     Turning to the national scene, recent indicators, in conjunction with various   developments in the District that I’ve mentioned here, leave me with the very clear impression   that the economy will slow and that recent inflationary pressures should ease over time    Specifically, I have revised down my outlook for growth this year and next and am now   projecting about 3-3/4 percent for GDP growth over the forecast horizon  That is only slightly   below estimates of trend growth  However, unlike the Greenbook, we get those projections   with a fed funds rate that remains at its current level  There are a number of reasons for this   likely slowing, in my view  One is the moderation in stock market gains; another is the increase   in real interest rates  Certainly, the elevated oil and gas energy prices are a factor  And most   importantly from my perspective are our recent increases in the funds rate and more restrictive   monetary policy  While the evidence we are seeing is still mixed, I think we do have more hard   statistical evidence of a slowdown  Also, I am hearing more views from business people, as in   the examples I cited earlier, that higher interest rates have led to a slowdown in economic   activity and a change in business sentiment that I think is important             64  Regarding the inflation outlook, I am aware that the effects of our previously   accommodative monetary policy and the passthrough of oil prices to the non-energy sectors are   continuing and will put some upward pressure on core inflation in the near term  But I am also   convinced that we will not necessarily see an acceleration in core inflation because we have   moved to a more restrictive policy over this past year and that tightening has not had its full   impact on the economy as yet  As long as we remain restrictive for some period of time, the   increase in inflation should be temporary, I think, rather than permanent  I’m looking for   inflation this year to be under 2 percent, as measured by the core PCE, and to rise somewhat, of   course, as we go into next year  But I don’t see an acceleration in inflation  I think we should   be mindful of that as we contemplate policy  Thank you    Mr Chairman, I support your proposal  I don't know if we have   moved as far as we need to, but I suspect that right now there are still a lot of monetary policy   effects in the pipeline from the actions we have taken here recently that are not yet fully in play    We ought to let them work and observe where that is taking us  And as others have said, a lot   of data will be coming in over the next several weeks that I think will provide us useful   information from which to make a further judgment on the effects of our earlier tightening   moves  One of the side benefits is that our press statement last time indicated that the balance   of risks was on the up side and today we are not acting on it, and I believe that is a healthy thing   to do as well  So, I think your recommendation is a very good one  "
6601,2000-08-22,HOENIG,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman The overall economy for the Tenth District   remains solid; it hasn’t changed a great deal from last time  However, there have been some very   slight signs of further slowing since the last meeting  In the interest-sensitive sectors, particularly   home building, there is clear evidence of some cooling  Also, manufacturing activity appears to   have slowed systematically across the District in both the durable and nondurable goods areas  And   while retail sales picked up in July, the environment in that sector is clearly softer throughout the   District than it was earlier this year     However, in the other direction, nonresidential construction remains very solid in the   District and energy activity has expanded fairly significantly as higher oil, particularly gas, prices       36  have persisted throughout the last several weeks  Labor markets remain strong in the region    Unemployment rates continue to hover around the 3 percent range  But having said that, there are   no real signs of increased wage pressures  So, the situation is fairly much the same within the   District   On the national level, my views haven’t changed significantly from the time of our last   meeting  The economy is carrying momentum forward, but more signs of slowing continue to come   in on the national level  And core inflation pressures obviously remain modest  Perhaps one way to   describe our projection is to say that it is very similar to that of the Greenbook except in a couple of   areas  In our analysis we don’t have in mind a level of demand as strong as in the Board staff’s   projection  Our forecast of productivity gains is a bit less aggressive and that outcome assumes less   aggressive interest rate increases over the period  So, going forward, we see some modest slowing   in the economy and continued modest pressures on inflation  Thank you    Mr Chairman, I support your recommendation  I would say that policy   right now is tight and the issue is whether it ought to be tighter We certainly can wait to see whether   that is the case  One comment on the bias  As a suggestion, I wonder if we should not consider          78   taking out the lone reference to tight labor markets as the reason for our bias  I don't know that there   is a one-to-one mapping into inflation over the time horizon we have been talking about  Given your   comments, as well as those of others here today, it seems to me that we see other risks that are just as   important right now in leading us to this bias  I think they also ought to be considered, or certainly   that tight labor markets should not be given more consideration in our statement than these other   risks    In my view it is something we ought to consider as we go forward  "
6624,2000-10-03,HOENIG,"  Dave, let me ask you a question  In reading the Greenbook and your   projections, I know you haven’t changed your forecast much from the last time  We need to adjust   for energy, I understand  But in listening to you I sensed a little more of an acknowledgement of   some downside risks in the economy emerging in manufacturing and elsewhere  Is that a fair      34  description of the tone that I heard this morning--that there is a sense of greater downside risks than   you felt before, even though the projections themselves are pretty much unchanged?    Thank you    Thank you, Mr Chairman  The Tenth District as a region is continuing to   do very well in terms of economic activity, but it is apparent to us that growth is slowing  While   overall employment growth in the District is about the same as in the nation, private employment   growth is about ½ percentage point slower overall  Nonresidential construction reflects the softer   conditions in our area  The value of District nonresidential construction has fallen in three of the last   four months and remains significantly below previous peaks in the region  Homebuilding also has   slowed--not as dramatically perhaps, but it’s still a couple of percentage points below year-ago      56  levels  Manufacturing activity in the District also has moderated  Manufacturing jobs actually fell   about 03 percent in August and are down about 06 percent from a year ago  So, we have seen some   slowing there, in part due to higher fuel costs and so forth   Of course, the area in our District that is suddenly doing well relates to the oil and gas   industries, especially natural gas  Like Texas, we produce a lot of natural gas  Our rig count is up   about 125 percent and employment in that sector is up rather significantly as well  So we do have   activity starting to pick up now as people are becoming more confident that higher oil prices are   going to last for a while and are therefore willing to bring some activity back into play     Retail sales generally have been steady and actually have been fairly strong in the Denver   area, as has the whole economy in that region  But, overall, with some slowing we have seen a little   loosening of labor market conditions  The unemployment rate remains about the same or a bit   higher in different areas of the region as well  Price pressures have also remained steady, despite the   fact that some raw materials costs, of course, are going up and have to be dealt with by the   manufacturing companies  We haven’t seen those higher costs come through at all at the retail level;   we’ve actually heard some talk of easing price pressures there     Our agricultural sector is still seeing very weak prices  That industry is very much   dependent upon government payments and will continue to be so through next year at least, based on   the bumper production we see in our region  So we have a strong economy but with some slowing   apparent   At the national level, incoming data have done little to change my outlook on the   economy  From the information I have heard here and our own analysis I would say that growth of   economic activity is in a longer-term slowing phase  Since the beginning of the year, I think the flat   stock market, the higher energy costs in play, and the tighter monetary policy have cooled off      57  consumer spending  And while investment spending remains very good, our projection is that its   growth will be down from the earlier high level, and I think that will play a role as well  As   compared to the Greenbook forecast, our projection is for a stepping down of GDP growth toward   the 3-1/2 percent area  We also see that occurring without further increases in the fed funds rate   from its level today  The risks, of course, are related to energy, which we’ve talked about  And, yes,   energy costs could push overall prices up and that could actually slow the economy  The situation   could be complicated if personal income levels fall and the debt burdens in our economy have to be   dealt with  So, those are the downside risks     In essence, while I wouldn’t fall on my sword on this, Mr Chairman, I think the risks are   more balanced than they have been  I would feel comfortable saying that with a balanced risk   statement, even with these economic projections, because I think the higher rates are still in play    We have seen a slowing expansion and I think that is continuing, which gives us a picture of an   economy with more balanced risks in the future  Thank you    I can accept your recommendation, Mr Chairman, although I think we   could go to a more balanced stance  But we can wait  "
6648,2000-11-15,HOENIG,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Let me spend a little time on   developments in our District  Growth across the Tenth District continues to moderate and some   of the slowing appears to be the result of labor supply constraints  But there is also evidence that   the pace of demand is slowing  Moreover, in talking with business leaders throughout our   District at least, I've noticed a shift in sentiment about future activity  There is increasing   concern about the possibility of a more significant slowdown coming  Having said that, private   employment growth remains close to the national average in most District states  Colorado’s   private employment growth, while still the highest in the District, has fallen considerably--from               29      about a 4-1/2 percent rate in mid-1999 to 2-1/2 percent now--and growth there clearly exceeds   that in the rest of the District   Manufacturing activity was flat in October in our District, although capacity   utilization remained relatively high  Looking forward, District manufacturers have been   lowering their expectations  A manufacturing survey revealed the second consecutive downward   revision in capital spending plans  This obviously raises some questions as to whether   productivity gains will be sustained in that environment  It may also help to explain the shift in   sentiment I mentioned a little earlier   Residential construction activity continues to cool in the District  Excluding   Colorado, single-family housing permits have fallen for four consecutive quarters, leaving the   level down about 20 percent since the fourth quarter of 1998  Indicative of the slowdown, our   business contacts in Kansas City report that start times on housing have now declined from about   90 days to around 15 days  In contrast, though, single-family permits in Colorado are up about   10 percent and median prices in that area are up about 15 percent year over year  Nonresidential   construction activity has fallen even more sharply in most of our District  For example, in the   third quarter the value of nonresidential construction was down about a third everywhere in the   District but in Colorado, where it was down about 10 percent   Energy activity, in contrast, continues of course to benefit from the higher energy   prices  District counts of active oil and gas rigs have increased for about eight months in a row   and are now the highest since December 1993  Drilling contractors have accumulated a sizable   backlog of job commitments, but growth is constrained by a lack of skilled workers in that               30      industry  Many have left the oil industry and it is hard to get them to come back at the wage   levels that are now prevailing   Labor markets overall have remained tight, but with very little change in wage   pressures that we’ve noticed  The District's unemployment rate was about 32 percent in   September, below the national average  Intel, for example, attributed a delay of several months   in opening a new computer chip fabrication plant in Colorado Springs, originally scheduled for   November, to difficulties in hiring--especially construction workers   Manufacturers are seeing higher input prices but they are not able to pass those costs   through in prices  And our farm economy continues to see little change  Cotton crop production   was very strong and, therefore, we continue to see obvious downward pressure on prices   Let me turn to the national economy  The incoming data confirm, as Dave already   noted in his briefing, an ongoing process of moderation in the economic expansion  The lower   rate of GDP growth in the third quarter helps to confirm that slowing  I realize the key question   is, of course, whether the third-quarter results represent a respite or a new trend  To be sure, the   third-quarter growth in consumption expenditures at an annual rate of better than 4 percent is   unlikely to be sustained, but early indications for the fourth quarter suggest that consumers are   following the rest of the economy toward a more moderate pace  And I think that's significant   Nevertheless, I remain satisfied with the outlook for economic activity  I expect the   economy to grow near its sustainable rate, along the lines described by the staff in its projection    Despite a pickup in compensation costs and the acceleration in overall inflation this year, the   underlying inflation rate remains relatively modest in my opinion  On balance, the unwinding of               31      the effects of higher energy prices in conjunction with the 6-1/2 percent fed funds rate should   place some downward pressure on underlying inflation over the forecast horizon   Let me note quickly, though, the risks in the outlook  While inflation risks are still   real, they have moderated to some degree for the reasons I’ve just described  In contrast--and I   think this is consistent with what the staff said in its briefing today--my view is that the downside   risks to economic activity have increased somewhat  I believe that growth slowing to trend is the   most likely outcome  But I also believe there are greater downside risks stemming from recent   developments, and I’d like to tick off some that I would highlight  First, financial conditions   have tightened and the downturn in economic activity has softened corporate balance sheets    Also, we have the higher interest rate spreads that we've talked about today, tighter lending terms   and standards, lower equity prices, an increase in the cost of capital to some degree, and   increased aversion to the risks of more speculative investments  Junk bond default rates are up,   rating downgrades are more prevalent, and profits are lower  Debt as a share of net worth has   been rising more quickly in 2000, after leveling off in prior years, and debt service costs are   increasing   These are factors that are on the horizon and they are affecting the balance of risks   with which we need to deal  And while none of these developments means that growth will   decelerate beyond our expectations, I think we are in a more risky period in terms of our   economic projections and the outlook  Thank you, Mr Chairman    Don, my question is similar to Governor Meyer’s  It strikes   me that how you view the risk statement depends on how you view monetary policy right   now  And this is what I think you were just saying  Suppose you view monetary policy   right now as tight--that is, the funds rate is above the natural rate, whatever term you   want to use--and the economy is slowing  If we still have the risk of inflation but we   have a tight policy, which is addressing that, and now we see a slowing, that means the   downside risks are increasing  We might then want a balanced risk statement because we   have a tight policy to address the one concern and the economy is heading in this other   direction  So, how one views the appropriateness of the risk statement depends on how   one judges the tightness of current monetary policy    Mr Chairman, I too would prefer a balanced risks statement,   and my reasons are perhaps similar to Bill Poole’s  I think we do have upside risks for   inflation, which we are addressing  That's why we have a fed funds rate at the level it is   now, which I believe indicates a fairly tight policy  And I think by holding that position   we have introduced new risks that bring the position more in balance in terms of the   outlook  In my view what is happening with your additional statement is that we've come   full circle  We're now finding ways to compromise on the risks statement; we are   neutering its role and putting more emphasis on the rest of the press release  That may in   fact be the option we end up with, which better describes the views of this Committee in   terms of the risks that have now been introduced and the policy actions that might be   taken in the future  But by having these two different statements, I think we are   introducing a new potential for confusion in the marketplace as well  So I would go for a   balanced statement now in the press release, but we’ll see how this works  "
6671,2000-12-19,HOENIG,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Since our last meeting, the District has   continued to expand, but quite modestly, and there are additional pockets of weakness and some new   areas of concern within the regional economy  There have been some highly publicized layoffs,   although the actual level of employment has remained relatively high  And private employment   growth continues to follow a modest slowing trend for the District, just as it does for the nation   Retail sales got off to an okay start this holiday season, but few expect the kind of year-  over-year growth seen last year  Also, some concern has been expressed that holiday sales levels   have been dependent on some heavy discounting  By far the weakest component of consumer   spending in our region has been for automobiles and light trucks  Both GM and Ford have reduced      36  activity at their Kansas City plants  One has eliminated all overtime and the other has actually shut   down its line for some weeks during the holidays                                             manufactures prefabricated metal buildings and serves on the   national trade association says he sees softening not only in his business but in many other segments   of manufacturing as well  And businesses appear to be taking a very clear wait-and-see attitude   toward investment decisions going into next year   Construction activity is down from a year ago but remains relatively solid overall in the   region, particularly in the Denver area  Homebuilders report that starts turned downward in   November, following a modest rebound the month before  Nevertheless, housing starts and home   sales remained high by historical standards, and the fact that housing prices in most cities continue to   rise faster than the general price level suggests that demand for housing is still relatively strong   Nonresidential construction starts have also stabilized recently, after trending down much   of the year  Energy activity in our District has leveled off recently but is still the highest in years   and is being held back mainly by a lack of rigs and skilled workers  So far, District energy firms   have benefited from both higher gas prices and oil prices     Inflationary pressures in the region do not seem to have changed significantly since our   last meeting  A somewhat higher proportion of business contacts reported above-normal wage   increases in November than in previous months  However, businesses did not appear to have any   more success than before in passing such costs on to the customers  Finally, the farm economy   remains in a slump and dependent on Government subsidies, although there has been some reduction   in inventories that may help to sustain prices in the future   In terms of the national economy, my outlook has not changed a lot over the past month  I   remain cautious about the economy  Economic activity clearly has slowed  So far the slowing has      37  been orderly and I expect it to continue to be so  The incoming price data continue to be consistent   with a moderate underlying inflation rate as well   Let me talk briefly about inflation  Obviously, we’ve received little new information   about inflation over the last month, but what we have received has been generally favorable  Despite   higher energy prices and rising import prices, core inflation remains modest  And we agree with the   Board's staff that it should continue that way  I realize, of course, that headline inflation will be far   from stable over the next few months  The spike in natural gas prices is just one example of the   factors that will complicate our reading of prospective inflation  However, as the winter passes   energy prices should retreat to more normal levels, a prospect reflected in the futures market  Thus,   while we may see some volatility in inflation, I expect it to remain modest for the foreseeable future   Turning to the economy more generally, growth appears to be moderating as expected in   the fourth quarter  Consumers are reining in their spending because of slower employment growth   and lower stock prices this year  Manufacturing activity has also moderated and businesses more   generally are retrenching  Tighter financial conditions, softer earnings, and softer balance sheets   appear to be causing firms to scale back their spending plans  One key question is whether the   economy is decelerating too quickly, as David mentioned  To be sure, recent reports on consumer   confidence and retail activity are noteworthy  While the jury is still out, the evidence is mounting   that the slowdown is real and may last a while  The stock market is down significantly and   anecdotal evidence suggests that labor markets are softening  And as I noted earlier, in our District--  and I think it is true more generally--holiday sales have gotten off to only an okay start and no one   expects strong sales suddenly to emerge   In essence, I agree with the Greenbook that growth will be below trend for some period    Also, as I mentioned at the last meeting, I remain somewhat concerned that tighter financial      38  conditions pose an additional and important downside risk  These include higher interest rate   spreads, lower equity prices, tighter lending terms and standards, increased risk aversion toward   more speculative ventures, and a rise in junk bond default rates  We see higher though still modest   C&I loan delinquencies as well  And finally, after-tax corporate earnings growth is down  As a   result, we're seeing debt as a share of net worth rise in 2000 after leveling off in prior years  Debt   service costs are rising and downward adjustments of capital spending plans are taking place  None   of these factors taken in isolation means growth would decelerate beyond expectations  But the   combination of tighter financial conditions and large financial imbalances increases the risks to the   outlook, and I think significantly     In summary, what the data suggest to me is that the economy can grow at a more modest   but healthy pace in the future and that inflation will remain modest  However, we might wish to   rebalance the risks to the economy by considering an adjustment in policy that goes beyond just the   words in our press statement  Thank you    Mr Chairman, I too would prefer moving now  I think the funds rate is   high and the effect has been to slow the economy as intended  In my view a quarter point reduction   in the rate now would still leave us with a tight policy, one that continues to slow the economy, and   yet it would recognize the risks that we've talked about around the table  I believe it is likely that we   will have a conference call and that we will lower rates at that point  And certainly we can wait until   then   "
6694,2001-01-03,HOENIG,"  Mr Chairman, this is Tom Hoenig  May I speak next?    I also agree with your recommendation and I would reiterate my point   that the funds rate has been above where it should be for a little while now  I think we should   make our more aggressive moves when the rate is clearly above where the economy suggests it   should be--above the natural rate or whatever we want to call it  That's because in my view the   risks then are less than they are if we wait until the end of a series of policy actions to make our   big moves  So I believe we should start with a fairly significant move--and your proposed move   is significant, I think--and then decide whether we should whittle the size down as we get closer,   hopefully, to the correct rate  So I would support a 50 basis point move now  And I think the   risks still are on the down side because if in fact the economy is slowing as you’re suggesting--  and I think it is--the natural rate may continue to decline  So we may be chasing that rate for a   while  In my view those are real risks for us to be mindful of as we go forward     1/3/01 8   Mr Chairman, this is Tom Hoenig  I’m a bit uneasy with what   you’ve suggested  Although I think the long-term outlook still may be fundamentally sound, I’m   not sure we know that because events have come on rather rapidly in some areas  So I don’t   know that we want to be too far out on that limb in terms of how strong we think the economy   will be, going forward    Yes    I agree with you  I guess I feel a little more comfortable with Al   Broaddus's approach of talking in terms of taking back some of the increase that we did last year    Okay    That I agree with  "
6716,2001-01-30,HOENIG,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  First of all, I’d like to say that   these papers were really outstanding and advanced our thinking along quite some   distance  I have some specific reactions to points raised in the papers and some broad   reactions to the questions that Don asked  Let me start by saying that I certainly do agree   with the principles outlined in the Beebe/Cumming paper  Of those, maintaining our   independence is the most important principle; I agree with Al Broaddus on that  In   addition, we should do all we can not to subsidize a sector of the economy or individual   institutions   But having said that and having read these papers, whatever our decision, some   asset class or set of institutions will benefit from our action  We know that  It is a matter   of tradeoffs, as Bill McDonough said  Since some segment of the private sector will be a   beneficiary rather than the US government, as is now the case, I think the decision does   have serious implications for our independence  In addition, we may directly or     1/30-31/01 21  indirectly end up affecting relative asset values and the allocation of credit across   institutions and sectors of the economy    So, given the guiding principles, how to proceed in choosing the asset   composition of the System’s balance sheet is the primary issue  For me there are three   implications to these principles and I want to mention them quickly and then go into a   little more detail  First, I think we should conduct outright purchases of US government   securities for as long as possible; I totally agree with that  Second, I think we should   avoid outright purchases of any private sector security  I am concerned that putting on   our balance sheet an asset issued by an ultimate private sector borrower would   compromise our independence in that we would appear to be subsidizing a particular   sector or institution  Currently the US government is the most important ultimate   borrower on our balance sheet  A third point is that we should deal with strong financial   intermediaries rather than with ultimate private sector borrowers  Financial   intermediaries put some “green space,” if I can use that term, between the ultimate   borrower and us  And basically I would prefer having securities on our balance sheet that   are issued by financial intermediaries rather than securities issued by ultimate private   sector borrowers  By using intermediaries we are one step removed from allocating   credit   These views have implications that would lead me to the following incremental   strategy  First, I’d increase our self-imposed limits on our holdings of Treasury   securities  I recognize that these limits were originally imposed in order to minimize the   likelihood that we would affect relative asset prices  But given my strong preference that   we hold Treasury securities rather than anything else, I would accept that we may affect     1/30-31/01 22  some asset values--that’s part of the tradeoff  Second, I’d consider outright purchases of   GNMA mortgage-backed securities  GNMA securities are backed by the full faith and   credit of the US government, and I would avoid outright purchases of Fannie Maes and   Freddie Macs  Third, I’d begin the process necessary to implement the ACF, the auction   process for loans  With the ACF we would be dealing with strong financial   intermediaries  Also the ACF is similar to an RP in that the loan rate is determined in an   open market auction  Unlike an RP the asset on our balance sheet is a loan to a strong   depository institution, not the actual security used in the RP  And finally, the ACF would   allow financial markets time to develop the benchmark security on their own without our   indirectly influencing their decision  I realize that we may in fact have problem   institutions, but I don’t think we would be triggering the public knowledge of that    That’s all publicly disclosed now  It’s part of market discipline  Most of those have   written agreements  I don’t think we will be triggering public disclosure of problem   credit situations if we have to redirect our lending from assets involving problem credit    And fourth, I would continue to use RPs as we do currently--that is, as a means to hit our   intended fed funds rate target on a daily basis  I would not use RPs to increase the size of   our portfolio; I’d use the auction for that  Using RPs as a primary means to increase the   size of our portfolio would permanently put private assets on our balance sheet, contrary   to our principles     So in trying to see how we would move toward a process--and not to dismiss   Al Broaddus’s proposal because I think it’s interesting--this is the incremental approach I   would follow  I believe it would allow us to achieve an orderly transition, as the     1/30-31/01 23  government retires its debt, in a way that is most consistent with the four principles that   have been set forth  Thank you for the time    Our goal in a sense is to try to get through this transition   without shocking the system as we move toward holding different types of assets  That’s   why I prefer this incremental approach, which takes us through a series of assets that we   might hold while increasing, to the extent that is feasible, the amount of our current   holdings  I think the ACF is one avenue to a long-term solution, although I recognize   that the ACF raises issues that need to be dealt with  But I’d hate to move toward   complete reliance on RPs or toward holding a particular type of agency security that   would have a more narrow impact for the particular markets or institutions involved       1/30-31/01 24   Peter and Don, I understand why you want to diversify into   the foreign sovereigns and why you dislike Fannie Mae becoming the benchmark and so   forth, but let me ask you to speculate a bit further  The market would be informed as to   why we were doing this and I wonder if there would be a political backlash in the sense   of our favoring foreign sovereign over domestic securities  That whole issue could come   back and bite us in a sense, as we try to move into that market  Is there a risk or even a   likelihood that we might have to deal with that type of criticism?    Yes    It does point out how carefully it has to be explained not only   to our most severe critics but also to those who immediately grasp it and understand it     1/30-31/01 66   Mr Chairman, just to clarify  On the request to explore   securities of foreign sovereigns for repos--one option we’re considering--when you say as   we go forward we will give context to this, do you intend that we would have a broader   discussion of this whole topic?  In other words, here is one solution for the short term    There are other long-term solutions under discussion, so will we provide a full context   and not raise expectations that we’re looking at foreign sovereigns as our solution for   expanding the depth of the market?     Okay, thank you    Second    Thank you, Mr Chairman  In the Tenth District, economic   growth has slowed further since our last meeting  Manufacturing and even some areas of   homebuilding are experiencing outright declines in activity while other sectors generally   are growing at a slower pace  As far as we can tell, for the District’s economy as a whole   growth is still positive and labor markets are still relatively tight but far less so than they   were just a month ago  Moreover, with all the layoff announcements and talk about the     1/30-31/01 134  slowing economy, consumers clearly are becoming uneasy  In our surveys of District   contacts, businesses are showing more caution; they are waiting to see how the economy   fares before they make any major decisions  Employment edged down last month and, in   a departure from prior experience, last month’s slowdown in job growth was due more to   weakness in demand than to the lack of qualified labor that we’ve talked about in the   past  A lot of the job losses in December were in manufacturing and construction, and   these are also the sectors about which we have been hearing the most reports of declining   activity lately  And we are hearing of extended layoffs at our local auto manufacturing   plants  We’ve also been getting a steady flow of layoff announcements from other areas   as well, which could limit job growth in the next couple of months  Retail sales have   been sluggish  Despite heavy discounting, sales in December and early January were up   only modestly over a year ago  Many of our contacts said unease about the economy was   causing consumers to put off purchases, especially of big ticket items such as autos     On a more positive note, some areas in commercial construction did hold   steady  Work continues on a number of large projects, and commercial space is still in   relatively short supply in most of our cities  A few contacts expressed concern about   overbuilding in the retail market, but otherwise markets seem to be in general balance    Of course, energy activity remains a source of strength in our region, expanding as fast as   firms can find equipment and workers  The District’s rig count climbed further last   month and is now at an 8-year high  In our District inflationary pressures remain   relatively subdued and may even have eased slightly since our last meeting  Only a few   of our business contacts reported above-normal wage increases, less than in the past   months  Retail prices also appear to have edged down last month due to some heavy     1/30-31/01 135  discounting  To be sure, some manufacturers have been hit hard by higher input costs,   especially for natural gas  However, they are not finding it any easier to pass those costs   on than before     Let me turn to my comments on the national economy  I think recent events   have confirmed our concern--or my concern at least--that the economy might slow more   dramatically than desired or than thought likely only a month ago  Incoming data on   economic activity suggest that the slowing continues and, like the Board's staff, I have   marked down my outlook for near-term growth  But also like the staff, over the longer   run I still remain confident about the underlying resilience of our economy   Currently, though, we are in a cyclical slowdown  Weakness in the economy   is likely to be broad-based  Consumption, especially durable goods expenditures, and   business fixed investment continue to soften  Residential housing should tread water, I   suspect, as low mortgage rates help to prop up demand  But inventory investment, as   we’ve already noted, is softening noticeably  Incoming inflation data confirm a trend of   moderate inflation pressures  Given that the economy is slowing, that energy price   increases are showing some signs of unwinding, and that inflation expectations remain   well anchored, inflation could ease some     This projected economic weakness and moderate inflation outlook suggest to   me that a 50 basis point reduction in the fed funds rate might be appropriate for us to   consider  In my view, the current federal funds rate continues to represent a tight policy    The issue is not just whether we’re in a recession but whether policy is tight, and I think   it is  A 50 basis point reduction would take us toward a more neutral policy and would   reflect prudence  I would suggest, as I have before, that it is in the early stages of a     1/30-31/01 136  policy shift that we can be more aggressive in our rate actions  As we get to lower rate   levels, we should be more cautious about any change or hold the rate constant to assess   the situation  It is at times like the present that I think we can, and probably should, act a   little more boldly   Let me also take a minute to talk about the risks  As I’ve said, I think the   longer-term outlook is for a pickup in economic growth as we get into the second half of   the year  But there are important risks to this forecast  First, I think investment could   decline further  Softer aggregate demand has a depressing effect on business fixed   investment and future business spending  In light of weakening financial balance sheets   and past spending levels, business fixed investment may be particularly vulnerable   Second, consumer debt service levels remain relatively high and asset values have   softened  These factors and the low saving rate, along with declining consumer   confidence and slower employment growth, could undermine consumer spending and the   economy’s growth  And finally, the foreign sector continues to embody some risks    With our large current account deficit and perhaps a slowing in economic growth   elsewhere, I believe there are some risks in that area as well  These are the kinds of   factors that we need to have in mind today as we consider our policy actions in the next   part of this meeting  Thank you    I’m in agreement with your recommendation, Mr Chairman  "
6740,2001-03-20,HOENIG,"  I have a couple of questions for you, David, and I’d like you   to look out a little beyond the forecast horizon  You commented on the alternative     3/20/01 22  scenario with a more aggressive reduction of the funds rate  I know you have projected   the inflation rate out to 2002 under that scenario and I’d just like to get your impressions   of what it might imply for 2003   My second question has to do with the effects of such a policy on construction   activity, given the comments in the Greenbook and in your statement about that sector    Banks in our region are beginning to lend more aggressively on real estate  If we were to   pursue that more aggressive policy easing, would that perhaps have the effect of pushing   the yield curve down?  If that lowered the capitalization rates on real estate, we could see   a fairly dramatic shift of funds into that sector as people look to deploy their assets,   which might cause some--for lack of a better word--overbuilding in the real estate area    If construction takes off as implied or real capitalization rates fall, what effects do you   think that might have down the road?      Thank you    Thank you, Mr Chairman  The Tenth District economy   remains sluggish but some signs of stability are beginning to appear  Manufacturing   activity continues to decline and auto sales in most of our areas remain relatively weak,   although some recent pickup has been noted  Incoming data on other sectors have had a   more positive tone  Interestingly, like David Stockton, we really did expect to find a lot   of gloom and doom with respect to the real economy and we didn’t  We found some   positive elements in the situation   Let me turn to specifics  I’ll start with the slower industries first, which   include, of course, manufacturing  Our Bank’s most recent manufacturing survey   showed a decline in January  Activity was below year-ago levels, for the first time in the   six years we’ve conducted this survey  Capital spending was also down from a year ago    And purchasing managers were not nearly as optimistic about future activity as they were   earlier  One of our directors,                                 indicated that his firm’s business was   down about 5 percent from a year ago due to lower export demand and also the effects in     3/20/01 58  rural areas of the decline in wealth among hobby farmers  He has had to lay off about   one-third of his workforce, a noticeable reduction in that particular market   Consumer spending remains soft but also has shown some signs of a firming    Auto sales were down sharply in January but subsequently recovered somewhat  And   most of the retailers we contacted in February said that their sales were about level and   that they were seeing some increase in traffic  For example, one of our contacts, a   furniture manufacturer who sells in Denver, reported a significant increase in traffic and   greater interest in some of their big ticket items  Construction activity, while down from   a year ago, rose sharply in January following a poor December  Retailers and   homebuilders in some of our markets view the slowdown relative to a year ago as a pause   and they remain optimistic about the period ahead    Labor market developments also provide some evidence that the District   economy may be stabilizing  Employment continued to grow in January, the latest month   for which we have data, and we have seen a noticeable reduction in layoff   announcements  Perhaps most importantly, our directors and other contacts tell us that   most of the workers who have been laid off are being hired by other firms, so there has   not been a great struggle in finding employment given the job vacancies that existed  The   supply of labor may not be as tight as it was earlier, but labor also does not appear to be   in excess supply    Energy activity is strong in our area  Shortages of equipment and workers   actually have constrained drilling activity  The equipment seems to be becoming   available but skilled workers remain in short supply  Conditions in the farm economy are   mixed, with livestock producers making a profit while grain producers will have to rely     3/20/01 59  once again on government subsidies  Inflationary pressures in the District have remained   modest, although we’ve seen some pickup in the general trend of inflation within the   region   Let me turn to the national economy  Recent developments indicate that some   broad-based weaknesses from the fourth quarter are spilling over into the first quarter    Like the Board’s staff, we also expect growth in the first quarter to be relatively slow--  below the 1 percent mark  While this represents a marked slowdown, we also expect the   US economy to continue to grow modestly as we go forward, a view that is not   inconsistent with the staff’s forecast  Moreover, recent inflation developments have been   relatively modest, a fact we certainly recognize     Though the pace of economic activity has been decelerating, as I said earlier   recent economic statistics and reports from business contacts in our District--and I think   more generally--suggest some stabilization is occurring  I was surprised at the relatively   favorable outlook painted by the many directors and business contacts we talk with, but   they had to look at the hard economic data and get their focus off the stock market in   order to do that     Sorting through all these data and impressions, I expect the economy to grow   modestly this year and into 2002  However, I also recognize that there’s a great deal of   uncertainty in the near term and some downside risks as well  On the down side,   manufacturing is clearly in a slump, problems in the high-tech sector have deepened,   consumer confidence has plummeted, and the stock market’s performance has nose   dived  It has been reported to me that CEOs are putting off new projects and cutting back   on some existing projects  While recognizing this, I nonetheless judge that the most     3/20/01 60  likely prospect for the US economy is that it will move back toward its long-run trend   growth  Several factors support that assessment, including our solid productivity trends,   our stable inflationary environment, and our sound financial institutions  Those factors   will provide a strong foundation as we move into 2002    Given where we are, I would feel comfortable with a modest reduction in   interest rates from where they are now  A lot of momentum has been put into the   economy through our easing moves earlier this year  In addition to that easing I would   support a further modest move, perhaps for a total of 50 basis points, to insure against the   downside risks that we all recognize  Those downside risks stem from the large and   growing financial imbalances in the economy, especially the unsustainably low personal   saving rate, the high level of consumer debt, and difficulties in the foreign sector  If   these imbalances were to worsen, we could see a further deceleration in activity or   possibly an actual slowdown in the economy   In such an environment I would not be surprised if consumers tried to boost   their savings, rebalance their portfolios, and offset their losses of net worth, nor would I   be surprised if businesses tried to cut back on planned capital expenditures  Such   reactions have the potential to magnify the economy’s modest slowdown and precipitate   a drop in aggregate demand  In my view that possibility is the key risk to an orderly   rebound in economic activity  And that’s why in the current situation I support a modest   policy move for insurance purposes  I would be very cautious about taking more than a   modest step because I believe there is a lot of stimulus in the economy that hasn’t yet   shown through  Monetary policy has long and variable lags, so I also worry about the   risk that our easing actions could become procyclical, with further stimulus coming into     3/20/01 61  the economy as it moves--in the scenario painted by the Greenbook and others around   this table--out of its current slowdown  Thank you    Mr Chairman, I support your proposal  As I said earlier, I see   enough weakness and risk in the economy looking forward beyond this quarter to justify   a 50 basis point cut  And I am relieved that we are not doing more than that because in   my view that would introduce some of the problems you noted  It most definitely would   introduce moral hazard issues with regard to the market and what it would expect from   us, which would be inappropriate  So, I am comfortable with your recommendation     3/20/01 94  I have two questions  When you spoke of an intermeeting move, did you have   in mind a conference call with the Committee to go forward with such an action?    Secondly, in the press statement coming out of this meeting, would you anticipate any   reference to the market or would the market not be mentioned?  If nothing else, we're   going to get ourselves in this trap--    Okay, thank you very much    Mr Chairman, when I was listening to your comments, I   thought you were going to put words in the statement that said we might move in the   intermeeting period  In reading this draft, I’m quite relieved that you are not doing that    So, I can live with this sentence  I would take out “especially” if I had my choice   SEVERAL  Yes    I can live with this sentence because if I can’t live with this   sentence, I can’t live with the sentence that precedes it either  I don’t think it says that we   necessarily are going to move in the intermeeting period  I would take out the word   “especially” so it is more parallel to our statement in December and not less  Other than   that, I’m fine with this     3/20/01 108   What does a “yes” vote mean?  Does “yes” mean “especially”   is in or out?    No  "
6760,2001-04-11,HOENIG,"  This is Tom Hoenig  I have a question about the staff’s   forecast  Are you starting to factor into the longer-run outlook for this year any of the   fiscal activity that is going on right now?  Is there any anticipation of spending increases   or a tax cut in the projections that you just shared with us?    Okay, thank you    Mr Chairman, this is Tom Hoenig  I have visited with   different groups around the region and I’ll be meeting with our board of directors   tomorrow and will learn more about developments in our District  Of the groups I have   talked with recently, some have been in the technology and industrial sectors and some in   the consumer area  Let me just summarize a couple of points  The technology sector is   clearly in difficulty  Agilent, as you well know, has announced pay cuts and cutbacks in   the technology area, which is similar to some other organizations in that sector  Clearly,   there have been delays in capital expenditures by that company, by Intel, and by others    On the industrial side, in terms of large capital projects, the individuals I’ve talked with   in this region have seen a holding back on some industrial projects It is not panic, but   more a wait-and-see attitude; that is how it has been described to me repeatedly  Finally,   the consumer providers I’ve talked with have seen a continuation of what they say is   almost strength in sales of nondurables and some appliances  They say that the picture is   very mixed but nothing in their recent experience would strike them as so bad that it   would cause them to be afraid of or down on the market  And, frankly, I’m hearing some   anticipation of action on the fiscal policy side  So, it’s a mixed bag, not unlike the   situation at the time of our last meeting, with some signs of stabilization and a sense that   people are waiting as things work through     4/11/01 18   That leads me first of all, to agree with you; today doesn’t strike me as   necessarily the right day to reduce the funds rate  I don’t know that the data available at   this point would lead people to expect that or cause me to feel the need to cut rates    Moreover, I would like to avoid an intermeeting move unless important evidence   suggests otherwise  That’s the way I would lean  I’m certainly open to the possibility,   should the data over the next few days suggest the need for us to move  But I would like   to see some additional data come in and see how the new information would affect the   forecast  That completes my comments  "
6780,2001-04-18,HOENIG,"  Mr Chairman, this is Tom Hoenig  As I’ve thought about this   since our last call, I’ve concluded that going ahead and lowering the funds rate is a   prudent step  We might have been able to wait until the May meeting, but I don’t see that   we have to be locked in to changing the rate only at meetings  So I’m comfortable doing   a cut today  I’ve talked with a number of individuals around this region over the last   week, both directors and others, and views are split about 50/50 between those who feel   we’re at a bottom of the economy’s adjustment and those who are still expecting some   further weakening  And clearly we are still dealing with some consumer confidence   issues in this area as well     Finally, I would note that in lowering the rate to 4-1/2 percent I think we are   moving from what I would call a neutral or modestly accommodative stance to a more   accommodative stance  And given that the economy in the first quarter was growing at   only 1 percent or maybe 1-1/2 percent--somewhere in that range--against a potential of 3   percent or better, and given yesterday’s CPI numbers and the related outlook on prices, I   think the lower rate is appropriate     I do want to say that I hope we will exercise care as we approach the May   meeting in terms of looking at the data because as we get to a more accommodative   policy stance, of course, the risks of going one step too far always increase at that point    That’s my only note of caution as we proceed through these times  Thank you         And when is it going to be released?    Mr Chairman, I agree with what Larry Meyer was just saying    I think we should change the wording    When do you plan to announce this, Mr Chairman?     4/18/01 18    Okay, thank you  "
6801,2001-05-15,HOENIG,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I have had an opportunity in the last   several days to talk with different groups, including our economic advisory council and our     5/15/01     29   board of directors, and I would say that the view is still that economic growth in our District   remains sluggish  Businesses have been putting some of their capital spending plans on a wait-  and-see basis, not because they can’t find funding but because they want to see how things   develop  There was very little talk of recession in the discussions with our contacts  I was also a   bit surprised by the fact that a minority of those individuals commented that they wondered   whether additional discount rate cuts would really help with our problems, which are related to   energy and over-investment in some high-tech and telecommunications industries  So there was   a sense of how far the easing has gone and a question of whether it’s perhaps enough or more   than enough      More specifically, turning to our manufacturing survey, that sector continues to be   weak  The production index, though, did rise slightly from its January low  And on an anecdotal   basis, a minority of manufacturers talked about having made some very fast and harsh cutbacks   early on so that their operations are now profitable again and they are more optimistic going   forward    Consumer spending is mixed in our region  Retailers report that sales of big-ticket   items have been weaker than desired, which has offset the moderate strength they have seen in   sales of other items  The attractive mortgage interest rate environment has underpinned   residential real estate  There are some signs of slowing in the residential sector but very modest   slowing, and prices are still rising--although not as rapidly as they were in our Denver market,   for example  Commercial real estate remains strong but also is softening  And labor market   conditions have eased obviously and noticeably  Energy remains our strongest sector, with   further upside potential very clear  There is a lot of activity in that area and companies are trying     5/15/01     30   to get, as they say, iron and labor into the field  The farm outlook is unchanged from the last   time we met, with grains still in surplus and cattle and beef very strong right now       Let me talk briefly about the national economy  Obviously, as has been pointed out   here, the economy has slowed and certainly will continue to grow slowly in this second quarter    There are also obvious downside risks, which have been pointed out  Maybe we will have   further slowing in business fixed investment, for example  What are the effects of slower   earnings growth, foreign demand, consumption, and so forth?  And the psychology is negative    But there is no panic; we’re not talking about an overall sense of gloominess  Perhaps more   importantly, I believe, there is significant stimulus in the pipeline and with it I think the outlook   for the nation is generally rather positive, despite the powerful crosscurrents affecting the   economy  Accordingly, I would suggest that the staff’s forecast is a little too pessimistic on   growth and a little too optimistic on inflation  I would certainly acknowledge the existence of   downside risks  But GDP growth in the first quarter was stronger than people had expected    Sales figures, despite the downward adjustments for March and February, have been better than   people had thought  And a lot of inventory adjustments appear to be well advanced at this point    The outlook has been helped by our changes in policy  Our actions appear to have cushioned the   deceleration in activity  The decline in short-term rates, the decline in risk spreads, and double-  digit rates of growth in M2 are having beneficial effects in the short term  Moreover, our policy   easing has yet to be played out fully and will be felt more completely as the changes in monetary   policy kick in with a lag   All this taken together leads me to conclude that the economy will strengthen during   the second half of this year and into 2002, especially with the policy we now have in place  My   forecast is indeed much stronger than the staff’s  And financial markets, as we’ve discussed,     5/15/01     31   indicate that they also may be looking for a stronger outcome, given the steeper yield curve and   the decline in credit risk spreads   With that background, let me talk a minute about the inflation outlook  The gradual   increase in core inflation over the past year is a concern to me  While much of the increase may   reflect the pass-through of energy prices to core inflation, the current fed funds rate is   accommodative, in my judgment, and that heightens my concern for the longer-term outlook    Even assuming that energy prices decline somewhat and that core inflation stays at its current   level, our more accommodative policy may very well lead consumers, laborers, and businesses to   ratchet up their inflation expectations  There is some evidence that this is already occurring, and   it is likely to become more pronounced if we pursue policies that are increasingly   accommodating and aggressive  For example, the Michigan survey saw, in the steepening of the   yield curve that I mentioned, an early sign of this upcreep in inflation expectations  My   judgment is that core inflation could rise later this year and next year as our accommodative   policy moves forward     For these reasons I think the relative risk between weaker growth and higher inflation   has shifted since our last meeting  The economy remains vulnerable to downside risks in the   short run  Certainly, the behavior of business investment and anecdotal reports about rising   layoffs suggest that we are not out of the woods, and I’m not suggesting that we are  However,   our prompt and aggressive policy actions have served to address these developments to an   important degree, and the risks have begun to shift toward higher inflation as we move later into   the forecast period  Because of this change in relative risk, I would prefer to shorten our strides   and be more cautious as we take actions going forward  I have stated on previous occasions that   I believe we should front-load our policy actions and make our aggressive moves early  And     5/15/01     32   after four moves of 50 basis points each over the last four months, I believe a more cautious   approach may be in order this time  Thank you    Mr Chairman, I think we should pull back on the throttle today  Over   the past four and one-half months we’ve moved policy in a very aggressive way to an easier   position  In my view an additional 50 basis point cut will move us to an overly accommodative   position  We’ve added significant liquidity to the market  Now we should let it work through and   we should be far more cautious about further moves  I think we have an opportunity with a 25   basis point move and an asymmetric risk statement today to give the signal that you’re   suggesting  So I’m of the view that a 25 basis point cut, with retention of the statement that the   risk is weighted to weakness in output, is what we should do now  I certainly agree that the risk   of weaker growth continues to dominate over the risk of inflation for now  But a lot of easing is   in train  An additional 25 basis points would only continue the easing; it wouldn’t stop the easing   process  And policy, as we all know, works with a lag  Thus the relative risks have shifted since   our last meeting--though not to the point where the predominant risk is inflation, which is why I   think it is appropriate to reduce rates  My preferred approach would take us on a less aggressive   trajectory down and prepare the market for our acting in either direction    My suggestions are along the lines of President Minehan’s  I would   shorten the statement  "
6824,2001-06-26,HOENIG," Thank you This is just a clarifying question on Chart 8, the middle   panel In your discussion you suggested, I think, that the spark that created the movement down   in investment started with telecommunications and then moved over to real E&S spending other   than high-tech Did I hear you correctly when you were referring to the relationship of the high-  tech sector to the decline in other investment spending?   I ask because activity in the manufacturing sector was probably   declining even before the downturn in the high-tech sector  So I had it reversed in a sense I’m   just having a hard time following your theory exactly in terms of this downturn and I wonder   whether there are any implications if I disagree with you on that--if I don't think the tech sector   had much to do with this perhaps   I just wanted to make sure I heard it right   Mr Chairman, not a great deal has changed in the Tenth District  Our   economy does remain sluggish, as it was at the time of our May meeting  Manufacturing overall   remains in the doldrums  Capacity utilization continues to decline and plant managers say that   they are still working with inventories that they feel are too high  Firms are delaying some of   their expansion plans but the dichotomy among firms is interesting, reflecting somewhat the   contrasts mentioned in yesterday's discussion  A Corning plant in Oklahoma, which   manufactures optical fiber, has delayed additions to its capacity for obvious reasons  On the   other hand, one of our metal fabricators, while saying that the manufacturing industry is still in   recession, reports that they are beginning to see light at the end of the tunnel  They are seeing   some strengthening of orders, so they are more optimistic  That reflects, I think, a bit of the   contrast in the economy   Consumer spending has held up better than might have been expected, but the outlook   obviously remains quite uncertain in these times  While there are some signs of a rebound in     6/26-27/01 106   consumer confidence within the region, we are still seeing some cutbacks in discretionary   spending, especially in the consumption patterns of some of our higher income households   Residential construction has held steady but the demand for housing, based on recent   anecdotal data at least, is showing signs of slowing  Sales are down somewhat from a year ago    In most of our markets the inventory of unsold homes has increased and housing inflation in our   cities has slowed, especially in Denver where it had been most prominent  The picture is much   the same in commercial real estate  Construction is holding steady but there is some downward   pressure on prices and rents  Again, Denver is showing some increased problems, partly   reflecting their high-tech orientation, because Level 3, one of the companies building some of   these fiber optic networks, has laid off a considerable number of employees   The energy sector remains a strong factor in our economy  The rig count rose again in   May and is at a new eleven-year high, and drilling activity continues to be restrained to some   degree by a shortage of labor and equipment for that industry  Our agricultural economy remains   mixed; meat producers are doing well and grain producers are doing very poorly   As for the labor market, firms are finding it easier than it was a year ago to hire   workers From highly trained IT specialists to retail and other lower skilled workers, the market   has eased up The unemployment rate hasn't budged a whole lot, though, especially since our last   meeting  The proportion of business contacts reporting labor shortages has been about the same   recently as it was in March  Reflecting the sluggishness, wage pressures have eased somewhat in   our area and overall price pressures also have remained relatively subdued   Turning to the national situation, I have marked down my growth projections for the   near term but remain fairly optimistic, in line with the Greenbook, in terms of the longer run  I   now expect the economy to grow at a sustainable rate approximating the economy’s potential by     6/26-27/01 107   the end of the forecast horizon  At the same time, I've become more concerned about the   inflationary pressures that may follow  Price pressures should be contained for the time being  I   recognize that the current stance of policy has the potential to push up the underlying inflation   rate as we go forward   It is not surprising, of course, that the outlook for the US economy remains   pessimistic in the near term, which I think still reflects some of the lagged effects of tighter   monetary policy and higher energy prices from last year  And as we discussed yesterday, I   believe it also reflects a buildup of excess capacity in important sectors such as   telecommunications and technology as well as a significant slowdown in foreign economies   In this environment, Mr Chairman, our accommodative policy has begun to reverse   the effects of our previously tighter policy and has had an impact on certain sectors in terms of   increasing demand in those areas  It is not clear, though, that further easing can immediately   reverse the effects of some of the other factors that I've just mentioned  Of course, the question   we now confront centers on whether we should ease further to better assure recovery or whether   in a determined effort to turn things around we may be easing too much and therefore risk   overshooting our longer-run goals   I acknowledge that it is difficult to be patient in an environment of rising employment   and slowing growth but that, of course, is what I am suggesting here  I keep coming back to the   following logic  By most estimates the real fed funds rate is below the equilibrium long-term   rate, and policy is by that definition accommodative; additional fiscal stimulus is in process and   will have an impact on the economy later this year and next; monetary policy works with a lag, as   others have said here today, which suggests that our recent easing moves have yet to be fully   experienced; they will have increasing influence later this year and next  I admit that we don't        6/26-27/01 108   know if we are being too accommodative, but the risks of that are certainly increasing  I'm   concerned that if we follow a policy in which rates are set much below current levels and they   remain there over the next year, we risk over-stimulating the economy in 2002 and we risk higher   inflation in 2002 and beyond Thank you   Don, in terms of the press statement that you talked about at the end of   your remarks  What do you think the market's reaction would be to a statement that noted the   downside risks but also indicated that we might be finished easing, depending on the data that     6/26-27/01 133   accumulate over the next several weeks?  I don't want to put words in Bill Poole's mouth but I’m   thinking about his suggestion that we say we’re inclined to wait with regard to judgments about   our future policy course   But don't you think there's a possibility that the message is that if the   incoming data were weak, we would evaluate that, especially if we had a balance of risk   statement weighted to the downside?  Isn't that just as likely--or perhaps more likely, I think--to   be the real message?   Mr Chairman, if I had my preference, I would have stopped the   easing process by now I would not go the quarter point  But, given your recommendation,   including the third part of your recommendation on signaling that we are most likely done, as I   understand it, unless there is significant new information, I can accept your recommendation  I     6/26-27/01 150   would add that I would like to see more of an explanation in our press statement, but since I   argued last time for a shorter statement, I will not push that point here today  [Laughter]  "
6853,2001-08-21,HOENIG," Mr Chairman, the Tenth District’s economy continues weak    Manufacturing remains in a slump in our area  According to our Bank’s most recent   manufacturing survey, activity declined again in July, moving well below year-ago levels    Inventories were also down substantially and a significant fraction of firms said they plan to   continue reducing inventories over the next six months  One bright spot is that the capital   spending projections did not deteriorate further     Consumer spending held steady in most of our District, as it has elsewhere in the   nation I continue to hear that consumers are becoming increasingly value conscious, though, so   discount stores are enjoying the stronger sales at the expense of other retailers  Residential   construction remains stable  Home sales are solid in most of our cities, although inventories of   unsold homes are creeping up Throughout the District there is weakness in the demand for   high-priced homes, though, and that is telling in some areas, particularly Denver  Commercial   real estate is showing signs of softening further  Office vacancy rates continue to rise in both   Denver and Kansas City, as businesses in both cities cut back on their expansion plans  There is   still a substantial amount of construction in the pipeline but the surge in vacancies is causing   developers to have some second thoughts     The energy sector remains a bright spot in our District  Even with the recent easing in     8/21/01 35   oil and gas prices, the rig count grew again in July  Labor markets have eased further  Layoff   announcements remain high, although they have come down a bit from earlier in the year    Reflecting the sluggish economy, inflationary pressures continue to subside in our area  Only   one of the employers we contacted said that it had granted above-normal wage increases   recently   As mentioned earlier by President Stern, conditions in the farm economy have   improved  That sector has been helped not only by some price increases but also by the recent   package that was approved for aid to the farm industry  Our projections now show that farm   income on the national level will increase about 9 percent this year, so some spending should   accompany that     Let me turn to my views on the national outlook  It is noteworthy that while we   continue to adjust our outlook--both the value and the time horizon--our staff as well as the   Greenbook staff still see as the most likely outcome that the economy should strengthen toward   potential over the next few quarters  Therefore, it strikes me that the issue is  Do we continue   with the current easy policy or do we ease further at this time?  I say policy is easy as we might   measure it, using monetary growth and the real fed funds rate compared to the equilibrium   natural rate that has been estimated  I would add that from what I can tell, our last generation of   experiences suggests that it takes about four to five quarters from the start of an easing period for   the easing to have an impact that we can see in terms of GDP growth     This suggests that we are probably on track toward eliminating the cyclical   weaknesses that now exist But in our view of the outlook, we obviously have some rather   serious risks The incoming data are clearly mixed and it’s hard to do nothing when the data are   mixed  I would add that the foreign sector is weaker--and weaker than many had anticipated--    8/21/01 36   and that most certainly adds to the downside risks for us to consider  I think all this is   complicated to a degree by the difficulty of separating out the structural factors in our economy   that are weak--and will stay weak regardless of our short-term monetary policy--from the   cyclical factors So in some ways our difficulty today is to determine whether we are being--if I   may use this term--cyclically correct  [Laughter]   Mr Chairman, I think the proposal you put on the table is quite   reasonable and I would support it Let me make a couple of comments  I do think our policy is   accommodative right now and it will become more accommodative with this move  But in my   view it’s not just the markets that are nervous and uneasy  Main Street is also nervous and   uneasy Your proposed action serves to address that to an important degree and, therefore, I am   supportive of it I do agree with those who are concerned about the lags and about our ability to   reverse course at the appropriate time; that isn’t a science but in part it involves our recognizing     8/21/01 79   when to do so We have to trust that we’ll be able to do that at that time  So I’m very supportive   of your recommendation at this point   One thing I have to say, with due deference to Al Broaddus, is that I do not want an   expanded statement  I argued hard for the statement to be shorter and I think it should stay that   way In my view the market has to recognize our stance by our actions and by what is happening   in the economy--that is the best way to get the message across--and to react to that information at   the appropriate time    I’m flattered  "
6873,2001-09-13,HOENIG," Mr Chairman, this is Tom Hoenig  I would say that before   the events on Tuesday the situation here was generally continuing as it had been, with   manufacturing slow and no signs whatsoever of any improvement in business fixed   investment  I think these events have changed that whole outlook  I believe, as Gary   Stern and others have said, that we are dealing with a psychological factor  We have put   enormous amounts of liquidity into the market, and that’s what we should continue to do    If we gather information tomorrow and into Monday as the markets open and decide that   we should do something on the funds rate, I think 50 basis points would be the   appropriate amount because of the circumstances  I would have no problem with that I   don’t know that we have to rush to do it today or tomorrow, but I think we have to be   ready to act And if we are going to make a move, in my view it should be a fairly   significant move Thank you     9/13/01 16  "
6893,2001-09-17,HOENIG," Mr Chairman, this is Tom Hoenig and I’m on board with this   completely   That’s a good point  "
6912,2001-10-02,HOENIG," Mr Chairman, the economy in the Tenth District, like that for   the nation, remains sluggish  Some people might say it was mixed at best prior to the   events of September 11th Of course since then, as we’ve heard around this table, the   anxiety and uncertainty that was already in the economy took an even greater hit and   caused the outlook to worsen noticeably, as reflected in the Greenbook as well as in our   staff and the Blue Chip forecasts    Let me give you some data on the District  These developments are consistent   with the national news because many of the reports are from firms operating nationally    First of all, the manufacturing survey we conducted in July was quite negative  Our   dispersion index was minus 28  When we took a look at the August survey, we became   somewhat hopeful because that negative had become much smaller, moving to minus 7    But in September--and part of the survey was clearly done after September 11th --that   index went back to minus 16  So we saw a big switch in sentiment in terms of the   prospects looking forward   On the transportation side, I would make a couple of points As for the   airlines, our experience is the same as others have talked about  Boeing, which has     10/2/01 43   operations in Wichita, has announced significant layoffs  But as a side comment, Cessna,   which also operates there, has a backlog on orders for corporate aircraft  And that   backlog is growing, apparently reflecting increased demand for fractional ownership as   the desire to find alternative air transportation is starting to take hold   Let me talk for just a minute about the trucking industry  Bill Poole mentioned   a firm in that sector  In Kansas City we also have a large nationally operating trucking   company that does a lot of shipping for manufacturing firms  We recently had a   conversation with their people, and they said the firm’s business is down markedly  It   was down noticeably prior to September 11th and since then it has only gotten worse, as   their customers have pulled back  Their comment to me was that they are now operating   at 1985 levels of business So, they have had very significant reductions in volume and   have just announced sizable layoffs They have about 10,000 drivers and have laid off a   significant number of them as well as staff in their corporate operations     Looking at the railroad industry, we have a major railroad operating north-   south from Kansas City and then into Mexico  Their volumes in and out of Mexico have   dropped noticeably and their order books have dropped as well  Previous to September   11th they had initiated layoffs, and there are no signs of rehiring at this point      As for the retail sector, like others we’ve talked to many retailers  They have   reported a fairly persistent return to the pre-September 11th pattern in terms of sales But   the experience is very mixed as they look to the Christmas season  Some are saying   they’ve pulled back dramatically  One, as was reported in the national press, followed   through completely in their Christmas orders as their sales were up 25 percent  So we’ve   heard very mixed reports on the retail side      10/2/01 44   Energy, which for us is a two-edged sword, is also a mix  Because prices are   down that’s good in the general sense  But it also means that we’ve seen a real drop-off   in activity in our region; it’s down about 10 percent by our estimate   Generally, activity in our region is slower  The change in psychology is   noticeable, in terms of the effects   Looking to the national situation and policy, I would say that we also see the   economy recovering eventually  But given the psychology and the uncertainty,   forecasting the timeline for the recovery is exceedingly difficult  I wouldn’t pretend to   have a better forecast than anyone else in this room; mine would be no better than Dave   Stockton’s, for sure   Another factor mentioned here that I think is an important consideration is   fiscal policy We don’t know how that’s going to evolve  Trying to pull all this together,   I would be supportive of an easing--pick the amount  I think an easing step would   recognize that at least for the next several months the downside risks are probably going   to weigh very heavily on our economy Our experience in other instances, as people have   pointed out, is that we tend to underestimate the downside  In my view that is a real   possibility in this case as well So I would be more inclined to err on the side of easing    We can reverse the easing should fiscal policy be overly stimulative or should the   economy turn up, and I believe the market would understand that  I think we are in a   good position in that regard So overall a case for easing policy can be well supported, if   that should be deemed necessary here  Thank you   I support your recommendation  I would make just a couple   of quick comments that relate to the chart we were talking about a minute ago  One way   I looked at that was to ask the question Going forward, which mistake do we most want   to avoid?  Given the fragility and the psychology of the market, I think we most want to   avoid not appearing to be willing to take this action  So what you propose is exactly what   I want Second, I would like to say ditto to what the Vice Chairman said earlier  I   expect--and maybe hope--that we will have to reverse this easing move  But I think the   market is already thinking about that  We don’t need to say it  And it is probably better   if our statement is shorter rather than longer  Thank you   Oh, you’re very welcome!  [Laughter]  "
6936,2001-11-06,HOENIG," Mr Chairman, the economy in the Tenth District has not really   deteriorated since our last meeting, but that’s not saying much since it is considerably weaker than it   was before the events of September 11th Layoff announcements have subsided somewhat but   remain significantly higher than before the attacks  The composition of the job cuts being   announced also has shifted in the last month, with more now outside the airline, aircraft   manufacturing, and travel industries in our region  District manufacturing remains in a slump but it   does not appear significantly weaker than last month  Outside of autos, consumer spending has not   recovered from the initial fall after the attacks and retailers in many areas are very much worried   about the upcoming holiday season  The convention and hotel business has not returned to normal   either, due not only to continued concerns about safety and travel delays but also to cost cutting by   businesses under earnings pressure  Housing activity has slowed in much of the District, especially   in the high-end sector and particularly in Kansas City and Denver Those cities are also being hit   with slowdowns associated with layoffs in the high-tech sector  These layoffs also are increasing   concerns about commercial real estate  We see a lot of subleased space emptying out right now      11/6/01 45   And though Realtors are prone to point out that it’s not nearly as bad as in the last recession, they are   in fact worried   Let me say a bit more on manufacturing  Preliminary results from our Bank’s latest   survey of manufacturers show that production was about as weak in October as it was in September    Our firms are more pessimistic about the future than they were in the previous month  For example,   the six-month-ahead production index was down about 6 points in the survey  Among other   forward-looking indicators, the capital spending index fell about 5 more points and the inventories of   raw materials index also declined  So, looking forward, there is quite a bit of pessimism in the   manufacturing sector     Let me mention the energy industry  It has eased further since our last meeting  The   District’s rig count is now down about 25 percent from the decreased level in July, as the steep fall   in natural gas prices since the winter has rendered some marginal wells unprofitable Spot prices   have turned back, as you know, and we’re at about the 350 MCF level, which is a level that at least   will sustain activity at about where it is now     In agriculture, prices have dropped in the cattle industry, as you know, partly because of a   drop-off in restaurant demand after the September 11th attacks but also because there is a large   inventory in the feed lines Crop prices also have been weak, although there’s reason for a little   more optimism there with storage levels not as high as they were a year ago  Overall, business   conditions in the District are generally poor   Turning to the national economy, I would agree with those who say we are in a recession    As for the outlook, while our forecast differs in some ways from the Greenbook, I would say that in   terms of the outcome it’s a matter of degree, not substance  In that context, though, I think it’s   important to look at two time frames  One is the immediate future--that is, the fourth quarter--which     11/6/01 46   will be negative and will remain negative as we move toward the first quarter of next year  The   other is the intermediate term--the first half of next year and into the second half--where the outlook   is more optimistic in both the Greenbook and, as others have said, in forecasts by private economists   as well That’s due importantly to a very stimulative monetary policy, fiscal policy that is   stimulative and should be more stimulative as we go forward, and to the fact that energy prices have   fallen significantly   In terms of policy, I think we need to be very careful, as we always are, but our task is   particularly difficult now In that context I’ll say just a couple things in summary  Regardless of the   funds rate, the fourth quarter will likely be negative and there’s nothing we can do about that today    With a significant amount of stimulus already in play, the economy should recover in the first or   second quarter of next year, and there’s probably not a whole lot we can do about the timing of that   recovery at this stage I would also point out that we tend to get very nervous when we have taken   actions and we’re not seeing a turnaround, and I think we need to be very careful and patient in such   periods So, I can’t help wonder if we shouldn’t pause, knowing the downside risks are very serious   as we look to the future, and watch events develop Thank you   Don, doesn’t arguing for a 50 basis point cut, on the grounds that the   economy may be worse than we thought likely, lead to arguing for an even larger cut because we   ought to do all we can now given the limited inflation risks from such an action?  You didn’t   mention making no change in the funds rate, but that would say that we reacted very strongly after   the crisis--which I agree is what we should have done--and are awaiting the effects of those actions,   which haven’t even come into play yet  But the rationale for a 50 basis point move is that we are so   fearful that we think we should make a large cut  It strikes me that that argues for an even greater   cut given the uncertainty and the lack of inflation risk from that   May I ask one other question?  With a 50 basis point move, in your   opinion are we going to affect the markets’ expectations going forward?  Will those expectations be   completely revised and instead of 75 basis points of ease on the horizon from where we are will they   talk about another 75 basis points from where we would be if we were to go with a larger cut?   Thank you   May I ask you a question?   I would appreciate your opinion on this  By going with a 50 basis point   change, are we likely to foster expectations, not just in financial markets but in the economy more   generally, that we will do at least another 25 basis points and will that induce people to hold back   because they anticipate further easing?             Mr Chairman, I will take your lead on this  But I also want to express a   differing view in the sense that while our economy obviously had a terrible shock, we have taken   very aggressive and I think appropriate action and monetary policy is now in an accommodative   position Some time has to pass before we will see an upturn, even with this accommodative   position, and I believe it will take place  I have confidence in the future  In my view the US   economy is quite different from Japan’s in terms of its soundness and its ability to recover from the   shock So I would be comfortable with no change or a 25 basis point change today  I think we are   raising expectations with this move of 50 basis points  People are going to be making decisions now     11/6/01 88   in the anticipation that there will be more ease to come and I think there is a risk to that as far as the   economy goes as well  I will certainly follow your lead on this  These are difficult times and I   realize it’s hard to know the right answer  But I think we could afford to be more patient and let the   flow of time work  "
6962,2001-12-11,HOENIG," Mr Chairman, economic activity in the Tenth District is likely to be lower   again in this quarter The manufacturing sector remains in a slump and labor markets are soft    However, the consumer sector shows signs of having turned a corner In our opinion, housing,   consumer spending, and auto sales are pointing up  We interpret these data as suggesting that   economic activity in the Tenth District may be at or near its bottom     12/11/01 34    More specifically, the Bank’s November manufacturing survey found that production was   lower than a year ago, capital spending continued to decline, and firms were not yet done paring   inventories On the positive side, though, the weakness is less than it was last month  The year-over-  year decline in production was not quite as great as in October and was significantly less than in July   when the manufacturing slump appeared to be at its steepest  In fact, some of the anecdotal reports   that we’ve received recently from a number of our directors suggest that they are seeing a pickup in   orders and actually are talking about hiring additional workers     Having said that, the labor markets have eased and are continuing to ease in the District  In   our latest labor market survey, only a quarter of the firms reported any difficulty hiring or retaining   workers, and that’s the lowest percentage in our survey’s history  However, while unemployment rose   in October, initial unemployment claims fell in November and layoff announcements in November   were the lowest we’ve seen this year   Consumer spending in the region has held up better than many people expected  Mall   traffic was healthy immediately after Thanksgiving, and sales during the first 10 days of the holiday   season were up modestly over a year ago in most places  And the anecdotal data we’ve gotten have   pointed predominantly toward fairly strong consumer sales  Residential construction and home sales   rebounded from the drop-off after the terrorist attacks  As in the case of retail sales, the lower end of   the market is doing noticeably better than the higher end  Home sales in Denver were not as far below   year-ago levels in November as they were in September or October, despite mounting job losses in   that city On the negative side, however, Realtors throughout the District say sales of high-end homes   remain very soft   Energy activity has fallen since our last meeting  Conditions in that sector have been a bit   diverse in the District, with Oklahoma showing a fairly noticeable decline in activity because of their     12/11/01 35    higher costs of extracting gas from their resources and Wyoming actually seeing a continued high   level of activity because of their lower costs  Price pressures in the District are in fact very minimal as   we see it   Turning to the national economy, Mr Chairman, my views have only strengthened since the   last meeting  I still believe it is helpful to split the outlook into two time frames, the very near term   and the intermediate term or second half of next year  Within these two time frames, I think growth   will decline in the current quarter, turn around probably late in the first or in the second quarter of next   year, and be more robust in the second half, which is very similar to the Greenbook outlook  For this   quarter and the first quarter of next year the economy, as I said, will remain weak  But my point is   that there’s not much we can do about that today  As for the intermediate term, growth in the second   half of next year appears likely to be relatively strong without requiring further action on our part    Like the Greenbook, I expect growth in the second half to be close to 4 percent  The factors   generating this growth have been noted elsewhere and I’ll just highlight them    Monetary policy, in my view, is accommodative and is contributing to strengthening   demand  Fiscal policy right now is stimulative and could become more so in the future  Energy costs   are declining, and the contribution from the change in inventories should begin to be positive in the   first or second quarter of next year  Certainly, there are risks to consumer and business confidence   that we have to be mindful of, and the weakness in foreign economic growth is also worthy of note    With our current policy stance, which is accommodative, the consensus forecast--both inside and   outside the Federal Reserve--seems to be for stronger growth in the second half of next year  Finally,   it seems to me that we should not take actions now on the basis of events or shocks that we cannot   anticipate or even assign probabilities to today  Thank you   Don, let me see if I can ask a question on interest rate volatility  I observed   that after we moved the last time, futures funds rates actually went up    Right   New information that brought it up, okay  But they are now higher   Secondly, assuming that we have an easy policy now and also assuming that if we have an easy policy,   it would be better to have less volatility in interest rates than more volatility, are we not risking, by   moving the funds rate down, increasing the volatility of interest rates?   Raise them more than you otherwise would   Mr Chairman, I really think we ought to stay where we are  A 2 percent   fed funds rate is stimulative  We’ve cut the rate 450 basis points this year, which is very aggressive   for us, and 150 basis points of that has been done since September 11th We are seeing some signs of   improvement and not all of the stimulus has come into play yet  While I recognize that inflation is not   an immediate issue, and I appreciate that, I still think we need to take a little longer-run view at this   time  So, I have to say I agree with Gary Stern’s comments  "
6988,2002-01-29,HOENIG," Thank you, Mr Chairman  Our District economy in terms of the level of   activity is still relatively weak  But as others have said about their Districts, the signs are   growing that the situation is likely to improve, and there is a great deal more optimism among   manufacturers and businesses operating in the region  Turning to manufacturing for a minute,   the level of activity in that sector remains low  Our Bank’s latest manufacturing survey found   that production was down again in December after improving somewhat in November    Employment, new orders, and capital spending were again low in December relative to a year   ago   But importantly in my view, firms have become considerably more optimistic about the   future Many more of them are predicting a pickup in business and actually are seeing some   early signs of improvement in orders  So, looking forward, I think the situation is quite   encouraging In terms of our manufacturing survey, the six-months-ahead index for production   climbed fairly significantly  Granted, the rise was from a low level, but the index almost   doubled The new orders index more than doubled, and raw materials inventories as well as   finished goods inventories increased rather significantly according to the survey  So, there is a   fairly strong positive attitude about the future among manufacturers  Anecdotally speaking, I   talked with several manufacturers who seemed very pleased with the inquiries they’re getting   and the orders that are now being placed Moreover, they were saying almost uniformly that   their inventory levels and those of their customers are such that they are hiring or intending to   hire people again So there’s a great deal of positive news there, recognizing, though, that these   are improvements from a low level   As for consumer spending in our region, the story is very similar to what you’ve heard   from others  Retailers throughout our District were very pleased on balance with the holiday        January 29-30, 2002 Page 92 of 194  season They talked some about the extensive discounting, and they expressed concerns about   the pressure that has placed on their profits  Still, they are very positive about the volume of   sales Auto sales, like elsewhere, were very strong  There is some concern about used car sales   and about financing related to earlier leases A fairly large distributor in the Denver region told   us that each car coming back in on a lease has about a $5,000 write-down that someone has to   absorb So they are a little worried about the impact that will have   The energy sector has slowed Obviously, with prices coming down, the level of activity   has backed off considerably throughout the District, more so in the Oklahoma area than in the   Wyoming area, though activity in Wyoming is still down  Labor markets continue to be fairly   easy in terms of the ability to hire workers  It’s still rather easy to find new employees, and there   are no real signs of wage pressures that anyone is talking to me about  The farm economy is   legislation-dependent, so we’ll have to see how that develops  But overall, as I said, there are   signs of improvement    Looking at the national picture and comparing our outlook with that of the Board staff,   we’re generally in line with the Greenbook forecast  We see a little slower rebound as we get   into 2002, but activity picks up later, and for the year as a whole our forecast is about the same as   the Greenbook’s One thing I consider important is that, as others have pointed out, the balance   of risks is shifting The risks are becoming more balanced, though I’m not saying that they are   balanced at this point And I think it is a fact that we continue to have a very accommodative   monetary policy, which should be a positive factor for growth as we get further into 2002 and   beyond Thank you   Mr Chairman, I support your recommendation   Given this discussion, I believe as Al does that things have changed here    But I think releasing the vote and identifying who dissents without context is counterproductive    I think it is harmful As you said, we have a consensus; we have someone who disagrees with it,   and the consensus carries  That consensus is really the message of the FOMC  And to have   “noise,” as someone characterized it, without any explanation is not better transparency  Perhaps   it does lead to more of a slippery slope, but I really don’t see how we can go this way without   releasing the minutes a lot sooner than we do now because that’s the only way we can get   dissents into the context of the whole discussion  That would be helpful, whereas just to disclose   the vote and indicate that we had a dissent but not say why is counterproductive in my opinion  "
7015,2002-03-19,HOENIG," Mr Chairman, if my memory serves me right, I think the last time we   talked about this I favored as a “least worst” choice going with the Ginnies before going with the   foreign sovereign debt But I have a lot of sympathy for what Al said regarding the downside of   the Ginnies Nevertheless, I still would go in that direction  The one thing that I am concerned   about relates to the type of problems that often arise by going ahead piecemeal on something    What I’d like to do is to hold off as long as possible and take a look at all the options again,   maybe at our meeting next January  We could have this as a special topic then and look at each   of these options together in context  By then perhaps the ACF will be further along and we can              March 19, 2002 Page 22 of 117  make some comparisons  I’d rather do that than say that the least worst option now is to go with   Ginnies and build in that direction only to find that they may not be the best choice in the long   run and then try to back out of using them Other than that, I agree that our work on   contingencies has to come first and that we can put this off until that is done, knowing what our   risks are and knowing what our least worst choice is after that   President Moskow asked my questions  Thank you   Thank you, Mr Chairman  In looking at economic activity in the Tenth   District, we have to separate out Colorado a bit from the rest of the region  Excluding Colorado,   we are seeing fairly good signs of a turnaround  Layoff announcements have subsided,   consumers continue to spend, and housing activity is solid  Moreover, business confidence   appears to be inching back up in most of the District  Colorado continues to contract because of   some real weakness in the telecom sector, which continues to be plagued by excess capacity and   some rather tough price competition   Let me talk a little about the manufacturing sector  It is improving and, based on our   surveys, there are signs of greater optimism about the future  The Bank’s latest manufacturing   survey found that production and shipments strengthened a bit in February  In addition,   optimism about future production and orders continued to build  For the first time in many   months, firms in the manufacturing sector expect to be hiring workers in the near future rather   than laying them off  For now, capital spending remains below year-ago levels, but I’m hearing   a lot of conversations about how manufacturers are looking at taking advantage of the new tax     March 19, 2002 Page 57 of 117  law It is extremely interesting to them in terms of how they look at their capital investment   plans and the timing of any future investment  So it is on their minds at this point     Commercial real estate in the District remains weak  Vacancies are high in most of our   markets, putting some downward pressure on rents  Denver is clearly the hardest hit, with   realtors saying that there may be at least a two-year inventory in that city, so they are a bit   pessimistic right now  Consumer spending and housing activity are generally solid in the region    Apart from a few high-end stores, retailers say their sales have been improving and are   somewhat above year-ago levels  And home sales have also strengthened  Starter homes are   doing very well, and even the high-end area is starting to see some activity  Energy activity has   stabilized after declining through the second half of last year  The District’s rig count is the   lowest in two years, and coal prices have come down fairly sharply, making it hard even for low-  cost producers in Wyoming to be making a profit right now  Labor markets are slack, although   there are signs suggesting that employment is stabilizing  We continue to experience a shortage   of nurses in our region and a limited availability of workers in a few skilled areas, but employers   are still able to find help without very much difficulty  At our Okalahoma City board meeting, a   director who has a nationwide temporary help agency said that activity at the firm had picked up   significantly across the country So there are some signs of a pickup in demand for temporary   help Price pressures without question remain low across the region  And the ag sector is   waiting for the farm bill   Let me turn to the national economic outlook  Our assessment is really quite similar to   the Greenbook’s, namely that growth should be above trend beginning this quarter and continue   through next year The economic factors generating this forecast are clear, and I’ll only mention   them  First, monetary policy is clearly stimulative, with the real fed funds rate in the     March 19, 2002 Page 58 of 117  neighborhood of zero Fiscal policy has been stimulative and has become even more so recently    Energy prices remain relatively low, although we are seeing some increases in that area  And the   inventory adjustment is contributing to growth   Having cited these facts, I have a couple of observations—or maybe I should call them   concerns First, I think the likelihood that the rate of output growth will be greater than trend this   year is high and increasing; if I were to put a number on it, I’d say the probability is above   50 percent  While the output gap is positive, the probability that the gap will close sooner rather   than later is increasing, not decreasing  My second point is that the current fed funds rate, as   others have said, is clearly below equilibrium, and I would say perhaps significantly below   equilibrium  At its current level, it is generating substantial amounts of liquidity and, therefore,   setting up conditions that I think will give rise to future economic imbalances  Moreover, taking   into account Dave’s lesson number 4, it is creating conditions that could generate higher   inflation, say, twelve to eighteen months from now, based on the length and variability in the   lags So, in my view these are some of the factors we should talk about in the policy round  I   would offer one other thought I think moving sooner, maybe even today, may mean that we will   have to move less later  And I believe that would be very favorable in the long term for the US   economy  Thank you   Mr Chairman, I certainly see a need to proceed as you’ve outlined   today, and I would support that I would add, though, that I think we could continue to see some   fairly strong data and perhaps some data surprises on the upside, given what we’ve experienced   recently  So I believe that having the accommodative language in the statement is very   important  And in my view the possibility of an intermeeting move of 25 basis points should be   a possibility that is out there  If the market understanding is that we’re not planning to do   50 basis points but that we may be moving sooner than at the May meeting, I think that could be   very healthy for us I hope the press statement doesn’t foreclose that possibility   I see where this proposal comes from, and I understand it  I have a bit of   sympathy for what Cathy was saying in the sense that releasing the minutes earlier and delaying   the disclosure of the vote until those minutes are released made a lot of sense to me  That’s   because I still believe that putting the dissents in context helps  I know your committee   discussed that option; I read the memo  I don’t know how the lawyers would interpret it if we   got into an argument, but I think a case can be made for delaying the release of the vote until the   minutes are available  And the delay we’ve talked about is only two weeks, which is not an   unreasonable period But having said that, I think we are in a bind as far as releasing the vote at     March 19, 2002 Page 103 of 117  some point  So if we don’t want to release the minutes sooner, I don’t think we have any choice   but to release the vote after the meeting  "
7038,2002-05-07,HOENIG," Thank you, Mr Chairman  The Tenth District economy is showing clear   signs of improvement, although the recovery still is a bit sluggish in Colorado  I would also say   that the manufacturing sector is showing clear signs of a turnaround  Our latest manufacturing   survey found that production and shipments strengthened in April, moving closer to year-ago   levels Also, for the second month in a row, optimism about future activity was close to survey   highs Reflecting this increased optimism, more firms are expecting to increase employment and   capital spending in coming months, although the capital spending is further out in time in the   opinion of many respondents  Most of these signs of a turnaround come from durable goods   manufacturers who, after having suffered a very steep decline, appear to be enjoying a stronger   recovery than other firms    Retail spending and housing activity have been holding up fairly well in our region    Retailers are cautiously optimistic about future sales as well  And homebuilding is higher than a   year ago except in Colorado But even there, home sales in Denver firmed a bit in April, and   realtors continue to report strong demand for entry-level priced homes  Commercial real estate,         May 7, 2002 49 of 81  on the other hand, remains in a slump, with very few signs of an imminent turnaround in that   sector Office vacancies continue to climb, and they climbed rather rapidly in the first quarter,   although we are hearing scattered reports of a pickup in leasing activity especially for smaller   businesses Public construction has helped make up for the slowdown in commercial   construction for much of the region  Energy activity also remains relatively sluggish in our area    Although oil prices have risen, our oil industry folks seem to be holding back and are more   concerned about reducing debt than expanding  The labor markets are generally slack, but they   appear to be stabilizing And as I reported last time, temporary employment is showing a steady   increase, as reported by one of our directors who has a national firm in that business  He feels   there is a very clear and strong upward trend in such employment Price pressures in the region   are subdued There is talk, though, in the manufacturing sector about trying to increase prices to   get profits moving But, of course, those manufacturers also say that right now they don’t have   the pricing power to do that  The farm economy is wholly dependent upon the recent farm bill,   which I don’t need to talk about here   Turning to the national economy, recent data releases continue to point to a recovery, as   we’ve described here The recovery probably will be modest by historical standards just as the   recession was modest by historical standards  I continue to expect the economy to grow at about   3½ to 4 percent for the year as a whole  As I think about it, one thing that is helpful, at least to   me, is to break economic developments down into their structural and cyclical components    Structurally, the US economy remains strong  With remarkable strength in productivity during   this recession, we can be more confident in an assessment of faster long-term productivity   growth, which was talked about earlier We have seen once again the remarkable resilience and   flexibility of the US economy from last autumn into the spring  Finally, our long-term                  May 7, 2002 50 of 81  commitment to low and stable inflation has served us well in terms of pushing up the potential of   the economy  Cyclically, it appears that the US economy is in fact recovering  The slower­  than-normal recovery, as I said, I think reflects a relatively mild recession  I would submit that a   slower-than-normal recovery is not necessarily a surprise, given that the slowdown was also   mild  The factors behind the recovery are, of course, that monetary policy remained stimulative   and fiscal policy was stimulative, especially with recently enacted programs  Moreover, the   continuing inventory adjustment should at least contribute somewhat to growth as we move   forward, although perhaps not as much as we’ve seen recently  Of course, I do understand the   risks I would in fact suggest that they are about balanced  The continued pessimism of CEOs is   a downside risk, and it does raise questions about capital spending going forward, which is a   concern to me  But there are also upside risks—in particular, stronger foreign growth, stronger   productivity, and our resilient US economy   Turning to the inflation outlook for the immediate future, I think the most likely outcome   is for stable or even slightly lower core inflation this year  Most measures of core inflation are   stable or down The median CPI is the one exception, and that is up fairly noticeably    Nonetheless, I do want to say a couple of things relative to the risks on this side  With policy   where it is today, I think we do have some risks of inflation and also some financial excess,   which in my view we need to keep in mind  Let me give you my three reasons for saying this    First, monetary policy is currently quite stimulative  No matter how one measures it, the real fed   funds rate is near zero or at zero  Second, monetary policy is likely to remain accommodative   for an extended period If we decide today to leave the fed funds rate at its current level, the real   fed funds rate will remain near zero or at zero for another seven weeks  If rates follow the path   suggested by futures markets, the real fed funds rate will likely remain below its equilibrium            May 7, 2002 51 of 81  level for the rest of this year and perhaps through early next year  And using the Greenbook’s   forecast, including its assumption of maintaining the funds rate at 1¾ percent through the third   quarter before gradually raising it, the real funds rate is likely to remain below equilibrium for at   least another year  Thus, according to the Greenbook, policy will still be accommodative in the   middle of next year, even though real GDP will have risen for seven quarters and the   unemployment rate will have fallen for perhaps three quarters, if those projections are correct    Third, while a funds rate below its equilibrium level is appropriate when the economy is in   recession, we must consider the risk of maintaining such an accommodative policy during the   economic recovery  With such a small output gap and a low real fed funds rate, we should not   dismiss the risk of higher inflation longer term as we get into next year  Thanks    I understand your recommendation, and I go along with it  "
7062,2002-06-25,HOENIG," Karen, I have a question on the dollar and capital flows  You broke out   the reduction in capital flows between equities and other US securities  Is there any insight that   you can share with us on that? Why the larger drop-off in bonds, other than perhaps inflation   fears?  Why, with a declining dollar, do we see capital flows slowing and bond issuance falling?   Fair enough   Thank you, Mr Chairman  The Tenth District’s economy has continued   to show signs of improvement over the past several weeks since our last meeting, although some   sectors obviously remain weak and businesses are still acting in a cautious manner Prospects for   District manufacturers actually have improved further though, with new orders rising above   year-ago levels for the first time since the end of 2000  Retail sales excluding autos remain   solid, with strong sales at both high-end stores and large discounters making up for somewhat   slow sales in other stores Home sales have continued strong in most of the District, and energy   activity has picked up rather noticeably in our region lately   Of course, not all signs are positive Layoff announcements were up in May and appear   to be up in June Auto sales weakened somewhat, and commercial real estate remains in a slump   in our area Also, while optimistic about future sales, District manufacturers appear reluctant to   hire enough new workers to meet the anticipated increase in demand  They are relying   extensively on temporary help, preferring to wait for further evidence of recovery before they   engage in significant workforce expansion Finally, several large District firms in the telecom,   agriculture, and energy trading businesses have experienced further deterioration in their   financial condition and credit ratings since our last meeting   On the inflation front, wage and price pressures remain mostly subdued, although   obviously we have seen higher steel prices and that has had some effect on a number of our   metal manufacturing companies   Turning to the national outlook, obviously recent economic releases have been mixed    Nevertheless, I do expect growth to be about 3½ percent this year and to rise to something over 4   percent next year The Board staff’s outlook is similar to my own second-quarter growth at   about 2 percent and second-half growth at about 3½ percent  I think the forces behind the     June 25-26, 2002 82 of 179  recovery are clear and have not changed all that much since our last meeting  That is,   productivity appears to remain basically sound, monetary policy—with the real fed funds rate   near zero—is stimulative, fiscal policy is stimulative, and the inventory adjustment is continuing    These factors are working to strengthen the economy and offset the downside risks to the   economy  Still, the downside risks are significant, and I acknowledge them  One is the   accounting scandal, which monetary policy really can’t do much about; another is the   geopolitical risk, which again we can’t do a lot about  But those risks are real, and they are   affecting psychology There is also a downside risk in capital spending, which has not picked up   as much as we perhaps would like to see  And that is still a risk in the future   Let me just say in acknowledging these risks that I still feel that policy remains extremely   accommodative  And I think we need to take a longer-term view of this  Every measure that the   staff has presented—every measure we have—suggests that the real federal funds rate is below   the natural rate by a significant margin  Let me clarify my policy position  I have not in the past   and I am not suggesting now that policy should be tight in any sense  The conditions aren’t at all   right for that I am suggesting only, and I think importantly, that we prepare to move to a less   accommodative position  I would say that for purposes of long-run price stability we are overly   accommodative, and we should begin to consider a longer-term strategy to move ourselves   toward—not to, but toward—a more neutral position And as others have indicated, we have an   opportunity after this meeting through your upcoming congressional testimony, Mr Chairman, to   begin to inform the markets of this need and to develop a strategy so that we don’t catch them off   guard as we necessarily move toward a more neutral policy   I support your recommendation  I do want to make one comment  I   agree with you that we have a lot of credibility in the market But I think a good part of that   credibility has been achieved because we have been open with the market  And what you’re   saying today is that we would have a balanced risk statement but we’re not quite sure the risks   are as balanced as the statement is going to say        June 25-26, 2002 127 of 179  My concern is, given where we are, that we’re sending the message that   the economy is going to grow and yet we’re holding the funds rate down at a very low level  I   think that deserves some explanation  That’s my point going forward  "
7092,2002-08-13,HOENIG," Mr Chairman, the Tenth District economy for the most part has   followed the national economy  After rebounding in the first half of the year, it has slowed   appreciably Layoff announcements rose noticeably in July and early August  Let me talk about   the manufacturing sector in our District, which appears for the most part to have improved since   last fall and winter But it also, in a sense, has topped off  Our July survey shows about the   same level of manufacturing activity as in June and, while firms are still optimistic about the         August 13, 2002 26 of 92  future, they also indicate that they’re cautiously optimistic  And that’s a bit of a change since the   spring Labor markets remain slack, with firms having no difficulty filling almost any position at   this point Retail spending and housing activity continue to hold up well  Retailers are generally   optimistic about future sales and are showing some willingness to build inventories  Auto sales,   as in the rest of the country, have responded to the financing incentives  And home sales and   construction remain solid on the retail side though, of course, office space is pretty much dead    Energy activity in the District actually remained strong, with the rig count holding on to earlier   gains However, there are some issues in Wyoming because energy firms have produced a lot of   natural gas but have no way of getting it out of the area  So that’s causing some pressures there    Price pressures remained subdued across the District  District manufacturers expect further   increases in materials costs, but they have no intimation that they can pass them on at this time     I want to talk briefly about the drought I know there is a drought generally in this   country, but it has been particularly severe in our part of the country  If you draw a line north-  south through the middle of Kansas and Nebraska, the area surrounding that line has been   enormously dry  In some parts of Kansas the residents consider themselves lucky to have had   almost three inches of rain since January 1 of this year  It shows in the soil I recently drove   through a good part of these areas in the District, and the picture is quite dramatic  Reservoirs in   Colorado are at anywhere between 20 and 60 percent of capacity in terms of their water levels    Dillon Lake, which some of you may know because the Interstate and the Eisenhower Tunnel are   near there, is reported to be between 50 percent and 60 percent of capacity  It looks like a wheat   bed in much of that extremely dry area  I talked with some of the agricultural people in   Colorado about the cattle situation Hay production, which is very important to them, is   somewhere in the range of 15 to 20 percent of normal  That puts them in a dilemma because            August 13, 2002 27 of 92  they need a lot of snow this winter and, if it materializes, then they can’t afford to feed the   livestock That’s why we have the liquidation of cattle inventory going on  In fact, cattle   auctions in some areas are being held seven days a week and there is no market  So the situation   is particularly dire there  As for land sales in the ranch area, as one major real estate dealer said   to me, the market is virtually dead  In sum, the drought is very severe  It’s as bad as in the   1950s and actually as bad as it was in the 1930s in much of this region  One likely impact of this   may be on fiscal policy, because as I understand it there is a fairly strong effort under way to   enact some type of bailout or support for stockmen in the western part of the United States    We’ll watch and see how that goes   Turning to the national economy, I’ll be relatively brief  We have no major   disagreements with the Greenbook  We also have revised down our forecast to below 3 percent,   for the reasons that others have delineated here  One point I do want to note, though, is that in   talking with contacts at major companies that are not investment grade but one level below that, I   am being told that credit standards have become tighter  One man in particular said that his   firm’s financial numbers—and they’re standing by their numbers—show pretty good   improvement in the past year  But even with that, when they’ve gone to their bank lenders to   discuss rolling over debt, they have been asked to show improved ratios before the banks will   renew those lines So in that sense credit standards have tightened quite noticeably     As for the outlook, I think growth will be slower but still positive  The reason for that is   the stimulus that continues to exist in this economy  We will watch that carefully, obviously    But we do look for somewhat less than 3 percent growth this year and into 2003  Thank you   I support your recommendation on leaving the rate unchanged  I, too,   have a slight preference for maintaining the balance of risk statement as it is  However, I   acknowledge that the risks have shifted Nevertheless, I still think, as we look at our projections         August 13, 2002 84 of 92  and the stance of both monetary and fiscal policy, that a lot of  stimulus remains and that will   carry the economy forward  But like others, I wouldn’t fall on the sword on this issue because of   all the uncertainties in the economy  On balance, though, I’d wait to see a little more evidence   before changing that balance of risks statement because it is going to change expectations about   future rate moves—although I agree that some good numbers would change expectations once   again for everyone I’d just make that comment       "
7118,2002-09-24,HOENIG," Thank you, Mr Chairman  The Tenth District has remained pretty much   in a holding pattern since our last meeting  It has maintained earlier gains but has shown no   further improvement since early in the summer Manufacturing activity was flat for the second   month in a row in August, after improving most of the year until then  In our Bank’s August   manufacturing survey, production and new orders both remained slightly below year-ago levels,   and firms are still cautiously optimistic about the outlook for six months from now  But that   optimism is not translating into any increased hiring or new capital spending  Firms are holding   back     September 24, 2002 59 of 115  Our District’s labor market remains generally slack, with firms having little difficulty   finding well-qualified workers  Fortunately, the announcements of job cuts have slowed in   August and so far in September  Consumer spending remains generally solid, though not quite   as strong as earlier in the summer  Retail sales were unchanged or down only slightly in most of   our areas Tourism in Colorado has fallen off but remains fairly good in the rest of our region   where it is important for income  Residential construction remains strong throughout the   District Home sales have also been solid, although inventories of unsold homes in the Denver   area have risen and that has been a subject of some press articles recently  Energy activity in the   District has edged down lately but still is fairly good  And price pressures, as you’ve heard is the   case elsewhere, remain quite muted in our region    Our farm economy is now in recession, due I think importantly to the widespread drought   that we’re experiencing and that I talked about briefly last time  Crop prices have rallied as   crops have withered, but farm income will drop sharply this year  Higher crop prices have not   offset reduced volume from crop losses in many areas of our region  In livestock, which is our   primary agricultural income source, the producers are booking rather sizable losses  Now, the   higher crop prices may mean reductions in government payments, but as you probably all are   aware, there is now talk about a supplemental aid package for that industry   Let me talk briefly about the national economy  The economic news, as has been pointed   out by others, is mixed  Consumer and business spending have been fairly robust, while   manufacturing output and employment have been generally weak In addition to weighing the   recent economic reports in this uncertain environment, I understand that part of our job is to   judge how the current opposing forces on the economy will eventually play out and to decide   what we should do about it Currently tending to push the economy forward, as others have        September 24, 2002 60 of 115  mentioned, is the stance of monetary and fiscal policy   Low interest rates, especially for   housing and autos, have led consumers to continue buying  Several factors, though, are holding   the economy back  Business spending remains sluggish due to the overhang of the surge in   investment that occurred in the late 1990s, as David pointed out  And for some sectors,   investment spending is going to remain sluggish for quite some time       Another factor that is keeping growth sluggish—and it’s an important one from the   comments I’ve heard here—involves, as President Santomero said, the headwinds of uncertainty    We don’t know if or when an attack on Iraq might come  We have no better idea about the   likelihood, the magnitude, or the nature of a future terrorist attack  We are feeling perhaps a   little better about the corporate scandals, but we don’t know where that stands  And in the face   of this Knightian uncertainty, the natural business response has been and is to hunker down, to   wait and see what develops, and to hold off on any major spending until we know more    Business individual after business individual has told me that story   That said, it’s interesting that in both the Greenbook and our own Bank’s projections we   still are anticipating GDP growth of 3 percent this quarter, 3½ percent next year, and 4 percent   into 2004 That is pretty much what we expected last time  I can’t help but wonder what the   outlook would be if this heavy hand of uncertainty were lifted  Of course, I recognize that we’re   unable to predict these other potential events, and we have to be prepared to act if they continue   to hold us down as they are now   I support both parts of your recommendation, Mr Chairman  As I said   earlier, it would be nice to see how this economy would be performing if we could lift this   heavy-handed uncertainty, but at the moment that is not an option  I think that does put us in the   position of having to watch the situation carefully  And if the economy doesn’t improve or if we   have a disruptive event, then we have to be prepared to move, whether in the intermeeting period   or at the next meeting   Mr Chairman, I think you should be prepared and willing to take   questions I think it serves a useful purpose of providing information  Obviously someone could   take what you say the wrong way, but that’s going to happen regardless  I think you’ll do more   good than harm  "
7143,2002-11-06,HOENIG," This follows up on Bill’s comment from a little different direction  In   light of the animal spirits discussion, the alternative scenario in the Greenbook labeled “lower   funds rate” seems to produce a fairly optimistic outcome  I don’t know if you adjusted your   model or just allowed it to run in that instance to get the reduction in unemployment and the   pickup in growth My concern is, given the overhangs in capital and the capacity issues, whether   that is really a very reasonable outcome to project  In the context of a weaker scenario, perhaps   we would find less of an effect from that action   Or not operating as strongly through them   Mr Chairman, the Tenth District economy has shown signs of slowing   since the last meeting  But most of our business contacts still remain relatively optimistic about   the future Job growth has been slow, and layoff announcements have picked up, after subsiding   through late summer Reflecting the weak labor market and the general climate of uncertainty,   consumers are spending less freely than they were earlier  Also new commercial construction   has halted, as has the recovery in manufacturing in our region  On a brighter note, housing   activity continues to hold up despite increasing concerns that the boost to demand from low   mortgage rates is nearing its end There’s no real sign of that yet           November 6, 2002 53 of 122  Let me speak just a little more about manufacturing  It has been flat, as I said, for four   consecutive months following a strong rebound earlier in the year  In the Bank’s October   manufacturing survey, production and new orders moved slightly above year-ago levels but that,   of course, reflected the depressed levels last year stemming from the effects of September 11    Still, firms are moderately optimistic about activity six months from now, and they continue to   project improvements     The District’s labor market does remain slack, and job growth slowed in most states   during the third quarter And layoff announcements increased somewhat noticeably in October   after declining a bit in both August and September     Let me talk a minute about consumer spending, which has eased somewhat  Retail sales   have edged down from earlier in the summer, as uncertainty and slowing job growth have taken   their toll Auto sales also have slowed since August, as some of the manufacturers have backed   away from zero percent financing only to reinstate it subsequently  I think the way one of our   major auto dealers described the interest rate environment for the auto industry is very   interesting He viewed the environment before September 11, as we eased rates, as comparable   to how he might imagine smoking marijuana, whereas now it seems as if those in the industry are   mainlining the drug  His point is that they can’t get away from the zero rate financing and are   even expanding on it I think that’s important to take note of     Looking at wage and price pressures, they remain largely subdued in the region  In an   informal survey we conducted just a week ago, firms said that wages likely will increase about   the same in 2003 as in 2002  And as others have noted, health insurance costs will go up much   more; it is one of the areas that employers are concerned about                    November 6, 2002 54 of 122  Briefly, the farm economy continues to be rather mixed  The weather conditions have   changed again, with rain delaying some harvesting  But I want to mention that the drought   conditions and the plunge in livestock cash receipts are expected to drive farm incomes down   significantly in our region as we look to 2003   Turning to the national economy, obviously recent data show the news to be mixed, as   others have pointed out Growth in this quarter is likely to be low, though I would suspect not   quite as low as in the Greenbook forecast  But I wouldn’t quibble over the difference  Looking   to the future, like the Greenbook I expect growth to pick up, returning to trend levels in the   second half of next year and to above-trend levels in 2004  I think it’s important to recognize   that this outlook obviously reflects the stimulative effects of fiscal and monetary policy currently   in place But I realize that we are facing some important and strong countervailing forces    Vacancy rates, capital overhang, and excess capacity in the high-tech industry have damped   investment spending as we’ve noted  This is a situation that monetary policy probably will not   be able to quickly or easily offset Perhaps more important are the forces of uncertainty  There   is the risk of a war with Iraq; its timing, duration, and so forth are an uncertainty  Terrorism is   an uncertainty And the uncertainty of just how the economy is performing in this kind of   environment has its own effect  This leads me to understand why there is discussion of further   interest rate cuts But, not unlike Al Broaddus, I would sound a cautionary note  I think further   cuts will in fact stimulate consumer and business spending, as Dave Stockton said, but perhaps   more marginally than the normal statistical models would suggest because of the issue of   uncertainty   It’s important also to realize that the positive effects on consumer spending will come   primarily as a result of consumers taking on added debt  Maybe it won’t be substantial in terms               November 6, 2002 55 of 122  of the imbalances that we talked about  But I believe it is important in the sense of increasing   their fragility for the future So I think part of our discussion on policy should address the issues   of long-term against short-term tradeoffs, given the high degree of uncertainty and related to that   the uncertainty of how our policy might affect outcomes going forward  Thank you   Mr Chairman, given the uncertainty in the economy, which you   described in your remarks, I would accept and in fact would support a move of 50 basis points if   we are going to move at all  And since we are dealing with the issue of uncertainty, I think   having a balanced risk statement is a prudent way to do it  So I support you in your   recommendation   Mr Chairman, I’m on board with the Ginnie Maes  I think it makes   sense I said that when we met in early 2001  I’m interested in a little more study on the ACF   issue Looking at the federal debt projections, the need for that kind of facility has been pushed   off, so I certainly recognize that we’re not in a rush  But I think it also is something we ought to   give more thought to and establish a time frame for further study  Maybe, as Bob Parry said,   twelve months or so is appropriate  In any event, it would be very helpful in my view to work   out some of the details should we come to a point where we want to look at the ACF alternative   more seriously   You asked about the foreign sovereign debt issue, and I don’t know that anyone has   commented on it I thought the inclination last time was not to go in that direction, partly for   political reasons and especially if Ginnie Maes proved workable or if we decided to keep the   ACF as an alternative So I would put the foreign sovereign debt contingency on hold as well   And I would like to add my kudos to the quality of the paper on the ACF  It was really   great In terms of addressing the technical questions that are outlined in that memo, which I   recognize are important, the staff wouldn’t necessarily have to come back to the Committee for   discussion But if you want our comments, we could send them to you   "
7168,2002-12-10,HOENIG," Mr Chairman, the Tenth District economy has shown some signs of   improvement since our last meeting, but I would say that the improvement is still very, very   modest, and I wouldn’t wish to overemphasize it  Manufacturing activity has firmed somewhat   over the last couple of months, and optimism in our surveys of manufacturers about the future   has increased as well And we are seeing some very modest signs that capital spending is   increasing   In our survey, the year-over-year index for production rose from minus 13 in September   to plus 3 in November  It’s the first time the index has been positive since October 2000, which   is good news as far as we’re concerned  In the survey we recently conducted, it is interesting   that, while about 40 percent of those we survey still are thinking about decreases in spending,   that’s actually less than last time  So in that sense it’s a positive note   Consumer spending actually has picked up after easing earlier in the fall  Both discount   stores and department stores reported that their sales increased in the first part of November and   that business was also better over the Thanksgiving weekend  But talking with retailers is to me   a bit like talking to ranchers in the sense that, while they said the situation was better, they’re still   very, very negative about the holiday season  The pessimism is due in part to the shortness of   the Thanksgiving to Christmas selling period  We’ll have to see how that turns out   Housing activity in our region also continues to hold up remarkably well  New starts and   resales are both fairly strong  Commercial real estate, on the other hand, is depressed—   particularly so in the Denver area  Vacancy rates are high, and there’s also leased space that         December 10, 2002 52 of 87  people would very much like to get rid of  Labor markets remain slack, and there are virtually   no wage pressures in our region Energy activity has edged up slightly in the October-November   time frame  And our farm economy is mixed, with ranching very depressed and other areas   doing well, based on the subsidies they’re receiving       Turning to the national economy, I would say that the picture is very similar to what we   are seeing in the region; the data are mixed  But a slight improvement seems to have occurred,   as others have noted, and I do agree with the Greenbook forecast  The downside risks are   obvious There’s uncertainty about whether consumer spending will hold up, especially given   the drop-off in auto sales, and about whether business fixed investment will continue to   strengthen, which is so important for the incipient recovery  And, of course, how well foreign   economies do also will influence the outcome   On the positive side, as has been noted, monetary policy is stimulative and has become   more so Fiscal policy is stimulative, and the likelihood that it will become more stimulative is   higher than it was a couple of months ago  And financial market conditions have improved since   our last meeting  So I think we are in a position where we can be a bit more optimistic, but we   really have to wait and see   Mr Chairman, I thought your comments were brilliant today, and I   support you [Laughter]  "
7195,2003-01-28,HOENIG,"  Mr Chairman, it’s late and some of my intended comments would repeat   what others have said, so I’ll be fairly brief  One point I would note is along the lines of Vice   Chairman McDonough’s comment on modeling human behavior  We have two models here,   and most of us probably can agree with some dimension of each model depending on the   circumstances  As I look at the models and at the circumstances, I find that my thoughts go to   the Chairman’s earlier point and Don Kohn’s  When we are confident enough about what we   should do, we act more boldly  When we are less confident, we act either more cautiously   because we don’t know or we take that one step too many because we don’t know  What these   models are trying to do is to pick up that behavior  Since that involves the human behavior of a   small group, we’re going to get some rather contradictory and conflicting outcomes  That’s   exactly what we’ve got here, I think, and it has been interesting  I’m not interested in signing up   for the psychological test, though!  [Laughter]      Thank you  Circling back from those lofty questions, I have a relatively   mundane one on the risks to your forecast and the outlook  It has to do with the consumer, who   has been very important to our economy’s ability to maintain itself through this difficult time  If   one looks on chart 3 at what I’ll call the debt burden ratio of consumer payments, it is nearly at a   record high—with interest rates at a record low  Looking ahead, if in fact our economy begins to   pick up, the expectation is for interest rates to increase, and there will be a migration into a   heavier debt burden—depending on other circumstances, of course, including income growth   and so forth  Since the consumer’s role has been so important and since it will be a factor going   forward, how do you assess the downside risks there, given that debt burden, which as you noted   in your opening remarks people are concerned about?    Thank you      Mr Chairman, my comments are going to sound fairly familiar  The   situation hasn’t changed much since the last time we met  The District economy has been and   continues to be sluggish  There aren’t a lot of signs of improvement since our last meeting    Manufacturing activity, from what we’ve observed in the region, actually weakened somewhat in   December, disappointing us given the growth that we had seen in October and November    Production and new orders both moved back below year-ago levels after firming in October    Consumer spending has been sluggish since the last meeting, and in most areas holiday retail   sales were flat compared with a year ago despite some heavy discounting  I had a conversation   January 28-29, 2003 109 of 195    with an owner of major shopping malls in the Midwest—in Kansas City, Denver, and   elsewhere—and I found his comments about the post-Christmas season interesting  He said that   he thought sales were pretty robust in the first week of January  But since then, in the last two   weeks, they’ve dropped off dramatically  Retail activity is just dead, and he hasn’t been able to   figure out why  It is a concern because that pattern is not unique to one city  It has occurred   throughout the Midwest, though Denver in particular has been very hard-hit in terms of a   slowdown   Our commercial real estate sector is depressed, with a number of vacancies as well as a   lot of space that is being leased but not used  We have some real issues there  Housing activity,   as elsewhere, continues to be the bright spot in the District except in Colorado, where a   slowdown has developed even though prices haven’t adjusted yet to that slowdown  I don’t   know whether that’s coming, but I suspect it is  Energy activity in the District actually has been   flat despite the oil price increases, and that’s because no one knows exactly where that price is   going to go  Many feel it could easily plummet, and if it does, no one wants to be in the position   of having made that kind of capital investment  So activity in that sector has remained relatively   slow  Wage and price pressures are largely subdued; there’s nothing unique on that front   On the national scene, I really can’t quibble with the Greenbook, given the levels of   uncertainty  As we’ve noted, the fact is that monetary policy is stimulative, and fiscal policy is   likely to be  Another positive is that financial market conditions, given the economic situation   we are witnessing, are relatively strong compared with what they’ve been in the past  So the   markets are in a position to foster strengthening economic activity  I, too, see the issue as the   fact that the risks on both the upside and downside are bound to be so much larger than usual    We could have a very good takeoff or a real slowdown  That is the situation we’re faced with    January 28-29, 2003 110 of 195    Whether the outcome is to the upside or the downside, I think perhaps the new phrase for policy   that may come from all of this is “prudently bold”  But for the time being we’re looking at   possibilities on both sides, and I think we’re in a position to wait and see  Thank you    Yes, I support your recommendation  "
7224,2003-03-18,HOENIG,"  Dave, let me ask a question about the structural labor productivity chart    In your forecast, the contribution from capital deepening stays relatively low going forward, and   yet the multifactor productivity numbers remain fairly strong  You also talked about the slump   in investment spending  What is your thinking on the multifactor aspects of productivity and   why it will stay so strong as we go forward?    The only reason I was asking is that, with a holding back in investment   and therefore limited gains from new technology, I wondered whether we can continue to harvest   that  I don’t disagree with you because it’s hard to explain otherwise      Thank you    Mr Chairman, economic activity in the Tenth District, as in other   regions, remains basically sluggish, though we have had a few signs of improvement on mixed   data since the last meeting  Retail sales have increased only slightly from the disappointing   holiday season, and commercial real estate is still mired in a very deep slump in our area  On the   positive side, though, manufacturing activity actually has strengthened a little since the last   meeting, and energy activity has picked up noticeably  Housing continues to provide support to   District activity, with solid sales of low-end homes making up for some slump in the high-end   part of that market  On the inflation front, wage and price pressures obviously remain pretty well   subdued   In speaking with our directors and with a lot of business people throughout our District, I   consistently hear that businesses are reluctant to commit to new spending and hiring until the   uncertainty of the current situation with Iraq is resolved  This wait-and-see attitude also   describes consumer sentiment more and more as it relates to new spending  However, not to   overstate this uncertainty factor, I would also note that in Colorado, for example, attitudes are   distinctively pessimistic and very much unrelated to the war  Many people in that state see very   strong parallels between now and the slump that they went through in the 1980s, with a lot of   excess capacity and a lot of pessimism in play     Let me talk a little more about manufacturing activity because it actually showed some   improvement on balance in February  Production and shipments rose above year-ago levels, and   new orders registered a fairly large increase—in fact one of the largest since early 2000  Firms   continue to express optimism about production and sales over the next six months once we get   through some of this immediate geopolitical uncertainty  However, employment and capital   March 18, 2003 29 of 101    spending has remained well below year-ago levels, and firms are keeping their inventories low in   case the higher sales they expect do not materialize  In our survey about attitudes among   manufacturers, it is a fact that as they look forward they are more optimistic, as they feel they   can get through this immediate crisis  So I think there is that element  But, again, I go back to   Colorado as evidence that other factors are operating as well   Let me talk very quickly about the farm economy, which is actually expected to   strengthen in 2003  Farm income in terms of cash receipts is expected to improve, and farmers   also are going to continue to receive government payments  Commodity prices could fluctuate,   though, because we continue to have a fairly severe drought in the central and western plains of   our region, which is bringing a lot of its own uncertainty in the agricultural production sector   Let me turn to the national scene  The broad contours of our economic outlook have   changed little since the last meeting  We still expect near-term weakness and medium-term   strength  Like the Greenbook, we expect growth to be about 2½ percent in the first half and then   to increase to 4 percent as we move forward, recognizing that the error bands around that kind of   forecast are fairly large  But the reason is—and I don’t think we should lose sight of it—that   monetary policy is still stimulative, fiscal policy is stimulative and could become more so, and   we have financial market conditions and a banking industry that are generally able to be   supportive of an expansion     The factors behind the near-term weakness remain the same as at our last meeting  Oil   prices and geopolitical risks have fostered near-term restraint  As these risks and uncertainties   are lifted—perhaps in the next couple of weeks or months but maybe even in the next few   days—I think we’ll be able to assess how these elements of monetary policy and fiscal policy   might play out in the real economy  At least by waiting a little longer we should also be   March 18, 2003 30 of 101    allowing more light in the room to see by as we think about policy  So my suggestion would be   in line with the Vice Chairman’s—namely, that we might be well served to wait and watch as   more light is shed on the situation  It will put us in a better position to make decisions  As far as   how we couch our policy decision, I believe we should be very careful about making any   changes  I think we will have an interesting discussion in the policy portion of this meeting   about what we say in our press statement  Thank you, Mr Chairman      Well, I support your recommendation, Mr Chairman  But I have a   question for you  Are you planning to say in the press statement that we stand ready to move, or   are you just leaving that open?    Yes, I agree  It wasn’t clear to me how you were planning to explain our   posture to the public  That answer was helpful  Thank you    Absolutely  "
7276,2003-04-16,HOENIG,"  Yes, Mr Chairman  Our District economy continues to show a mixed   but overall sluggish performance, as I noted at the last FOMC meeting  Retail sales in our region   have been relatively lackluster  Manufacturing was down slightly in March according to our   survey, but manufacturers are still fairly optimistic as they look six months out  Also, we   contacted a couple of our manufacturers again very recently, and they are more optimistic than   they were at the time of the survey  They are at least getting more inquiries, and that gives them   some optimism, although the inquiries have not been converted into orders at this point  As for   April 16, 2003 20 of 47    our labor market, layoff announcements still continue, but they have slowed and noticeably so    Let me mention the energy sector  We drill primarily for natural gas in our region, and activity is   currently very strong and is picking up as well  I want to piggyback on a comment that was   made earlier  In our talking to and surveying some of our businesses they, too, are saying that   the effect of the war is not causing them to delay or accelerate decisions  They are, in a sense,   putting that aside for the moment  Our banks are interesting in that there is some steady loan   growth but loan demand is not strong at all  So they have good liquidity as they look forward    Finally, I’ll just mention that residential activity remains generally good; there has been some   downturn in Denver, but we think that was mostly weather-related  I think I’ll stop there, Mr   Chairman    Excellent presumption  "
7300,2003-05-06,HOENIG,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  The Tenth District economy actually has   shown signs of some further modest weakening since the last meeting due partly, and only   partly, to the war  Both retail sales and manufacturing activity have edged down, and tourism   has been soft  Some of the reduction in tourism was very clearly related to the war  There were   a lot of cancellations in the tourist areas of Colorado particularly  On the manufacturing side,   May 6, 2003 43 of 115    just to give you a sense of recent developments, the year-over-year index for production derived   from our manufacturing survey, after having reached a level of 12 in February, slipped to   minus 4 in March and was minus 3 in April  The year-over-year index for new orders, however,   was actually 8 in April, up from 4 in March  So it’s a mixed bag but is not very encouraging     We have met with our Economic Advisory Council and some of our directors, and there   is a mixed tone in their reports, with some modest optimism but quite a bit of “let’s wait and   see”  There has been, of course, some further pickup in energy activity and some very modest   moderation in private-sector layoff announcements  Consumers are in a little better mood since   military operations in Iraq ended but remain basically cautious  Most businesses report that the   end of the war has not affected their plans, meaning that they are still in somewhat of a wait-and-  see mode  On the inflation front, wage and price pressures remain subdued, but firms are   increasingly worried about the impact of insurance costs on their profit margins     Let me turn to the national scene  The broad contours of our economic forecast have   changed very little since our last meeting  Like the Greenbook, we expect modest growth in the   second quarter followed by a rebound to trend growth in the second half and then greater than   trend growth next year  For all the reasons outlined by others and in the Greenbook—monetary   policy, fiscal policy, the strength in the financial system, falling oil prices, and so forth—demand   should pick up  But in that context I’m aware that the recent news, as others have indicated, has   been relatively disappointing  That’s partly the reason, which I understand, for taking the   position that we should move now for insurance  Also, while I don’t necessarily think that the   probabilities of deflation are as high as Dave outlined—depending on the model, one can get   much lower probabilities—the fact of the matter is that accelerating inflation is not a near-term   threat  I understand that also as one of the arguments for going ahead and easing now     May 6, 2003 44 of 115    Having thought about that, though, I am more of the view that we ought to wait and see   until June  A reason for that is spelled out in Part 2 of the Greenbook, in what I think is an   important statement  “   we cannot yet discern whether the uncertainty that may have been   restraining private spending has lifted”  We will know a little more about that in June  The   second reason that I would put forward for waiting until June is that if we ease now—though   depending on how much—I think the zero bound will move from an issue on which we get a   general question from time to time to one of significant debate and discussion publicly  The nay   sayers in various groups will be bringing that up because the funds rate would be that much   lower and the zero bound that much closer  Moreover, we have an important discussion coming   up in June on communication  Some of that will relate to the issue of the zero bound  So we   will be in a better position to have clearer thoughts on how we as a Committee should talk about   that going forward  I think there are legitimate questions as to how to discuss issues relating to   the zero bound  While it may be easy to communicate that we can buy assets up the yield curve,   there will be questions such as what we are targeting—reserves, an average rate, or whatever    I’d like to have a discussion of those issues by this Committee before we move to a more public   realm on them  So I think that waiting until June has very little downside and it may position us   well for a clearer view going forward from there  Thank you, Mr Chairman    Mr Chairman, I have a question for Vincent  I appreciate the dilemma   that you just defined for us  What is your reaction to in a sense abandoning the balance of risk   statement and expanding the press release statement to define our position?  Does that have   merit?  How would the market react to that in your opinion?      I agree with that, and I look forward to your comments    I support this statement  I would say, perhaps not unlike others, that if   we had taken an action today, I would have been a little squeamish  But certainly I understand   where the risks are and would have supported an easing  I think unbundling the risks is a very   May 6, 2003 89 of 115    good idea  In my view, the second paragraph isn’t necessarily cast in stone but does give us   some opportunity to be more communicative with the public as we move forward  So I’m very   supportive of this  One thing I would request is that we think about the agenda for the June   meeting sooner rather than later because in light of this statement and our discussion today that   will be a real opportunity for us to do some very important planning and discussion    As a request  "
7327,2003-06-24,HOENIG,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Having just heard you say that these aren’t   necessarily options we want to talk about, I still would like to get a reaction from the staff about   some of them—perhaps for the sake of discussion  Independent of what we may do tomorrow,   we are at historically low interest rates, and people are wondering how the Federal Open Market   Committee might conduct itself in the future  Given that situation, it gives me pause to think   about being asked a question and telling people that as one method we could target a rate out on   the yield curve  I’d feel much more comfortable saying that we can expand reserves regardless    June 24-25, 2003 22 of 211    I’d feel more comfortable doing that than talking about targeting long-term interest rates   because, with our banking industry in good shape, the expansion of reserves would cause some   mechanisms to kick in that would tend to stimulate the economy  How do you or other members   of the Committee feel with regard to our talking about these issues, given that the questions will   inevitably be asked?    I’m talking about now, Mr Chairman, depending on where we move the   funds rate  People are saying, even in these memos, that the effective zero rate is 50 basis points   or that the money market funds would be affected if the funds rate gets to 75 basis points or   lower  Therefore, questions are going to arise as to how we should conduct policy or how we   plan to conduct it    Right    Right    One thing you’re saying that I appreciate hearing—because I would feel   very uncomfortable talking about it—is to stay away from specific discussions about targeting   rates out the yield curve  I want to endorse that  I also understand the need for vagueness, given   that we can’t anticipate what the future will hold for us   June 24-25, 2003 24 of 211     Wouldn’t it be easier just to solve this problem?  [Laughter]   June 24-25, 2003 59 of 211     Mr Chairman, as others have said about their Districts, the Tenth   District economy has remained sluggish since our last meeting but there are some signs of a   turnaround and a little more optimism  Labor markets continue to be soft, manufacturing activity   has not picked up noticeably, and commercial real estate remains in a slump  State and local   governments are also cutting back, and in some cases they are trying to raise taxes or have raised   taxes in order to balance their budgets     On a more positive note, indicators of future activity have shown some improvement    While District firms are still cautious about new hiring, they announced far fewer job cuts in the   last month than in other recent months  Also, manufacturers’ plans for future capital spending   June 24-25, 2003 96 of 211    are higher than they were earlier this year  Commercial realtors are now expecting conditions to   improve somewhat in the coming months instead of continually getting worse  In other positive   signs, retail sales are holding up, housing activity is still strong, and energy activity continues to   expand  I’ll say a little more on those sectors in a moment   On the inflation front, goods prices have been basically flat since our last meeting  But   manufacturers have mentioned to us that they are seeing a bit of increase in the cost of goods    Let me say just a little more about the manufacturing sector  In our survey on capital spending,   of those firms that plan to increase capital spending over the next six months about half said that   they had already placed the orders  That reflected some improvement from prior surveys  I   would also note that several of our directors indicated that optimism was considerably higher   among small and medium-sized manufacturers than in some of our larger firms   As I noted, consumer spending has continued to rebound after the dip associated with the   Iraq war, and housing activity has remained strong  The energy sector is showing improvement   but interestingly hasn’t improved as much as one might have expected  Some individuals in our   region have told us that an important reason is that they’ve seen prices go up before, have   invested to produce more, and then had prices fall on them  They’re not anxious to go through   that experience again  The farm economy is showing improvement, as you’ve read elsewhere, so   I don’t see any need to comment further on that   Let me turn to the national outlook  I agree that economic forces are in place for a more   robust recovery, making a rebound to trend growth this year and to above-trend growth next year   more likely now than it seemed at our last meeting  Businesses remain cautious, however, in   their plans for capital spending and for new hires  That, of course, is a concern for the outlook,   and I would suggest that the Greenbook’s forecast probably is a bit optimistic, especially   June 24-25, 2003 97 of 211    compared with our own forecast  But the point is that our recent surveys of capital spending and   other factors are considerably more positive in terms of expectations  So I expect to see growth   pick up to about 3½ percent in the second half of this year  While below the Greenbook forecast,   that is still, I think, a very positive outcome   As for policy, I won’t talk about numbers, but I believe that the probabilities of   improvement going forward are much better than they were just a short time ago, at our previous   meeting  So I look at the possibility of taking an easing action today as insurance  I think it can   be presented in that way—in a very positive light, consistent with an improving economy and   economic outlook  In my view that’s a good way to think about it and to present it  Thank you    Mr Chairman, I support the recommendation, and let me explain my   reasons in the following way  I am scheduled to give a speech next week; and as I think about it,   the policy stance you’ve just described makes me comfortable that I will be able to give that   June 24-25, 2003 144 of 211    speech  In other words, I do think that the outlook is positive  I don’t know if it’s as positive as   the Greenbook or as positive as we hope, but I think it’s positive  However, I believe that the   cost of insurance is fairly low and a ¼ point cut in the funds rate target is to me a reasonable   insurance policy  If we went more than ¼ point, selling the idea that the economy is picking up   and that the outlook is favorable would be much harder; that would be very difficult to   communicate  So I support your recommendation strongly    I agree with that   June 24-25, 2003 160 of 211     Yes, we have a different projection now, a much stronger projection     I realize that  "
7353,2003-08-12,HOENIG,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  The Tenth District economy has   strengthened since the last meeting  Although economic growth is certainly not robust, it is at   least showing some positive signs  The labor markets are still soft, but they do appear to be   improving slightly  Employment has slowly edged up since the end of the Iraqi war, moving   August 12, 2003 50 of 110    almost to year-ago levels  Layoff announcements did rise somewhat in July, but that was due   mainly to some anticipated job cuts at certain military bases     Manufacturing activity showed further signs of recovery in July  New orders were up    Our manufacturing index was 16 in July, up from 6 in June and minus 2 in May  That’s   consistent with other improvements, such as increases in capital spending and expectations of   future production that remain generally favorable  The negatives were that current production   did slip back to below year-ago levels and plans for future hiring and capital spending remained   unclear  There’s a certain sense of wanting to go forward but a hesitancy that still remains     Consumer spending has continued to rebound from the dip during the war  Retailers   contacted in mid-July said that their sales were up a little from previous months and at or above   year-ago levels in most locations in our region  Commercial real estate, though still weak, has   shown some signs of stabilizing  Office vacancy rates were unchanged in the second quarter,   and construction activity leveled off after trending down for the last year and a half  Housing   activity remained strong  The recent increase in mortgage rates has caused a fairly sharp   reduction in refinancings, but so far we’ve not heard any reports that it is curbing housing   demand itself  Energy activity remains an important source of strength  Drilling for natural gas   continues to expand, supported by high prices and the lifting of some environmental restrictions   recently in Wyoming   State and local budgets remain a drag on the District economy  Colorado, Nebraska, and   Oklahoma are planning to implement some further spending cuts  Also, legislators in Nebraska   and Kansas are talking about—and in fact are very close to—enacting some tax increases    Pricing trends are little changed since the last meeting  Retail prices have been stable  In   manufacturing, our contacts tell us that prices of materials have continued to rise while prices of   August 12, 2003 51 of 110    finished goods have continued to encounter downward pressure  The farm economy is   recovering  Those areas that have a crop have a very good crop  Some areas in western Kansas   and Nebraska still are experiencing a drought, and farmers there are relying on government   payments as they have in the past   Let me turn to the national economy  It appears, as others have noted, that the economic   forces are in place for sustainable recovery, making a rebound to trend growth this year possible   and to above-trend growth next year most likely  We have accommodative monetary policy and   fiscal policy, strong productivity, and a healthy financial system that can support the credit needs   of businesses as those needs materialize  Of course, as we’ve talked about today, the significant   increase in long-term interest rates is a topic receiving a lot of attention  While the rise in long-  term rates can be a negative, obviously, part of the increase reflects simply a rebound from the   dramatic declines in May and June  But I think those rates also have risen because investors are   more confident about the strength of the recovery  In addition to anticipating the strong   monetary and fiscal forces propelling the economy forward, we’re now beginning to see the   strength reflected in economic and financial data  Inflation-indexed Treasury yields suggest that   real interest rates are higher  In addition, the inflation premium has in fact increased   Putting this all together, my outlook for the economy continues to be for real GDP   growth of about 3½ percent in the second half of this year, which is below the Greenbook’s   4 percent  I think growth next year will be closer to 4 percent than the Greenbook forecast of 48   percent  Of course, if business becomes confident about the outlook and business fixed   investment increases to the 13 percent suggested in the Greenbook, then we could see growth in   the range of 4½ percent or better  So, while I see upside risk to growth, it is based on my   August 12, 2003 52 of 110    forecast of growth most likely being near 4 percent, not the 48 percent projected by the staff    Relative to that 48 percent, I think there’s probably some downside risk   Let me turn briefly to the inflation outlook  I expect core inflation to remain relatively   stable  While the output gap may put some downward pressure on inflation, I would be reluctant   to place too much weight on the output gap as a predictor of inflation going forward  More   significantly, financial markets and market economists seem to me to be expecting somewhat   higher inflation  In my view, the inflation risk for 2004 is about balanced  More generally,   given the outlook, I think the risk of unwelcome deflation or disinflation caused by a collapse in   aggregate demand is negligible, although I do recognize that continued strong productivity, along   with modest economic growth, could lead to some further disinflation  Thank you    I’m very comfortable with your recommendation on both counts, Mr   Chairman   August 12, 2003 76 of 110     On balance, I think it would be preferable to drop the last sentence   because it does change the statement, which gets attention, and then expectations change  If we   August 12, 2003 90 of 110    just repeat what we said before, we’re signaling to everyone that policy is on hold  In terms of   policy announcements or implications, I think that is the safer course, and we can have a full   discussion of these communication issues at the September meeting  I recognize that this last   sentence comes out of the semiannual monetary policy report, but if it becomes part of the   Committee’s statement, it will receive more emphasis    No, I’m not suggesting that you are  I’m just saying that having that   wording here does tend to bring out the point more forcefully    "
7378,2003-09-15,HOENIG,"   Mr Chairman, I have a question about something you said  I’ll ask for   Vincent’s interpretation of it so I can get this question on the table now  [Laughter]  You were   talking about wanting to inform the market about our outlook for the future  I think that’s what   you were saying in your opening comments      That’s what I want to clarify  Are we talking about the risks we see   today and how we interpret those risks?  Or are we talking about taking the statement further, as   we did last time, in terms of policy in the foreseeable future?  What is the intent?    Okay    I think it’s important to be clear what we mean when we talk about the   future  If we’re talking about the balance of risks we see today based on the information   September 15, 2003 16 of 78    currently available, that’s one thing  If we suggest that our assessment of the risks implies a   future action on our part, then I think we’ve gone beyond what we can reasonably do as far as   predicting the future    That’s helpful to me  Thank you    Right    Mr Chairman, I’m going to back off of Al’s point  I have some   sympathy for setting an inflation objective, but I think price stability is the objective  I’m more   or less following up on Bob Parry’s comments  Where I’m having difficulty with this whole   issue is that, to my mind at least, we are introducing a new ambiguity—I think it happened at the   last meeting—and that is this idea of market guidance  I feel very uneasy with it      Yes, or anything like that  We’ve moved further away from our   boilerplate language in trying to be more explanatory about our actions  As you started out   saying this evening, we can’t predict the future  None of us can predict the future  Another   factor is that the markets receive as much data as we do, and they can judge our actions or our   prospective actions based on those data and on our past actions  Over a long period of time, it is   September 15, 2003 39 of 78    the actions that really do speak better than the words  So that’s where I’m coming from    Moreover, it’s my experience—and I think others have found this to be the case as well—that   people hear what they want to hear  Sometimes, and maybe often, the markets hear what they   want to hear, so we cannot expect to convey conditional statements very successfully to the   markets  People simply don’t believe or accept statements as conditional in hindsight  Thus, we   find ourselves having to surprise the markets, in a sense, when we try to be too prescriptive or   forward-looking     So I would focus on the statement—I think it’s a good suggestion to bring the wording in   the Bluebook and the language of the press release together—and say that this is what our action   is today  We can talk about the risks we see today—the risks with regard to economic output   and inflation and leave it at that  That means more boilerplate  My view is that, if we try to do   any more than that, we will get into a very complicated pre-approval process on the press release   because we’d be saying more than the action itself says  I think that’s a very bad course to   follow  In my view, outlining our sense of the risks is about as much guidance as we can   provide  However, if we are going to try to use our press release to explain more—and I’ll end   with this—I have a very strong sympathy toward the Bank of England model  Vincent talked   about the possibility of errors occurring if we use that model, but frankly, I think there will be   fewer errors if we publish the minutes more quickly than if we try to write a press release that   represents twelve views in two paragraphs  With the latter approach I think we really open   ourselves up to errors and rough statements    It’s one I think we ought to consider very seriously if we start going   down the road of wanting to expand what we say in the press release rather than making it more   September 15, 2003 40 of 78    boilerplate  I have to tell you that I think focusing on those minutes and saying that they are an   accurate representation of our discussion would be very healthy for the market  With the release   of the minutes we are saying in effect “these are the facts”  The market can interpret our actions   and our outlook based on those facts    I would go back to announcing our action     With no comment, right    I’d release them as quickly as we can—two weeks after the meeting if   that’s reasonable—because they provide the explanation for our actions  The market can   decipher the minutes  Yes, people may occasionally misinterpret them, but the minutes are our   representation of the discussions that occurred at the meeting  And there’s no attribution, so   there is no risk to an individual member  I would prefer that to expanding the press statement    Now, if we go to a boilerplate statement—this is our action, and these are the risks, with the risks   clearly understood as those we see today and not anything that hints at our next move—I’m fine   with that  But absent that, I think we ought to get the minutes out more quickly and confine the   statement      Remember one thing I said  I said that I’d rather go through this   challenge with the minutes than opt to expand the press release  I think there’s more danger in   the press release if we’re going to get prescriptive with it         "
7399,2003-09-16,HOENIG,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  To begin with the region, our Tenth District   economy actually has shown further improvement since our last meeting, although District firms   remain reluctant to hire strongly or to spend a lot of money on capital  At the same time,   manufacturing activity has expanded, retail sales were solid heading into the fall, and residential   construction and sales rose to new levels  I would also note that we’ve had reports that state and   local tax revenues are now starting to come in above projections     Layoff announcements for District firms are continuing to trend downward, although we   haven’t seen a pickup in employment, as I mentioned  While large firms we contacted indicated   that they are not planning much in the way of new hiring, it is interesting that a substantial   number of small to midsized manufacturers said that they do expect to add to payrolls in the   coming months  The picture for capital spending is similar; it’s sluggish overall but with a few   signs of a possible turnaround, especially among small and midsized firms  This includes a   pickup in nonresidential construction due to some plant expansions now being talked about    September 16, 2003 33 of 106    Also, there is some increased interest among manufacturers in the new investment tax incentives    As for inflation in our area, raw materials prices and benefits costs have continued to rise   significantly  Also, in keeping with the stronger economic picture, there has been less evidence   of price cuts on finished goods     Turning to the national picture, I agree with the staff’s assessment that the economic   forces are in place for a sustainable recovery, with growth above trend this year and next year the   most likely outcome  As has been noted, we have an accommodative monetary policy,   stimulative fiscal policy, strong productivity, and a healthy financial system that can support the   credit needs of businesses when those needs materialize  In addition, economic data released   since our June meeting have been consistent with stronger growth this year and next  More   specifically, I expect growth over the rest of this year to be at least at the 4½ percent mark  I   would note also that I know of more people now expecting growth to be north of 5 percent in the   third quarter and I’ve seen projections here and there of 6 percent growth   Of course, I am aware that there are downside risks to the outlook as well  Obviously I   remain concerned, as do others, about foreign economic growth  As the Greenbook notes, the   foreign outlook has been revised upward, but that’s primarily because the forecast for the US   economy has been revised upward  So to some extent we’re looking at one another and saying   that we each should get a better economic outcome, and I think we have to be sensitive to that    I’m also concerned that while CEO confidence is improving, it’s not taking off strongly  Though   we’ve seen some increase in capital spending, we do not yet have a clear “self-sustaining”   recovery, as they say, on the business fixed investment side  Without that, we all are concerned   about the continuation or the sustainability of the recovery itself  The largest question mark   remains the labor market  I realize that employment is a lagging indicator, but the lags seem to   September 16, 2003 34 of 106    be especially long this time  Strong productivity is affecting this situation, obviously    Nevertheless, I expect that we will be seeing an increase in employment, as the Greenbook   projects, by the end of the year if not before and then a decline in unemployment beginning next   year     Let me speak very briefly about the inflation outlook  I expect core inflation to remain   relatively stable at its current level, which I think is a good thing  While the output gap may put   some downward pressure on inflation, I am cautious about putting too much weight on the output   gap as a predictor of inflation trends  For one, there’s the issue of level and speed effects and so   forth, which I believe Dave mentioned also  In addition, market economists are expecting   somewhat higher inflation, not lower, and I think that’s because they also question the role of the   output gap or its change in determining the course of inflation  My own view is that the near-  term inflation risks are about balanced  Inflation may move higher or lower but probably not   much in either direction if it does move  Given the outlook, I think the risk of an unwelcome   decline in inflation—one caused by a collapse in aggregate demand—is in fact negligible  I do   recognize, as I noted, that with continued strong productivity growth we could get a reduction in   inflation  But I would be hesitant to call such a development an unwelcome event  Thank you    Mr Chairman, I agree with leaving the funds rate target unchanged at   this meeting  My own view is that we are in an environment where we’re close to price stability,   with low and stable inflation, and I think the risks are balanced  I will tell you that trying to   figure out what to say in this statement right now makes the early release of the minutes seem   more appealing to me than it did last night  In any event, I don’t think we can do much to   change this statement given the current circumstances, so I’m not going to argue any further  I’ll   live with this language, but I hope we do develop a very carefully crafted exit strategy fairly   soon  Thank you    Mr Chairman, listening to this discussion, I want to say that I very much   agree with those who say we should leave this wording absolutely the same as it was last time    Keeping it the same tells the market something right there  It means that   we don’t want to change anything, and market observers will begin to think about the fact that   we’ll be backing off in the future  I think that will take us a step forward in an exit strategy   September 16, 2003 93 of 106   "
7424,2003-10-28,HOENIG,"  David, looking at 2004, your estimates for consumption are strikingly   strong  It would be great if the figures came out that way  But you estimate consumption to be   as strong as it was in the late ’90s  You touched on your reasoning, but could you again give me   your rationale for that?  I ask because your forecast is an outlier; it’s at the upper limit of the   range of forecasts    Well, I question only the third reason relating to the wealth effects    When we had these kinds of growth rates in PCE previously, the wealth effects were much more   positive  So in my view the wealth effects returning to neutral—while granted they are no longer   a drag—won’t produce quite the boost that might be expected  I do agree with you on the labor   market, however; I certainly see that improving as we move forward  But the consumption   forecast seems a little strong to me    Mr Chairman, the Tenth District economy continues to improve, and our   business contacts have become somewhat more optimistic about the outlook  Let me talk a little   about the labor markets They remain soft but are showing some signs of firming  According to   some of the payroll data we’ve looked at, employment was flat for our District in September    However, layoff announcements are down from earlier in the year, and more firms say that they   are planning to hire or are thinking about hiring  I would note anecdotally that firms announcing   job increases in the last couple of months include several call centers, a major railroad, several   manufacturers in our area, and a number of high-tech firms in Colorado  To the relief of people   in both Kansas City and Tulsa, American Airlines decided not to lay off workers at its two large   maintenance facilities in those cities   On the manufacturing side, activity actually strengthened further  Production and new   orders both increased, and expectations for future production and orders remained relatively   high  Capital spending also improved somewhat  Although employment remained below year-  ago levels, the average workweek did rise noticeably  On the negative side, aircraft   manufacturing continued to struggle, with little improvement expected until 2005  I would note   that from August to September the year-over-year production index from our survey of   manufacturers rose from 8 to 17, the new orders index climbed from 22 to 31, and the capital   spending index improved from 0 to 12  Moreover, preliminary data received for October as late   as yesterday suggest that these trends persisted in October   Consumer spending continued to edge up despite the softer labor market that I   mentioned  Retailers contacted also said that they had had pretty good sales and their confidence   remained strong  Housing activity increased further, setting new records in most of the areas   except for Denver where it’s a little slower  Commercial real estate does remain weak in the   October 28, 2003 50 of 126    region, and energy activity is expanding but at a moderate pace  State and local budgets show   further signs of improvement, with some tax revenue increases in several of our states  But I   would caution that to some extent those numbers reflect tax increases  On the agricultural side,   forecasts for net income have moved up as much as 22 percent over last year  But I would   remind you that about $20 billion of federal farm payments are included in those numbers     Let me turn to the national outlook  The economic forces are in place for a relatively   robust recovery  That assessment is based on current monetary policy, fiscal policy,   productivity, and a good strong financial system that can support credit needs going forward    Overall, I expect growth through the end of next year to be above 4 percent, a little better than   the Blue Chip consensus but not quite as strong as the Greenbook forecast  As noted, a recovery   in capital spending and an increase in employment remain two risks to our achieving sustainable   economic growth  But I’m hearing about some increases in capital spending from the people we   talk to, and we see some evidence of it in the numbers  In my conversations with CEOs in the   District, there’s a clear sense of greater confidence and an indication that firms are more willing   to undertake planned expansions  So I’m optimistic about that  We also are beginning to see   some signs that labor markets are responding to the acceleration in growth over the past several   months  The evidence is very preliminary and tentative, I realize, but I think it bodes well for the   labor markets going forward     Turning to the inflation outlook, I would say that, in the near term, inflation is likely to   remain stable and that the risks going forward are about balanced  A continued decline in the   dollar could put upward pressure on inflation  Although the output gap may put some downward   pressure on inflation, I am reluctant to put a lot of weight on that gap as a predictor of inflation    October 28, 2003 51 of 126    Research here and elsewhere suggests that the predictive powers of the output gap on inflation   are difficult to find   Finally, on the topic of policy let me say that I clearly would be of the view that for now   we should maintain policy where it is  I think any change would actually be harmful in the   current environment  However, given recent data, I’m not convinced that we can define a period   within which we can keep rates this low  I also think it’s important that the public come to   realize, as President Parry suggested, that an accommodative policy refers to the level of the   funds rate and not to the direction of any change  Although I do not have a point estimate of the   long-run equilibrium for the funds rate, it probably is more likely in a range of 3 to 4 percent   than near 1 percent  Thank you    Mr Chairman, I support you completely  Since we’re into metaphors   today, here’s mine  With regard to the communication part of your recommendation, with the   second paragraph I think we have dug ourselves into a hole and we’re trying very hard to get out   October 28, 2003 83 of 126    of it but all we’re doing is getting in deeper  Let’s put the shovel down, think about it, and climb   out of this hole later  That’s why I’d say leave the paragraph exactly the same    Mr Chairman, I more or less share the view that President Guynn   expressed  One of the things I did in preparation for this discussion was to go back to the press   release that we used in January 2000  After some considerable thought, the Committee—rightly   or wrongly—put that wording together  It worked very well as far as I’m concerned  Then some   special circumstances came up, and we made changes in that wording  They served their   purpose but now we have some fallout from that  We ought to go back to the earlier language as   a starting point—not to the language we’re now using, which was put together ad hoc piece-by-  piece, but back to the base  Let’s think it through and see what we need to modify in that   language  If it makes sense, I’d keep the structure as close to that earlier version as possible and   then move forward  I would not try to figure out wording today or choose now among several   options  I don’t feel comfortable with any of them  I’d feel reasonably comfortable with what   we had before with some changes to reflect that we’re in a more stable price environment  So I   agree with Jack  Maybe circumstances are changing too quickly, and we can’t wait until   January  But we ought to wait at least until December, think this through more carefully, and   come up with some options or narrow our options at that point  "
7449,2003-12-09,HOENIG,"  David, in reading the Greenbook and listening to your comments this   morning, you’ve indicated that, as we go through the next several months and through 2005, the   economy will move back to its potential  Yet the associated real fed funds rate at the end of the   period is less than 1 percent  If one were to look at this option as a policy prescription, is the   idea that you want to ensure a move back toward potential as quickly as possible and then worry   about how far below equilibrium the short-term rate is?  Is that the suggestion rather than that we   should plan to move the funds rate up as the economy moves back toward potential?    I understand    Thanks    Mr Chairman, the Tenth District economy is similar to the District   economies others have described in that it continues to expand and has done so fairly clearly   since our last meeting  Businesses are showing some real confidence that the recovery now is   going to sustain itself     December 9, 2003 72 of 133    Let me talk just a minute about regional developments  Our labor markets have indeed   firmed since our last meeting  According to the payroll data, employment rose in October for the   second month in a row  Moreover, layoff announcements have subsided, and hiring   announcements have picked up, suggesting that job growth will continue to strengthen further in   the coming months  Manufacturing activity also has expanded  Production and new orders rose   strongly during the last two months, and expectations for future activity have moved higher    Employment is no longer falling, and for the first time since the slump began, firms in   manufacturing appear willing to hire additional workers to meet anticipated increases in demand    Capital spending also continues to improve, with considerably more firms planning to increase   than to reduce investment in the coming months  Consumer spending looks solid despite   reduced stimulus from the tax rebate and the slowdown in mortgage refinancing activity     Anecdotal reports suggest that the holiday season has gotten off to a good start in our   area, particularly in the east side of the region, with stores feeling less need to discount   merchandise this year than last year  Travel and tourism are also doing well, with convention   activity continuing strong and ski bookings in the western part of our District running quite high    Housing activity remains robust  And though commercial real estate is still in a slump, we’re   beginning to hear that the bottom has been reached, at least in the view of our local developers    Energy activity remains strong     With respect to inflation, wage pressures are still minimal, but price pressures have   increased slightly  Manufacturers not only expect substantial increases in raw materials prices in   the next few months but also anticipate having somewhat more success in passing the cost   increases on to the customer  That’s the anecdotal comments we’re receiving from them  In   agriculture, incomes are up  They were adjusted up another 6 percent in November  The only   December 9, 2003 73 of 133    fly in the ointment is some of the upsetting information relative to China  That has affected our   agricultural outlook to a small degree     Let me turn to the national economy  To repeat what many others have said, recent   indicators have been strong and more so than generally expected  As a result, many people have   revised upward their forecasts for growth in 2004  Overall, I expect growth to be in the 4¼ to   4½ percent range in 2004 and stronger than that—maybe 4¾ to 5 percent in 2005  Obviously my   forecast is lower than the Greenbook’s but somewhat higher than the December Blue Chip   numbers that came in at just under 4 percent  The reasons for the strong outlook are the same as   they have been for some time  accommodative monetary policy, stimulative financial   conditions, cumulative effects of fiscal policy, and strong productivity  In addition to these, I   would add strong forward momentum and improving business confidence as important factors    Moreover, employment is finally rising, and the unemployment rate is falling  We also are   seeing more signs of recovery in capital spending on a national level, as I’ve heard around the   table  The growth in profits and business fixed investment seen in the last quarter along with   strong orders and shipments of nondefense capital goods suggest that the recovery will continue   to improve as we move forward     While there are risks to the outlook, I think they are probably balanced now or on the   upside, depending on one’s definition of upside  At the last meeting I felt, as did others, that   there was a fair amount of uncertainty with regard to capital spending and employment  While   risks in those areas perhaps remain, they are clearly much smaller today than just a short time   ago at our last meeting  In addition, the upside surprises we have been seeing may continue as   the recovery gains momentum   December 9, 2003 74 of 133    Let me turn to the inflation outlook  I take the view that inflation will rise, but I agree   with those who say it is likely to increase only slightly, perhaps by ¼ point in 2004 and 2005  I   would add that, while I think the argument that the output gap will tend to hold inflation down is   a fair one, I believe the highly accommodative stance of monetary policy in an accelerating   economy balances out those deflationary risks  As it settles out for me, Mr Chairman, I would   suggest that at worst the output risks are balanced  I think the inflation risks are also balanced    In my view we really do need to reconsider the last sentence of our statement  I think we can   change the language—and perhaps at this meeting—in a way that moves us more toward neutral,   with balanced risk assessments, without necessarily upsetting the markets or the mainstream    Thank you       Mr Chairman, obviously I agree with your policy recommendation for   the funds rate  I don’t agree with the change in the statement  I think we have an opportunity   here to identify the risks as balanced and drop the “considerable period” statement  If we were to   remove that statement, I think the market might, as President Poole suggested, exhibit some   gyrations this afternoon, but I believe there’s a fair amount of expectation in the market that we   will drop that wording today  If we did, I think it would allow us more flexibility going forward    It would enable us at our January meeting to focus on more forward-looking issues relating to the   policy statement  I must admit that that would be my strong preference       I’m not quite sure what to say, Roger  I started out, as I’ve thought   about our communications in the last few months, thinking that the earlier release of the minutes   would provide us with an opportunity to cut back on the statement  You indicated in an earlier   memo to us that cutting back on the statement, even coupled with an earlier release of the   minutes, would be viewed as a step back in terms of the information we provide  That causes me   to think that the forecasts we submit twice a year in preparation for our semiannual reports on   monetary policy should be the focus of our communications about the outlook  I’d rather have   the forecasts we provide to the Congress in those reports—along with the relevant Committee   December 9, 2003 113 of 133    minutes—be the vehicle we use to put out that range of views rather than the risk statement,   which for me has been a very dissatisfying effort to communicate with the markets and   whomever else  So, since we’ve opened up the door to having more options to choose from here,   I would say that I really would like to pare back the press release  And I’d try to provide sooner   rather than later a greater sense of the variety of very valuable views among Committee members   and the differences that come through that ultimately lead to a consensus  So that’s my two cents   worth  "
7475,2004-01-27,HOENIG,"  I agree with those who have suggested that we put this on the shelf for   now  The original purpose is being dealt with in other ways, and the cost seems to be sizable for   this particular very narrow dimension  If we need to, we can bring it up at another time  I think   it’s better shelved for now    Given the suggested approach that you’ve just outlined, Mr Chairman,   I’ll confine my comments  On the risk statement, if that’s what we’re narrowly focusing on, I   January 27-28, 2004 21 of 238    don’t have any difference with you  But I’d start out by saying that I wish we could get rid of the   risk assessment in the statement  I’d like the statement merely to say this is the action we took    It’s the risk statement that always seems to hang us up and raise other issues    Well, that’s what I would prefer  But barring that, depending on how   this Committee discussion comes out, my second choice would be the gradual evolution option    I’ll stop there    I’ll combine a couple of things at this point  Let me start out by saying   that, if the consensus conforms with the view that you have just summarized, I can live with that    I originally was in favor of releasing the minutes earlier, and my thinking was that doing so   would allow us to get rid of the risk statement  I know there is the thought that we can’t move   back from a decision to accelerate the release of the minutes, but I think the quid pro quo of   eliminating the risk statement could be favorable  So that has some appeal to me  Plus the   minutes give the market a more complete reflection of the broad views of the Committee   members, and there is perhaps a benefit from that     I think that assessment still holds  However, I recognize your main point  I’ve been   down that road before You jump, and then you’ve done it, and you can’t back out  So I don’t   January 27-28, 2004 44 of 238    have a problem with approaching the decision slowly, with a lot of thought  But I think it is a   step worth considering and deliberating  As for some of the comments that arise in our   discussions, certainly if the minutes are not released for two or three weeks, what we say in   public statements during that period can be more complicated  But I think we live with that to an   important degree now  So I don’t see that as a very significant complicating factor  The news   event of the minutes could be an issue if somehow the minutes give a completely different view   of our assessment of the balance of risks than the statement did when we released it  So I think   the proposal to advance the publication of the minutes deserves continual thought if not   acceptance at this point   Finally, I’m just going to go ahead to the next item, the role of our individual projections    My thought was that, if eliminating the risk statement were viewed as a backing away, the   projections could be the substitute in terms of filling in for information that is forward-looking    That’s not as critical to me as the idea of releasing the minutes sooner to make public the general   views of the Committee  I’ll stop there    Thank you  Let me just say that the idea of using the projections came to   me perhaps more as a reflection of how much I disliked the risk statement than how much I   really liked the projections  So, given the almost brilliant discussion of the risk statement, I’m   not married at all to the projections  I understand all the issues and concerns, and I agree that   we’d have a very difficult time making that work going forward  But I suppose it did serve my   purpose in the sense that it illustrated my willingness to get rid of the risk statement  With that   I’m going to be quiet   January 27-28, 2004 73 of 238     Thank you, Mr Chairman  The Tenth District economy has actually   strengthened further since the last meeting, and business contacts are frankly relatively optimistic   about the year ahead  I attended a tech conference near Boulder about two and a half weeks ago    That conference is held each year at about the same time  Last year about 150 people attended    This year about 400 people were there, and they were all very much engaged with projects going   forward  So there is a clear improvement in attitudes in some of the technology areas  Also,   energy activity in the District continues to be strong, primarily in the natural gas area, and is very   positive generally speaking  Manufacturing activity actually continued to expand in December    Both production and new orders moved further above year-ago levels, with orders posting their   strongest growth in some years  Inventories also rose above year-ago levels for the first time in   three years   In our survey on capital spending we did see some improvement on net  Thirty-one   percent of the manufacturers said that they expected to increase expenditures in the next six to   twelve months, and that is a substantial improvement over the numbers for our region in the   previous survey last May  Many firms that are planning to increase spending cited the need to   replace primarily IT and some other equipment  Having said that, some respondents provided   specific comments indicating that they were going to hold onto their current equipment until it   January 27-28, 2004 135 of 238    actually fell apart on them before they would invest again They were absolutely committed to   not spending money at this time   Commercial real estate activity is still weak in our area  Vacancy rates actually edged up   in the fourth quarter, and we are not seeing a lot of construction activity in that sector of our   regional economy  Labor markets also remain soft, but the underlying trend of layoffs and new   hires was a little more favorable this time  Adjusting for some of the mad cow effects on meat   packing plant activity, we have seen more hires than layoffs based on our own surveys   In the agricultural economy, 2003 was a very strong year for our region and I think   nationally, primarily because of the decline in the dollar and the demand overseas  We actually   are going to have some of the highest earnings in several years in the agricultural sector  In fact,   agricultural income hasn’t been that high in the last seven years  So that is really positive  And   we now expect that the mad cow effect will be less severe than we had originally thought, based   on talks with various groups in our region where that threat is so important     Turning to the national outlook, I would agree with those who say that recent indicators   confirm a strengthening in the economy looking ahead  Our projection for GDP growth is not as   strong as the Greenbook’s; we have it more in the area of 4½ percent  But I think that the   differences are a matter of degree  The direction is the same, and some of the reasons for the   improvement are the same, including very accommodative monetary and fiscal policies and   favorable financial conditions  So I think we will see some improvement    One comment I did want to make is related to the point that President Poole mentioned   about looking at the output gap as an indicator  I, too, am a little uneasy about putting much   weight on the output gap because the estimates of its size are so varied  The same is true of   some other parameters such as the natural rate  The gap could be as little as ½ percent of GDP or   January 27-28, 2004 136 of 238    as much as 2 percent, and that is too wide a range on which to base judgments  So I think   President Santomero is right in asking what areas we are going to look at to help guide us in our   policy decisions in the future  That is a very important question   As for the inflation outlook, we think inflation is most likely to increase over the year by   perhaps as much as ½ percentage point, given the fact that we have a very accommodative   monetary policy and fiscal stimulus in the pipeline  I think that is an important consideration for   us as we look forward  I’ll stop at that    I support your recommendations, Mr Chairman  On the funds rate, I   absolutely agree with you  On the change in language, to the extent that it adds to our flexibility   I think it’s a good time to make the change  So I’m very supportive  "
7503,2004-03-16,HOENIG,"  Mr Chairman, the Tenth District has continued to expand since our last   meeting, and business contacts remain relatively optimistic about the rest of this year  Consumer   spending and tourism have remained solid through the ski season and into this period  Housing   activity has eased somewhat, as is true elsewhere, but it generally remains strong in our region    Manufacturing activity also continues to strengthen, as production, new orders, and employment   all have risen  In other positive news, manufacturing firms reported a further increase in capital   spending and in spending plans  And business leaders express optimism about economic growth   over the rest of this year throughout our region, with stronger feelings in the eastern part—in   Kansas City and that area—and a little less optimism in the Denver area   Commercial real estate has remained weak, and most firms continue to show less   enthusiasm for new hiring than for capital spending  There seems to be a sense that the cost of   capital is less than the cost of labor and that, therefore, it makes sense to go with the capital   spending  I’ll give you one piece of anecdotal data in support of that  Located in our region is a   major distributor of propane across the United States  They have used new technology—call   center, global positioning, and communications technology—to move their product from starting   point to distribution point  Using this technology, they are anticipating, to begin with, a   reduction of at least 10 percent of their drivers and, longer run, as much as 25 percent because of   the improvements in moving out their product  They came to the conclusion that investing in   this technology produced a much greater return on capital than continuing to operate in the old   way  I think that’s part of what we continue to see in the job market  Let me also mention that   we are hearing more anecdotal reports of delays in the ability to bring orders forward  When   firms order goods to be used in manufacturing, they are experiencing longer delays in receiving   March 16, 2004 49 of 107    those goods  So in that sense the environment is fairly strong in terms of our experience with   economic growth   At the national level, activity continues strong  Our projection in comparison to the   Greenbook forecast has no major differences  On average, for 2004-05 we’re in the same range   of about 4½ percent GDP growth  What I would say to you here—although I’m not advocating   any immediate change in our policy stance—is that I think conditions are developing that could   allow future price pressures to emerge  First of all, both monetary policy and fiscal policy, as   everyone knows, have been delivering quite a bit of stimulus  As one person said, “There’s a lot   of yeast in this dough, and it’s moving”   I would also say that the anecdotal reports suggest that we are going to see more delays in   deliveries—barring shocks, obviously  And there is more talk of passing on price increases; that   is becoming much more prevalent than it was just two or three months ago, or actually even a   month ago  So I’m wondering, in terms of positioning ourselves in the sense of our ability to   move rates up, if being tied to developments in the job market is really in our longer-run best   interest  We may have to be alert to this emerging situation as capital spending continues to   bring us greater productivity increases  Despite some views to the contrary, I think that   inflationary pressures may emerge before the job market turns around  Thank you    Mr Chairman, I’d prefer that we move to a balanced statement on the   inflation risks because I think the risks in fact are relatively balanced now  But I would not   choose to disagree with the stronger preferences that might be held by others around this table   March 16, 2004 82 of 107    who believe that we really should not be making a change at this time  That’s the more   important decision at this point, I think  "
7527,2004-05-04,HOENIG,"  Mr Chairman, the Tenth District economy has continued to improve   significantly since our last meeting, with most sectors showing considerably greater strength    Manufacturing activity accelerated in March and April  Production and new orders increased   sharply, causing backlogs at a substantial number of the firms we surveyed  Employment rose more   modestly, according to our monthly survey, but it has now been above year-ago levels for three   months in a row  Optimism about future activity also improved, boosting capital spending plans but   leaving hiring plans little changed    May 4, 2004 41 of 112       The year-over-year production index edged up to 31 in March and jumped to 46 in April in   our region  The year-over-year new orders index fell back to 29 in March and then rebounded   strongly to 54 in April  In other positive news, in Wichita aircraft manufacturers reported that   demand for business jets is finally picking up because of improved corporate profits and an aging   fleet among some of the corporate companies that use these jets  Consumer spending and housing   activity have strengthened since our last meeting  Much of the improvement in retail sales has been   in the mid-level department stores, which had been lagging behind the big discounters and luxury   stores  Similarly, we have seen an increase in demand for high-end goods and second homes in   several parts of our region  In our tourist sector, advanced bookings at summer resorts have been   very strong, although there is some uneasiness about the impact of higher gas prices on tourism as   we move through the summer  Energy activity has continued to expand in response to the high   prices for oil but particularly for gas, and there are shortages of workers, rigs, and materials in that   industry  Commercial real estate does remain in the doldrums; that’s the one exception to the   generally positive news  Labor markets are showing some signs of improvement; year-over-year   job growth in the District turned positive in March for the first time since 2001   On the inflation front, wage increases remain minimal, but surging raw materials prices have   led manufacturers to raise their output prices  Some firms said that strong demand has enabled them   to increase prices across a broad base  I’d also mention a point I found interesting  Firms began   their price increases by putting surcharges on steel, for example, or anything else they could, but   they are now moving such increases into their base prices  So they have had success in passing on   those increased costs and now are trying to institutionalize them into their base price programs    Bullish commodity markets, of course, are helping our agricultural sector across the board, and   there’s a lot of optimism in that sector as well   May 4, 2004 42 of 112       Turning to the national outlook, the economy is expanding at a solid pace; others have   highlighted the evidence supporting that  Certainly we could see GDP growth this year of between   4½ and 5 percent  I think there are strong indications that growth in that range is a possibility  With   that said, I’d like to talk a bit about developments on the pricing front  I think we are beginning to   see higher prices and expectations of further increases in prices  Expected inflation is now rising   among consumers and much of the business community in our region  For example, core inflation   measures have risen in the last few months, and recent increases reflect higher prices for more than   a few components  More troubling, though, are signs that inflation expectations are increasing    There was a one-page article in our local newspaper just this past weekend advising people on ways   to prepare for the oncoming inflationary surge  While longer-term inflation expectations may not   have changed on net since last fall, I think they are higher than they were during the first three   quarters of 2003  I’m not as inclined to say, as suggested in the Bluebook, that long-term inflation   expectations appear to be well anchored   Looking forward, while I do not expect a significant outbreak in inflation in the near term, I   think the upside risk to inflation is increasing noticeably  My concern stems from the currently   highly accommodative monetary policy in the context of a stronger real economy  The current real   funds rate is negative  The Bluebook shows that, for the first time since late 2001, it is below the   staff’s range of estimated equilibrium real rates  My concern also stems from the past depreciation   of the dollar and higher levels of energy, commodity, and various input prices—with steel being   only one of them  While I recognize that the direct effect of commodity-price increases and the   depreciating dollar on consumer price inflation is generally small, these factors may be influencing   the psychology of pricing and inflation expectations  And I don’t think that should be minimized    We are receiving an increasing number of reports that efforts to pass price increases up the chain—  May 4, 2004 43 of 112       as I mentioned in my anecdote earlier—are meeting with success, which may signal further inflation   pressures for the future  For these reasons, I expect core inflation to be higher than the Greenbook   suggests   I would add, too—and I know we have another discussion ahead of us—that I think we   should be very careful about how we describe the outlook in terms of future monetary policy actions   we might need to take  With that, I’ll stop for now  Thank you, Mr Chairman    Vincent, this may be more of a statement than a question also  But in my   experience on this Committee we’ve never acted in other than a measured way  And I can’t see our   doing otherwise as we go forward, depending on the data we get  In my view the only thing we   accomplish with this word specifically is to put a collar on ourselves and to tell the market that   we’re putting a collar on ourselves going forward  I think that’s what we’ve done in the past, with   the result that, anytime we want to make a change, we have to wait at least one more meeting to   prepare the market for the change—using the statement as the vehicle  That is the point Tony was   making earlier  We have an opportunity here to drop this language, and I think we should    Partly my concern is what will happen if the payroll numbers come out   better than 300,000 again and we have more inflation  Then what are we going to do next time?    What are we going to do?  We’ve already told the market if we say   “measured” today, what we’re going to do next time    Okay    I understand what you’re trying to do in terms of preparing for the next   meeting  My only concern is that, once we put this language in there, when the next meeting comes   and we have our policy discussion we’ll have to worry about the word “measured”—which I think   was President Santomero’s point    That makes me feel a whole lot less well      Mr Chairman, having expressed my opinion somewhat earlier and having   listened to all of this commentary, at this juncture I want to give you my measured response to the   conversation so far and that is that we have the direction right  I know where we stand in that we   need to be looking at the next meeting for some action  And I think that’s the most important thing   we’ve decided here today, so I support you in that  I think we would be better served not to have   this last sentence, line 8, in the statement  We could convey this message in speeches, as you   already have in some ways, over the coming period  The data coming out will decide a lot of this   for us and move us toward a June time frame anyway  But I think the more important element of   today’s decision is that we cannot move now and we should be thinking about June  In that sense, I   support your recommendation  "
7553,2004-06-29,HOENIG,"  Just a follow-up  The orderly and disorderly adjustment scenarios are   based on where we are today, if I understand correctly?    You’re saying that this can continue, though you don’t know for how   long, and as it does—     The consequences grow  And yet there is nothing we can do about it,   which is an interesting conclusion   June 29-30, 2004 28 of 203           But we know that at times it gives us a terrible headache    Thank you  I think the discussion of the inflation outlook has been helpful,   but it does raise some questions about the sense of optimism in the projection in terms of inflation   coming back down as quickly as it does  I’d just like to ask for your reaction because it has been   our experience, both when inflation comes down and when it goes up, that we underpredict the   change either way  It is on its way back up now, and we’re saying it’s not going to continue at a   very strong pace, and yet history tells us that we sometimes get behind the curve ourselves  Part of   the reason I worry about that is that the output gap is actually fairly small and closing rapidly, I   think; at least, that’s what some projections are showing  And the difference between the   unemployment rate and the NAIRU is fairly small; in fact, depending on what the NAIRU really is,   the difference could be zero  Looking at where policy is right now, the fed funds rate is so low   June 29-30, 2004 81 of 203          relative to where neutral most likely is, and we get to neutral so slowly in this projection, that I think   this inflation outlook is fairly optimistic—even with the error bands around it  I just have a sense   that we perhaps need to be less optimistic on this  My view is based upon the degree to which I   think the projections are overstating the difference between the NAIRU and the actual   unemployment rate and are not taking into account just how accommodative policy is right now and   will be in the near-term future  I guess I’m asking you to be somewhat defensive on this, but it   would be helpful for me if you could do that    Fair enough  Thank you    Thanks     Mr Chairman, the Tenth District economy has continued to expand at a   very solid pace since the last meeting  The labor market shows substantial signs of improvement    The District’s employment rose in May, and I think the numbers in June are also very strong, and   jobs are above year-ago levels in all seven of our states  Manufacturing activity rose in May, and   the preliminary numbers coming in for June are very solid  Production and new orders continue to   increase, and most plant managers that we talked with reported that their rates of capacity utilization   were back to pre-recession levels  Expectations are that activity during the second half of the year is   likely to cool somewhat but will still be at historical levels  Year-over-year production and new   June 29-30, 2004 104 of 203          orders indexes actually are setting new highs in our region as we move through June  Consumer   spending continues to rise at a moderate pace  Retailers report steady gains in sales, and we are   optimistic about the summer outlook  Housing activity also remains strong  So far, home sales and   homebuilding have shown little adverse effects from the increases in mortgage rates we’ve seen to   date  Energy activity has continued to expand in response to the high oil and gas prices, and   actually some drilling has been constrained because of the shortage of labor in that particular sector    Commercial real estate, as others have reported, remains our weak spot as well   On the inflation front, wage pressures remain constrained in the region, but manufacturers   are continuing to raise output prices in response to what they say are higher energy and raw   materials costs that they feel they need to pass on  Most manufacturers do expect these costs to   moderate; however, many of them are now telling us that the strong demand has made it easier for   them to increase prices and to have the increases hold   Turning to the national outlook, the economy obviously continues to expand at a solid pace   We expect that GDP growth will be around 4¾ percent this year and just slightly below 4 percent   next year  The important point, I think, is that the continued strong growth largely reflects the fact   that we have an accommodative monetary policy and a stimulative fiscal policy and that strong   growth around the world is facilitating growth in our GDP  The slowdown in growth that we’re   projecting for next year is related, of course, to some back-off in fiscal policy and a presumed   tightening in monetary policy   Let me talk a bit about inflation  Core inflation, as we all know, has increased  Although   we talk about important transitory elements to that increase, I still think that the core price indexes   now have embedded in them some inflationary updrift that is due to our earlier accommodative    monetary policy  And while fiscal policy may back off, it is still going to be stimulative, and we are   June 29-30, 2004 105 of 203          going to be in an accommodative policy stance for some time  So as I think about policy going   forward, I would join those who encourage us to have in mind moving back toward neutral at a   more deliberate pace and in a very systematic fashion  We should move to neutral more quickly   and avoid having to go above neutral later to contain inflation, which I think is now threatening in   light of our easy policies in the past  As far as the statement is concerned, I think we should be very   sparing with our words regarding our likely future policy course  I’d let the economy define what   our future policy will be and not our words today  Thank you  "
7581,2004-08-10,HOENIG,"  Mr Chairman, conditions in our District reflect much of what I’ve heard so   far around the table today, but I think a couple of developments are worth noting  Our labor   markets have shown further signs of improvement, actually  Employment rose in June for the   fourth straight month  Major hiring announcements stayed at a high level in June and July, and   local labor market surveys indicated an increase in hiring plans for the rest of this year  Layoff   announcements did turn up a little in July but remained lower than the hiring announcements and   were largely confined to our telecommunications firms, which are continuing to cut staff    Manufacturing activity in our region continued to grow solidly in July  Production and new orders   rose further, and employment and hiring continued to expand according to all our survey results    Firms remain highly optimistic about future activity and still plan moderate increases in hiring and   capital spending  Consumer spending is flat in our area, as others have noted for their regions    Energy activity continued to expand in response obviously to the price environment  As before,   August 10, 2004 35 of 103          though, some of the individuals we talked with on the producer side say that they are being   constrained to some degree by shortages of labor and equipment and difficulty in obtaining permits   for some of the drilling activities they would like to pursue   I would say that on the national level the question we are struggling with is whether this   recent news is a pause or a more systemic issue  I am unable to tell that for sure, but I’m inclined to   suggest that it’s a pause and not something fundamental  But given the uncertainties around energy,   I think continued high or rising energy prices pose some risks on that front  One thing that does   concern me is that, based on my conversations with some of our business people—even those in the   manufacturing sector—the news that has come out recently has surprised them as well  So they are   rethinking how they are looking at the situation going forward, and that is a bit of an issue for us    But I do believe that the economy is fundamentally strong, and I think our current monetary policy   stance is consistent with that moving forward, as is fiscal policy as well  So I think that the lull is   temporary and that we will see activity continue to increase through the remainder of this year    Thank you    Mr Chairman, I think we should move toward neutral, and I find the   rationale for doing so as stated here pretty good, so I’m fine with that  I would like to leave in the   sentence about energy prices because energy is the elephant in the room and I think we should   acknowledge it  And I don’t think we need to modify the statement any further than that  Thank   you  "
7606,2004-09-21,HOENIG,"  Just to your point on the exchange rate and why we may need to think   about this  It strikes me that, because of external demand and our own situation, we have a more   September 21, 2004 36 of 100          accommodative policy than we normally might because of trying to keep domestic demand up,   and the result is that it also keeps our demand for imports very high  That means that we as a   country accumulate more debt, and as we look down the road, we continue to see this already   very large current account deficit growing further  Therefore, we have a greater likelihood of a   crisis later as we try to maintain our own domestic demand, given that the rest of the world isn’t   helping us along  It may be time to think, as you are saying here, about the external side in terms   of the exchange rate We can’t predict the future; I recognize that  But all the indications are that   this problem is building and that the likelihood of this future crisis is building  Because of our   need to maintain strong domestic demand, we continue to put liquidity out there, and the world   continues to accumulate our debt  This future problem is building in part because of our policy   and the fact that we are dealing with one policy instrument right now     That’s why I’m saying, with regard to the Chairman’s point, that we may   have to look at the exchange rate side or at least think about it  I believe it is perhaps becoming   more critical that we do so    Mr Chairman, on the national outlook, our view is similar to the   Greenbook’s in that we think the expansion has regained some of its traction and will continue as   we move forward  Discussions with business contacts throughout our District tend to support   this notion as well  For example, most retailers that we’ve contacted in the last few weeks   reported that sales have improved in August over earlier in the summer  In addition, the chair of   our board, whose firm is in the manufacturing area on a worldwide basis, reported to us just last   week that capital spending budgets finally seem to have been, to use his word, “unleashed”    Another director noted that low interest rates and available capital have enabled firms to find   capital for acquisition and expansion fairly readily  In our most recent survey of all thirty of our   head office and branch directors, about two-thirds of those who expressed an opinion about the   next six months—and that was most of them—thought conditions would improve, while about a   third thought the economy would just, in their words, “muddle along”  Finally, District hirings   continue to exceed layoffs and by a fair margin now  The ratio of announced planned hirings to   September 21, 2004 59 of 100          planned layoffs was 2½ to 1 in the third quarter, greatly surpassing the previous high of 1¼ to 1   earlier in the year   Based on recent evidence like this and on forecasts by our staff, I believe the most likely   outcome is continued good growth in the 3½ to 4 percent range, as suggested by others  The   uncertainty seems to center on whether hiring will pick up, and I agree that the most likely   outcome is that it will strengthen as we move through the remainder of this year and into next   year  On the inflation outlook, it appears that the Committee and others were correct in that the   spring increases were temporary and price inflation has settled back to more-modest levels  In   that environment, my judgment is that what I would describe as our careful, systematic   movement toward a more neutral fed funds rate is serving us well  Thank you     I support the recommendation and the press release  "
7631,2004-11-10,HOENIG,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Let me first talk a little about the region, which   has continued to show expansion since our last meeting  Despite some tentativeness on the part of   businesses and consumers that I think was tied to the election, we’re seeing some rather positive   developments  Consumer spending edged up a bit during this recent period  Auto manufacturing,   as I’ve heard others say, was a little slow  That was driven very much by whether or not incentives   were being offered; as they were pulled off, sales have gone down  So I suspect sales incentives   will come back as we move through the rest of this year  Energy activity in our region has risen   November 10, 2004 39 of 107    rather briskly with the higher oil prices and especially the higher natural gas prices; we’ve seen a lot   of activity develop as a result of that   As I mentioned, many of our contacts said that the preoccupation with the election was   causing businesses and consumers both to do some postponing  With that behind us, they really do   expect some pickup in activity  I would also mention that on the manufacturing side we have seen   some pretty positive developments continue across our region, particularly in support of small   manufacturing  That was very encouraging to us  We’ve seen indications from a number of   businesses that they are more forward-looking than I’ve ever seen in terms of what they’re prepared   to do and their expectations for increased business  There is, I think, a change in attitude   developing that is worth noting   Looking at the national level going forward, we judge that the continued accommodative   stance of monetary policy and some of the easing of headwinds created by energy prices should   now contribute to a healthy pace of economic growth in 2005 and 2006  Specifically, it appears as   though growth will remain above trend, in the 3½ to 4 percent range, as others have noted  While I   do not want to make too much of one data release, I agree with the point others have made that the   payroll numbers do provide some evidence of a significantly more positive forecast than we might   otherwise have been thinking about  I would also note that, with this kind of growth continuing,   there are some indications that prices could move up maybe a tenth or two in the first part of next   year  We will see, of course   There are some upside as well as downside risks that I think we have to keep in mind  First   of all, on the upside, I think the removal of some of the uncertainty that has been in the market is a   very important factor going forward  As for the labor markets, I think their strength is evident in   more than just this last report  If we look at the revisions that were made to the data for previous   months, we’re now talking of average monthly increases of about 190,000 over the last four   November 10, 2004 40 of 107    months, and in my view that’s a pretty healthy pace  If it continues, that may point to a more   optimistic outlook for consumer spending as we move forward  Also, with the adjustments in the   dollar, we may see some reduction in our current account deficit, which will be less of a drag on the   GDP numbers  As for the downside risks, I think we may see some increase in personal saving  I   believe it will be very modest, but it may be a factor offsetting attitudes toward increased consumer   spending  Finally, while energy prices have been backing off, energy is always a wild card and   could be a player as we move forward  On balance, though, I think the outlook is favorable, which   in my view puts us in a position where we should continue to remove our policy accommodation   and move back toward the neutral stance of policy that we’d like to attain  Thank you    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I agree with your recommendation  I wanted to   say, notwithstanding your comments on productivity, with which I don’t disagree, that the fact is   that the real fed funds rate today is zero  I’d be more inclined to the view that we need to pause if   the real fed funds rate were in fact positive—or to put it another way if the nominal rate were in the   November 10, 2004 80 of 107    2½ to 3 percent range, which is what I think you may be suggesting  So as long as the rate is below   what I would consider a reasonable, neutral rate—and zero fits that criterion—then I don’t think we   should be pausing  That’s not to say that we should move every time we meet next year—I realize   that’s not the case—but I think the rate needs to be at a positive level, as you’re suggesting  In my   view, the discussion at our meeting in February of next year will be important, and I think changing   the language at that point will be important as well  "
7656,2004-12-14,HOENIG,"  Mr Chairman, let me start briefly with my reaction to the national economy   where I think, as discussed in the Greenbook, growth remains above trend and, barring unexpected   events, is likely to remain above trend for the next couple of years  If this is correct, we will   gradually approach our long-run potential GDP  More specifically, we expect that growth will be   near but slightly below 4 percent this year and next  With trend growth of about 3¼ percent, we   estimate that we approach potential at the rate of about ¾ percentage point per year  This outlook is   similar, as I said, to the Greenbook and to the December Blue Chip consensus forecast as well     Several factors obviously contribute to this; they’ve been mentioned, and I’ll only touch on   them  They include our continued accommodative monetary policy, strong consumer spending that   seems to be continuing, and labor markets that are in better shape than we thought—  December 14, 2004 34 of 118           notwithstanding, as some have commented, the recent claims numbers  Moreover, wealth is higher,   as reflected in the stock market and housing prices  And, of course, oil prices have declined   I think the evidence from our District supports this outlook  Headed into Thanksgiving,   retailers were generally optimistic about the holiday shopping season  Almost all of the mall   managers we contacted just last week said the holiday season had gotten off to a good, though not   spectacular, start, with traffic and sales up several percentage points from a year ago  Travel and   tourism activity have also been very solid, and Rocky Mountain resort owners expect a big increase   in foreign ski visits this winter due to the lower dollar  In addition, manufacturing firms remain   quite optimistic about future activity and plan moderate increases in capital spending and   employment during the first half of next year   Let me briefly mention our agricultural economy, which will enjoy a record-breaking year   in 2004  Farm income is 25 percent above last year’s record high and 50 percent above previous   2004 estimates  With historically high livestock prices, the bulk of the income gains have come   from that sector  In addition, crop production for corn, soybeans, wheat, and so forth, was up 12 to   25 percent this year, with corn and soybean producers posting record years  Even with these large   supplies, prices remain well above their ten-year average  This record farm income has translated   into higher land values  In the Tenth District, ranch land values have soared 10 percent above levels   of a year ago  Non-irrigated cropland values are up 7 percent from a year ago, and irrigated   cropland values are up 5 percent  As a result, equipment sales are also surging  For example, in   October, sales of large equipment ranged anywhere from 25 to 50 percent above year-ago levels    Finally, analysts expect equipment sales to increase in December, as farmers and ranchers take   advantage of purchases to cut their tax bills   December 14, 2004 35 of 118           Turning to the inflation outlook, inflation remains modest, although there are some signs   that it may be rising, as others have noted  Core PCE inflation is 1½ percent over the most recent   twelve-month period, and core CPI inflation is 2 percent  We have seen some increases in core   inflation over the last couple of months  In addition, as others have noted, even though five- to ten-  year inflation compensation remains relatively stable, five-year inflation compensation has   increased  Finally, while oil prices have decreased—a positive—the dollar continues on balance to   depreciate  District manufacturers continue to expect upward pressure on producer prices  For the   twelfth month in a row, a net positive percentage of firms raised output prices; this follows three   straight years of constant or falling output prices  In addition, the future finished goods price index   rose to its second highest reading on record in November, trailing only the peak of April 2004    With sluggish employment growth and increased layoffs, wage pressures do remain slight     These results, on balance, suggest to me at least that we should continue steadily moving the   federal funds rate closer to what we might consider a long-run neutral level  In addition, I would   submit that the risk of higher inflation than in the Greenbook baseline is large enough that we   should be thinking about continuing to raise rates on a systematic basis—and by more than assumed   in the Greenbook  First, the Greenbook forecasts that the output gap will be eliminated by the end   of 2006 and that core PCE inflation will be 1½ percent or just under that, and yet the real fed funds   rate is only 185 percent  Since this is below the Board staff’s medium-run equilibrium fed funds   rate—what I’ll call neutral—we should expect higher inflation beginning in 2006  Second, we   know that all forecasts have error bands, and the Greenbook provides enough information that we   can calculate the probability that the output gap is eliminated in 2005 or early 2006  I would submit   that the probability is large enough that we should be concerned about higher inflation in these   years  And third, the federal funds rate remains below neutral for the entire forecast period  My   December 14, 2004 36 of 118           point is that the output gap is being eliminated and, when this occurs, the risk of inflation, of course,   rises     Therefore, I think we should be moving the federal funds rate at a fairly steady pace toward   the lower bound at least of estimates of neutral—barring any shocks, of course  Once we get close   to what most consider the lower bound of neutral, we can become more cautious at that point and   begin to speak of pauses  I’d submit, however, that we are not yet at that point and that we should   not become overly cautious at this time  Thank you    I support your recommendation    I support early release of the minutes, Mr Chairman  I have for some time    I think it will give a better sense of the Committee’s views and the process of its thinking with   regard to policy, and I believe that will serve the market well  "
7683,2005-02-01,HOENIG," Thank you, Mr Chairman  First of all, I am a firm believer that low and   stable inflation is of paramount importance for an economy to have long-term health  I’ve held that   view for a long time, having experienced some of the effects in our region of an inflationary cycle   and the washout that comes with that   Let me say that I thought these papers on whether we should adopt an explicit price target   were good and very helpful As I read through them, I came to the conclusion that there wasn’t, as   you said, a lot of evidence suggesting that explicit price objectives have a negative effect and that   there was some perhaps weak evidence that they may have helped to anchor long-term inflation   expectations Based on that, I’d be inclined, depending on how the rest of today’s discussion goes,   to support using a range for consumer price inflation as an objective  Given its general acceptance   by the public, I would choose CPI inflation because it’s better known And I would have an   objective somewhere in the range of 1 to 2 percent or 1½ to 2½ percent  I also think the horizon   should be the medium term and that, therefore, the objective should be total CPI  If the horizon were   short, I would agree with Governor Bernanke that the objective should be stated in terms of the core   CPI While somewhat vague, I think a medium-term period would provide the information that   would be important for anchoring long-term inflation expectations  I would also monitor very   closely core inflation and use it to explain deviations of inflation from the target range  I think it can   be very helpful that way   I also agree with the point that an explicit inflation objective might be perceived as unduly   emphasizing one component of our dual mandate, and I think that’s a legitimate concern  I would   think we could avoid this perception by ensuring that we always talk about both objectives in   discussing monetary policy strategy and operations—although we can’t put a target on the growth   side That’s something we need to think about and work through  But I don’t think it should   necessarily inhibit us from going down this path           February 1-2, 2005 21 of 177  Finally, let me mention only briefly how we might go about introducing an explicit   numerical goal  I do not think we need congressional approval, but I’m not the expert on that  I   defer on that to someone who is an expert, but I’d prefer not to go that way   I could accept having the Committee vote each year on a medium-term inflation objective    That would allow us to take into account a changing environment, a changing economy, and   changing dynamics  While this would allow for the possibility that the objective could change,   depending on developments, I doubt that we would change it very significantly or often  I assume   that we’d probably reaffirm the previous year’s objective or modify it slightly based on changing   circumstances  And I think having such an objective would serve us well in terms of keeping us   focused on a primary goal of long-term price stability  I’ll stop with that, Mr Chairman  Thank   you   Thank you, Mr Chairman  For the economy, growth currently remains   above trend and, as we all know, is likely to remain above trend several quarters forward  As a   result, we are systematically approaching long-run potential GDP for the economy  I expect growth   will be near 4 percent this year—above trend There are obvious reasons for this monetary policy   remains accommodative, consumer spending on goods and housing is strong, and business   equipment spending is strong  While fourth-quarter growth was below expectations, final sales to   domestic purchasers were at a robust 43 percent pace  And I think the labor market continues to   improve   Evidence from our District is very much in line with this outlook  Most retailers we   contacted said that holiday sales were moderately higher than a year ago, and many said that sales   were above their plan In addition, many ski resorts in our region reported sharp increases in hotel   occupancy and a near-record volume of ski visits, many from foreigners  Job growth picked up in   December  Hiring announcements since the last FOMC meeting exceeded layoff announcements by   a margin of two to one, and a substantial fraction of small and midsized manufacturers said that they   plan to increase employment in the coming months  District manufacturing continues to expand at a   brisk pace; production, new orders, and employment all rose in December, and firms remained   upbeat about future activity Capital spending plans for 2005 are reported strong   We all know where the price indexes are right now but, looking to the future, I would expect   to see further increases in core inflation With the federal funds rate below the lower bound of most   estimates for the neutral rate, I remain alert to the greater or increasing risk of inflation  In addition,   there are several other reasons to think that this upside risk may be rising  First of all, as others have   said here today, we are hearing more about the return to pricing power  Further, a greater pass-  through of higher commodity prices seems to be occurring  The possibility of continued dollar   depreciation is strong, as is a greater pass-through of higher import prices  And slowing productivity   growth, leading to higher unit labor costs, is on the horizon                          February 1-2, 2005 101 of 177  Evidence from the District supports these observations  For example, the fraction of   businesses reporting labor shortages was 53 percent in January, up significantly from last quarter and   last year As a result, wage pressures in the District have also increased  About 26 percent of the   employers contacted in January said that they had to boost wages more than normal as compared to   17 percent last quarter and 11 percent a year ago In addition, our manufacturing survey showed   evidence of greater pricing power For example, among respondents reporting higher input prices,   the share who also reported higher output prices has risen markedly, from 40 percent in the fourth   quarter of 2003 to 60 percent in the fourth quarter of 2004, the same as before the recession    Similarly, among those who expect to pay higher input prices going forward, those who also expect   to charge higher output prices has risen markedly from 41 to 51 percent   In summary, the outlook for the nation and our region is certainly good  Growth is robust,   and we are hearing increasingly that there is a lot of money looking for opportunity  I would submit   that the risk of higher inflation, therefore, is now large enough that we should at least be thinking   about raising rates more aggressively toward neutral than we have in the past  Thank you   I support it  "
7708,2005-03-22,HOENIG," Mr Chairman, looking at the economy, we expect growth will be in line   with what others have said—in the 4 percent range this year and slightly above 3½ percent next   year With trend growth of about 3¼ percent, obviously the output gap and labor market slack are   diminishing  There are a whole host of reasons for that, which Dave already outlined, and I won’t   repeat them    I will say that from the Tenth District perspective, our information supports this more robust   outlook Most retailers we contacted said that sales were up from last year’s already solid levels  In                          March 22, 2005 28 of 116  addition, travel and tourism continued to improve, as the dollar has helped to increase ski visits and   hotel occupancy in the mountain states  Labor markets remain strong, with hiring announcements   exceeding layoffs by about a 1¼-to-1 ratio since our previous FOMC meeting  And, finally, District   manufacturing continues to expand strongly  Production, new orders, and employment all rose in   February Moreover, firms remain optimistic about future activity and plan moderate increases in   employment and capital spending going forward this year   I’ll make most of my comments on the inflation outlook, because I do have some concern   about that I was struck by David’s point that, as for inflation breaking out, he would put it in terms   of a “not yet” statement  But as I view the outlook, I expect, even with the fed funds rate rising as   we currently are projecting, that inflation will increase and perhaps could accelerate in 2005 and   2006   Here are some reasons for that  First, we have been in an accommodative mode of policy for   an extended period of time now—years, not quarters—with the fed funds rate below most estimates   of neutral over much of that period  Core inflation, by whatever measure you pick—core CPI or   PCE or the market-based core PCE—drifted higher last year  Not only did core inflation drift   higher, it was unexpectedly higher than earlier projections This unexpected increase is notable   because it occurred even though real GDP growth was as expected and the fed funds rate was being   increased If inflation could increase that much last year in the presence of sizable slack and a rising   fed funds rate, I am concerned that, with less slack in the economy this year, we will end up with yet   higher inflation   In addition, a number of indicators suggest continuing inflationary pressures  For example,   we have higher cost pressures resulting from higher commodity prices, which we mentioned, and   from oil prices and the lower dollar  As a result, we also are seeing high PPI inflation and increases                             March 22, 2005 29 of 116  in unit labor costs that may not be dramatic yet, but they are increasing  Wage pressures are   emerging in our District  About a quarter of the employers we contacted said that they’ve had to   raise wages more than normal, particularly for skilled workers   We are also seeing evidence of increased pricing power in the Tenth District, as firms have   more confidence in their ability to raise output prices even without an increase in input costs  For   example, we asked our survey participants a special question about whether their ability to raise   prices had improved since the beginning of just this year  Of 77 responses, more than half said   clearly yes   The final reason I see an upside risk for inflation is that monetary policy does, in fact, remain   accommodative  The federal funds rate is currently below most estimates of the neutral rate  Even   with the Greenbook’s assumptions of tighter policy, the fed funds rate will end the year below or at   the lower end of estimates of the medium-run neutral rate  This poses a significant upside risk to   inflation, because it is likely that much of the slack in the economy will have been eliminated by the   end of the year With output close to potential and core inflation elevated, I think we should aim to   be comfortably within the range of neutral by the end of the year, not at the lower end   Overall, with growth above trend, I am concerned that there is an upside risk to inflation   even with the funds rate path consistent with the projections we are seeing currently I believe we   should begin moving more aggressively to bring the fed funds rate closer to the long-run neutral rate   sooner I would submit that, as long as the funds rate remains significantly below neutral, the risk   that we will need to raise it 50 basis points can be managed  Now, I say that, but I also realize that a   50 basis point increase, while it could be justified, would surprise financial markets  So perhaps we   should begin to signal the market that a more aggressive return to neutral is at least possible  But   rather than tinker with the language in the press announcement, which makes me nervous, I would                                   March 22, 2005 30 of 116  prefer to shorten it and drop any reference to measured pace  After reading the minutes in three   weeks, markets will know that a more aggressive policy is possible  In other words, we don’t have   to provide a long explanation today And in fact, in testimony you gave earlier, I think you dropped   the “measured” language; therefore, I don’t think changing that part of the statement would surprise   the markets at all  Thanks   Mr Chairman, I’m okay with this  I do want to say, though, that your last   comment on the loss function is really a major concern of mine  To the extent that we are too slow   on moving back into the neutral zone, I think the danger is that later on we will have to go higher   faster and the impact on the economy will be more significant at that point  I think we’re at that   point, and that’s why at the May meeting it is so important that we make some hard choices  And I   am worried about that  "
7734,2005-05-03,HOENIG," Mr Chairman, I’ll start off by repeating the obvious  There have been a   couple of surprises since our last FOMC meeting  The economy has lost momentum after the end of   the first quarter, and core inflation has continued to rise The loss of momentum we saw in March in                                 May 3, 2005 47 of 116  the first quarter has led me to join others in marking down my forecast for growth this year to about   3½ percent I expect growth in the second half of this year to be about 3¾ percent and then slow   perhaps back to 3½ percent next year With trend growth of about 3¼ percent, the output gap and   labor market slack should continue to diminish, as we’ve said before     I would agree with those who attribute much of the slowdown to the persistence of higher   energy prices This is especially the case for consumer spending and confidence, as we see it    Higher energy costs have also reduced growth in other countries, and I think that probably has   contributed to some of the worsening in our trade balance   Obviously, we need a little more time and information to determine whether the recent   economic performance reflects temporary factors or is likely to be more permanent  If it is   temporary, then, as energy prices level off or perhaps decline somewhat, I would expect the   fundamental forces of growth to take over—those being monetary policy that, in my opinion,   remains accommodative and financial conditions that are, perhaps, highly accommodative   I’ll digress here by giving you just one anecdote I talked recently to an executive of one of   our major banks that lends across the nation in some of the hot markets  He described a   condominium deal, a fairly large one, where the construction cost was about $100 million  The   developers had $3 million of equity in the project  Those who lent $97 million lent those funds on a   pro forma sale price that finished out at $140 million  So there is a lot of speculation, I think, in   these markets  And that is something that we have to take into account    But I also see that the labor and capital markets that we talk about here are strengthening  So   overall I think the evidence is that the economy will improve  And I would say, from a regional   perspective, that the Tenth District mostly provides support for an improving outlook, though I   acknowledge that there are issues with respect to energy prices For example, consumer spending,                                 May 3, 2005 48 of 116  including travel and tourism, rose solidly in March and early April, and most retailers said sales   were up substantially from a year ago  In addition, housing activity turned up, following a pause in   late 2004 and early 2005 in our region Housing starts and permits rose solidly in March, and home   sales were strong in most of our District’s cities   Still, preliminary data from our manufacturing survey suggest some evidence of a slowdown    In fact, in April the production and shipments indexes both fell  More worrisome, though, was the   large decline in the six-month-ahead production, shipments, and new orders indexes  This bears   watching, since it may suggest a more permanent slowdown than we currently expect    In addition, a number of contacts expressed concerns to us about higher energy prices  For   example, in our April manufacturing survey, some firms said that they were delaying shipments in   order to assure full truckloads and thus save on fuel costs  A few firms also said that they expect to   cut back on production due to high energy costs In addition, some retailers were worried that higher   gasoline prices would eventually take a toll on their sales Of course, for our region, higher energy   prices are positive for some of our District’s states, particularly Oklahoma and Wyoming, where we   see nearly boom conditions   Turning to the inflation outlook, I do expect to see further increases in core inflation, with   core PCE inflation averaging almost 2 percent in 2005 and core CPI inflation averaging 2½ percent,   similar to the Greenbook forecast  However, unlike the Greenbook, I expect core inflation to remain   elevated in 2006 rather than to fall back I take note of the fact that energy price increases may be a   rock in the pond, but I think the substantially accommodative monetary policy we have had is more   like a boulder And it is carrying itself forward, which is what we need to be aware of and alert to   We continue to see increases in core inflation  Whether measured in 3-, 6-, or 12-month   periods, core CPI and core PCE inflation have generally been rising this year Moreover, core                                       May 3, 2005 49 of 116  inflation is now higher than at any time since the second half of 2001  In my opinion it is above   comfortable levels  Measured from six months ago, core CPI inflation is about 2½ percent and core   PCE inflation is above 2 percent Clearly, some of the increase represents temporary factors—such   as the energy prices we keep talking about and the prices of some commodities—and may be   reversed However, I would take note that the pass-through of energy prices to core inflation is   difficult to predict, as we talked about earlier, and may be greater than some suggest  I also believe   that there is more to the inflation story than energy prices  Even if we exclude the two largest   quarterly rates, core CPI inflation over the last four quarters was 2 percent, which is significantly   higher than core inflation over the previous four quarters   I believe some of the increase is the result of our continued accommodative policy  We’ve   seen inflation rise over the last year in the presence of sizable slack and a rising funds rate I’m   concerned that, with less slack in the economy, we will continue to see higher inflation going   forward In addition, maintaining an accommodative monetary policy poses an upside risk to   inflation, with the federal funds rate currently below many estimates of the lower bound of the   neutral rate If we are slow in removing this accommodation, I would be concerned that the increase   in core inflation also might be passed through to higher expected inflation   We’re also seeing some evidence of pricing power in the Tenth District, as manufacturers   continue to raise their output prices to cover what they’ve referred to as rising costs of energy and   other inputs In addition, the share of our Beige Book retail contacts who reported to us that they   were raising prices this time was the highest in the last five years   These are my concerns  The one other thing I would mention relates to our statement  I   would agree with those who would like to abbreviate our statement today  Since people are, in fact,   paying attention to the minutes, I’d rely on them as our communication method  Thank you                                 May 3, 2005 50 of 116  Well, I’m fine with where you’re going on this  I do agree that we ought to   talk about this at a future meeting  I’m more in favor of shortening the statement and just relying on   the minutes  Others have different views But with where we are today, with inertia, I think I’m fine   with your proposal  "
7761,2005-06-29,HOENIG,"  I may be asking your question over again, Mr Chairman, but I’m looking at   exhibit 6—at the PCE projections and the explanations for why core PCE is increasing  I guess   what you’re saying is that these are the reasons why  Then, going back to your discussion of labor   costs, there’s no discussion of productivity  So, are you more or less dismissing that as a factor in   terms of having a follow-through and pushing up core PCE?  Are you saying that labor is not that   significant a factor?  The issue of productivity coming down seems to me to be more relevant than   suggested here   Not compensation and not the possibility of productivity coming down and   being less able to absorb that factor in the future?    Part of what leaves me uneasy is that in the Greenbook the last several   times we have recognized that PCE inflation has been higher than we thought it would be and we   are projecting it to turn back down again  In this sense, there’s a continuation of the view that these   things are temporary and that they will back off at some point    Thank you, Mr Chairman  First of all, our view regarding the national   economy is basically similar to others I have heard here  We agree with the consensus of GDP   growth running about 3½ percent, slightly over our potential rate  And we see that going forward   through the rest of this year and into next year   I also would say that the anecdotal evidence coming from our region is very consistent with   this above-trend growth rate  Consumer spending continues to grow solidly, with retailers reporting   that sales were generally above plan and higher than a year ago through the first and second                     June 29-30, 2005 120 of 234  quarters  Tourism continues to expand briskly, boosting occupancy rates at hotels and resorts in our   region And energy activity remains high   One of the interesting anecdotes arose during a recent visit I made to the Cessna plant in   Wichita, which is booming right now  They have back orders for their jets—general aviation   aircraft—running well into 2007, with prices running from a mere $2½ million to a little better than   $20 million for their Citation 10, which flies at 08 mach  And the demand is incredible  So the   general economic environment reflected in these parts of our region really is consistent with a   strong growth rate going forward     On the national inflation outlook, I understand the arguments given today for why inflation   should continue to ease off  For that to occur, it is critical in my view that we continue to move   policy out of its current accommodative stance  If we don’t, I think we are stimulating demand—I   think it’s reflected in some of the other comments here and in some of the anecdotes that I’ve   pointed out—and I think we will have future upward adjustments in inflation as we move forward    So I think it is critical that we get ourselves closer to that neutral zone that we talk about, which no   one can pinpoint with certainty but which is probably somewhere between 3½ and 4½ percent  I’ll   leave it at that   Yes, I’m fine with your proposal  "
7790,2005-08-09,HOENIG," Yes, I have just a quick question  We’ve talked a great deal about the   intricacies of measuring the various price indexes—the PCE or whatever  I want to clarify,   though, that—regardless of which index one is looking at and adjusting—the trend line on   inflation is up over the last 12 to 18 months  Even with these adjustments, you still have a trend   line that is up, which I think is an important consideration   It’s higher than we thought, but not getting higher?    Mr Chairman, let me start with some thoughts on the national economy   I do expect growth in real GDP to average about 3¾ percent this year and 3½ percent next year    While this is somewhat slower than last year, it remains above trend  And the monetary policy   and financial conditions currently in place I think are poised to support continued above-trend   growth With growth above trend, the output gap and labor market slack will further diminish    In fact, the economy appears to be at or near full employment now, which is all the more reason   to have the federal funds rate above its current level    I’d like to turn for a bit to developments in our region, because the evidence from the   Tenth District is consistent with this strong outlook  For example, economic growth has   strengthened rather noticeably since our last meeting  Employment continued to expand, and in   the intermeeting period businesses announced substantially more new hires than layoffs in our   region Consumer spending also increased strongly, as retailers posted further gains, auto sales                                  August 9, 2005 58 of 110  rebounded, and tourist activity showed no effect that we could notice from higher gasoline   prices   In addition, energy held steady in terms of high levels of demand  Drilling has slowed in   the mature oil and gas fields of Oklahoma but has continued to grow strongly in newer fields in   the Rocky Mountain region Drilling in those areas continued to be constrained by a shortage of   equipment and labor  As a result—and I’ll repeat what Richard said—one Denver-based energy   company has ordered two Chinese rigs and rig crews for delivery this fall as well as several   additional rigs for the coming couple of years   While manufacturing activity expanded at a slower pace than in the spring, most firms   are optimistic about future sales and plan more hiring and investment to meet the increased   demand  A wide range of District businesses also reported sharply improved earnings due to   strong revenue growth systematically in our region  The only negative news on this level was   that commercial real estate markets continued to show only modest improvement and that   inventories of unsold homes were up noticeably in some of our cities   I think it is worth noting that a sizable area of extreme drought has developed throughout   the central Corn Belt states The drought affects much of Missouri and Illinois and parts of   Wisconsin and Indiana  Markets currently expect the nation’s corn crop to drop 10 percent and   the soybean crop to drop 4 percent As a result, corn and soybean prices have both risen about   13 percent since their planting  The USDA crop report that will come out later this week, on   August 12th, could trigger a further rally in prices if drought damage is greater than the market   currently expects   Turning to inflation, I think it is worth noting that core PCE inflation, as we discussed   quite extensively earlier, is now averaging about 2¼ percent this year and is expected to remain                                  August 9, 2005 59 of 110  at that pace next year While we continue to talk about this as being moderate, I think it is   important to recognize that it represents a continued upward adjustment of the inflation outlook   and is at the higher end of what most of us have indicated we are comfortable with  I also   remain concerned about the upward pressure on inflation  First, there is an upside risk from   higher energy prices and dollar depreciation  In addition, the real fed funds rate, using the core   PCE inflation, is only 12 percent  These factors, I think, pose an upside risk to inflation,   especially when combined with growth that remains above trend and an output gap that is small   and approaching zero   I believe we are now at a point where the upside risk to the economy is greater than the   downside risk  And while we appear committed to moving only 25 basis points today, and I   think the market would be surprised if we did otherwise, we ought to at least seriously consider   eliminating any reference to “measured pace” in our statement  To me it was noticeable in   listening to David today that, as we talk about the economy, potential is less than we expected,   demand is greater than expected, inflation is greater than we anticipated, and monetary policy is   probably 100 basis points below what most people think it should be  In my view, it’s time to   think about changing our statement  Thank you   Mr Chairman, I think we’re a little behind the curve  But I don’t see a   better solution in terms of going forward, so I support your recommendation  "
7814,2005-09-20,HOENIG," Thank you, Mr Chairman  There has been a lot of discussion on the   national economy and Katrina, and I don’t think I’ll repeat that  But I would say that I am in   agreement with the scenario the Greenbook has outlined here; we do expect a temporary   slowdown in the economy this year and then a pickup next year and beyond  And I think the   evidence from our region is consistent with that outlook                       September 20, 2005 66 of 117  Economic growth in the District remains strong, although businesses have expressed   some concern over the impact of Katrina on the regional economy  At the end of August,   though, employment was still growing solidly  Retailers reported further growth in sales; tourist   activity continued to show little effect from higher gasoline prices at that time; and   manufacturing activity had grown pretty solidly over the summer   In a special survey that we conducted following Katrina, a wide range of contacts said   that the disaster would have some negative effect on their businesses in terms of costs and the   availability of supplies  And a small percentage actually expected some positive effects from it   More specifically, a contact at a major railroad coming out of our District from Kansas City told   me that they were able to get their operations along the Gulf Coast back in order within just a   few days of Katrina and were back moving materials across that area at almost normal levels    So, there has been a fairly strong reaction in terms of bringing things back on line after Katrina   While the impacts of Katrina remain uncertain, I would say that analysts in the farm   sector are more optimistic than they were just a week ago, for example  The impact on the   transportation system, as I just mentioned, appears to be less than initially feared  Terminal   facilities are now reporting limited damage to physical infrastructure, and the unloading of   barges and loading of ocean-going vessels appear to be starting again  As a result, the   hurricane’s impact on agriculture will be primarily through higher fuel prices  Higher diesel and   natural gas prices have a large impact on crop production costs, as they boost the cost of   operating machinery, drying grain, fertilizers, and so forth  So overall I think activity in our   District will continue strong Katrina will have some impact on the region but not a major or   long-lasting one for the most part                           September 20, 2005 67 of 117  Turning to the inflation outlook, my concerns there have not changed since our last   meeting  Core inflation is higher than I would prefer, although it still is in the 2 percent plus   range Core CPI inflation, for example, is up 22 percent in August from a year ago, and other   measures of underlying CPI inflation are, in fact, higher and moving slowly up  In addition, I   believe the upside risks to inflation have increased, and I think we need to be aware of that and   sensitive to it   In my view, a pause now would in fact be more than a pause, because as others said—in   particular President Santomero—in this environment the data are going to come in weaker than   we would otherwise expect  So a pause now would be hard to reverse until sometime next year   The other point, which others also have noted, is that fundamentally monetary policy remains   accommodative for now  We have been removing accommodation but policy is still   accommodative, and I think we need to keep that in mind  Therefore, I think we should continue   on that path as we move forward from this point  I would agree, though, since we have been   removing accommodation for a while, that at some point here in the next few meetings we   should be talking about changing the language and about how close we are to neutral on the   funds rate I think that will be an important and interesting discussion for us  However, for the   time being, I think we should stay on our course and remove accommodation at the pace we have   been doing in recent months  Thank you   Mr Chairman, I support your recommendation  And having listened to   your comments, I would like to invoke the central banker’s prayer from Jackson Hole this year    It says, “Lord, if there be shocks, let them be varied and preferably moderate ones so that we can   stress test our systems”  [Laughter]  "
7836,2005-11-01,HOENIG,"  Mr Chairman, thank you  My views on the national outlook remain pretty   much unchanged from the last meeting  I think growth will be somewhat slower in the second half   of this year and then stronger next year due to the reconstruction activity  The rise in energy prices   will have a dampening effect on growth to some degree  Nonetheless, the resilience that the US   economy has so far experienced following the hurricanes suggests that real GDP will grow at above   trend, at least over the near-term forecast period  Several other factors are consistent with that    Financial conditions remain supportive; fiscal policy is stimulative; and as I’ve noted and many   have already mentioned here today, there is a momentum in the economy   Evidence from the Tenth District is consistent with this outlook  District manufacturing   activity continues to expand at a solid pace, and capital spending plans at District factories have   rebounded, after dipping slightly following the hurricanes  As a further sign of solid business   confidence, hiring announcements for District businesses have exceeded layoff announcements by a   wide margin since the last meeting   On the negative side, though, higher energy prices have eroded consumer confidence in our   region as well as nationally, leading to somewhat slower consumer spending  For example, retailers   contacted in the first half of October reported sales were generally unchanged from a year ago, a   marked change from the summer when many stores were reporting solid year-over-year growth in                                         November 1, 2005 53 of 114  sales Homes in some parts of our District have been taking a little longer to sell, causing some   builders to lower their prices or at least increase the incentives around the sales efforts   Turning to inflation, let me talk a little bit about evidence from our District, because we are   seeing further inflationary pressures  Wage pressures, while still modest, are beginning to show   through Manufacturers are reporting sharply higher costs for natural gas and petroleum-based raw   materials  Some of our manufacturers are also reporting increased costs of building materials, such   as steel and lumber, as a result of the reconstruction effort elsewhere  But adding to this, District   manufacturers are finding it somewhat easier, as others have noted, to pass their higher costs on to   customers  For example, in the special question we asked this month, 30 percent of the firms said   that their pricing power had increased over the last three months, but only 14 percent said their   pricing power had decreased  Retailers have also been showing somewhat greater determination to   raise prices to cover their higher costs, although the retail price increases have been mostly modest   so far   With this said, I want to tell Dave that I think today’s report on the Greenbook and the   discussion have been very, very helpful  It’s beginning to redirect the discussion from one of a clear   position of removing accommodation to a discussion of the correct range for the fed funds rate and   where it should fall if we are to maintain stable prices and sustainable growth   Obviously, I share with others here the view that inflation is currently the main concern    Energy is an obvious pressure, there is strong momentum in much of the economy, and there are   some signs of changing inflationary expectations  I think this is something we have to be alert to    But since our policy actions today have their final effects months in the future, I think it’s also   important that we begin to address inflation and whether the rise is transitory because of the energy   effect, or whether we are, in fact, seeing some inflationary pressures that will become embedded                                             November 1, 2005 54 of 114  going forward  If it is transitory, then the question is, I think legitimately, where should we stop?   What is the right range?  Is it near where we are now or should it go higher?   For now, my own views are that we should be moving the funds rate somewhat higher, as   others have suggested, and that this perhaps would be a reasonable place to stop  What exactly is   the appropriate area, I think, should be a continued focus of this Committee’s discussions in the   meetings ahead  I would also share the sentiment that we need to carefully rethink the FOMC   statement coming out of these meetings  I think it is becoming badly out of date and, as a result,   may lose credibility  So now is the time to start a serious discussion about changing it  I welcome   Janet’s comments and others here today Thank you    I agree with what you are proposing  "
7858,2005-12-13,HOENIG,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’d describe the outlook for the US economy as   solid, as the Greenbook has described it  Obviously, several factors contribute to this, including the   forward momentum that’s in the economy, the lagged effects of past monetary accommodation   (which we’ve talked about in the past), very supportive financial conditions, and stimulative fiscal   policy   I would say that the evidence from the Tenth District is consistent with this broader outlook as   well, but we also are seeing some slowing in certain areas  Energy activity in our area continues to   expand at a very substantial pace  There is still a shortage of workers to support some of the   expansion that’s being sought  Manufacturers remain upbeat about future activity and plan increases   in capital spending over the next six months  In addition, consumer spending, after dropping   following the hurricanes, has rebounded solidly in our region  However, there is the point that David   mentioned about housing activity, which does appear to be leveling off in our region  And while   manufacturing activity continues to expand, it is at a somewhat slower pace  I would make note of   the fact that we also are being affected by some of the GM issues, since GM is closing its plant in   Oklahoma City and that will idle about 2,400 workers   Turning to the inflation outlook, I expect core CPI inflation to be in the area of 23 percent   next year, as higher energy prices pass through to higher overall core inflation and as the effects of our   past accommodative policy show through  However, I expect that the increases may be temporary, as   productivity growth remains strong and as energy prices recede from where they have been, if that   continues Nevertheless, I still would expect the inflation number to be in the 2 percent or slightly   higher range                                   December 13, 2005 30 of 100  But that said, I think there continues to be a good case for further tightening at today’s   meeting  Beyond that, I would say it is less certain, as Michael said, and I think in our statement the   matter should be couched in the near term  And I’ll stop there as well  Thank you    Mr Chairman, I support your recommendation, and I guess I can go with the   language  The one thing that your comments raised in my mind relates to row 3, the rationale part of   the statement, where it talks about possible increases in resource utilization  I wonder if we shouldn’t   have a statement that talks about the carry-on effects of past accommodative policy because that’s   what you’re really talking about when you get into asset value issues  I’m not saying we have to do   that, but that came to my mind as I listened to your comments  Other than that, I’m fine with your   proposal    Right  I don’t disagree with you  That’s the only thing that occurred to me,   but I’m fine with your proposal  I think we need to keep going  "
7880,2006-01-31,HOENIG,"  Mr Chairman, in thinking about the status of the US economy and the   appropriate funds rate target at this meeting, I would start by suggesting that, in my judgment at   least, the current funds rate is probably within the neutral range  Therefore, we should be mindful   of not going too far, especially when it would appear that growth is slowing to trend  The most   compelling reason for considering the move now is the continued drift upward in core inflation, but   even in this case, I think we need to be especially aware of the past increases in the funds rate  We   have yet to see their full effects on inflation   The fourth-quarter growth was surprising; but at this point, as others have said, it does not   yet alter our long-term outlook  Like the staff, however, I revised upward my 2006 forecast   ¼ percentage point and now expect that growth will be about 3¾ percent in 2006, about   ½ percentage point above trend, and will return to trend in 2007  Turning to the inflation outlook, I   expect core CPI inflation to be about 2½ percent this year, as higher energy prices are passed   through to higher overall and core inflation  However, it is reasonable to expect that the increase   will be temporary, as others have said, with core inflation likely to fall back to 2¼ percent in 2007    The reasons for this pattern have a familiar ring  Greater-than-trend growth reflects the lagged   effects of past monetary accommodation and generally supportive financial conditions, whereas the   prospective slowing growth reflects the removal of monetary accommodation and, in this instance,   higher energy prices   Evidence from our District is consistent with an outlook of strong but slowing growth as   well  Manufacturing production and new orders rose solidly  Expectations for future production   remained high, and expectations for future orders actually surged  Hiring plans also rose strongly in   December and January  However, for the District as a whole, hiring announcements were only   January 31, 2006 49 of 106    slightly greater than layoff announcements  Finally, housing showed signs of leveling off, and   consumer spending was solid, though not spectacular, during the holiday season  In fact, a number   of our contacts said their holiday sales were below plan  Just quickly in the farm sector, there are   concerns being voiced for 2006 following a generally good year in 2005, and they were mostly that   drought may be reemerging in the District   Wage pressures in the District remain mostly subdued, and increases in raw material costs   actually slowed somewhat  However, manufacturers continued to raise output prices in response to   past increases in input costs, and a substantial number said they were raising wages more than   normal for certain types of workers in short supply  Reports of retail prices said that increases were   down somewhat from the last meeting but still higher than they were just last summer   Let me turn just briefly to the risks  I would submit that inflation risks are on the upside and   output risks have become more on the downside recently, not exactly the kinds of risk that are   friendly from a policy perspective  The outlook for core inflation is 2¼ to 2½ percent  This is   higher than I would prefer  Moreover, the potential for even higher energy prices makes core   inflation more likely to be higher rather than lower over the next several months  But at the same   time, the risks to output are on the downside  First, forward momentum has certainly diminished    For example, real GDP grew about 26 percent during the last half of 2005, decidedly below trend    In addition, while the fourth-quarter slowdown was probably temporary, it could also be signaling a   more fundamental slowdown  Finally, a possible increase in the term premium poses downside   risks to growth  You know the term premium is far below the historical average  If the decline   reverses faster than expected, both would be significantly weaker as shown by the Greenbook   alternative scenario  As I see things then falling out, the choices are obviously difficult, but I think   that the inflation risk for the time-being is the greater risk, and therefore I would be inclined to move   January 31, 2006 50 of 106    at this meeting  But we should have the odds no greater than 50-50 that more upward changes are   likely in the fed funds rate at the next meeting   And finally, Mr Chairman, although I have not served as long with you as some others   around this table, I have served among the longest with you, and I would like you to know it has   been a real privilege    Yes, Mr Chairman, I agree with your proposal  I’m very pleased with   taking the word “well” out just because I think the statement should be giving the market 50–50   odds rather than something greater than that as we look forward  And we are data dependent  So I   really prefer that  And I agree with postponing the discussion on procedure for the next meeting    There’s much to be done, and I think in the transition we need to wait until then  "
7902,2006-03-27,HOENIG,"  Dave and Karen, my question is basically to ask you to give me your sense   of the risk  In reading the Greenbook, I have a sense that the risk is balanced  I see that interest   rates go up and then they come back down  So I understand that overall the risk is balanced in your   view  But what do you sense are some of the most pressing risks we have?  Because when you look   at the alternative scenarios—and they’re very interesting—two of them, the productivity factor and   the term premium on the yield curve, seem to have the greatest effect  But what in this outlook do   you sense is perhaps our greatest exposure?  I think that’s what we’re trying to anticipate—where   the economy will be and what may affect it negatively    Thank you, Mr Chairman  A couple of things, first, on the region  Like   the nation, our region continues to grow at a fairly robust pace  But one of the questions we kept   asking in our discussions was whether it was strong but leveling out, or accelerating  I think, for the   most part, the consensus is that it’s strong but leveling out  Turning to just a couple of examples,   manufacturing activity did expand in February and, we think, in March on a preliminary basis, but   at a somewhat slower pace than in January and even in December for us  Production and new   orders rose only modestly in the February and early March period  Housing activity, as others have   discussed, has shown some signs of leveling off, although it is still high by historical standards    Residential construction has edged down in most areas of our District, and builders to whom we’ve   talked expect further easing in the months ahead  I think it is important, too, that home sales are   showing little or no growth, with high-end sales softer than most of the other segments in our   markets    Just to mention commercial real estate, it has actually improved somewhat in our region    Vacancy rates have continued to edge down in the Denver and Kansas City areas, so we have seen   March 27-28, 2006 Authorized for Public Release 60 of 167       some pickup in activity  Energy activity continues to expand very rapidly, despite shortages of   labor and equipment throughout the western part of our region  In some of our Rocky Mountain   communities, concern has increased that the energy boom will drive away some of the other core   business because of the costs of labor, land, and houses—it is really a boom environment there   I will talk quickly about inflation in our area  Wage pressures, in fact, remain mostly   subdued  We have seen some backdown in wholesale prices, although retail prices have edged up    Manufacturers reported to us somewhat slower growth in raw material prices so far this year   compared with last year  However, I would say they are also concerned that they cannot pass price   increases on as they work through the process   Let me just say one thing on the auto industry in our region  I talked with one of the largest   retailers-dealers in the region, in Denver—actually, he goes into Texas and some other areas  He   told me that in just the first two weeks of March they’ve seen a general slowdown in some demand   for their products, both domestic and foreign  But he said that, obviously, the domestic market is   really suffering greatly  In fact, he has seen other dealers refuse to take inventory from the domestic   auto dealers, which gives him real concern about that industry going forward   Turning quickly to the national outlook, I agree that, for the most part, it is very positive  I   think that in the first quarter, maybe the first half, we will see a strong GDP number, perhaps as high   as the Greenbook has indicated or even higher, which will then move back down toward the trend   rate of growth over the course of the year  Like President Stern, I think part of this in the first   quarter and first half is reflective of a couple of things  One is the bounceback from the year-end    Another is the last effects of accommodative policy that we had in the previous year, because a lot   of money is still searching to be deployed right now but is beginning to be used up  And for the first   time in a while, I’ve heard more and more businesses talk about the prime rate  I haven’t heard that   March 27-28, 2006 Authorized for Public Release 61 of 167       in four years  They are much more sensitive to it  They’ve seen it go up, and now they’re   negotiating around that, which I think tells you that some of the catch-up in terms of the policy   effects of our past moves has begun, and I think you’ll see more of it in the coming months and   quarters    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I have a slightly different view  I would go   with A  I wouldn’t dissent over it if I were a voting member, but I would push very hard for   signaling that we are just about at the end  And here is a bit of my reasoning  I think we are at   or in the area of equilibrium in terms of the fed funds rate  Perhaps we’re even at the upper end    I know we can’t observe what the equilibrium rate is, but then we can’t observe the NAIRU   March 27-28, 2006 Authorized for Public Release 116 of 167       either, and we tend to put a lot of weight on that  If we believe our projections—the Greenbook   or our own projections—I suggest we are moving back toward trend, even without further   actions  Then I think we are where we need to be  If we believe the Greenbook that we need to   raise the rate and then come back down, then we are about where we need to be    So I think that’s important to keep in mind  Also, probably most in this room have said   at one time or another that monetary policy acts with a lag, but we never believe it  And here we   are, we’ve tightened for how long?  We recently tightened again  We are at a point at which we   say there aren’t really inflationary pressures, and yet we have tightened up  The outlook is that   we would move to trend, and yet we haven’t had the full effects of our recent tightenings  The   fourth quarter was weak but for transitory reasons; and the first quarter bump-up was a   bounceback for the weak fourth quarter, and we’re heading toward trend  I think we are where   we need to be, and we need to be patient about that  And about whether we move again—we   ought to have our language say that we are not moving but that we may if the data come in   stronger than we anticipated and than our own projections suggest they would    So here we are anxious again about it  The economy is strong  We’ve heard it’s strong    And yet we don’t believe that it will taper off, so we’ve got to do something about it  And that is   our history—always going too far  I think that’s what we’re in danger of  Whether we go to   4¾ percent today is not the issue  The issue is that we are about where we should be, and if   we’re going to signal something, that’s what we should be signaling to the market     First of all, I like the format much better—the fact that we have an   opportunity to express our opinions on policy before we have to react to you does open the   conversation, and it does allow you to not feel that you have to get your policy in during the   initial go-round Now, as to whether it’s one day or two days, I’m indifferent  If it works out   that we like to have the additional time the day before, I’m fine with that  Or we will find out   next time if we can have the different format within one day  That will be fine as well  So I’m   most impressed with the different format  "
7926,2006-05-10,HOENIG,"  May I just ask about the breakeven rate in TIPS—we looked at it and saw   perhaps some seasonality to it  Is that just nonsense, or have you looked at it or thought about it?    Usually this part of the year    But you haven’t actually systematically looked at it?    Thank you    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Let me start with our District  Evidence from the   District continues to show strong growth  While consumer spending has shown some modest slowing,   retailers remain very optimistic in our surveys about future sales, and this despite some of the recent   increases in energy prices  Manufacturing activity continues to grow solidly, and energy activity   May 10, 2006 47 of 120    remains, of course, very strong in our area, with continued reports of shortages of both labor and   equipment   Housing markets in the District are cooling, as you’ve heard described elsewhere, and illustrate I   think a potential downside risk overall  Though it’s still high by historical standards, residential   construction continues to edge downward  Home sales were still growing modestly in most areas but   not fast enough to absorb the supply of homes being brought on the market  As a result, first-quarter   inventories in the largest District markets have grown markedly relative to a year ago  In addition,   foreclosures also point to some weakening in the housing market  I guess the most notable is a 31   percent increase in March over the previous month that pushed Colorado to the highest foreclosure rate   in the nation—as reported anyway  One factor behind the increase is the unusually widespread use of   interest-only mortgages in that state  However, nonresidential construction in Colorado and elsewhere   in the District appears to be taking up some of the slack from the housing side   Let me turn to the nation and try to be brief  The contours of the outlook that we have are similar   to what I reported at our last meeting and not unlike that from the Greenbook  Several factors suggest   that the economy will slow over the forecast period  First, as I’ve suggested before, the removal of   policy accommodation continues to have its effect  Second, long-term interest rates have, as others   reported, risen noticeably  Third, energy prices continue to increase, reducing consumer purchasing   power  Finally, we’ve been forecasting a slowdown in housing, but there is a risk that the slowdown   could be actually larger than expected   Of course, there are counterbalancing factors that would show continued growth  Those have   been outlined by others, but certainly the past stimulus in the amount of liquidity in the market has its   effects  In addition, we are seeing improvements in employment and in income, which should help keep   the economy moving forward   May 10, 2006 48 of 120    On the inflation outlook, as others have noted, the recent increase in inflation is a concern to me,   but it is not a surprise  We have been expecting last year’s increase in energy prices to feed into a   temporary rise in core inflation  We’ve seen that  More recent increases in energy are going to   complicate that situation   So in the end, as we prepare for the next portion of this discussion this morning, I would agree   with all my colleagues on one thing—monetary policy is going to be much more difficult in the next few   months  [Laughter]    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I want to share, as I did the last time, a little   different perspective on this  I continue to agree with the Greenbook and others’ projections that the   economy should slow as we move through the rest of this year and next year  I think that’s an important   factor to consider because the policy actions we take today are geared toward those periods as well   I don’t want to give the impression that I’m not concerned about inflation, because I am  Part of   my concern is not that we will end too soon but that we will be too quick to reverse our position  Let me   explain  What we have now is that current GDP growth and some of the inflationary events are the   effect of past substantial accommodative policy  Now our instincts are to keep increasing the rates until   we actually see the slowing  Thus, we tend to overshoot in terms of tightness  That sounds familiar to   me  I think I’ve seen this movie, and that’s part of my concern   As I said, I am concerned about inflation  In fact, I wish we had gotten where we are today a   little sooner, but we didn’t  Our challenge is to hold firm now and to hold firm when the economy   begins to slow, and our instincts will be to ease, especially as the speculative excesses begin to wash out   of the economy and we have a lot of people saying that it’s absolutely imperative that we ease to offset   that speculative washout   May 10, 2006 81 of 120    I think that’s really our challenge  I’m not concerned so much about just today  It’s more the   larger context ahead of us  What I’m trying to say is that I judge we are about where we ought to be    We should allow the market to work the rest of the yield curve and the economy, so that we bring the   imbalances that are in play now back into balance and, when that happens, we hold our discipline and   not let our instincts to ease and offset that discipline very quickly take over  That’s really the future   challenge of monetary policy as we work through the rest of this year and into the next  Thank you    I would not change the language  I would leave it as it is because inflation   expectations are contained, and we want to make sure they stay contained  That is what the two sentences   independent of one another do  I think it is a good balance  "
7950,2006-06-28,HOENIG,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  My view of the outlook has not changed   significantly since the last meeting  Generally speaking, I agree that, while we will have continued   growth in GDP, we also will experience the beginning of a decline and below-trend growth   probably through some of the remainder of this year and into 2007   Indeed, in my view, there are increasing signs that the combination of tighter monetary   policy and higher energy costs is beginning to slow the economy’s momentum  There are clear   signals that housing has begun to weaken  Moreover, the behavior of asset prices and risk   premiums in financial markets suggests that credit costs have risen and market liquidity is at least   beginning to see some pressure  Also, it is worth noting that many other central banks are moving   to a more-restrictive policy stance, suggesting that slower growth is the likely outcome for other   countries as well as ours over the period ahead   As we discuss the economic outlook and monetary policy, I believe we must understand   how our policy actions might affect the economy  Oftentimes we do focus on the long end of the   June 28-29, 2006 53 of 177    yield curve  Certainly I do  However, I believe it is also important to focus attention on the shorter   side  Longer-term rates continue to be unusually low  Short-term rates have risen in lockstep with   the fed funds rate  Consequently, many consumers and many small businesses that have loans tied   to prime have seen sharply higher rates over the past couple of years  In response, consumers have   scaled back their use of home equity loans fairly significantly over the past few months  In   addition, the repricing of low-rate adjustable loans continues to affect household discretionary   spending, and it will begin to show up in pressure on small businesses   Evidence from the Tenth District is generally consistent with the national economic trends    Through May, District business activity continued to be strong, as others have said, especially in   manufacturing and in energy, of course, for us  Labor markets in much of our District remain tight    However, while businesses are experiencing strong cost pressures for materials and wages, they   have, as far as we can see in some of our responses, been unable to really push higher prices as   much as they would like  As a result, some profit margins are under pressure, and our most recent   manufacturing survey indicates that many firms have scaled back some of their capital spending   plans from earlier projections  As in the national economy, the District’s housing activity has begun   to slow  Housing permits have dropped sharply over the past several months, and the inventory of   unsold homes has risen notably in many of the metro areas of our region   Turning to the inflation outlook, I find the recent pickup in core measures of inflation to be   troubling  However, I continue to think that much of the recent increase reflects long-past actions in   monetary policy and some of the other resulting combinations of pass-through energy costs and the   weaker dollar  Consequently, although we are likely to see more months of elevated inflation   readings, I believe that inflation will likely decline over the forecast period, assuming that we are   June 28-29, 2006 54 of 177    holding at a firm—I should say a slightly firm—monetary policy  Under these assumptions, I   would expect core PCE inflation to decline from about 24 this year to 21 next year   The topic of inflation expectations has received considerable attention, but I see little   evidence that expectations have changed significantly, at least so far  Long-run survey measures of   expected inflation remain anchored around 2½ percent for CPI  Moreover, although the TIPS data   suggest that inflation risk premiums are somewhat higher than they were earlier this year, these   premiums do remain low by historical standards  Thank you    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’m glad that everyone agrees that the   strength of a good committee is for someone to disagree, because my preference, based on the   assessment of the outlook, is to maintain the funds rate at 5 percent, and I would vote   accordingly if I were a voting member  Even though the financial markets clearly expect a move   to 5¼ percent at this meeting, my reading of the evidence suggests that such a move is not   necessarily required at this time  Based on what I know, a 5 percent rate is moderately restrictive   and will, given time, result in an easing of inflationary pressures as the economy slows in the   period ahead   Our challenge should be to maintain this rate as the economy begins to slow, until   June 28-29, 2006 119 of 177    we have inflationary pressures clearly receding, because there will be pressure to ease as soon as   the slowing of the economy intensifies  I think that’s where our mistake will be made    I have every concern about inflation  But the numbers that we’re seeing are in the past,   they’re from policy actions we took in the past, and there’s not a lot we can do about them   looking backward  We should be prepared to switch  If the economic data show a reacceleration   of the economy, then we will have real cause to make a move up  But so long as the economy is   slowing and projections show that it is slowing, then we are restrictive—mildly restrictive, as   President Poole said—and we should hold firm until we bring inflation down     I think we are implementing restrictive policy, and what we’re choosing today in raising   the rates reflects our desire to steepen the projected downward inflationary trend  Our choice   today reflects our willingness to increase the risk of overshooting in an effort to decrease the risk   of undershooting—that’s the tradeoff we’re making today   So I would hold off, I would be   patient, and I would be firm in keeping the rate at 5 percent until we see the inflation numbers   come down—that is, if I were choosing    In the language, I believe it is important to reemphasize our commitment to price   stability  I agree with that  At the same time, I do not think the risks are all one-sided, and I   believe we need to state this in the release  For example, I judge that monetary policy is now   restrictive or somewhat restrictive, and we should say so  Now, I agree with those who say   nineteen people can’t write a statement, but that’s something we should have in the statement   going forward  Moreover, in the current circumstances, I believe it is very difficult to devise   forward-looking language that will clearly be understood by the financial markets  Obviously,   we’re talking about that here and having trouble ourselves  So regardless of the decision at this   June 28-29, 2006 120 of 177    meeting, I think that it is especially important that we do not, by our choice of language, pre-  commit to another increase in August  And I will leave it at that  Thank you     That’s a generous word, but thank you  [Laughter]   "
7977,2006-08-08,HOENIG," Mr Chairman, thank you  Obviously we are dealing with a difficult set   of circumstances  We have information that the growth of the economy is slowing and inflation   August 8, 2006 52 of 158                is rising, not something we particularly like to see  We have seen slowing consumption   nationally, and certainly our District has seen some of it  The one exception is in some areas   where we have an energy boom going on, which is not necessarily advantageous to other parts of   the country We also have slowing residential investment in our District  Inventories are   building up rapidly, both in the eastern side of the District and in the Denver western side, and   we have some pretty sharp increases in bankruptcy levels in the Denver area  The shocks of   energy costs have affected consumption, and I think that effect will carry through  We have been   more optimistic about manufacturing  Even though our surveys have shown some slowdown   recently, the six-months-ahead forecasts are still fairly optimistic   There is no denying that the inflation level is up, and I think that increase reflects past   policy accommodation that is still in play  I also think that some of the supply shocks are having   their effects, and the shocks themselves are continuing forward  That situation is being   aggravated a bit for our District, and perhaps will be even more for the nation, by the drought   that we are experiencing, which is reducing some of the crop output in the area  The outlook,   therefore, is not particularly encouraging  I think consumption will show some further slowing   going forward, especially as we see further shocks in the economy related to energy  Some of   the wealth effects related to the housing industry will also affect consumption going forward    The outlook in terms of business fixed investment is unclear  BFI has been pretty good The   outlook seems fairly good right now, but it is slowing to some degree  Policy is moderately, not   significantly, restrictive, but it seems to be working its way through fairly slowly   While these factors are in place, we worry about whether the real rate will decline, which   I think Mike Moskow mentioned  I also worry that the decline will affect inflation expectations   and cause them to shift—that is an upside risk to the economy in terms of the inflation that I do   August 8, 2006 53 of 158              worry about Still, I suggest that we are moving as expected  We have some short-term   inflationary pressures that are going to continue, that are “baked in the cake,” as they say  And I   do worry that—as we move forward and if the economy slows, as I suspect it will—our big   challenge will be not to ease too soon Thank you   Thank you, Mr Chairman  I don’t think I’ll surprise you  I agree with   Governor Kohn that a pause is appropriate In terms of some of the comments, I do suggest that   we need to recognize that we often say that monetary policy operates with a lag  In fact, moves   that we have made have not yet worked their way through, and we ought to see how they   develop A pause is appropriate to do that—it’s not shutting off further moves but letting us look   at the facts that are in play   With that, I am bothered that the markets are already projecting that, sometime in the   future, we will reverse and begin to lower rates, which I think is not something I would like to   see Also, because I recognize that there are genuine and serious inflation risks, we need to be—   and to express that we are—very sensitive in watching inflation expectations  Part of our   judgment will be not just on real economic data but on these expectations and on what inflation   does, since that is our business  If I could say something in this language, it would be to the   August 8, 2006 99 of 158                             effect that I think we are restrictive, maybe moderately restrictive, and that we’re going to stay   that way until we see systematic declines in inflation  I think that would do a lot for us   Having said that, in terms of the language, I would then be comfortable with   alternative B, with the modifications that Governor Kohn has suggested, as we try to clarify our   intentions, if that’s what we want to do with this statement, moving forward   Thank you, Mr Chairman  Don, I appreciate the outline that you gave in   terms of raising the questions  I’ll be straightforward As far as goals—what we are doing and   why is the important part of communication  That’s our obligation That is part of transparency,   and it serves us well  Regarding our view of the future—I think we should outline that in terms   of the balance of risks What we’re doing now is just about right, frankly  We need to get away   from the idea of trying to signal or giving a policy path  I think that gets us into some   difficulties In addition, it binds Committee members who may not agree into the future, and   that’s a disadvantage to the Committee in the long run   Having said that, I still think what we’re doing right now is pretty darn good  Having the   statement to say here’s what we did and why and the minutes to show the nuances of the views   gives further information to the markets and serves us well  Speeches may sometimes raise the   media’s attention, but I think they have served us well; I don’t think that we’ve gotten ourselves   into too many problems with them  Once we get through the discussion in October in terms of   the price goals and that sort of thing, how we communicate may change  So we may need to   have another discussion of this  But for the moment, with those comments, I’m pretty satisfied   with where we are  "
8000,2006-09-20,HOENIG," Mr Chairman, I’d characterize the Tenth District’s economy as quite   healthy right now As you know, the Tenth District has benefited perhaps disproportionately   from the rise in energy prices over the past few years, and this is providing considerable stimulus   to the local and state economies in the District  We are also seeing strong manufacturing activity   September 20, 2006 57 of 132                  driven by exports of District products  Although the housing markets across the District can be   characterized as soft, we have no reports of serious declines in prices anywhere in the region    Retail sales, excluding autos, also are holding up pretty well for us  The other soft spot for us is   agriculture, and that is tied pretty much to the drought that we continue to experience   Regarding the national economy, the economic information received since the last   meeting confirms a further slowing of economic activity this quarter  Moreover, weakness in   housing and auto production suggests that the fourth quarter could be a little bit weaker as well    At the same time, we have recently experienced the sizable and largely unexpected declines in   energy prices that we have talked about here, which, if maintained, could provide some stimulus   over the balance of the year to offset some of that weaker information  Currently, I expect   growth to slow to a range of 2 percent to 2½ percent in the second half of the year and to   rebound to above 2½ percent or to 3 percent next year  Generally speaking, I am more optimistic   than the Greenbook, especially with regard to housing and consumer spending, and I’m not   nearly as pessimistic as the Greenbook on potential output   As to housing, we are in fact, as all have noted, squeezing out of that sector the   speculative excesses that developed with the low interest rates of recent years—and doing so is   unavoidable if we want to correct the sector The adjustment process has obviously been painful   for some, and it has not yet run its course  However, we perhaps see ourselves getting a little   closer to the bottom than we might think right now, and that’s related to the fact that credit   remains available at reasonable rates for most homebuyers, as suggested by the recent   information on mortgage applications  So, yes, it is painful, and yes, we are going through it; but   I don’t think it is necessarily long lasting in terms of the consumer’s position   September 20, 2006 58 of 132                      For the consumer more generally, the situation is obviously mixed  On the one hand,   consumption will likely receive less stimulus going forward from the withdrawal of home equity,   and with slower house-price appreciation, wealth effects will likely be lower as well  On the   other hand, higher labor compensation and lower energy bills should provide support to the   consumer in terms of confidence and the ability to spend  Overall, I continue to believe that   there are somewhat more downside risks than upside risks to the outlook over the next quarters,   but I think we are moving in a fairly consistent way as far as GDP growth goes   Finally, let me provide my perspective on the inflation outlook  My overall views on   inflation have not changed materially since the last meeting  I continue to expect core PCE   inflation to moderate from about 23 percent this year to 21 percent next year on the course we   have right now The big negative on inflation, of course, is the higher trajectory for labor costs,   which has been mentioned  Although the recent revisions to compensation are perhaps   somewhat unsettling, such concerns are partly offset by the recent more-favorable monthly   inflation numbers and by the significant fall in the prices of oil, gasoline, and natural gas in   recent weeks  Although the recent inflation data have not caused me to alter my inflation   outlook, I am in one sense more confident in the forecast of moderation than I was a month ago   or so On balance, as we look at all this, I agree that we still have some upside risks to inflation   that we have to remain aware of as we look to the policy discussion ahead  Thank you    Mr Chairman, based on my assessment of the economic outlook, I think   we should maintain the funds rate at 5¼ percent, which as others have said is modestly restrictive,   and I counsel what I would refer to as rational patience here as we work through this  I continue to   hold the view that the current policy stance, along with the lagged effects of past tightening, will   lead to a moderation of inflation going forward—and that does not deny that upside risks to   inflation do, in fact, remain     Just quickly, I would like to say that I think credibility is extremely important for the Federal   Reserve and that we risk the issue of credibility much more when we are at 1 percent than when we   are at 5¼ percent, which is where we are now, in terms of upside inflationary risk  We are   moderately restrictive, and we do not want to overreact  With that in mind, although there are also   downside risks to growth, I want to be very clear to the markets and to the public that any near-term   easing in policy is not likely  Indeed, I believe, first, that we should maintain our current policy   September 20, 2006 100 of 132                                  stance until we see evidence of significant systematic declines in inflation  We should make that   clear Second, if we get evidence that inflation is not moderating, I would be prepared at that point   to support additional tightening; but I think we should have that evidence before we reengage in any   policy tightening   On the press statement, I am in favor of B+  We should be very firm about our inflation   position and about our commitment to bringing inflation down  We should not overreact; and with   the moderately tight policy that we have now, we can see inflation come down systematically over   time  Thank you  "
8025,2006-10-24,HOENIG,"  Mr Chairman, I’ll start with the District this time, and I will tell you that   conditions in the District remain generally good  Energy activity remains strong, both in the   traditional sectors, such as gas, oil, and coal, and in our new sector called ethanol  [Laughter]    They are booming, I’m afraid  Despite the recent decline in energy prices, we are not yet   hearing, in talking to different producers in the region, about any significant pullback in energy   production  In part, this situation reflects a prevailing view right now among those producers   that the weakness in energy prices is likely to be temporary  However, if energy prices remain at   current levels or move lower at a sustained rate, I think we will then see some pullback in retail   activity and so forth—more than we’ve seen so far   In other areas of the District economy, we saw some softening in manufacturing activity   in the third quarter, but our manufacturing survey shows that businesses remain mostly   optimistic about future hiring and capital expenditure plans  Housing activity has certainly   slowed across the District  However, we have received few reports of unusual weakness in our   recent meetings with directors and economic advisory council members  So it is slowing but   shows no sign of collapse, at this point anyway  We have also seen, with the decline in energy   prices, strengthening in District retail sales activity and a sharp rebound in expectations for retail   October 24-25, 2006 35 of 203    activity in the fourth quarter—except for domestic auto sales  Labor markets remain firm across   the District  Unemployment rates are low, and our directors and other contacts continue to report   shortages of skilled labor across the District  District agricultural conditions remain rather   mixed  Drought continues to affect much of the western part of our region  However, livestock   and crop prices have been supported by strong world demand and lower supply, so those farmers   who are able to bring in a crop are doing quite well   Turning to the national economy, I think that the recent decline in energy prices will   provide important support to the near-term outlook  Currently, I see second-half growth of   around 2 percent, rebounding to between 2½ and 3 percent as we get into next year  Generally   speaking, I am more optimistic than the Greenbook, both in the near term and for the next year    Indeed, with the current financial conditions that others have talked about, I don’t envision the   pullback in consumer spending and business investment spending that the Greenbook has   projected at this point   One area that is worth discussion—and Dave talked about it a bit in responding to a   question—is the employment outlook, an area for which the Greenbook continues to have, as   Dave said, a different perspective  Although demographic forces will clearly work in the   direction of slower labor force growth in the coming years, I’m not as convinced that the   slowdown will be as sharp or as sudden as the Greenbook suggests right now  I say that because   I want to be cautious about viewing the recent slowing in monthly employment growth as being   driven by these demographic factors  I believe the recent slowing in employment largely reflects   some employer caution about the economic outlook, combined with the effects of weakness in   housing and retail sales  Support for this view can be found in the recent slowing of growth in   temporary help that has been reported to us  Should the economic growth pick up, as I   October 24-25, 2006 36 of 203    anticipate, we should begin to see some stronger employment numbers as we get into next year    As to the effects of demographics—again, I think they are going to play a very important part,   but another significant factor to keep in mind is the educational composition of the labor force   and the skills composition as we move forward in terms of labor demand, because that’s the   shortage we’re always hearing about   Now, returning to the near-term outlook, the recent decline in energy prices has helped to   counter the effects of housing weaknesses  Consequently, the downside risk to the outlook has   diminished somewhat  However, because we have not necessarily seen the bottom of the   housing market, I do believe that that is an important downside risk to the economy   Finally, let me share some of my perspective on the inflation outlook  My overall views   on inflation have not changed materially since the last meeting  I continue to expect core CPI   inflation to moderate from about 28 percent to about 25 percent next year and, similarly, core   PCE inflation to moderate from about 23 percent to 21 percent  A significant fall in prices for   oil and gasoline and natural gas in recent weeks has already begun to show through to overall   inflation  I believe this is a positive development in helping to ensure that inflation expectations   remain anchored and perhaps in helping to moderate core inflation next year  Although the   decline in energy prices has reduced the upside risk to inflation somewhat, I agree with others   that core inflation does remain too high, and I think we have to keep that in mind as we consider   our policy options  Thank you    Richard, clarify for me  You said that some of your national contacts were   seeing a slowdown in the book of business  Is that the minority of the contacts?  I’m not quite sure I   know what you were conveying    As to your reference to the trucking company—one of our trucking   company contacts indicated that business is still good  Their bookings out have been reduced from   three weeks to about four or five days  So they’ve seen a slowdown, but they’re still busy  They   still have business coming in    I agree  Thank you    Thank you, Mr Chairman  My preference also is to maintain the rate at   5¼ percent  For the near-term outlook, I think an important recent development that has been noted   is the decline in energy prices  As I said yesterday, lower energy prices do help cushion the effects   October 24-25, 2006 103 of 203    of the housing slowdown, and they do reduce the downside risk to growth over the near term  At   the same time, by lowering headline inflation, I think they help contain some of the inflationary   expectations  So if that rate is maintained, I think we will, in fact, contribute to lower core inflation    By reducing both the downside risk to growth and the upside risk to inflation, the decline in energy   prices makes it more likely that we can continue to maintain the fed funds rate at what I’ve   described as its current moderately restrictive level until core inflation returns to more a acceptable   level  At the same time, I continue to believe that the upside risk to inflation does remain  The   recent monthly pattern in core inflation, while encouraging, does not firmly establish a downward   trajectory, which I think is very important to establish  Consequently, I would be prepared to leave   the fed funds rate at that level and have it naturally firm as mentioned by others, and I would   support additional tightening should inflation reverse course   Let me very briefly talk about the statement  While downside risks to growth remain, I   would not want to convey to the markets the impression that any near-term easing of policy is likely   at all  As markets have only recently understood the message in the last press statement, I believe   we can best accomplish this by updating the rationale section using the wording suggested in   alternative B, section 2  I’m comfortable with the word “moderate”  I think Vince gave a good   definition of it—at or slightly less than potential  I don’t think that word would be harmful at all    But then I would go alternative A for section 3, and I would maintain the wording of the assessment   of risk that was used last time  I would not be in favor of modifying the language of the risk   assessment in an attempt to get the markets to alter their current views of the expected policy path    Thank you    Yes    Thank you    No, I said I am very comfortable with the word “moderate”    So long as we don’t get sidetracked onto what “potential” is at this point    Mr Chairman, in preparing for today’s comments, I found it interesting   and somewhat instructive to look back to similar discussions that this Committee has had in the   past  This includes not just our more recent ones but an extended debate that took place in July   1996  I can confirm, therefore, that we have a deliberative process  [Laughter]  Looking back   over how my own views have evolved, I am as convinced now as before about the importance of   an unqualified commitment to price stability as the underpinning of our monetary policy  I have   long had an interest in how an inflation-targeting approach to policy might help us, and that’s   where I think it gets interesting because I think the devil is in the details, if you will  As the staff   and I have tried to work through some of the details we would have to confront in implementing   such an approach, I have become somewhat less enamored than I was about the usefulness of   establishing an explicit numerical inflation objective  I am not necessarily opposed to such a   October 24-25, 2006 164 of 203    step, and if we were to go there, I’m more drawn to Governor Mishkin’s approach than to others   I’ve heard  But I do have concerns about the value of doing so, as well as how such a decision   would be implemented and how it might alter the decisionmaking process and our discussions   within this meeting—the so-called unintended consequences of moving along this line   Let me address these points by framing my comments according to the questions in   Vince’s memo  First, is it helpful?  As I understand the literature on central bank transparency   and credibility, the value of establishing an explicit numerical definition of price stability comes   from anchoring the public’s inflation expectations and reducing the volatility of these   expectations  In this regard, I have been struck by how well anchored inflation expectations   have been in the current tightening cycle here in the United States  This is in contrast, I realize,   to some historical contexts, but the fact of the matter is that they have remained quite anchored    How much further improvement would come from the adoption of an explicit target at this point,   I question  Would it be meaningful?  I’m not so sure    Another argument is that adopting an explicit numerical objective would make it more   difficult for future Committees to backslide on their commitment to price stability  I find this   argument somewhat weak  Short of a change to the Federal Reserve Act, future Committees   would not be bound, nor would they feel bound, to actions taken by this Committee  I can see   someone pushing forward at some time, in terms of the dual mandate, an issue relative to stable   output as becoming a new important element  Moreover, my reading of the literature comparing   the performance of inflation-targeting and non-inflation-targeting countries suggests that there is   very little measurable difference in performance to this point   In the absence of a clear benefit of establishing an explicit numerical objective, we also   need to look at its costs  One possible cost is the constraint that might be placed on short-run   October 24-25, 2006 165 of 203    policy decisions  In this regard, I wonder how an explicit numerical objective might have altered   our response to the weakening economy in 2001, which Governor Kohn mentioned  Since core   inflation measures tend to lag output, core inflation was still rising as we began to reduce rates    Would we have been as able to cut rates as readily if we had established an explicit numerical   objective?  Perhaps yes, perhaps no   How should the objective be chosen?  Turning to the question of choosing an explicit   numerical objective, I see a host of procedural and logistical issues  As to procedure, I feel   strongly that any decision should reflect unanimity on the part of the Committee; otherwise, the   credibility of such a decision is immediately called into question  Establishing unanimity about   the details of an objective could prove difficult  For example, I would not be comfortable with   using the core PCE deflator exclusively in defining a measure of price stability  Theoretically,   PCE is generally judged superior to the CPI because chain weighting avoids the substitution bias   in the CPI  In another important dimension, however, the case for the PCE is much weaker    Perhaps most notably, the core PCE deflator is subject to regular and sometimes significant   revisions  The revisions to PCE over the past six years have not been trivial; moreover, they   have all been in the same direction  By underestimating inflationary pressures during this period,   core PCE sent misleading signals about those pressures  Moreover, the CPI plays a much larger   role in the institutional fabric of this economy  I find it interesting that so few members of the   financial community produce forecasts of PCE inflation, even as they view it as the Fed’s   preferred measure  More important, TIPS-derived measures of inflation expectations are based   on the CPI  Thus, to line up market inflation expectations with the PCE we are forced to go   through the sort of exercise that is reported in the current Bluebook  I wonder how accurate or   useful such a translation might be over an extended time  Consequently, if we were to go the   October 24-25, 2006 166 of 203    route of establishing an explicit numerical objective, I would advocate not tying ourselves   exclusively, for example, to the PCE   As to whether an explicit or implicit approach is preferable, I would lean toward an   explicit approach of surveying members on their long-run objectives  I feel this approach would   be more transparent and efficient than expanding the horizon of central tendency forecasts   How would an objective influence policy setting?  I believe there would be effects, but   gauging these effects would be difficult without a more thorough and detailed understanding of   how the objective would be implemented  If we decide to go in this direction, it will be   important to maintain the diversity and independence of views expressed by the Committee   members, both in our deliberations here and in our interactions with the public     Finally, if we explore a form of price-targeting or inflation-targeting, we should hold off   on an ultimate decision until we have a thorough understanding of the details of such a regime   and their implications for the policy process within the Committee  Once again, just as   reinforcement, I prefer going forward along the lines that Governor Mishkin outlined for us    Thank you  "
8048,2006-12-12,HOENIG,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Overall, the Tenth District economy   continues to expand at a moderate pace  Activity has slowed somewhat, but our region is still   probably doing a little better than the nation as a whole  One area in which we may be doing a   bit better is housing, even though we have slowed just as everyone else has  Our surveys show   that the inventories of unsold homes, although elevated, are less than they are in other regions of   the country and that they have not accelerated much since last summer  Our real estate contacts   have indicated to us that they think inventories will be coming down over the next few months   because the slowing in construction is bringing them back into line  It will take some time,   however   On the manufacturing side also, we have a bit more positive information in the region   than perhaps nationwide  While we have had a slowdown in areas related to housing and autos,   the areas related to oil and gas, railroads, commercial offices, and high-tech equipment in the   District are generally noting strong and even increasing demand, and we’re expecting those   businesses to expand their operations accordingly  Some of our machinists and machine   manufacturing organizations have actually seen some fairly strong growth, and their six-month   outlook is also strong, especially in the export sector  Energy activity has remained strong in the   District, despite some declines in our mountain region, where costs of drilling are higher, and   December 12, 2006 50 of 134         that has caused some reduction in rig count  Other areas in the Oklahoma panhandle and so forth   are really going quite strong   Consumer spending remains solid, and early holiday returns have generally been quite   positive  Mall managers in the District’s cities reported solid traffic after Thanksgiving, and   we’re off to a very good start for the December holidays  Labor markets also remain fairly good   in the region, and as others have reported, our demand for skilled labor is really quite good, and   finding individuals to fill positions is difficult right now  However, a couple of pieces of   anecdotal information offset that a bit  In the past couple of months, the temporary hiring area   has had a slowdown in their sales growth, which surprised the chairman of our board of directors   to some degree—I don’t know whether he mentioned this last week when he was here  Also, a   couple of major trucking firms, while not saying that business is bad or anything like that, are   saying that business is noticeably slower than it has been in other such holiday periods  Whether   or not it’s packaging they’re not willing to say, but they are saying that it sure is slower     On the national outlook, I don’t have any real disagreements with the Greenbook in that   we see growth to be below potential  What potential is may be a question  However, we do see   growth below potential but returning gradually over 2007 into 2008  Obvious risks to that   forecast are, on the downside, housing and, on the upside, perhaps some strength in foreign   demand  We have seen the latter, as I mentioned, in our manufacturing sector, and I think it may   bring some strength to the economy as we look ahead   On the inflation front, our outlook is for inflation to come down gradually—we continue   to think that monetary policy is slightly restrictive—and, with that, inflation numbers  For   example, core CPI inflation would come down from 28 percent to 25 percent in ’07 and perhaps   to 23 percent in ’08; the core PCE would average around 2 percent over 2007 and 2008, falling   December 12, 2006 51 of 134         from 21 to 19  Those are obviously rough estimates, but they are showing the trend  The risks,   of course, are in what happens to energy  On the other side, frankly, is what happens to the   dollar because, if that continues to go down, it would create some upside inflationary pressures   that we’d have to think about and deal with as we go forward  So with that, I will stop and wait   for the policy discussion for the rest of my comments  Thank you    My preference is, as we look at the outlook, to maintain the federal funds   rate at 5¼ percent  In my judgment, Mr Chairman, our current policy stance is slightly or   moderately restrictive and will lead to moderation in inflation going forward, though slowly I   admit  But I will also say, as indicated in my earlier statement, that I believe there are some   upside risks to such moderating inflation  Therefore, I believe that we should maintain a slightly   restrictive policy stance until we see core CPI inflation at 2 percent or lower  I would also say   that my view of policy going forward is more asymmetric  If we get evidence that inflation is   not moderating, I would be prepared to support additional tightening  On the other hand, it   would take a prolonged period of below-trend growth with little sign of a return to trend or a   much larger slowdown in growth to convince me that we should ease policy  On the press   statement, I’m inclined toward saying less than we’re saying now  I still think we ought to leave   more to the minutes and say less in the statement  But having said that before and not getting   very far, I would go with alternative B, more in line with some of the language that you and   Cathy may work out here  Thanks     You know, it’s a tough call, but I think I’d go with exhibit 5 language     Mr Chairman, I think we have just been to North Dakota  [Laughter]    I agree  I can’t imagine putting a position out in public  I’m concerned that   I do get questions  “This has been in the minutes  What do you think?”  I feel a little uncomfortable   just saying, “I’m not going to talk to you about that”  I feel more comfortable saying, “That’s a   tough issue  We’ve gone back and forth  We need to think it through  There are strong views”  I   December 12, 2006 116 of 134         mean to talk about it a bit without putting a big position out there  I just don’t want to say to them,   “I’m not talking about this”  It sounds incomplete or half-baked    I feel very comfortable without giving out, “This is what we ought to do,”   and that sort of thing  That’s helpful  "
8077,2007-01-30,HOENIG,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman, now that I have everyone’s attention, [laughter]   I’m going to start with some information on the District and then talk briefly about the national   economy from my perspective  Let me begin by saying that the District’s activity did slow over the   second half of 2006 in line with the national economy itself  The slowdown was most apparent in   housing and manufacturing  However, the most recent data that we have from November and   December indicate a pickup in some of the activity  Moreover, reports from our directors and our   business contacts suggest a considerable degree of optimism among them going forward, more than   we expected actually  One area in which we are seeing signs of improvement is housing itself    While new construction activity does remain subdued in our region, sales activity has picked up,   and the inventory situation appears to be improving in our major markets  Nonresidential   January 30-31, 2007 60 of 255    construction remains strong and is offsetting some of the weakness on the residential side  District   employment growth has risen in recent months, and labor markets remain tight for us  In addition to   continuing shortages of skilled workers in a large number of technical and professional areas, we   have recently received reports that the hospitality and recreational sectors are experiencing difficulty   in finding lower-skilled workers as well  We have also received numerous reports from directors in   District businesses indicating higher year-end wage and salary increases   The situation in agriculture is somewhat mixed  The sharp increases in crop prices,   especially corn, driven by exports of ethanol and exports of corn itself, have caused the USDA to   boost estimates of 2007 farm income rather significantly  However, higher crop prices are also   eroding profitability of livestock producers and processors in our region, which is a fairly important   sector   One important sector in which activity appears likely to slow in 2007 is energy  The District   economy has benefited tremendously over the past few years from the rise in energy prices, which   has spurred increased production of traditional products—and that includes oil, gas, and coal—as   well as alternative fuels like ethanol and biodiesel  According to reports from a couple of our   directors, however, the recent decline in energy prices has already led to a reduction in drilling   activity and is likely to cause some cutbacks in new investment in alternative fuels as well   Turning to the national outlook, I, like others, have noted the recent strength in the economy   and have raised my estimates of growth for the fourth quarter and somewhat raised them for the first   quarter  I continue to expect growth to rise over 2007 modestly toward what I think is potential, in   the neighborhood of 3 percent  However, now I expect it to occur a little more quickly than I did at   the December meeting  Accordingly, recent economic information has led me to reassess the   balance of risks to the outlook  I believe the downside risks from the further slowing of housing   January 30-31, 2007 61 of 255    have diminished somewhat  Moreover, I share the view that the recent weakness in manufacturing   activity reflects a better balancing of production and inventories rather than a fundamental   weakness  Going forward, the improved outlook for energy prices should support consumer   spending by improving consumers’ disposable income, and we may see additional fiscal stimulus   resulting from the more-favorable budget positions of the state and local governments   Finally, in terms of the inflation outlook, my views have not changed materially since the   last meeting  I’ve been encouraged by the recent inflation data, and I continue to expect inflation to   decline over the forecast period  I expect the core CPI to be in the 23 percent range and core PCE   inflation to be about 2 percent for 2007  However, as others have noted, core inflation is too high,   and considerable uncertainty remains about whether the recent progress will be sustained    Particularly, it is not clear how the opposing trends of lower energy prices and greater resource   pressures may play out over the next few quarters  Consequently, it seems to me that there is upside   risk to the inflation outlook  Thank you    Mr Chairman, I’m very comfortable with alternative B as far as the rate   goes  Given what we don’t know today, I think that’s exactly where we ought to be  We will   know more over the next six months about how that should be adjusted as we move forward  On   the language, I feel that we would be better served with sections 2 and 3 of alternative C  That   language describes my own views and much of what I heard yesterday, especially as it says   “seems to be rebounding” and “some tentative signs of stabilization”  “Going forward the   economy seems likely to expand at a moderate pace” is good language  Then, more important, I   would like to see in section 3 that “readings on core inflation have improved modestly in recent   January 30-31, 2007 102 of 255    months but remain elevated”  Going forward, that is the essential issue I think we have to watch   besides the economy  That’s why I believe that language is preferable  The risk assessment as   described in alternative B is fine  Thank you     It’s not     Because it describes what is, and that is that inflation is elevated     It isn’t to me, because 26 year over year is elevated       My point is that what you’re describing is the systematic move down,   and the margin is bringing the average down, and that’s what you say  “Readings on core   inflation have improved modestly in recent months but remain elevated”  So long as we can   convey that, I think the markets will read us more properly because, even though the three-month   January 30-31, 2007 103 of 255    may be coming down, it’s still 26 percent year over year rather than where I thought last June it   would be, which was 24  So it has improved, but we’re not to where we need to be, and that’s   my point     Mr Chairman    Just to clarify, I’m assuming then we’re floating back toward alternative B,   leaving the fourth section as is    Oh, I like that, but I’m not sure that’s where we landed [Laughter]    First of all, I’m fine with your proposal  I would have gone with the other   proposal, but neither set of language binds us, and that is the main thing that I agree with  That   brings me to President Poole’s point  I don’t have a sense that we have a great increase coming later   in the year, and I don’t want to convey that such was the sense of the Committee  Now, if he does   as an individual and would like that in the minutes, that’s one thing  But I would not want to have   the minutes read as something more than what I heard here today  Trying to define a Committee   sense of this that wasn’t in the language here would make the minutes more confusing  So I’m okay   with this language, and I associate myself with Vice Chairman Geithner on the use of the minutes    Thank you  I’ll frame my remarks around two propositions  The first is the   “yes”  We should be receptive to changes in our practices and procedures to the extent that they   make monetary policy more effective and provide clear public benefit  My general sense is that   providing more information about our views on the economic outlook can be a good thing when it   comes without impairing the effectiveness of the policy process  The second is the “but”  Changes   that we make in this regard need to be done in a way that respects the diversity of viewpoints that is   central to the effectiveness and the effective functioning of this Committee  I believe that the   strength of this Committee and the source of its ability to conduct sound monetary policy and   facilitate confidence in our policy come in large part from the diverse backgrounds and views of the   individual members  Although at each meeting we must arrive at a Committee decision, the   decision and the way it is communicated to the public are shaped by the views of all participants   In my experience, Mr Chairman, as policy evolves, it is rarely the case that everyone   suddenly sees the wisdom of a major change to the direction of policy  Rather, one or more   members begin to articulate concerns with our current policy stance based on their experience and   their assumptions about unfolding events  As data begin to provide support for this viewpoint, the   January 30-31, 2007 173 of 255    Committee begins to move in a new direction  Even when new positions are not subsequently   supported by the data, our discussions benefit from considering alternative points of view and sets   of assumptions  Consequently, as we consider options that we might pursue to increase the   effectiveness of our communication, I am strongly opposed to changes that would limit the   expression of alternative forecasts and viewpoints, either in the discussion within the room or in our   communication with the public  I regard steps such as producing a joint forecast or requiring a   common interest rate assumption as extremely detrimental to the Committee’s deliberation and   public communication  Such steps would lead inevitably in my mind to the delegation of   decisionmaking to a small group of individuals, and I don’t think that’s helpful   With that said, let me focus for a moment on some specific issues on the role of forecasts in   policy communication, and I would begin with some comments on the proper vehicle for   communicating forecast information to the public  If we decide to move forward with discussions   of our forecasts and providing more forecasts, I would like to suggest an alternative—and like all   the other alternatives today, it is superior [laughter]—and it is based on how we would choose to do   this  If we want to convey this information in a way that is both timely and logistically manageable,   we should use the minutes  This is an extension of what we now do  It takes us forward but, I   think, in a proper step     Specifically, I propose that we consider releasing a summary of numerical forecasts as part   of the minutes  We all prepare forecasts beforehand  As I remarked earlier, it is important that the   information be in the form of a survey of individual forecasts, not a joint forecast, and each forecast   should be based on the individual’s view of policy and not on a common interest rate path  The   minutes would contain summary information in the form of tables or charts on a small set of key   variables, such as real GDP, core inflation, and unemployment  This information would be   January 30-31, 2007 174 of 255    presented in the form of a central tendency and the range of Committee member views  I would not   include specific information about the policy assumptions used for the individual forecast    Members would present their views in the meeting and then be permitted to revisit their forecast in   light of the Committee discussion and decision  The forecast period would likely be four to eight   quarters, as now, with the semiannual report focusing on the longer horizon beyond that, if we go   there  An advantage of using the minutes, besides timeliness, is that a narrative is already prepared    There would be less chance of confusion about the ownership of the forecast  The numerical   forecast information would supplement the qualitative discussion currently in the minutes, and I   think it would enhance the public’s understanding of policy  For example, the recent disconnect   between our views and those of the financial markets might not have developed had the markets   seen our forecasts of temporarily slower growth and persistent inflationary pressures   A final issue is the use of common conditioning assumptions in the forecast  As I indicated   earlier, I would not be in favor of requiring a common fed funds rate path  I think it might be   helpful for the Board’s staff to provide information on some of the conditioning assumptions they   use in the Greenbook as a starting point for Committee members’ forecasts  However, as with the   fed funds rate path itself, I would not be in favor of requiring a common set of assumptions for   individual forecasts  I think this helps inform the public but also keeps the diversity within the   Committee and leaves the Committee more effective  Thank you, sir  "
8101,2007-03-20,HOENIG,"  Mr Chairman, I’ll spend a little time on the District  I think you can   describe it as almost robust, recognizing that we are a District that exports a lot of raw materials   and byproducts of raw materials  We have had solid job gains led by further tightening in our   labor markets, and recent revisions suggest that 2006 job growth was stronger than we had   previously thought  Mining led the job growth, but we also saw strong gains in professional and   business services and in leisure and hospitality  In fact, our ski season this year was a record, as   the snow was also a record  Besides shortages of skilled labor, of which we are constantly   getting reports, we are seeing also shortages of some lower-skilled workers as well—in the   temporary employment area, for example   It is also noteworthy that our manufacturing activity has been strengthening  We have   received good reports from our directors and advisory council members that it actually   strengthened in February  Lower inventories of finished goods led to a surge in order backlogs,   and most industries reported robust activity led by machinery and high-tech equipment   March 20-21, 2007 33 of 196    production  In addition, plant managers expressed greater optimism about the outlook for   employment and capital spending as they look forward, not as they’re looking right now     Turning to real estate, housing activity may have stabilized  We have suffered like the   rest of the country in that area, especially in our Denver market, where we have had record levels   of foreclosure  But beyond that—and even there—we have seen some stabilizing in our housing   market, and our commercial activity remains really quite solid  Housing permits and the value of   new residential construction held steady in February  In addition, the buildup of home   inventories has actually slowed, and District contacts expect inventories to decline gradually in   the coming months, as they are now seeing things turn  Nonresidential construction remains   strong, with absorption of office space increasing in most cities and vacancy rates continuing to   decline throughout our region  Commercial real estate contacts expect more new construction in   the months ahead  They are actually seeing it come on the drawing board  They also reported   that office prices and rents increased further, even though sales were somewhat flat over the last   month or so   Farm financial conditions have improved overall, with increased crop prices that are   being driven by the expanded ethanol production  USDA forecasts that net farm income will rise   about 10 percent this year  Strong income prospects have boosted land prices—significantly, I   might add, in some parts—and solidified farm balance sheets  One piece of information I would   note is that ethanol is a boom industry right now in the region—not in just our region but in the   area around Nebraska and Iowa  In that area, 100 plants are producing; there are 50 on the   drawing boards, but we are seeing some backing away from that  Three projects have been   pulled back in Oklahoma recently, and one more in Kansas  But still, a lot are going forward,   and it gives me some pause because it has the tone of too much, too quickly, and the real   March 20-21, 2007 34 of 196    economy will suffer if it backs away from that development  Anyway, on balance, the regional   economy is very strong right now   Turning to the national outlook, I would say that, on balance, although I have revised my   outlook down somewhat in 2007, I still have it projected as growing on the whole for the year   better than 2½ percent  So my outlook is more optimistic than that of the Greenbook  There are   some reasons for that, at least that we’re thinking through  Like others, we see housing   stabilizing, perhaps taking a little longer to come back, but inventories seem to have stabilized    As those inventories are worked off through the first half of this year, we think housing should   improve through the rest of the year, at least given where the fixed interest rates lie  We’re also   seeing that the secondary effects of the slowing of the housing market seem contained at the   moment, so that slowing is not spilling over, and the containment is being strengthened by the   facts that personal incomes are actually continuing to improve and that we have a good labor   market  So those factors are important  Also, as we discussed earlier, foreign demand is strong,   and the outlook seems to be good  Finally, federal spending—the fact is that we’re fighting a   war, and you tend to spend more over the course of a war—is picking up I think  Coffers are   strong, and states are spending at a fairly rapid rate  So a lot of factors are affecting demand, and   therefore I think that this economy will pick up as the year goes on   I recognize very clearly that there are some risks to keep in mind  One is that the housing   market could worsen, and there could be further spillovers  I’m very mindful of that  But on the   other side, I do share some of the concerns raised by others in terms of the inflation outlook    Inflation has not come down as much as we had hoped, although I’m still projecting that it will   so long as we keep the rates at their current levels  But there are some upside risks with the   tighter labor market and strong demand, and we could see energy prices putting more pressure on   March 20-21, 2007 35 of 196    it  So it’s a mixed bag perhaps with, on balance, some upside risk as well as downside risk to   this economy  Thank you    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I am inclined toward leaving the rate   unchanged, so that would be alternative B  I’d like to comment on a couple of things  Although   the downside risk to growth appears to have increased somewhat on a national level since the last   meeting, I continue to expect that we will see a pickup in the economy, as I said yesterday, over   the year  At the same time, I am obviously disappointed, as others are, that the recent inflation   March 20-21, 2007 82 of 196    numbers have not continued to show the progress we saw last fall  Consequently, I think that the   risk of inflation will remain above acceptable levels for a while, and that situation on balance   outweighs the downside risk to growth  So while I favor no change in policy, I also continue to   favor statement language that reflects an explicit bias toward firming or that makes it very clear   to the market that we will remain firm until we actually see the inflation numbers consistently   improve     That leads me to the issue of the statement  I’m open to the language there, but I like the   wording that “the Committee’s principal policy” or “predominant,” whichever you prefer,   “concern remains the risk that inflation will fail to moderate as expected”  I’m a little uneasy   about the part that says that “future policy adjustments” will be dependent on events  I think it   should say something along the lines of “the extent and timing of any additional firming” so that   we don’t confirm the market’s view that we will see a drop of as much as 75 basis points in the   fed funds rate in the future  Our most likely events are to hold firm as we go forward, and I’d   like to convey that to the market one way or another  I’m open as to whether or not we do that   by saying that the bias is still on the upside  I’m more concerned that, by saying that we’re going   to look for data in the future as defining which way we go, we will confirm the lower rates in the   markets, and that will complicate our job rather than simplify it  Thank you    Mr Chairman, I don’t have any problem  I agree with Cathy on the length    At the same time, I don’t think focusing on financial conditions is a particular problem because   what you’ve said about having that in there can be said about anything else that you put in  What   happens next time if income is lower and so forth?  So I don’t think that “financial conditions” in   and of itself matters one way or the other  I also agree with Governor Kohn that we do need to have   a rationale  We can’t just take it on faith  We went down this road some time ago, and this is what   we have now; so I think we do owe people some explanation, Cathy      If I could, I’d like to clarify slightly my earlier comments in the sense that   I’m not of the view that the language should stay in terms of a bias toward tightening because I   think we need to tighten  My view has been that we are modestly firm and that we should be   March 20-21, 2007 103 of 196    conveying to the market that we are going to stay modestly firm until we see a consistent decline in   the inflation numbers that we have  The difficulty is trying to explain that in language  So what we   end up with is a kind of Hobson’s choice  We leave the language as it has been, therefore signaling   that we will stay firm, or we change the language to say that we will be dependent on the future   data—which is, I think, also accurate  But making the change tends to confirm the view that now   we are more likely to ease than we really are  Either way, we are giving signals to the market that   are not exactly what we want to explain  So which of those do we choose in order to keep   expectations from changing too dramatically?  That’s really my point as I’ve thought about this,   which I wanted to clarify  Thank you    No, it won’t  [Laughter]     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I, too, want to thank the staff for really a   great piece of work and a lot of coordination, which made this possible  First, I want to say at   the outset that I do not want to move forward at this point in providing a numerical definition of   the Committee’s inflation objective  Second, regarding the enhanced use of a survey of   economic projections, I support the release of increased information on the economic outlook   along the lines suggested in the memo  To be a little more specific, I would like to assure   everyone that I believe it is important to maintain a clear commitment to price stability  That’s   not what I’ve been disagreeing with at all     However, in looking at the benefits and costs of adopting a numerical inflation objective,   I believe the practical benefits are relatively small at this time and the costs are relatively larger   than the benefits  Therefore, I suggest that we not do it  Regarding the benefits, there appears to   be little difference in economic performance of inflation-targeting and non-inflation-targeting   countries that we are looking at  Also, I have not seen convincing evidence that inflation   March 20-21, 2007 131 of 196    expectations are better anchored with an explicit numerical objective than with our current   methods of communicating and acting toward an environment of stable prices or at least low   inflation  In contrast, I think the costs at this time are a little higher  The political implications   are important  I think about the law of unintended consequences or some of the longer-term   reactions—and not just those of the Congress but also the public more generally  We have a   commitment to a dual mandate  If we also have a commitment to a specific price target, I think   that over time the arguments will mount—and I would understand them mounting—that we need   a specific target for output  Then we’re going to get ourselves trying to balance this out, and   frankly I think it will be difficult  So that is why I’m very reluctant to have a numerical target   put forward when we have a dual mandate that suggests otherwise in terms of balancing   Now, if we do go forward, where do I come out in terms of the numerical objective?  I   would go with both a core PCE and a core CPI  Despite the general superiority of the PCE, and   ignoring the difficulties in pricing its nonmarket components, the CPI has advantages in   communicating to the public, which others have mentioned  Also, TIPS-derived measures of   inflation expectations are based on the CPI  Now, I would prefer a point goal of 2 percent for the   core CPI and 1½ percent for the core PCE, and I would specify a flexible time horizon   I agree   that longer is better, and I won’t put a number forward at this point   Turning to the group questions, I would not support trying to achieve a consensus on the   inflation objective  I do not think we can choose an inflation objective that binds future   Committees  We don’t have a statutory mandate, and people’s opinions will change as   personalities and experience change  Thus, we would need to revisit this issue on an annual   basis, and I think that would be difficult  It seems to me that the consensus view is the de facto   inflation objective  For this reason, given my earlier comment, I would prefer simply surveying   March 20-21, 2007 132 of 196    Committee members on their views about what constitutes price stability  Finally, if we go this   route, I would recommend that we publish simply the range and the central tendency of the   members’ objectives   As I have already said, I support the proposed trial run  I thought the summary of the   economic projections provided in Vince’s memo was good and useful, and I think we should go   forward with that  The more difficult issue for me is how to convey the forecast uncertainty    While it is important to convey the uncertainty surrounding the forecast, I would not combine   members’ central tendency forecasts with the FRB/US confidence intervals  I think you’re   mixing things here, both in terms of what you’re trying to talk about and then who is talking   about it  Is one the Committee’s, and is the other the staff’s?  Is one referring to one thing or to   something else?  I think you will create confusion over time, and so I would be reluctant to go   down that path, Mr Chairman  Thank you for the opportunity to comment  "
8123,2007-05-09,HOENIG,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I gave a fairly detailed summary of the   District’s economy last time, and it hasn’t changed a great deal since then  So I’ll be fairly brief    The labor markets in the region remain fairly tight; they have not loosened at all since our last   meeting  Our manufacturing sector continues to show strength  Our agricultural sector   continues to show strength  Housing is the one area that, as in other parts of the country, has   shown weakness as inventories have built; but we haven’t seen dramatic declines in prices at this   point, and we will watch that, as others are watching it within their regions   On the national outlook, we see that the economy will continue to grow at something   below trend  We’re a little more optimistic than the Greenbook, but the point is that we should   see the economy grow below trend  For all the reasons that others have said, we expect inflation   to moderate, but reasonably slowly, over the next eighteen months  Therefore, anticipating the   next discussion, I would say that, as a policy group, we need to be resolute in our own policies in   terms of holding our positions fairly firm  So I’ll leave it at that until we get to the policy   discussion, Mr Chairman  Thank you    Anticipating that a linguist will be reading this afterward, let me say that I   strongly support alternative B  Since I’m assuming that the language is what we’re talking about, I   support the current language even though there have been many suggestions for modifications  I am   not inclined to make any suggestions myself or to accept any of the others that have been put on the   table unless you, as the Chairman, decide to modify this language somewhat     I have a couple of comments, though  Governor Kohn mentioned that we would have a   long period in which we experience below-trend growth; but from my perspective, that’s what we   intend  We have had a period of modestly tight policy, and therefore we should expect somewhat   below-trend growth with the objective of bringing in our inflation numbers  We are right on track   May 9, 2007 90 of 130    with that, and that is where we ought to be staying  I am very comfortable with this modestly tight   policy  Over time it should systematically bring inflation down  I agree, again, with Governor   Kohn’s earlier comment that we can do it in this way with minimal cost to the economy, which is   our objective  to bring inflation down and to do it in the least costly way possible  So we need to   stick with this policy as we have defined it here  I would also point out, just for the record, that if   you want to make sure that we are not getting tied up into targets, as I have said before and will say   again today, that I am not targeting on core PCE  I much prefer core CPI—it is more easily   understood  If that is the case, then the 2 percent number, if we have to talk about a number, makes   a lot more sense  We can get this any way we want, but the point is that we need to bring the   inflation numbers down systematically, and we are not yet where I think most of us in this room   agree we should be  So where we are with the policy under alternative B is, I think, a very good   choice for us  I will end with that  "
8144,2007-06-27,HOENIG,"  Just a question about scale—regarding exhibit 8, serious   mortgage delinquency rates—when you refer to adjustable rates going to almost   12 percent of loans, is that of adjustable-rate loans?  What is the total dollar value the   10 percent is against?      Okay—and the total outstanding mortgages are what dollar   amount?    That is what I thought  I just wanted to make sure  Thank you    This is the number of loans—then do you have any idea what the   percentage of the dollar amount of loans is in delinquency?    So about the same  Okay    Thank you  I will spend just a couple of minutes extra on the   District this time because, generally speaking, our District economy continues to perform   very well despite the weakness in the housing sector  Energy and agriculture remain very   strong, and manufacturing remains generally strong although we have seen some   leveling-off of that in the past month  The strength in these three sectors has helped spur   broad-based job growth throughout the District and a significant tightening of our labor   markets and their conditions  Many of our contacts report labor shortages and higher   wage pressures  Demand for skilled labor remains very strong, and some firms have   limited hiring plans because of the unavailability of qualified workers  To bolster   June 27-28, 2007 54 of 261    recruiting, a few companies have partnered with vocational schools to offer industry-  specific training programs to try to fill the gap  Since our last meeting, hiring   announcements, which we try to track, have outpaced layoff announcements by a margin   of 6 to 1  One anecdotal piece of information—we have some fairly large engineering   firms in Kansas City that build power plants globally, including in China, and also   ethanol plants  Last year, one CEO told me that they hired 2,100 engineers and were   unable to fill 900 positions on a global basis  So there is a lot of activity going on out   there   Construction activity remains mixed, with weakness in residential construction   balanced by strength in commercial construction  On the residential side, we have seen   some pickup in sales, but high inventories have limited new construction  For us,   problems with subprime loans are concentrated in Colorado and in a few other areas  But   because of the strength in energy and agriculture, some parts of the region are actually   experiencing a housing boom, with strong home-price appreciation  Relative to the total   market, that is small, but it is a rather sharp contrast  Conditions in agriculture are the   best in recent years  Spring rains have alleviated drought conditions in much of our   region  Strong demand and limited supplies continue to boost farm commodity prices   and farm incomes  However, we are also beginning to see the effects of higher livestock   and crop prices on retail food prices themselves  An additional concern is the sharp rise   in land prices throughout much of our District  First-quarter cropland values in the   District rose roughly 12 percent above year-ago levels, and ranchland values have   strengthened as well, that much or perhaps a little more  Our contacts in the real estate   industry indicate that some of the recent surge in land prices is speculative in nature, and   June 27-28, 2007 55 of 261    some District bankers have expressed concern about the bubble in farmland values driven   in part by the ethanol boom that we have heard about  In recent examination reports, our   supervision staff have begun to see some increases in nonperforming real estate loans,   and that includes some pickup in other real estate owned as well  These developments   are very preliminary, but they are reminiscent of an earlier time, and we are trying to pay   a little more attention to that   On the national outlook, data released since the last meeting support the view that   growth will pick up over the year  I have been encouraged by the recent pickup in retail   sales and by positive news on employment and personal income  At the same time, the   recent increase in longer-term interest rates, if sustained, is likely to damp growth   somewhat in the period ahead  In particular, the rise in the thirty-year fixed mortgage   rate may deepen and prolong the ongoing housing slump  The combined effects of   weaker growth in the first quarter and the rise of long-term rates have led me to lower my   estimate of growth in 2007 to about 23 percent  I expect growth of 27 in ’08 and 28 in   ’09  I now think the risks, perhaps, are roughly balanced  While the downside risk from   housing remains, the outlook for other sectors, as others have reported, has appeared to   improve  Markets seem to have adopted this view as well, as removal of the expected   policy easing has contributed to the flattening of the yield curve at this point   In terms of the inflation outlook, recent data have been favorable, with core CPI   on a twelve-month basis down to 2¼ percent  I expect continued moderation over the   year  In particular, if owners’ equivalent rent continues at the slower pace of the past   three months, it will help bring down the twelve-month core inflation number over time    Despite these recent improvements, I continue to believe that upside risks to inflation   June 27-28, 2007 56 of 261    remain  The possible pass-through of recent energy and food price inflation to core   inflation may slow progress toward lower inflation  In addition, pressures from resource   utilization and slow productivity growth, if that happens to be the case, could affect that   outlook as well  Finally, I am somewhat concerned with the recent uptick in longer-term   inflation expectations  We have talked about the TIPS five-year, five-year-ahead   breakeven inflation rate; as mentioned in the earlier briefing, it has increased about 20   basis points over the past month  So in light of these factors, I believe it is important that   we continue to signal to the markets that current inflation rates are not acceptable over   the longer term  Thank you    Mr Chairman, I am very comfortable with our current stance at   5¼ percent  I think that it is, as I have said before, modestly restrictive and that it will   take us over time to a lower inflation rate     On the statement itself, I have a couple of comments  I am a little uncomfortable   with the language used in the output rationale because we use the term “moderate” to   describe growth for the first half of this year and coming quarters and this suggests that   there will not be much change in growth going forward as we use “moderate” in both   places  So I would like, if we could, to have something in there that will describe the   pickup in activity from the second quarter on that we have talked about  This would   improve the characterization  That is just a suggestion  I know how hard it is to craft   these things, but it is something to think about   June 27-28, 2007 104 of 261    On the inflation rationale, I’ll make two points  One, I think the statement carries   pretty well—that is, inflation has come down recently, but we are not yet confident that   progress will be maintained  Two, on a twelve-month basis, core inflation is higher than   I find acceptable over the longer term, and would like to see further progress toward price   stability  Perhaps President Fisher’s suggestions would take us closer to my preference in   terms of something more explicit that promotes further progress in reducing inflation    That would improve the statement  But, as I said, crafting these things is pretty difficult    I can live with the language as it is, and those are just suggestions to think about as we go   forward from here  Thank you    I have just a question  In communicating the projections, what are   you suggesting there, Mr Chairman?  Is it four times a year that we would put the   projections out with commentary?    Okay  Fine  Thank you    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I very much support the proposal that   you’ve outlined here  I think it does not tie our hands as individuals, which was one of my   concerns originally  It allows us to do our work as members of this Committee and to put   our information out there for our colleagues and for the public to judge, and I think that’s   very important as individuals on the Committee  I think that the third-year projections are   helpful  They do take on the tone of a goal  There’s no question about that, but I don’t think   that it’s necessarily bad at all for us as individuals; and I don’t necessarily think the fact that   we have differences is bad for us as a Committee so long as we’re clear about our analysis   for that  So I’m very supportive of that   I would move the minutes up if at all possible  I think they have served us well  We   still work very hard on the statement, but the minutes have de-emphasized the importance of   the statement because they clarify, and the sooner you can clarify through the minutes, the   better the public is served  So, yes, we should proceed  I like four times a year  Now, how   do we do it in terms of the description and so forth?  That’s something I think we’ll   experiment with over time  I really do like the histograms  I think they give a very clear   piece of information to the public and to each of us  So I’m very supportive of them as well    The variables you have are just about right  I prefer the CPI, as I have in the past, but I   certainly wouldn’t fall on my sword about it  I think getting this out is more important than   June 27-28, 2007 155 of 261    whether we do the CPI or the PCE  I do think total inflation is very important—it helps   clarify things for the public and allows us to explain the difference between it and core  If I   had my choice, I’d stay away from the fed funds rate path  Appropriate policy or the way   you have described it is fine  Using uncertainty in explaining it is extremely important   because it is an uncertain business over time   I would not have revisions; they distort what we had coming in  The minutes should   describe parts of the discussion and clarify things for us as we go through it  So redoing the   projections afterward serves no real useful purpose to my mind  I think we should move   forward on this as you’ve described it here  I like your summary of what doing it   accomplishes  Thank you    As far as the statement now goes, the way I would phrase it is that I   can live with what we have  If I may anticipate President Minehan just a little bit, I would   June 27-28, 2007 201 of 261    like to see it simpler and shorter as we go forward, especially if we can move the minutes   closer to the meeting date as we discussed here earlier  That would enable us to do that    That’s my first comment  On the governance, I think the way we do it right now is fine  If   we are going to have the statement as it is now structured, the process seems to be working,   and I don’t see any need, again, to vote on it    Well, I guess the way I would answer that is I would not change the   way we do it now because I’m not sure if it’s the first or the fourth section  [Laughter]    That’s right  "
8170,2007-08-07,HOENIG,"  Mr Chairman, the Tenth District economy overall continues to perform   well, with strength in energy and agriculture partially offset by the weaknesses in residential   construction  Developments since the last meeting include some softening in District   manufacturing activity similar to that shown in the July ISM survey numbers and in other   regional Reserve Bank indexes  We have also seen a slowing in overall employment growth  In   contrast, consumer spending seems to be holding well in spite of higher gasoline prices  Indeed,   reports from District directors and business contacts indicate a strong summer tourism season   with increased air traffic and higher hotel occupancy rates throughout the western part of our   region  The recent slowing in District employment growth has been somewhat surprising to us,   given the activity in much of our region  Since the beginning of 2004, District employment   growth has been running around 2 percent, and in the past few months has slowed to about 1½   percent  Geographically, the slowdown has been most notable in Wyoming, New Mexico,   Colorado, and Oklahoma, and anecdotal information suggests that the slower growth is due more   to a shortage of skilled and semi-skilled labor than to any weakening in demand  This anecdotal   information is supported by new regional information on employment costs by the BLS    According to them, recent employment cost increases in these states have been well above   increases nationally and in other parts of our region   Construction activity remains mixed, with weakness in residential construction offset to   some extent by strength in commercial construction  Just an aside, when you talk about things   that are on the horizon, we are a little concerned about commercial real estate because it is very   August 7, 2007 41 of 136    hot right now and there is a fairly large portion of it on the books of the banks in our region  On   the residential side, there is considerable variation across our region  In some areas where   energy and agriculture are strong, housing activity is actually above normal  In other parts of the   District, however, both national and local developers are experiencing the most difficult   conditions in some time  In most District metro areas, inventories of unsold homes continue to   rise, but the rate of increase has diminished somewhat in recent months   Turning to the national outlook, data released since the last meeting support the view that   growth will pick up over the year  Compared with the Greenbook, I am more optimistic about   both the near-term outlook and longer-run growth  Specifically, I think second-half growth is   likely to be around 2½ percent  Growth in 2008 and 2009 is likely to be near potential, which we   estimate to be around 2¾ percent  Housing obviously constitutes the major downside risk to   growth over the next few quarters  I am not yet convinced, however, that recent financial market   volatility and repricing of credit risk will have significant implications for the growth outlook  It   is still reasonable at this point to think that the recent volatility will prove transitory, and the   repricing of credit risk is, in that sense, desirable  I am also encouraged by the results of the July   senior loan officer survey, which suggests no general tightening of bank credit conditions  Like   the Bluebook, I think that Treasury yields are likely to move back up once the markets feel more   comfortable about the state of the economy and credit conditions and realize that policy easing is   not likely to be forthcoming  Although weakness in housing and tighter credit conditions have   increased the downside risk to output, I believe that strength in consumer spending, exports, and   government spending will help maintain moderate growth in the period ahead   With regard to the inflation outlook, recent data on core CPI and PCE continue to be   favorable  However, I am expecting some pass-through of higher energy prices to temporarily   August 7, 2007 42 of 136    boost core measures over the second half of this year  In addition, pressures from resource   utilization and slow productivity growth remain  Thus, despite recent improvements, I continue   to believe that some upside risk to inflation remains  Thank you     Mr Chairman, a couple of things  First, I am satisfied with the current   policy  I think that for the moment our concern should still be on inflation, and I think our policy   is designed to address that  In saying that, I also recognize—from my own observations and   from what I’ve heard here today—that more downside risks are emerging and that we have   brought the risks more in balance, I guess is the way to say it  Complicating that, of course, are   the tighter credit conditions  I think they are probably transitory, but we won’t know that for a   while yet—maybe by the next meeting  That leads me to conclude that I am comfortable with   alternative B and its language because I think it recognizes this dynamic and puts it out there for   the public  So I would stick with what we have in alternative B and then see how we develop   between now and the next meeting  Thank you    August 7, 2007 96 of 136     I’m okay if you want to put “premium,” the Vice Chairman’s language, in   there  But I think that the markets have become more volatile, and nothing is wrong with saying   that, and credit conditions have tightened, which is a fact, and people are thinking about the   volatility of the markets  So that is on their minds  We’re acknowledging it, as you said, and so I   was comfortable with the language  "
8193,2007-08-10,HOENIG,"  Yes  I don’t know if Tim, Bill, or maybe Brian can answer this, but I’m   interested in whether we’re seeing or having conversations with any of the banks in terms of lines of   credit being pulled or any kinds of pressures they might be sensing that would have implications for   the discount window as side effects  "
8204,2007-08-16,HOENIG,"  Yes  I just have a question for Bill  Can you elaborate on your comment   about the effects and the perceptions of weak backstops on some of the issuers?  I didn’t quite catch   it, and I’d like to know a little more, if you don’t mind    So when you were talking about the third backstop as weakened, the lines   of credit are still there, and the banks aren’t able to back away from those at this point or are not   backing away?    Bill, are you hearing any discussion of kicking in the “material adverse”   clauses?  Are those are being talked about or thought about, do you know?     Okay  Thank you    Yes, Mr Chairman  First of all, I agree with and support this proposal   very, very strongly  If I were asked about a 50 basis point reduction versus a 75 basis point   reduction, I would have been very agreeable to 75 basis points  But in saying that, I would also say   that I’m satisfied with 50 basis points  To explain my position, I think that one issue will be very   important to the banks—that’s why my earlier questions about lines of credit and about the   willingness to fulfill them—and I think our supporting them by reducing that cost as much as   possible is a further signal and encouragement for them to be prepared to take these credits on and   to move this stuff forward  So I think it could be a stronger statement in that regard, but even the 50   basis point reduction is taking it in the right direction and, in encouraging the individuals, will serve   a very useful purpose as we go forward  Thank you    Just quickly, Mr Chairman—first, I want to come back to President   Fisher’s point  I agree with him in terms of the concern for collateral, but the discount officers   throughout the System have very carefully put out there what collateral is acceptable, and “no   questions asked” does not mean any collateral offered  I think we have to keep that in mind    Second, I know we keep coming back to the stigma  The closer the discount rate is to the fed funds   rate the less the stigma  In terms of our announcement to the banks, saying that it would be less of a   August 16, 2007 28 of 37    stigma because it is closer to the fed funds rate, the stronger our encouragement of them to use this   facility would be  Finally, one thing I do agree with is that I would not want a fed funds rate cut   because that should be driven by our outlook for the economy  I agree with President Stern that   that’s something that we should come back to and think about in terms of what lies in the future and   then make a decision about the fed funds rate  Right now we’re focused on liquidity, and I think   this is the preferable route to take  Thank you    You might as well stay with “appreciably”    Mr Chairman, my first choice would be “further,” but I’d take   “appreciably” over “significantly”  "
8225,2007-09-18,HOENIG,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  As far as where conditions are today, I’ll keep   my remarks short since they don’t differ a great deal from the Greenbook, Part 2, and the remarks of   others  On the District itself, our District continues to do economically well  Energy obviously is a   strong factor  For agriculture, we have even adjusted the earnings numbers up dramatically since   February  Manufacturing has shown strength in August, and services seem to be good  The surveys   we’re doing also suggest those are continuing to do reasonably well  My outlook in terms of what   the reaction is or what we’re seeing in the economy for the national economy is not unlike that,   except that the data are more mixed, as described by others  So I won’t go into that     The issue is not so much where we are  It’s where we’re going to be six and nine months   from now, and the issues around that are issues of uncertainty  Banking conditions in our region,   and I think more broadly, are good  The issues there, as we will talk about later, are issues of   balance sheets, liquidity, and such things, which are important considerations to the economy going   forward  That will be an important discussion  As we survey our businesses looking forward, we   see the effects of some of the uncertainty where people, in a broad cross-section, are saying that   they have not pulled back on their capital spending or in their hiring plans generally but are in a   September 18, 2007 37 of 188    little more of a wait-and-see mode  So there is a tendency to want to hold back, and the effects of   that are really up in the air  I think that’s important for us to consider  Also, we have seen backing-  off from funding commitments that were there  Just like others, we’re seeing that as well in our   region  As a result, looking forward, we have reduced our outlook, but not anywhere near as   dramatically as the Greenbook  I think that we will get through this transition and that the economy   has enough momentum that it will go forward if confidence hasn’t been lost  So I don’t have quite   as pessimistic an outlook going forward   The other element is the inflation outlook, and I think that inflation should remain relatively   modest  The thing that struck me is that the real rate has increased as inflation has come down over   the past year since we last held, and so real rates are actually tighter  That should have a favorable   effect on the inflation outlook and also its own slowing effect in the economy, and I think that will   be a very important part of our discussion going forward  With that, I’ll just stop for the time being    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Having been a part of this policy group for a   while, the one thing I can tell you with certainty is that, no matter what we do today, it will be   criticized, [laughter] and unlike us, our critics will be absolutely confident in their position  So   having recognized that, I would feel comfortable if the Committee moves down 50 basis points   today, and if possible, I would like to be certain that we don’t convey that other moves will follow   September 18, 2007 98 of 188    in the future unless the economic and inflation outlooks require it  There are a couple of reasons for   this  The first is obvious  the turmoil and the increased uncertainty about the future, which I think   as a monetary policy group we have to take into consideration  Second, as I said in my earlier   remarks, I think that our effective policy has become tighter over the past year and, therefore, it   warrants some reduction in real rates  This will take us a little bit closer toward neutral, which I   think is an appropriate place for us to be   With that said, as far as the statement goes, I feel most comfortable with alternative B  That   covers one part of my reason for wanting this reduction, and I think that the inflation outlook and   the real rates can go unsaid for the time being  I would also just mention that, depending on how   our conversation about the auction credit facility goes, I would be comfortable with an appropriate   discount rate of the same amount or, as I said in our earlier video conferences, I would not have any   opposition to that discount rate coming down an additional 25 basis points beyond what I’m   recommending here for the fed funds rate  Thank you    Just kind of on this point  There is a description of this as somewhat   prequalifying  You have to be available for primary credit  Second, it’s temporary  Third, it’s   September 18, 2007 141 of 188    in pretty rough times as far as when you’re borrowing  I’m not sure you’re going to get rid of   the stigma problem with this, and you’re going to go through a lot of gyrations to do something   that then you’re going to have to unravel  Are you sure that you want to do this?  [Laughter]  If I   were introducing this, I think I’d be more inclined to introduce it in good times, so that you get a   perspective going that is less subject to wide interpretation  That’s a little concern I have as   much as anything    One of the appealing things about it is that it broadens options, and I think   that, any time you are in a set of circumstances where you have to find solutions, broadening your   options is good  I appreciate the fact that we are not voting on this today because I think it deserves   a little further thought, especially about the unintended consequences  There are advantages to   saying it is temporary, but I’m not sure that there aren’t also some disadvantages from that  There   are advantages in trying to remove the stigma, but I’m not sure what other hazards you create   because, if you don’t pre-qualify, what have you said to the world about that as well  So there are   September 18, 2007 150 of 188    lots of uncertainties around this that I would appreciate more time to think though before we   actually begin to implement it  "
8248,2007-10-30,HOENIG,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I will talk a little about the District this time    It continues to perform well, with ongoing weakness in the housing sector offset by strength in   agriculture and energy  As has been true for a while, construction activity remains mixed, with   weakness in residential construction offset by continued strength in commercial construction  In   October 30-31, 2007 21 of 162    terms of residential construction, both the number of single-family permits and the value of   residential construction contracts declined in September, and home inventories rose with slower   home sales, as is happening elsewhere  However, District home prices measured by the OFHEO   index edged up in the second quarter and remain stronger than in the nation as a whole  On the   commercial side, after a robust spring, construction activity has slowed but has remained solid    Energy regions, such as Wyoming, report strong activity  But even in the non-energy regions,   activity remains solid  Office vacancy rates were stable, and absorption rates declined  In   addition, developers reported more-stringent credit standards, and they expected credit   availability to remain tight   Consumer spending softened in September  Mall traffic was flat, and retailers reported   that sales were down slightly  In addition, auto dealers reported that sales fell further in   September as high gasoline prices cut demand for our SUV sales and for vans  In other areas,   though, activity appears to remain at least moderate  For example, travel and tourism remain   healthy  In addition, manufacturing activity picked up slightly in October  Solid increases   among producers of durable goods offset a weakening among producers of food, chemical, and   other nondurable goods  Even so, purchasing managers remain optimistic about future activity,   as most forward-looking indexes strengthened or held steady  Finally, we continue to see   strength in agriculture and energy  District producers are selling a bumper crop at high prices as   poor crop conditions in the rest of the world trimmed global inventories and boosted export   demand  In addition, robust meat demand kept cattle and hog prices above breakeven levels    The sharp rise in farm income led to a surge in farm capital spending in the third quarter and is   expected to rise further in the fourth quarter   October 30-31, 2007 22 of 162    Turning to the national economy, my outlook for growth is basically unchanged from our   last meeting  Generally speaking, economic indicators have been a bit stronger over the   intermeeting period, as described here, but financial markets continue, obviously, to exhibit some   stress  The senior loan officer survey suggested moderate tightening of credit conditions  That   is consistent with our estimates of slower growth in the current quarter  As before, though, I   remain more optimistic than the Greenbook about both the near-term outlook and the longer-run   growth potential for the economy  Specifically, I think growth over the forecast period will   average about 2½ percent  My forecast is based on maintaining the fed funds rate at its current   level of 4¾ percent through the middle of next year before reducing it to its more neutral level   late next year or early 2009  With regard to trend growth, I continue to expect a decline in   potential growth from about 2¾ percent to 2½ percent by 2010   Disappointing housing data have led me to mark down my near-term forecast for   residential investment  I continue to expect that residential investment will decline through the   first part of next year before turning up in the second half  Also, after strong growth in the first   half of this year, nonresidential construction is likely, perhaps, to slow significantly over the next   year and a half  Supporting growth in the near term will be moderate growth in consumer and   government spending along with strength in exports driven by the lower dollar and robust   foreign growth   Turning to the risks to the outlook, I believe they remain on the downside as far as real   output but have not worsened noticeably since our last meeting, especially with that action  I   believe that construction, both residential and nonresidential, and slower consumer spending   from higher energy prices constitute the main risks to the outlook  With regard to the inflation   outlook, recent data on core inflation continue to be, as noted here, favorable  I expect core PCE   October 30-31, 2007 23 of 162    inflation to average about 18 percent over the forecast period—remember, assuming no change   in the fed funds rate—but I also expect that overall PCE inflation next year will moderate as the   effects of higher food and energy prices wear off  However, I do remain concerned about the   upside risk to inflation as well  Greater dollar depreciation and higher energy and commodity   prices, along with greater pass-through from all three, could push inflation higher for a period of   time  In addition, I am also concerned about the implications of the gradual upcreep in the TIPS   measures of expected inflation for the long-run path, and I am receiving more anecdotal   information, in discussions with individuals in our region, about a change in expectations about   inflation as they continue to deal with some rising prices in materials and other goods  Thank   you, Mr Chairman    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’ll take just a second here because I realize   how difficult today’s decision is and that it involves balancing contrasting and rather elevated   risks  One risk is that the current housing and financial environment will cascade the real   economy immediately into a slowdown, and that would cost output and jobs and prove after all   to involve little effect on rising inflation  To do nothing in this instance, I realize, would at least   seem to be a poor choice     October 30-31, 2007 90 of 162    The other risk, however, is that inflation is less contained than we would like to think    Aggregate demand is at least holding and looks firm  Commodity prices, not just energy, show a   rising trend and are unusually high  The dollar has depreciated, as Brian pointed out, and if it   continues to fall, will add to further inflationary pressures  Unit labor costs are increasing, and   these inflationary factors are real and show themselves to be present in TIPS measures and in   terms of expected inflation, as I mentioned yesterday, in a lot of anecdotal discussions that I have   had  To ease further in this instance would also seem to be a poor choice    I realize that the intensity of these two countervailing forces complicates our decision,   and I know that I might be only one view on this, among others who have a different view  But   as I see it, we are having to choose a policy that involves tradeoffs around these two choices    One choice is to ease now  We would take an action that is oriented toward the short run, and   the immediate easing could be looked at as an insurance policy, as I have heard it described,   designed to mitigate further the possibility that the current upheaval in the housing and financial   markets will lead to an unwanted slowdown in the real economy  If the economy strengthens, as   President Lacker has pointed out, we can always reverse that easing—so we tell ourselves  The   other choice is to hold firm now  Inflationary risks, as I’ve described above, are real; and while   they are unlikely to affect us in the short run, they most certainly could affect us in the longer run   if we continue to ease  If inflation above acceptable levels gets entrenched into the US and   global economies, make no mistake—as we all have experienced, this has happened before    Inflation does creep in  It doesn’t jump in—it’s a little at a time  Also, if we ease today and   things don’t turn immediately, we will be reset for another discussion of what the market expects   when we come to December  The cost to remedy inflationary momentum later is also high—  indeed, as we all know   October 30-31, 2007 91 of 162    So what is the better choice, then, when adjusted for long-run and short-run   considerations regarding these elevated risks?  Personally, I think that we should hold where we   are  When I analyze how the US and global economies are performing and look at the   projections for these economies that we shared here, I judge this to be the better long-run   decision  We moved rates down significantly at our last meeting  Indeed, we front-loaded the   action to ensure a strong result  Also, we are very close to neutral, if not there, I realize, and we   need to be slightly firm if we are to hold inflation and inflationary expectations better in check    It strikes me that inflation is at the higher end of what most individuals prefer  If we need to   move down, we can do so later  It is, in fact, easier to lower rates than to raise them back up    Our issue today, I think, remains for the moment principally liquidity, and we should remind the   world that we have stepped up to this issue and reassure it that we are ready to meet the need   further—and other needs, if necessary  But for now the risks on both sides of this policy   decision are elevated, and we need to wait, watch, and be ready to act depending on how events   play out   As to the statement, then, I prefer alternative B for the most part  I would prefer   something along the lines in paragraph 4 that “financial markets remain uncertain,” and then   “thus the Committee will continue   ” or paragraph 4 in alternative C  Thank you very much,   Mr Chairman    I do      Well, what I really prefer is that we go back to our last statement but say,   “Financial markets obviously remain uncertain, and we will watch them  Thus   ,” and then   October 30-31, 2007 92 of 162    bring in “the Committee will continue to assess the effects of financial and other factors,”   without the downside risk      Exactly    Mr Chairman?    I’m sorry, but I need to understand what you just implied  Are we to go   back now and redo our projections for this meeting under the assumption that we took the action   today?    Okay  But it’s not what I based my decision on    But the whole point of the process was to prepare us for this meeting,   and now I am going to go back and reassess the process I went through in light of what took   place in this meeting  If everyone is comfortable with doing that, then I would be happy and able   to do it  At least I understand that we are all going in the same direction that way  So I am fine   with it, as long as that is what, in fact, we’re doing     If that’s it, then I’ll go back and do it  I just want to make sure that’s   what we all agree we’re going to do  If that is, then fine; but I didn’t have that understanding   before you made that statement    It’s like an annual report that has updated information in it  As long as   everyone is doing the same thing    I’ve got a long record, and I haven’t been in this situation too often  But   I have been in this situation before  "
8273,2007-12-06,HOENIG,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I appreciate this proposal  I have just a   couple of questions  They are really related to perhaps the announcement and to the idea of   “temporary” but perhaps longer term than that, and to encouraging, if you will, the market or the   banks to in fact use this out of the chute  The more the emphasis is on temporary, the more you   continue to carry the stigma issue forward; and the more it is presented as a program that we are   initiating that we might extend as our normal operation, the more it would mitigate the issue of   stigma  I don’t know if you have or maybe someone on the staff has thought about this, and I   would like your reaction to the issue of how we present this to get it as successful as possible out   of the chute   December 6, 2007 14 of 51     May I have one follow-up question to that?  When it is announced, what   is my flexibility in answering banks’ questions as to the minimum size of future bids?  Right   now it is at $10 million  You suggested, or the memo suggested, that it could go as low as $1   million  I will get that question fairly quickly after this is announced  I don’t want to raise   expectations, nor do I want to ignore questions  I don’t know if there is a balance on that, or   maybe we say just, “We’ll wait and see”  I guess that may be the better answer?  I see Brian   responding    Thank you  "
8296,2007-12-11,HOENIG,"  David, in listening to this, I have a question  As you are looking at and   projecting forward, we’re talking about a fed funds rate path that comes down, and yet we’ve talked   a great deal about inflation rising temporarily in some views  The question I have is, Does it give   you pause?  How do you analyze the risk that you are lowering rates in an environment of rising   inflation on a global basis?  Do you have any concerns about the risk?  Are you reevaluating the risk   of how stable inflationary expectations might be in that scenario?   December 11, 2007 30 of 138     Right, and you’re saying the slowdown in the economy makes that   temporary?    Thank you   December 11, 2007 31 of 138     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’ll start on the local level  Overall our District   economy continues to perform generally well, with ongoing weakness in the housing sector being   offset by strength in agriculture, energy, and manufacturing  We have seen some slowing in   employment growth over the past few months, but this appears in part to be a supply consideration    Our directors and business contacts continue to report that the labor markets are, in fact, tight across   much of the District with shortages of both skilled and unskilled labor and rising wage pressures    There is some reduction in employment, obviously in the housing sector, but that is being offset by   these other considerations  I would also note that manufacturing activity remains basically solid,   with manufacturers reporting strong export orders  The District’s manufacturing index moved   upward in November and still points to moderate growth  In addition, District manufacturers’   capital spending plans actually rose but remained below most of last year’s readings on balance   Turning to spending, general retailers reported a rebound in sales in the latter part of   October and early November  Automobile dealers, on the other hand, did report weaker sales and   have also become more pessimistic on future sales  Travel and tourism continues to expand in our   region, with District airline traffic figures solid, particularly in the Denver area  Likewise, hotel   occupancy figures have continued to increase from already strong levels in the region  As has been   true for some time, housing activity, as I said, remains soft  For example, the value of residential   December 11, 2007 58 of 138    contracts dropped again in October, and the rate of decline in residential permits steepened again in   the past few months in our region  Offsetting this weakness in housing, though, is considerable   strength in agriculture and energy  District energy producers continue to expand their capital   investments as they are relatively confident that oil and gas prices will remain firm over the longer   term  In fact, their capital expenditures have been slowed by a continuing shortage of labor and   access to some equipment  Our larger regional banks are still reporting fairly good conditions  The   deal flows seem to be coming through, although they are looking at those carefully, just given the   environment that they find themselves in on a national level  Finally, price pressures remain mixed    Most businesses report rising input costs, both labor and materials, but differ in their ability to pass   those costs on at this point  In transportation, input costs are passed through one for one through   customer surcharges  Other businesses continue to find it a little more difficult to pass through the   higher costs, but they are beginning to push harder on that as we talk to them   Let me turn to the national outlook  Weakness in incoming data and continuing stress in   financial markets obviously are noteworthy, and others have noted that here today  Compared with   the Greenbook, however, I see stronger growth in both the short run and the longer run  I expect   fourth-quarter growth to be closer to 1 percent, not the zero percent in the Greenbook, and the   economy to strengthen slowly through a good part of 2008, starting out slowly obviously and then   picking up as we go through the year  Comparing my views with those in Greenbook, the basic   difference appears to be largely in some of the judgmental adjustments in the Greenbook concerning   spillovers from the housing and financial stress to consumer spending  The current Greenbook   forecast, as others have noted, is similar to the Blue Chip Bottom Ten forecast, which suggests to   me that it might be better seen as the downside risk outlook not necessarily the most likely outlook   at this point  The first half of 2008, as I said, is likely to be somewhat slower than I previously   December 11, 2007 59 of 138    projected because of the high energy prices and continued drag from housing  However, I expect   that growth will gradually strengthen as we move toward the end of 2008 and then remain there   through the rest of the forecast period  Having said this, I realize that the downside risk to economic   activity does remain elevated  The housing slowdown could be deeper and last longer, and   continuing financial turmoil could further affect consumer and business spending  However, while   financial factors remain a risk to the outlook, in my view the economy, though it will grow below its   potential, can weather these forces and is being supported by the policy actions that we have taken   in the past two meetings   Against this outlook for economic growth, let me turn now to the inflation outlook  Year-  over-year overall and core inflation rates have risen  In addition, Greenbook’s 2008 forecast for   overall and core PCE inflation has increased since our last meeting  While below-trend growth in   the near term may exert some downward pressure on inflation, the combination of higher prices for   oil, commodities, and some services and dollar depreciation should place upward pressure on both   overall and core inflation going forward  Over the past several years, the pass-through of dollar   depreciation and higher oil prices to inflation has been limited in part because of longer-term   inflation expectations remaining, as we said, anchored  My concern is that, if we continue to lower   the fed funds rate into a rising inflation environment and the dollar continues to depreciate, these   expectations may become unhinged perhaps more quickly than we would like to think  In this   environment, I think we should not lose sight of not just the downside risk to the real economy but   also some very serious upside risk to inflation  Thank you    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I would say that when Governor Mishkin   talked about the importance of maintaining long-anchored expectations about inflation, I agreed   with that  I think that is more vulnerable than others do, and so if it were on the table, I would   support maintaining the rate  I think inflation risks are elevated  I am uneasy about lowering   rates into a rising inflation environment, and I think we should have allowed more time for the   75 basis points to work  Having said that, however, I also acknowledge that the downside risk to   growth may be larger than I judge it to be  There is a lot of evidence out there right now, and I   have heard it from around the table  Thus, I can accept the 25 basis point cut, if that is the   Committee’s preferred action  I would be very uneasy with a 50 basis point cut at this time, and   I do not think a 50 basis point cut is warranted in conjunction with tomorrow’s announcement of   a term auction facility  I think that would send a signal to financial markets that we view the   outlook as more dire than it is, thus adding to financial turmoil rather than alleviating it  So I ask   the Committee to keep that very carefully in mind as we go forward with this discussion  Thank   you, Mr Chairman    I do  Turning to the statement, I think the language in alternative B is   the right language, regardless of which—A, B, or C—we choose  I think in particular I would   December 11, 2007 100 of 138    prefer that we not assess a balance of risk and instead simply state that recent events have   increased the uncertainty on output and inflation  Thank you  "
8317,2008-01-09,HOENIG,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I recognize that the risks on the economy are   elevated  I have recognized it for some time  My concern is that the risks are elevated as   dangerously, if you will, for inflation as for the slowdown  We have at this point a situation in   which we have revised up our inflation numbers and yet that is after we have cut 100 basis   points, which we have not seen the full effect of  Those rate cuts are in process now, and they   are not going to address the housing issue, given its circumstances, and they are going to work   January 9, 2008 32 of 60    slowly through the rest of the economy as we move forward  We have revised up in our   estimates the fourth-quarter real GDP numbers, and I think that is important to note even though   I know our risks overall are elevated for growth, given some of the data coming in  Job growth   came in disappointingly  It did so also in September, and it was revised up significantly after   that  I don’t know if the numbers will be revised up, but I would like to go cautiously,   recognizing that they have been revised up in the past  I think there are tail risks  There is an   important risk of the economy slowing, perhaps going into recession  I think that there is an   elevated risk of the inflation numbers continuing to creep up as they have over the past several   months  If these inflation numbers continue to rise as we decrease interest rates, there is a very   serious cost that will have a very significant detrimental effect on the economy in the long run,   which we need to keep sight of   My concern—as others have expressed, but it is a very serious concern on my part—is   that we say we can reverse the policy position or raise interest rates later  But it is extremely   difficult, and understandably so, because the earlier actions will still be having an effect while   the economy shows a slowing  When it starts to pick up, we won’t be sure, just as now, whether   we really are going to accelerate and whether the economy is going to pick up  So we delay in   reversing those actions, understandably so  So that is why I want to be very cautious about   coming down with our interest rates because we will be very cautious going up with our interest   rates on the other side of that   I am very pleased that you have not put an actual proposal on an action today  I would be   very uncomfortable with that  I think we need to have a full discussion with more information   before we commit to any kind of interest rate moves at our month-end meeting  I understand the   January 9, 2008 33 of 60    risk, but I think it requires a lot of analysis as we look both at inflation and what that may mean   to us if it’s rising and at the real danger of a recession  Thank you    Mr Chairman, just a question  Will you let the world know we had this   meeting?  I ask only because I have a directors’ program tonight and a directors’ meeting   January 9, 2008 47 of 60    tomorrow morning, and I don’t know what the circumstances are about acknowledging this   meeting or anything else  So I would appreciate some information    I appreciate knowing that  Thank you  "
8338,2008-01-21,HOENIG,"  Yes, Mr Chairman  I don’t want to get ahead of what you might be   saying, but if Bill could give us a sense of what the markets are doing overseas, I would   appreciate just his sense of things    Yes, Mr Chairman  I am troubled by this, I will admit  I understand the   arguments, and it is difficult to argue against dodging a crisis  It is a very daunting thought to   January 21, 2008 14 of 32    think about a crisis that you might have avoided had you just taken certain actions  I would echo   Bill Poole a bit in terms of understanding what we will get out of this and how we will deal with   backing away from this in the future because part of the reason we have the problem today, of   course, is the last crisis  The desire is to intervene, to get the market rates down, and to bring   confidence; but then our ability to pull out of that is compromised because we can’t be sure in an   uncertain world of how strongly the economy might be coming out of something  Therefore, we   often delay and create the next issue that we have to deal with—as we are today   So I am troubled  I know the risk coming in tomorrow  I know we are being driven   heavily by these markets  At the same time, I think doing an intermeeting move commits us to   another move down the way  It will be hard to stay at rates that are not going to at least invite   another series of problems down the road because I see us at 3 percent by nine days from now    So how do we deal with that?  I would at least like to hear some discussion as we consider this   pretty substantial action tonight  Those are my comments    It is, I guess, helpful, but let me ask this  A point that was made earlier,   when you said that we are moving to where we need to be, in terms of the real rate, taking total   inflation, we are moving to real rates that are negative  I am fairly confident that, while this is a   bold move, it is also a precursor to another move a week or nine days from now, which would   put us in an even more negative position, when we are projecting the economy to be slowing and   when, in fact, total inflation is above—currently at least, year over year—4 percent  I understand   the concerns about the markets and people’s uncertainty  But we are taking these very dramatic   actions right now, more perhaps than what we need when you say “where interest rates need to   be”  If we were to go 50 basis points now and 50 basis points at the next meeting, we are still   moving down, but we are taking it in a more measured form  I am not convinced that isn’t a   better way of going, given where we are with the economy and given where we are with our   projections looking forward  That is really something that maybe you could at least address—  the negative levels of the real rate in terms of your comfort going forward and where we need to   be    Mr Chairman, I hear you, and I appreciate your concerns  I do   understand that there is a psychology in the market that is having its effect  I think if we make   this statement as strong as we can about the need to watch inflation, and if we understand among   ourselves that, as we take this action today and the follow-up actions that I am certain we are   going to take, we will watch these inflation numbers, including broad asset values—I know we   don’t prick bubbles and that sort of thing, but watching these broad asset-price movements—that   would be very, very important, at least to think about  I do not wish to be dissenting on this, as   troubled as I am about it  I do understand the psychology of it  For those reasons, I am willing   to go along with this  But I worry about our ability to deal with reversal as this takes place,   especially given where our projections for growth are right now and my concern that we already   have inflation above 4 percent  So I defer to you at this point  I would vote for it because I think   the psychology of the marketplace is, of course, rather fragile, and I will leave it at that  Thank   you    Yes  I think the strongest language as we can give would make me much   more comfortable  "
8360,2008-01-29,HOENIG,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Let me talk a bit about the region  The   Tenth District is generally moving forward at a fairly steady pace, but there are some mixed data    The obvious wide variances are in real estate  Housing is weak—not as weak as some parts of   the country but still weak  Also, it is interesting that commercial real estate in each of our major   cities right now continues to do well  I recently talked with several developers  They are all   doing well but are very concerned, and they are beginning to cut back on their plans and move   away from them  So you can see the worry carrying forward in terms of what actions they are   taking  In the agricultural area and in the energy area, real estate is a different story  It is   booming  Land values have gone up in the ag part—non-irrigated land, something like   20 percent over the past year  If you are near an ethanol plant, it has gone up 25 to 30 percent  It   is also interesting that the ag credit system is helping to fund that  Their increase in lending was   about 12 percent this past year  That is up from about 9 percent the year before, so they are   providing that  They are also now involved in lending to these ethanol plants in a very   significant way, helping to carry that boom forward  That gives me some pause in terms of what   is going on in some of the rural areas  Related to that, the energy and lease values are also   accelerating at a fairly high rate  I found it reminiscent and somewhat disturbing in talking to a   couple of individuals when they noted that the land values have about doubled over the past two   or three years in some areas, and they said that I should relax because on current ag prices they   should have tripled  [Laughter]  Where have I seen that before?   On the other side, actually, manufacturing in our region has held steady  We have a lot of   aircraft manufacturing, which is really strong, and some other smaller manufacturers providing   support in both ag and energy, and they seem to be doing well  Technology is also doing well in   the region, especially in the mountain areas—the Colorado and Denver areas  Engineering firms   January 29–30, 2008 68 of 249    are still very strong—the strong demand for engineers and the unfilled positions continue  They   are supplying that service across the globe and see continued demand there  So it is mixed, but   overall probably our region is doing better than average relative to the rest of the nation   On the national level, my projections suggest that we are going to grow below our   potential growth rate  I am not as pessimistic as the Greenbook  I also have inflation coming   down, but that is on the assumption that we are able to reverse our monetary policy at a fairly   quick pace as we move through this year and into 2009  I will leave it there  Thank you    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Given the discussion I have heard so far, it is   apparent to me that we will most likely move to a 3 percent fed funds rate today  If we do so, I   think we should be prepared to stop at this point and let the market work through the   disturbances that only time and market adjustments will correct  While I would not pre-commit   to no further cuts, I would give no hint of them either  I think that is important  The discussion   we just had around this table is that we cannot know the future, there are always headwinds, and   we will make a mistake  Therefore, we should limit ourselves to some extent  As I have   expressed in this Committee before, I think we should narrow the range to which we are willing   to move the fed funds rate  My judgment is that to move to levels outside the reasonable range   that, yes, I know would be debated, but a reasonable range of neutral, is as likely to introduce   disturbances into the economy as it is to moderate the economy’s performance   I find an approach to policy that focuses on the real equilibrium rate compelling  I think   it is good theory, and it is common sense and can be explained to the public  I understand that   we cannot observe the equilibrium rate, but we cannot observe the NAIRU, potential GDP, or   most other criteria  The real rate is at least related to the policy tool that we focus on, which is   interest rates  When you systematically move below or above the neutral rate, you   systematically stimulate or restrict the economy  With that in mind, and since monetary policy   works with a lag, I would recommend that we follow a policy in which we stop moving rates and   let the market work once we are notably below or above the long-run neutral rate based upon a   reasonable estimate  This is a credible approach to policy  Today, a nominal 3 percent fed funds   January 29–30, 2008 120 of 249    rate would provide for an actual inflation-adjusted rate that is less than 1 percent  That is quite   stimulative  That will serve to support the real economy as the financial sector adjusts, and it has   to adjust  To stimulate the economy further at our current inflation rate is to invite, or at least to   increase the probability of, higher inflation or encourage the next asset bubble or both, and it will   undermine our credibility in the long run   Turning to the press statement, I have three brief comments  First, in paragraph 2, I   would begin by putting the economic rationale before the financial market reference, which   would most appropriately align our recent actions with our concern for the downside risk to the   economy and place our concern for financial market stress in better perspective  Second, I   believe that a detailed discussion of inflation risk may not be helpful at this time, and the less   said the better  Therefore, I prefer the language in paragraph 3 of alternative B rather than any   other of the options  Finally, I believe we should modify the risk assessment to provide more   flexibility for future decisions  Most important, it should place less emphasis on the possibility   of future rate cuts and better position us to return to a neutral position later this year and early   next  Therefore, I would rewrite paragraph 4 along the lines that President Plosser suggested    To summarize, I suggest that we act at this meeting, explain our action as I suggested, and hold   at that point  Thank you    Yes  Your exhibit 4 and your risk-based capital ratios, fourth quarter, are   those as of December 31?    Okay  And do these reflect losses already taken in capital rates?    Okay  Thank you    My comment is on the conflicts of interest as well  The only thing I   would like to add is that this is not the first time the rating agencies have miscalculated the risk   and put that out there  The incentives are designed to do exactly that, and it will occur again  I   January 29–30, 2008 175 of 249    think this statement is too generous to the rating agencies  The incentives are driving them to do   this, they did it, and they will do it again in the future  It is just inherent that, when you are going   to make that kind of money and if you can get it down to working with them and pushing this   stuff out, it really is a matter, for those who use them, that you get what you pay for    I think this was very interesting, and I have a suggestion and then a   question  The suggestion is that this morning we had the Federal Open Market Committee meeting    This afternoon we should have the Federal Market Oversight Committee meeting, and that is what   we’re doing right now in looking at some of these institutions  My question is, As you look at these   and you compare the most effective and least effective, are you in the process and shouldn’t we be   in the process—because we go back and look at these horizontal reviews—of looking at what   lessons we’ve learned about more-effective institutions and less-effective institutions during the   horizontal review so that we can be more proactive in terms of the outcomes that we’re now seeing?    If we do that in a systematic fashion over time, we could anticipate not all—we learned a long time   ago that you cannot anticipate it all—but some of these differences and put more pressure on some   institutions that were not doing good risk analysis to step up to it before it becomes a crisis  I don’t   know if we’re doing lessons learned for ourselves in that regard    I think that is good because, if you think about it, we have the Basel capital   standards coming forward, which involve the advanced method—relying on those institutions to a   great degree in terms of judging their capital and their capital levels  When they are under pressure,   they will tend to work the model  It is natural  As we have said before, the incentives are that they   will work the model  So if we are not taking lessons learned from this in terms of anticipating those   behaviors, I think we will repeat history in the surprises that we get  "
8389,2008-03-10,HOENIG,"  If I understand this, the ability to go outside our normal collateral and   into, say, these jumbos and so forth is based upon section 13 (3) in the Federal Reserve Act  Am   I right on that?  As you talked about moral hazard, did you have any concerns that, should the   market not accept this and things deteriorate further, we would find ourselves going down the   road to greater acceptance of greater varieties of collateral that we need to think about in the   future?    I assume that to try to handle the issues around moral hazard, the fact   that we are confining it to the primary dealers is an important consideration?   March 10, 2008 9 of 39     I don’t oppose this  I just want to make sure that I understand some of   the implications because I assume that part of this, given the circumstances in the markets, is to   create a floor under this that is, in effect, trying to stanch the momentum and keep the losses   down  So that logic will apply more broadly should the markets deteriorate, and that is kind of   the path we are on  This is a crisis, I admit, and I just want to make sure that we are clear on   what it is we are initiating here    Okay    Just a comment  When I read this paper, I sensed that you have to get   comfortable with the fact that we are extending the safety net to a group with the goal of settling   the markets, which reflects, in fact, the reality that we now have with this very integrated, much   more complicated marketplace  As we do this, I think moving back from it will be much more   difficult than we are anticipating  That is why going into this we make a pretty clear decision   that we have opened the safety net to a broader group for the purposes of managing this crisis   and that we will probably revisit this again, depending on whether we stanch this now or whether   it continues forward—the question that we have been asking ourselves for several months  I   think this is the way that we will find ourselves continuing down, depending on how long this   lasts—that we are going to extend the safety net  "
8407,2008-03-18,HOENIG,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I thought I would talk a bit about some   events in our region that I think have global implications—that is to say, I will talk a bit about   agriculture  You have heard others here this morning talk about some of the price movements,   and I think it is worth perhaps spending a few minutes on their effects  First of all, agricultural   commodity prices have surged to record highs, driven by obviously strong demand, lean   supplies, and a weak dollar  Since the fall of 2007, winter wheat prices have doubled, and corn   and soybean prices have risen about 70 percent, to record highs  Rising crop prices are boosting   farm income  In real terms, US net farm income is expected to climb to the second highest   level on record, trailing only 1972, when abrupt sales of US wheat to Russia pushed up farm   income   An emerging concern is the growing disarray in futures markets for agricultural   commodities caused by a surge in investment by index and hedge funds going forward  Recent   reports indicate that hedge and index fund investment in futures markets for corn, soybeans, and   wheat rose from $10 billion in January 2006 to $45 billion this past January  Early this month,   index funds held more than 40 percent of the long positions on wheat contracts on the Chicago   Board of Trade  At this rapid pace of investment—since the beginning of this year averaging   March 18, 2008 24 of 127    $1 billion per week—the funds would own the nation’s entire 2008 corn, wheat, and soybean   crops by early 2009  Now, that is obviously theoretical, but that is how much money is going   into this market  The resulting market disarray is constraining the traditional use of commodity   futures to hedge market risk  Grain elevators, which use futures to hedge their contracts to   purchase crops from producers for future delivery, are facing much larger than normal margin   calls on their futures positions  Some reports indicate that lenders are beginning to restrict their   funding of elevator hedges  As a result, an increasing number of elevators are limiting their   contracts for crop purchases to no more than sixty days in advance of the delivery instead of the   normal one to two years   Now, this surge in crop prices and farm income is pushing up farmland values    According to our bank’s agricultural credit survey in the fourth quarter of 2007, non-irrigated   cropland values jumped 20 percent over 2006 levels, with strong gains also reported in irrigated   cropland and ranchland  Our directors and other contacts report a further strong gain since the   beginning of the year, and some have reported as much as a 20 percent increase in the first   quarter alone  Adjusted for inflation, the average price of farmland across the nation now tops   the early 1980s peak, which immediately preceded the plunge in the early to mid 1980s     To date, crop production budgets suggest that the recent run-up in farmland values is   supported by current revenues from crop production  However, farm input costs have also risen   sharply, driven by higher energy costs, suggesting that a drop in crop prices could quickly erode   farm cash flow and undermine these values  District bankers report a surge in farm capital   spending  In February, sales of four-wheeled major equipment rose 45 percent above 2007   levels, and combine harvester sales were up 13 percent  Farm equipment prices have risen   sharply, and our directors and other contacts report that some equipment dealers are rationing   March 18, 2008 25 of 127    purchases among their customers  In the past month, anecdotal reports from District contacts   indicate that nonfarm investors have boosted their farmland purchases  Our contacts at a   national farm management company based in Omaha stated that the number of inquiries for   farmland purchases by corporate interests has jumped significantly recently  Similarly, one of   our directors reported that a hedge fund with assets of more than $7 billion is expected to invest   $500 million in cropland from Texas and Nebraska  This fund recently purchased nearly 25   square miles of corn acreage in western Nebraska   Now, we continue to watch for signs of rising leverage, but to date farm debt levels have   risen modestly only, and agricultural banks seem to remain healthy  Bankers report continued   use of cash to finance farmland purchases, but I would note that leverage is being brought into   the picture, and I think that will accelerate as opportunism and greed have their way  Total farm   lending in the District banks has increased a modest 14 percent over the past four years, with   most of that growth being in farm real estate lending  But District bank examiners and   respondents to our surveys reported that the Farm Credit System was being more aggressive in   funding farm real estate transactions  Real estate mortgage loans held by the Farm Credit   System rose about 12 percent in 2007  Asset quality at our ag banks remains, at this point, solid    Noncurrent assets—all assets, not just farm loans—at ag banks are up only slightly from a year   ago and remain well below historical averages  Net loan losses are still very low  Earnings have   remained solid primarily because of cost control and very low loss provisions  I am very   pleased, but I will tell you that, going forward, in terms of the surveys with the kinds of pressure   and price appreciation going on, I think the push for leverage is just beginning     March 18, 2008 26 of 127    At the national level, in terms of the Greenbook, every indication is that the economy is   slowing  Whether it is recession or very slow growth is a matter of degree, but I think our   projections are in the same direction as the Greenbook     Turning to the inflation outlook, I am concerned, as I have said before, about the upside   risk to inflation  Though I certainly agree with others around the table that weaker economic   activity may put some downward pressure on goods price inflation, I think we can also agree that   a number of factors could push inflation higher, including rapidly rising commodity prices   worldwide and a weaker dollar  As discussed in the Bluebook, there is some indication that   inflation expectations may be moving higher as well  As I have indicated before, I am   increasingly concerned that, in our need to respond to signs of economic weakness, we risk   losing our hard-won credibility on inflation  For the past four years, core PCE inflation has   averaged about 21 percent, considerably above the numbers that this Committee has put forward   in its long-term projections  Frankly, I do not think that many people outside this room think   that this Committee can deliver the longer-run projections that we have put forward  I don’t   think that we can keep inflation expectations anchored only by talk if actual inflation rises   further in the months ahead and we continue to ease policy in a rising inflationary environment    This is something that we need to keep in mind as we discuss our policy options today  Thank   you    Mr Chairman, I think this is a mistake  I want to take just a second  I   understand why we’ve been lowering the rate, trying to keep the problems from spreading over to   the real economy  I’ve been reluctant because our practice has been to go too low and to create a   new set of circumstances that we have to deal with although I’ve understood, given the seriousness   of this financial crisis, that we’ve had to go down  I have been and continue to be very supportive   of the use of our TAF and our other vehicles to provide liquidity to the market to help address and   stanch the panic  The fact of the matter is, though, that there is an enormous amount of loss    Whether there is enough capital in the banking industry, we know that there is a solvency issue out   there, and these actions, while they provide liquidity, cannot solve that problem  That’s where fiscal   policy goes  But I’m not sure that our continuing to lower rates isn’t allowing others who should be   addressing this to look to us to solve the problem that is not ours to solve, and that concerns me   about where we are   March 18, 2008 88 of 127    The fed funds rate at 3 percent nominal, I think, is a stimulative rate in terms of where the   real fed funds rate is  In an environment where we now move down even lower than that, we are   inviting other speculative activities  Liquidity has to go somewhere, and it is going there fast  I   think there’s a danger in doing that, and this 3 percent will stimulate the economy forward  Two   and a quarter will stimulate the economy forward and introduce other significant risks both to   speculative activity and to inflation, and that’s why I think we should be more careful in going   forward  Now, doing nothing will shock the market, but I’ll tell you that the market has been   shocked as much by some of the new actions we have taken as if we said, “Here it is at 3 percent”    There are a lot of people on the sidelines waiting for us to stop so that they can come in and take   advantage of the situation  So there are lots of reasons that I would much prefer to hold at this   period, and I felt compelled to express that view  Thank you    Mr Chairman, I don’t want to prolong this too much, but in response to   the Vice Chairman’s comments, I am not sure I follow what you are saying  I think the model   that you showed us, in terms of where the equilibrium rate is, is a short-term model  It is based   upon a variety of estimates and output gaps, and I think there is plenty of room for disagreement   around that model  So the fact that we have different views on this Committee is very healthy    Even to the world it can be very healthy because a lot of people out there have a different view of   this and are wondering if there is any variance of views within this Committee  I think that can   serve as useful a purpose as uniformity without objection    Vice Chairman, we have a bubble developing in some parts of our area    I think they are aware of that, and so I think we have to be mindful of that in our discussion more   broadly  That is why I think there are important differences that we should necessarily be able   to—and should in fact—acknowledge publicly   March 18, 2008 111 of 127   "
8433,2008-04-29,HOENIG,"  A question—and just remind me—if we bring the student loans and   these other assets in under this facility, do we have the right to swap out if the rating changes or   questions come up?    That was my first question  The second is that we have been entangled   before in appearance issues  If we feel that we are doing the right thing, that doesn’t give me   much concern  On the substance, do you judge that the tightness in the market is such that this   action is necessary to facilitate liquidity, or will this only marginally improve things?  If it is   marginal, the appearance issue becomes more entangled, I think  If it is pretty clear that we have   some liquidity issues and that this will address them, then I would feel much more comfortable   with it    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Economic activity continues to be slow in the   Tenth District with a soft tone in our residential and nonresidential construction and certainly in our   retail sales  Mitigating this weakness, however, to some extent is continued strength in energy and   agriculture exports and, to a lesser degree, manufacturing  With regard to exports, one interesting   development is a shortage of shipping containers domestically and internationally that is limiting the   volume of exports of both our agricultural and some of our manufacturing products  On balance   though, the District activity continues to be stronger than the national economy, and this is reflected   in better employment growth and firm labor markets in many parts of our region   April 29–30, 2008 63 of 266    In my recent discussions with directors at our Bank and in our Branches and the Economic   Advisory Council members, several themes have been prominent  Concern about inflation has   escalated to the highest level I’ve been involved with in the last decade  Businesses across the   board are experiencing the largest input cost pressures in recent memory for them  Many businesses   have not been able to absorb these cost pressures and have raised prices to both retail and business   customers, and generally speaking, businesses are finding much less resistance to price increases   than in the past  Businesses also report that suppliers are increasingly reluctant to make contractual   price quotes very far in the future   We have also been monitoring the effects of credit availability on business capital spending   in our area  Although businesses report some tightening of credit conditions, credit costs and   availability are not the primary factors behind reduced capital spending plans  Bank loans have   actually continued to grow  Instead, businesses cite uncertainty about the economic outlook as the   main impediment to investment  They are in a wait-and-see mode  So spending is being held back   not for financial reasons but just caution  Indeed, they suggest that uncertainty about whether   monetary policy will be eased further is a factor currently inhibiting their capital spending plans    They want to see when we’re done   Turning to the broader economic output and the national economy, I have revised down my   growth estimate for the first half of 2008 but have had few changes to my longer-term outlook    Compared with the Greenbook, I see somewhat stronger growth this year and somewhat weaker   growth next year  Weaker growth in the first half of this year is coming largely from the effects of   higher energy prices on consumer and business spending coupled with the continued weakness in   residential construction  I would say that the effect of high energy prices is now about as large as or   even larger than the contraction in residential construction, and I think that the energy outlook   April 29–30, 2008 64 of 266    constitutes a main downside risk to growth in the period ahead  In contrast—and contrary to the   Greenbook and the views of some—I think that energy and housing perhaps now more than credit   problems are holding back economic growth  Certainly credit conditions have continued to tighten   as reflected in the April Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey, and markets for many asset-backed   securities, of course, have shut down  But the availability of credit for good business and household   borrowers does not appear to have really been restricted that much  They are pricing more wisely   for risk, and that is probably a positive  Consequently, the downside economic risks from a   pronounced credit contraction appear to have diminished considerably over the past few months   I want to turn to inflation  In my view, the inflation outlook has worsened considerably    For the first time in many years, we are seeing significant inflation pressure from goods prices,   especially imported goods prices  Moreover, the recent moderation in monthly inflation numbers is   coming mainly from some softness in service prices, which in my opinion, is unlikely to continue    More optimistic views of inflation, including those in the Greenbook, rely heavily on economic   slack and a turnaround in food and energy prices to improve the outlook  I am skeptical on both   counts  I do not think that there will be as much slack generated in the current slowdown as does   the Greenbook, and there is evidence that the effects of output and employment gaps on inflation   have fallen, well, actually more than a little over the past two decades  Furthermore, I have not seen   any indication that elevated energy and food price inflation is likely to dissipate soon, as many of   these pressures are reflective of international economic developments that we have talked about   here, including the weakness in the dollar   I believe that we are entering a dangerous period, if I can use that word, in which inflation   expectations are beginning to move higher and inflation psychology is becoming more prominent in   business decisions  In this regard, I also do not take much comfort from favorable readings of labor   April 29–30, 2008 65 of 266    costs as wages tend to follow prices in my experience  In these circumstances, I am concerned that   maintaining a highly accommodative policy stance for an extended period would greatly increase   the likelihood that inflation exceeds our long-run objectives  Thank you    Mr Chairman, I’m glad that reasonable people can differ  I do continue to   hold the view that easing policy today is a mistake  If I were voting on it, I would vote to hold   where we are  With the fed funds rate at the level it currently is, I think that continuing to ease   policy in an environment of rising inflationary pressures gives serious erosion to our long-run   credibility  We are seeing increasing signs that inflation expectations are rising  I see it constantly,   as the public’s inflation psychology is changing as well  This change reflects the large, sustained   now, increases in food, energy, and other commodities and accelerating import prices  I am   concerned that maintaining at this highly accommodative policy level for an extended period, while   it may bring some short-run stimulus into the economy, increases inflationary risk to an   unacceptable level, which will, over the not-too-distant future, begin to distort long-run investment   decisions and continue to increase the risk of financial instability and imbalances in the longer-run    Finally, on the psychology of the markets, holding rates constant, although it might disappoint some   on Wall Street, will please many, many on Main Street  I judge that it will confirm to the world that   we are turning our attention to these longer-run issues, and I’m disappointed that we’re not seizing   the opportunity to make that statement  Thank you    Yes  Option 1 doesn’t seem to be one of your recommendations, and yet it   is something that basically people know how to do  The idea is to eliminate the pack so that you   have the system already in place  It’s simple; you can learn from it  Why wouldn’t that be one of   the options you’d pursue?  I don’t have any real opposition to option 2, but I was just curious   because the transition seemed so simple with option 1  That is the question    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I would look at this meeting as an   introduction to this topic, given the breadth of the discussion here, which I found extremely   interesting and useful  I think we will need to come back to another discussion of it—not   necessarily with another 100-page study  I wouldn’t want to put that burden on you—it might   negate any savings we get from this project  [Laughter]   To the point of the options, the one that was most attractive to me was option 2  It is a   good transition  We have some familiarity with it, given the way we do clearing balances now,   and I think we can work on it  The reason that I was a little questioning about option 1 is that in   April 29–30, 2008 182 of 266    option 2 you are not quite sure what you are going to end up with, given how the banks may   choose to target the amount of reserves and so forth  But with any choice we make, we are going   to have to go up that learning curve  So of those, I prefer option 2  I am fascinated, though, with   President Lacker’s comments on option 4 and will look at it again with that in mind because I   thought he made some good points  But at the moment, I think option 2 is a pretty good path to   go down  "
8458,2008-06-24,HOENIG,"  Mr Chairman, I will begin my remarks this afternoon with a brief update   on the conditions in our District  Overall, District economic activity continues to expand   moderately, with strengthened energy, agriculture, and export manufacturing more than   offsetting the softness in our housing, retail sales, and other types of manufacturing activity    District labor markets continue to perform reasonably well  While job growth has slowed over   the past few months, unemployment remains very low, and many sectors continue to have   difficulty finding workers, especially skilled ones  Evidence on wage pressures is mixed    Although wage pressures have moderated somewhat in our Beige Book survey, some recent   labor union contracts have built in rising profiles for hourly wage increases over the term of the   contract  Rising energy and commodity input prices are continuing to negatively affect our   District economic activity   Reports from businesses suggest that higher energy and food prices are being quickly   passed on to the customer now  However, businesses are having mixed success in passing on   other cost increases, resulting in some severe erosion in margins and profitability in some of the   June 24–25, 2008 32 of 253    firms  To illustrate some of the cost–price dynamics, I would like to take just a minute and relate   the recent experience of one of our Branch directors, who operates a multi-line manufacturing   firm  I mention this because I am hearing it more and more  In addition to rising fuel prices, his   business has seen a doubling in steel costs since January, with July quotes on steel tubing up an   additional 25 percent  In response, his company recently announced a price increase of 16 to   18 percent across a range of products  Competitors immediately matched or exceeded his price   increases  Notably, he made these price increases despite a decline in new orders in May  He   also noted that import prices from China that he has seen have risen 28 percent this year and that   ocean freight prices have risen about 20 percent  As a result, customers who previously bought   Chinese products are now purchasing US-manufactured goods  It is interesting—I talked with   some of the folks at Union Pacific, and their shipments into the Midwest have dropped slightly,   but their shipments out have increased about 3 to 4 percent  So that is what is going on in the   region     More broadly, turning to the national economy, I have revised up my growth estimate for   the first half of 2008, but it has made little change in my longer-run outlook  Compared with the   Greenbook, I see somewhat stronger growth in the second half of this year and somewhat weaker   growth next year and in 2010  Most of the difference from the Greenbook in 2009 and 2010   comes from the policy path assumptions  I assume that policy accommodation is removed at a   more rapid pace than does the Greenbook  Recent economic data suggest that, although   downside risks to growth remain, they have diminished  I continue to judge that the potential   spillover effects from the financial distress have understandably been overestimated in this   Committee’s recent decisions and in Greenbook forecasts in recent months  In my view, the   greater risks to the outlook come from rising energy and commodity prices and less from the   June 24–25, 2008 33 of 253    financial distress as we go forward  In my view, current policy accommodation is greater than   needed to address these risks   As I indicated at the last meeting, I believe that the upside risks to inflation have   increased considerably over the past several months  Like the Greenbook, I expect both overall   and core PCE inflation to move higher in the second half of this year  If this happens and we   maintain the current level of the funds rate, I believe we are likely to see further erosion in   inflation expectations, which will undermine our credibility with financial markets and the   public  In this event, I judge we will greatly increase the likelihood that we will need to raise   rates more aggressively, taking rates above neutral, in order to achieve our longer-run inflation   objectives; and that is of significant concern to me, Mr Chairman   Turning to the issue of long-term projections, let me comment that I have felt somewhat   constrained by the current three-year horizon for our quarterly projections  Of the options   presented by the subcommittee, I am most comfortable with providing estimates of the values for   total inflation, output growth, and unemployment at which the economy is likely to converge  I   am not sure, however, how we want to label these estimates, if they are included in the table  I   understand that putting these estimates out might be interpreted as a move closer to inflation   targeting, but I think that this is a bridge we are ready to cross since we adopted the enhanced   projections process  The other options seem less desirable  Given the resources required, by my   staff at least, I doubt that we could provide a meaningful forecast at a four-year or five-year   horizon, and I am not sure how projections for average values over a period of five to ten years   ahead would be interpreted by the public  In my view, appropriate policy should be expected to   return the economy to its long-run equilibrium over a three-to-five-year period, with the length   of the period depending on the nature of the shock  Setting out a five-to-ten-year horizon could   June 24–25, 2008 34 of 253    be construed as a weakening in our commitment to achieve our mandate in a timely manner    Thank you    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Recognizing, as I do, where we’re coming from   and its dangers, I think more-recent data suggest that the downside risks to growth have diminished,   and in my judgment the current stance of policy is much more accommodative than necessary to   address these risks  I continue to believe that the two most recent policy actions of this Committee   were more than sufficient, and we really need to think about reversing them sooner rather than later    Inflation risks have risen, and we have seen erosion in longer-term inflation expectations  As I   noted in my previous remarks on the outlook, if we do not begin to remove policy accommodation   soon, I think we risk having to tighten policy more aggressively in the future to reestablish our   credibility   A couple of things  It struck me in looking at some of the major economies besides the   United States—the European Union, Japan, and China—if you look at the real interest rates, they’re   low  I mean, they are 1 percent or less or negative  So this is a lot of stimulus coming into the   world economy  And to make my point again, I don’t think you can have a sustained recovery with   a sustained inflationary environment, which we’re in danger of encountering if we continue on this   path   Over the past several weeks, markets have significantly altered their expected funds rate   path to remove policy accommodation, and therefore, I don’t know that doing something today   would be that big a surprise  The current funds rate path built into the market rates is closer to what   June 24–25, 2008 108 of 253    I believe is desirable to maintain price stability over the long run, but I would prefer moving   somewhat faster—3 percent by the end of this year and perhaps 4¼ percent by the end of ’09  Thus,   in my view, we should begin the process of removing monetary policy accommodation by   increasing the fed funds rate target by 25 basis points at this meeting  I think this action would   perhaps be somewhat unexpected, and I recognize that there is some risk that markets would react   by moving the funds rate path up more dramatically than some might desire  However, taking this   action would move us beyond merely talking about inflationary risk and would help us contain   inflation expectations by reaffirming our commitment to maintaining price stability  I think it   would quickly have a positive effect on the economy as these expectations begin to shift  Now,   assuming that’s not the majority view today, I would then encourage us to set the stage in our   language for stronger actions coming in the future  That is an important issue especially, as you   mentioned yesterday, in terms of remarks that we might make following this meeting, in speeches   and so forth   Finally, let me just say that I think policy is currently accommodative, perhaps very   accommodative  The insurance policy taken out earlier this year to guard against the tail risk of   spillovers of the financial distress to activity is less necessary, perhaps far less necessary, and it is   potentially even harmful to the efforts of maintaining price stability  Therefore, I encourage action   sooner rather than later  Thank you    Yes  To follow up on Governor Kohn’s point, I think it’s important to our   discussion going forward in terms of how we view these firms, from commercial banks to   investment banks and primary dealers, because we are lending under exigent circumstances to these   institutions under the primary dealer facility  Therefore, they almost by necessity should be   concerned about stigma if they were to continue to borrow through there  On the other hand, it’s   important because the TAF is a different instrument and has different implications going forward in   how we think about it and whether we want stigma with that  I think about how and how broadly   we view different financial institutions, that is, investment banks  Are they blending into   commercial banks?  What about beyond that?  We are going to have discussions about other types   of financial institutions—should they not continue to be lent to only under exigent circumstances   June 24–25, 2008 154 of 253    versus an ongoing TAF type of arrangement?  So I think there is stigma and probably should be   unless we are concluding that they’re more like banks than not like banks    Mr Chairman, on the short term, I think extending through the end of the   year is prudent and would support that  I would say that the possibility of its naturally dying off   would be ideal  I would support that because it is “exigent circumstances”  We should make that   clear and work these people out of it as quickly as possible     On the longer-term issues, I share the view of a lot of what President Lacker said  A couple   of things  I’m very uneasy about extending our lending and supervisory authority to these   institutions on the basis of systemic risk  The banking industry has been under our umbrella,   importantly around transactions activities—that is, payments—and how important they are   systemically  It’s clear, and a line is there  Beyond that, it is size that’s systemically important  If   we extend this and institutionalize it because we’ve had this emergency and we’ve used section   13(3), then I have to ask what will happen when the next Long-Term Capital occurs that’s larger,   more complicated, with a lot more interaction that will affect the markets globally  What will we   do?  To what then will we extend ourselves in terms of supervisory oversight, memos of   understanding, agreements for the group of hedge funds that aren’t regulated, and so forth  So I   think it’s important that we focus on the fact that this is an emergency and that we go back to   June 24–25, 2008 170 of 253    “exigent circumstances” in the future for these institutions so that we have clear boundaries on that    I think it has served us well and will continue to serve us well  Then we use our best judgment in   exigent circumstances and very sparingly  I think that’s a lot of what President Lacker said, so I   won’t repeat everything else, but those are the concerns that I really do have going forward    I would very much like to see us make that happen sooner rather than later   just because of the force of events taking us forward  "
8483,2008-07-24,HOENIG,"  I have a question that is somewhat different from that  When you   brought this up, I thought that we were asking to extend this into next year but that the idea was   to eventually back away from this  We are setting up this new procedure that suggests to me that   it might end up needing to go longer since we are talking quarter-ends and so forth  I am not   there, but I know there are other strains  Are the liquidity strains suggesting not only that we   want to extend this into next year but also that there is a tightening, a worsening, of conditions   that means we need to change the approach here and provide even more assurances to the   market, so that we are committed to this?  This seems to take us away from rather than toward   backing out, and I really am a bit concerned about that   July 24, 2008 13 of 50    The second question I have on this is about going from 28 days to 84 days on the TAF    We in Kansas City don’t have a lot of this going on, but we have some; and we haven’t had a lot   of concern about the fact that it’s 28 days and not a longer maturity  Are things happening in the   markets such that we would want to do this to help settle things out, or is it merely an   administrative change to ease our burden and perhaps theirs as well?  I don’t have a lot of   problems with 125 percent coverage ratios, but I am interested in why we are looking to change   the maturity  So I have those two questions for you    On your first answer, okay, you are suggesting that this doesn’t mean we   are going to extend it further  But what we have now is not fully utilized, and yet we are   July 24, 2008 14 of 50    extending it and adding to it  That it just seems contradictory to our ultimate goal bothers me a   little  That is a comment, not a question    All right  Thank you    Mr Chairman, this is President Hoenig  May I ask just one clarifying   question?    It doesn’t affect how I come out on this, but if I understand the   conversations, if we made an 84-day loan and if during the period we found the institution’s   condition deteriorating, we could in the Reserve Bank’s judgment change that to a primary credit   loan, call that loan if we felt it necessary, have conversations with the primary supervisor, and deal   with that loan whether it was 84 days or 28 days  That is my understanding  Is that correct?    Thank you    I’m comfortable with 84  I’d be interested in thinking about the 28-day as   well, but I’m comfortable with 84 as long as we have the conditions that I talked about  Thank you  "
8506,2008-08-05,HOENIG,"  Mr Chairman, let me say that the Tenth District probably, on the whole,   performed a little better than the national average in the industries that we have; but in terms of job   growth, it has slowed  At the same time, we’re still adding jobs in the region, and our   unemployment rate remains relatively low compared with national measures  Although wage   pressures actually do show some elevation relative to our Beige Book survey, they have obviously   eased a bit in recent months  But it’s interesting that, as we talk and monitor the labor conditions   and we talk to some of the labor unions, there is a great understanding that they’re losing ground    They are going to begin entering contracts at the end of this year and in the next year, and how they   approach that is extremely important because, again, they are looking and talking now about cost-  of-living adjustments and those sorts of things, which gives me some pause  According to our   manufacturing survey, our activity actually strengthened in July, although the expectations for   future activity have diminished somewhat  Not surprisingly, manufacturers producing energy and   agriculture and in export-related markets continue to operate at relatively high levels whereas the   other areas within the District are showing some slowdown   Let me talk just a second about oil  Although oil prices have declined, as was noted, they   are still high enough that capital spending and production remain elevated and look to remain so in   the foreseeable future  In fact, some of our industry contacts suggest that, as long as expected prices   for oil remain in the $70 to $80 range, there should continue to be a fair amount of investment in   that particular sector  As you well know from reading the Wall Street Journal, we did have the   SemGroup go bankrupt in the Tulsa area  It has had, I think, fairly confined effects  One of our   August 5, 2008 72 of 145    regional banks took some pretty heavy losses  They’re very well capitalized and did recapitalize   some of it, so they’ve not been dramatically affected by it  Local producers are in the worst bind   because they haven’t been paid for some of the oil delivered and there’s no other party to contract   with for future deliveries  So that has brought a lot of uncertainty in the local area about where to   provide some of this oil that they’re producing   In my discussions with businesses around the District, it’s interesting that there’s a lot more   conversation about and focus on managing your price strategy in this environment  As has been   true for a while, fuel surcharges are prevalent, and firms are able to pass those along with a fair   amount of ease  In addition, businesses are reporting that materials suppliers are placing 10-day to   30-day time limits on their price quotes  Finally, most price indexes in our manufacturing survey   remain near historically high levels, and plans for future pass-throughs have actually intensified   Turning to the national outlook, my outlook for growth has not changed materially since the   last meeting  I expect that growth will slow in the second half because of these higher energy   prices, some weakness in the labor market, and sluggish activity in some of the manufacturing   sectors  The fact is that the uncertainty regarding the economic outlook is considerable, and   downside risk to growth in the near-term future is there  These risks are being addressed, from our   perspective, by our current stance of accommodative monetary policy  So we are addressing that   uncertainty  The point I would like to make is that I’m less uncertain about the outlook for core   inflation  We have seen erosion in longer-term inflation expectations, and I believe inflation risks   have actually risen  If core inflation rises in the second half as expected, there is a real possibility   that inflation expectations will become unanchored, especially if we maintain our current   accommodative stance of policy  An expected leveling-off of food and energy prices and slack in   the economy could help moderate upward pressure on inflation, but I do not think they will be   August 5, 2008 73 of 145    enough to actually bring inflation down to an acceptable level  In fact, if we maintain the funds rate   at 2 percent, I think inflation is more likely to move higher than lower over the medium term, and   that concerns me  Thank you    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I appreciate the fact that reasonable people   may differ, and I do differ  In saying that, I am not advocating a tight monetary policy  I am   advocating a less accommodative monetary policy  I recognize Governor Kohn’s point that   relative prices are adjusting, and others have made that point  I think around that context is the   fact that we are seeing a systematic increase in the price indexes, both total and core, and I don’t   think we should ignore that  Now, the core is creeping up, but up nevertheless, and it is   systematic in my view  I would feel more comfortable that it was transitory if policy were not so   accommodative, which affirms the likelihood of further increases in inflation going forward    That is really where I am focused, I guess is the way to say it   We introduced the policy that we have, as I think others mentioned, as an insurance   policy early on, when we were more in an immediate crisis  I don’t negate or minimize the   tension that we are under, but I do think we have become very accommodative in our policy with   negative real rates  So here we are with this insurance  We have this subpar growth  The subpar   growth is not going to go away soon, so we are delaying removing the insurance policy  I worry   about that  I think in the long run that does increase the risk of an inflationary problem of a   sizable magnitude later on  I know we have this immediate problem, but our role also is to take a   long-run view, and I think we would be wise to raise the rate now modestly  It would still be an   easy policy  The effects of that increase might be disturbing to the markets  On the other hand,   it might actually give more confidence to the markets that inflation is going to come down   because we are going to insist that it does  I think there would be some good effects from that    So that is where I am coming from on preferring that we move rates up slightly at this point    Thank you    August 5, 2008 109 of 145   "
8531,2008-09-16,HOENIG,"  Mr Chairman, I see no reason to focus on the details of the forecast    Clearly, the economy is under stress, both as we look at the economic growth forecast and as we   look at the inflation forecast  So I recognize the amount of stress we are under here  I would say   to you, in dealing with that stress, I am fully supportive of the actions that we take in terms of   liquidity—the TAF and the other efforts to provide liquidity into the market  These are tools that   we can and should use for these kinds of shocks in a short-term context  On the other hand, I   would encourage the Committee to resist the impulse to ease policy in a sense of doing   something  The issue is not the level of our policy rate at this time  It is the dysfunctioning of   the markets that we hope our liquidity efforts will help address  To begin to talk about easing or   even to put language in there that suggests easing is to cause people, on the expectation that we   might ease at some point even if we hold off now, to delay decisions that they would otherwise   make that would benefit the economy   I also encourage us to look beyond the immediate crisis, which I recognize is serious    But as pointed out here, we also have an inflation issue  Our core inflation is still above where it   September 16, 2008 31 of 108    should be  Headline inflation has been up, even though there are some signs that commodities   and energy are backing off  But the businesses themselves are saying, “How do I recover my   margin?”  So there is no impulse to pass along those reductions  We talk about wages and labor   backing off  But they are holding off, they are not backing off, and in negotiations they are   much more antagonistic  Those kinds of pressures will emerge at some point  Those are the   longer-run issues that I think we need to keep in mind as we deal with this immediate crisis  So I   would strongly encourage us to leave rates where they are, to be very careful with our language,   not to encourage the expectation of further rate decreases, and to continue to be aggressive in our   liquidity provisions as we have been the last several weeks and months  Thank you    Mr Chairman, I have thought about this considerably because I think we   have come to a time in our history when we have institutions that clearly ought to be and may in   fact be too big to fail  I think we tend to react ad hoc during the crisis, and we have no choice at this   point  But as you look at the situation, we ought, instead of having a decade of denying too big to   fail, to acknowledge it and have a receivership and intervention program that extends some of the   concepts of the FDIC but goes beyond that  That is, if you are insolvent, it is not a central bank   issue—we are a liquidity provider—and therefore the government comes in  But unlike the GSEs,   everyone has to take some hit—the equity holders, certainly the preferred stockholders, also the   subordinated-debt holders, and perhaps the senior ones—by assuming a certain amount of loss    They would have immediate access to—pick a number—80 percent  The research would help us   pick that number, and they can have access, but the rest becomes a subordinate-subordinate position   after the liquidation so that you have still a sense of market discipline in play and you don’t get the   system gaming it in that, if you know there’s a bailout coming, you buy the debt and sell the equity   short to make a bundle  I think therein lie the distortions that are absolutely detrimental to the long-  run health of the economy   Regarding how we go forward, I think we are going to have many lessons from this  Part of   the problem has been very lax lending and, obviously now, weaknesses in some of the oversight    Also a history of our reacting from a monetary policy point of view to ease quickly to try to take   care of the problem and, therefore, to create a sense in the market of our support has raised some   September 16, 2008 50 of 108    real moral hazard issues that we now need to begin to remedy as we look forward in dealing with   future receiverships  We are in a world of too big to fail, and as things have become more   concentrated in this episode, it will become even more so    I think what we did with Lehman was the right thing because we did have a   market beginning to play the Treasury and us, and that has some pretty negative consequences as   well, which we are now coming to grips with  "
8589,2008-10-28,HOENIG,"  No, no  In fact, it follows right on with what Nathan was just answering    That is, for the moment we are creating kind of a broader in-list for these four countries and   stigma with the non-accepted group at this point  What will happen, then, if we do have an issue   that involves—pick a country—Chile?  Are we going to send them to the IMF?  Are we going to   have our subcommittee make a decision as to whether to give them a swap?  If we do that, will   that then create uncertainties about others?  Are you really not concerned about the stigma and   the implications of this, especially—I guess they are asking this in anticipation of the possibility,   even though they think it’s fairly remote—would we not be increasing the probabilities of a   problem by doing this now?  I know these are tough questions; but in this environment, I am   anticipating a bad event  So what do we do in the case of that bad event?   October 28–29, 2008 28 of 206     But it’s something that we ought to think about sooner rather than later   because the likelihood is that, if you take care of these four and you get another request, you are   going to get three others and not one other     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Let me just briefly say that, in our region, we   have continued to do actually better than the national average, but that is beginning to wane  We are   seeing, obviously, the energy effect show itself as rigs are being put out of production and you see a   October 28–29, 2008 80 of 206    slowing there  We are seeing some concerns being raised about agricultural prices and the boom   that has been going on in that part of the economy   That said, there’s still a reasonable amount of business going on that they haven’t frozen up    We asked our directors and our other advisers how they were seeing things, and it varies  There   were some organizations that say that our non-investment-grade borrowers from the banks, if they   had credit already, are still able to access those lines  If they lost some portion because of a bank   problem or something like that, they cannot get new credit, so it is cut off in that way  I think that’s   important to keep in mind  Businesses themselves are beginning to pull back on their capital plans    They’ve said that  Their balance sheets—obviously outside the auto industry—are still decent, but   they’re saying, “We’re looking at this, and we’re pulling back until we see how it plays out”  You   are beginning to hear more of that  They feel that they can get credit  Some of them are talking   about actually trying to pull down their lines to make sure they have the money, and the only thing   keeping them from doing that is they don’t know what to do with it once they get it  So that’s their   dilemma  They’re afraid of losing their credit, but they also know that it costs if they pull it down    So the dynamics there are interesting   On the national outlook, I’ll be brief  I think that obviously the projections for recession are   in place  Down is where we’re going  How much, though, is speculation right now  I don’t know    I don’t know that anyone does until we begin to see things settle out  Inflation should be down as   well  Obviously, when you have a recession, you will back off from that, but how much?  That’s   not clear at this point  There is a lot in play, and that’s why we don’t know the answers to those   questions  We have these liquidity facilities and an enormous amount of liquidity out  We have the   TARP that is now in process but not completed  That’s going to have an impact, and I think those   are very important  As we discuss our own policy, we are very close to the point of the quantitative   October 28–29, 2008 81 of 206    easing discussion that we had, as you said, in 2003  Pulling that material out and taking a look at   that is important as we decide what we’re going to put our money into as we try to stimulate this   economy  Right now we’re subject to waiting and seeing  There’s been a lot done, and attitudes are   a critical part of this now, and we just have to wait to see how those change over the next quarter or   two  Thank you    Well, Mr Chairman, I certainly understand how serious this matter is,   and I guess I am of the view that alternative A is not going to solve much  There is a   psychology, I understand, in the market that is going on, and I am not convinced that our   continuing to take these actions and then having adverse outcomes is necessarily going to inspire   confidence  I think we need to let our actions work their way through  Part of the problem is   that the credit mechanism is stuck right now because of the tremendous uncertainties  Then I   look at all of the things we have done over the last month, and the ramping up of the liquidity   facilities has really exceeded even our ability to sterilize  So we have had, in effect, a funds rate   that is well below our target  We have excess reserves in that period that were over $280 billion   when they are normally $2 billion, and that was before we added more swap lines and more   liquidity into the market  Frankly, I think we are at a point now where the liquidity mechanisms   that we’re trying to use, not our interest rate targeting, are really our monetary policy  As we go   forward, perhaps we need to think about how we are going to conduct monetary policy under a   quantitative easing environment  That is what I think we will effectively be at if we move again   today  So how we think about liquidity and about the credit mechanisms is really where more of   our attention will have to be spent  Lowering the rate may have some positive effects, but I   October 28–29, 2008 127 of 206    doubt it  So I would just stay where we are, let some of these past actions begin to work through,   and see what the effects of those are before we then take another move because I think the   market would just appreciate some stability over time in our actions so that they can see these   things begin to work  It isn’t a problem of the interest rate level right now, in my opinion, so   that’s why I would wait and see  Thank you  "
8617,2008-12-15,HOENIG,"  Bill, in your discussion on exhibit 13 and around the idea that a number of   resets are coming for mortgages—the earlier seven-year ARMs and so forth—and as you also look   forward to where mortgage rates are, why are you anticipating trouble with the ability to refinance,   given the outlook for mortgages rates?    Right  Okay  That clarifies  Thank you    All right  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I would like to start off also by   saying how much I appreciate this  I think it is an important opportunity for us not necessarily to   agree—because committees are designed to bring different views together and, one hopes, to   come to consensus—but to hear one another and to feel more comfortable knowing where we are   as we move from here  So I really do appreciate this opportunity   I am going to go through the questions in somewhat the order they were given, and let me   begin by discussing the first two questions on policy strategy  The key issues here are how low   to move the fed funds rate target and at what speed  I agree with the view that keeping your   powder dry is no argument for not going immediately to zero  However, I think that there are   other good reasons for not going to zero at this time  In fact, the condition of the financial   December 15–16, 2008 54 of 284    markets is a strong argument for being especially cautious at this juncture about going toward   zero and about how fast if we were to choose to do that   It is clear from the studies, at least the way I read the studies that were provided—which I   would also add were just excellent—that the market dysfunction in some very important markets,   including the Treasury market, increases substantially as you move toward the zero bound  At   what precise level this occurs is not defined, but evidence does suggest that it is a genuine issue    Indeed, markets are clearly showing signs of impairment in that the effective federal funds rate is   trading well below the current target of 100 basis points  It would be unfortunate if our monetary   policy actions were to cause major and avoidable effects on the functioning of these markets,   especially with the current fragile state of the financial system and when the benefits, as I   interpret them, are not obviously significant   I believe we can minimize the damage, so to speak, in these markets by maintaining the   fed funds target above 50 basis points—I prefer 100—and by taking actions to ensure that the   effective funds rate trades closer to the target over time, recognizing where we are starting from    The way to do this, of course, is to put limits on the size of the current swaps and liquidity   programs—I suppose that is, as others have said, a size limit on the balance sheet—to the point   that the Desk can begin to sterilize the reserve injections of these other programs  We are not   there, I realize, but I would like to see that as the goal   Turning to question 3 on communication strategies, there is evidence that   communications about the future policy path may have measurable effects on interest rates and   other asset prices, especially in circumstances where the markets and the central bank have   different views about the future policy path that need to be reconciled  Especially in the United   States, a statement about the policy path is likely to be more influential on market expectations   December 15–16, 2008 55 of 284    than a statement on inflation right now  As to the statement about the policy path, it is possible   to have a significant effect on longer-term rates when market views about the policy path differ   significantly from our views and there is credible commitment to keep the target rate low for a   very long period of time  In general, I think that it is difficult to construct a very specific   statement that is credible to markets and does not unduly tie the hands of this Committee    Consequently, if the Committee decides to adopt language about future policy actions, I would   prefer more-general rather than more-specific condition statements  I would note that the more-  general language we used in ’03 through ’05 appears to have been more effective than the Bank   of Japan’s more-specific conditioning statements during the period of quantitative easing   As to the inflation communications, I would be opposed to a statement that suggests that   inflation risks have threatened the dual mandate and that the Committee will act to mitigate this   risk  I also expect inflation to come down over the next few months, but this reflects   considerable unwinding of temporary factors, as we noted elsewhere, and the risk of deflation is   modest at this time  I also would be strongly opposed to a statement that suggests that we would   accept higher-than-normal inflation rates in the next few years  While such a statement might be   appropriate in a deflationary environment, the US economy is not yet at that point  Instead, our   inflation rate has been higher than acceptable for the past five years, I believe in part because of   our willingness—understandably, but still our willingness—to err on the side of accommodation    In the future, should inflation come in very low for a sustained period of time, such a statement   about accepting higher inflation might have some benefit in preventing a sharp decline in   inflationary expectations  But in today’s circumstances, such a statement could lead markets   again to conclude that we would respond very slowly to higher inflation pressure in the future  I   think it would confuse and not actually clarify   December 15–16, 2008 56 of 284    On nonstandard policy tools, I am okay with expanding the purchase of agency debt and   mortgage-backed securities and longer-term Treasuries  Right now, all, in my view, are   government guaranteed  However, I am not in favor of direct support of private securities   through backstop credit facilities or other procedures  I am of the view that we have stepped far   in the direction of credit allocation and have undertaken actions that are fiscal measures and not   appropriate for a central bank, even in a crisis like this  In my opinion, the long-run costs to the   economy and the Federal Reserve of engaging in credit allocation exceed the near-term benefits   of supporting limited segments of the market  There is a relative price effect  In terms of agency   and Treasury purchases, I agree that the immediate focus should be on reducing the agency   spreads over comparable Treasuries  Treasury rates have come down a good deal, but agency   spreads have widened  Normally, private yields move with the Treasury rates, as we know    However, the current crisis has largely broken the usual connection  Therefore, I don’t think that   actions to lower Treasury rates further will have much effect on other rates, and I would   concentrate more on bringing other rates down  However, in the coming months, as the   economy begins to recover, Treasury rates will likely come under upward pressure  To the   extent that markets begin to incorporate a view of the policy path that differs from ours, I think   we might want to consider purchases, as discussed here, of longer-term Treasuries at that time or   perhaps altering our communication strategy then   On the form of the directives, I would generally favor quantitative targets for Desk   purchases  Although it will be somewhat difficult for this Committee to determine appropriate   quantitative targets, I don’t think we want to move in the direction of specifying targets for   interest rates or spreads for these other instruments because the exit strategy for these approaches   could be very disruptive for the financial markets   December 15–16, 2008 57 of 284    In terms of communicating our use of nonstandard tools, if we go that way, I think that   the more we say, the better for everyone  It is important to articulate the range of options under   discussion; and when they are announced, it is important to discuss not only how they will be   implemented but also how they would be expected to help in achieving our objectives  Right   now confidence is quite fragile, as we all know, and so it is important that we send positive and   constructive messages and not unduly surprise the markets with our actions     Two other issues not directly related  As we talk about our policies going forward, I   think we really do need to spend a little more time talking about what it means in terms of the   deleveraging process that is going on  People talk about it freely, but I don’t think it is clear in   anyone’s mind and would perhaps affect our actions  Also we need to talk about the potential   effects of the fiscal policies that will be unveiled soon  Thank you very much    Thank you, Mr Chairman  The Tenth District’s economy, like the others,   has systematically worsened  Layoffs are increasing  Our retail sales are down  The housing   market is certainly not improving, and manufacturing has weakened  In our two stronger areas,   energy is showing a pretty good slowdown with these falloffs in prices, and rigs are being stacked;   the agricultural sector is also feeling the pressure as commodity prices fall  So it is uniformly poor    As far as the national economy and outlook go, I have no major differences with the outlook that   has been presented by others  I would tell you that we have done different projections ourselves  I   think a lot depends on what will be developed on the fiscal side as we move from here, and I am   kind of waiting to see about that   I do have one other comment and perhaps request as we think about this, and it follows on   yesterday’s conversation  It strikes me, as I look broadly and see what’s happening in our own   region, that the intermediation process is broken as it goes through the banking industry and then   more broadly than that  The deleveraging process that is under way is actually accelerating—it is   worsening and complicating our ability to fix the intermediation process  As a result, we as the   central bank are going around that process as we try to get credit working, and I understand that    But it does have consequences—some good for those particular markets where we’re bringing   intermediation forward but also perhaps some not so good as other sectors are left behind in that    My point is that we really do have to focus, in working on the fiscal side with the Treasury or   whomever, on fixing the broken intermediation process, and that is the banking industry  I know   we are working with the TARP  It needs some additional work  But out of that comes my request    We spent a fair amount of time yesterday talking about the Japanese experience  I wonder if we   wouldn’t benefit if we looked at the Nordic experience of the early ’90s—how you go in, take a   look at that, and how you conduct policy around that—and have a discussion among ourselves   December 15–16, 2008 138 of 284    because I think there are some lessons there that we might learn to our benefit as we move forward   from here  That’s a suggestion I have, not just my report on the District  Thank you      I agree with that, but at the same time, I see the similarity  When you don’t   go in and try to drive it back quickly, you get the Japanese outcome of prolonging it  I don’t know   where the banks are yet, but I know that things are getting worse and that the intermediation process   is broken  So just maybe there is something in-between—something that can be done that forces   outcomes for some of these banks  Even though they are not insolvent as such, we have poured a   ton of equity into those institutions, and I am not sure if we shouldn’t have added some other   elements to that that might have helped on the other side  That’s my point    Thank you, Mr Chairman  If we were still working with the framework of   targeting the fed funds rate, I would prefer D, and I would accept C, and I would vote accordingly    But I think what I’ve heard in the past two days is that we have really abandoned that framework,   and this is kind of a ratification of that  I think that our framework now is actually in A and B in the   statement that we are going to “expand its purchases    as conditions warrant”  If that’s the case,   then going with A, in which you don’t set a fed funds rate or talk about it, is probably preferred   I also think that we’re now in a credit policy type of framework, and it bothers me  I have a   lot of sympathy for what Presidents Lacker and Bullard said  I would prefer, rather than a statement   that says “as conditions warrant,” that we have some kind of a monetary base criterion for the   future  This is something that we ought to think about  At the same time, I do not think that we   should have inflation below optimal in this statement  I don’t think we’re there, and, at this point, I   think it should not be hinted at   I think that “purchasing longer-term Treasury securities” goes with the conditionality   statement anyway  We’ll do what it takes, and if it takes purchasing longer-term Treasuries, that’s   it  That is what we have unless we go back and look at a new framework that we need to get out   December 15–16, 2008 187 of 284    and talk about with the public, and I hope that as our meetings and our discussions progress, we   begin to focus on that  Thank you    I agree    If we’re going to have statements that say we’re going to purchase   mortgage-backed securities as conditions warrant, I don’t think “purchasing longer-term Treasury   securities” is a much different step from that, so we can leave it in    In terms of what we’re going to be speaking about regarding the new   regime, I think it was easier when we had alternative A and we were going to a new regime than   when we’re saying, “Well, okay, we’re going to end this regime here”  I’m giving this speech; I get   questions  We’re going to end this regime, and we’re going to go to this  So now I’m in the middle   of a transition, and I’m trying to explain it, but other than, “Yes, we left this behind, and here we are   going forward”  So that’s my concern about the middle step here  I guess in your opinion it’s easier   to explain going from “Here’s the old regime; we’re going to stick to it for a little while longer and   then   ”    All right  So we are going to give them a three-year term to give them   assurances that they don’t have to worry about rolling over  I am assuming that, as the market   improves—and it should over the next year or 18 months—this would be almost self-liquidating   because it would then become attractive to these parties to leave now and that would be taking it   off our balance sheet  Is that the operating assumption?    That puts us at risk of taking a loss, then, if we should decide to reverse   the policy action    That would be the ideal—to push them back out as quickly as possible   when the market straightens out    But we’re talking about a lot of assets on our books    I have no problem with that  What I’m thinking about is, if we do define a   new regime, how we conduct policy  How are we tying ourselves down now relative to what we   might want to do in the future in moving these assets on and off our balance sheet?  I think that the   more flexibility we have in moving them out, the more flexibility we have in any new regime we   put forward, and to me that’s important   December 15–16, 2008 226 of 284     Do we have in mind a limit as to how broadly we would make the credit   facility available?      I ask that question because there are some very important industrial   companies that have been financing at fairly attractive rates and are now going to have to refinance   that at far less attractive rates  I think that will have every bit as significant an impact on the   December 15–16, 2008 233 of 284    economy as the mortgage-backed securities  So unless we think through how we limit this, I think   there’s a legitimate case for just about anything    Which makes my point  We really have to focus on fixing the intermediary   process in the United States  There’s no limit to this  The refinancings coming due are huge  "
8641,2009-01-16,HOENIG," Just a quick question Given the way AIG was structured and the   possibilities of being able to pay back the loan with a sale of assets or operating units, and   Citicorp is now looking to sell off units, have we given any thought to requiring that, if these   things aren’t dealt with even in an extended period of time, they would be required to sell off   units to pay this back?  That would address some of Richard’s and my concerns about the   enabling process that we are providing for this continued increase in concentration of these   resources that are themselves unsound    Thank you, Mr Chairman  As a general statement, I think I am on record   as having supported and continuing to support an inflation objective  A numeric inflation objective,   as we have talked about before, would help communicate the Federal Reserve’s commitment to   price stability Of course, that said, we all realize that in the past this Committee was reluctant to   push for its implementation in part because such an articulation of price stability mandate needs                                          January 16, 2009 39 of 69  strong support from the Congress  In the current circumstances, this support may be likely; but in   the longer term, if inflation were to require strong tightening policy, I think support would fade   quickly away  Also, it may be difficult to make the case for quantification of only one of the   mandates as we have talked about before, thus making this action, if we were to move toward an   explicit target, a temporary action just by circumstance  I would be opposed to establishing a   numerical inflation objective at this time if it were only a temporary measure in response to the   current crisis   In my view, if we go this way, we need clear congressional agreement, at least in a   resolution, and the mandate should be considered by all parties as permanent  I see little benefit in   adopting a temporary numerical objective  Such an approach would likely undermine our   credibility in establishing a permanent objective at a future date  If by circumstances or if we think   the odds are fairly high that an explicit numeric objective at this time would be temporary, I believe   we would be better served by focusing instead on our communication strategy, as President Yellen   has outlined—at this time, for example, clearly indicating that inflation below 1 or some percent   was unacceptable and would call for aggressive policy action, as we have already taken   In terms of implementation of a permanent numerical objective, though, I would favor a   medium-term range of 1 to 3 percent  I would prefer overall CPI but certainly can live with PCE as   we have been doing at this time, with an explicit statement that we are targeting the midpoint of 2   percent  That makes it a target, and the range gives some maneuvering room, but we are headed   always toward 2 percent  This is as other central banks have done  I would say I am not in favor of   price-level targeting at all, in part because of the difficulty of communicating such an approach to   the public in any successful way  If, however, we are going to decide to go down this road toward   inflation targeting or even price targeting, I guess I would back off this idea of longer-term              January 16, 2009 40 of 69  projections just because I think of the added confusion that it would perhaps cause  I will leave my   comments at that  Thank you, Mr Chairman  "
8661,2009-01-27,HOENIG," It’s the first nomination I’ve heard like that  [Laughter]   Oh, wow [Laughter] Only 45 minutes later   I have heard that story, and I don’t need to review it again  I have just a   couple of things that I want to comment on here  First of all, I do appreciate this, because we are   thinking about where we are and we are thinking about how we might exit this, even though we   have a lot of turmoil ahead of us  That much I appreciate  I think that part of President Lacker’s   point and the Vice Chairman’s point may be that we are in an adjustment process  We are   deleveraging like crazy in this economy  That resulted from an excess at an earlier point, and we   are going to find a new equilibrium  That is the process we are going through, and it is very   difficult   Much of what we have done I wish had been done in the Treasury to begin with  I still   think that would have been the right call  But it wasn’t, so we are where we are  How do we get   where we are going, and how do we do this transition?  What we have are these facilities, and I   hope that we use them temporarily  I hope we do take advantage of working with the Treasury   to move as much of it out as we can  Some of it is self-liquidating, and I think we will get out of   it But some of it is not, and that is the part I would like to be able to push toward the Treasury,   and that would be part of our plan I would also say that I am reluctant to go with long-term   Treasuries, not because I don’t necessarily agree with some of what you are saying but because I   am worried about some of the consequences of the perception that we are directly funding the   Treasury and monetizing debt immediately  I want to think that through before I get on that   bandwagon, given where we have already come at this point   To change just a bit, Mr Chairman, I want to talk about the TARP and the future as we   go forward, as you have these discussions coming up  I think there is no confidence in it  It has        January 27–28, 2009 61 of 267  been inequitably administered across the United States, and that is why you have such bitterness   about it So in looking forward, we have an opportunity to do that better  The way we outline   how we are going to deal with financial institutions and banks in the future is extremely   important now  I want to thank Nathan for the summary report on the Swedish experience or the   Nordic model and so forth because, as we talk about aggregator banks or RTCs or some   approach to the problem, I think that is a very good model to look at  It offers us opportunities to   deal with this problem as it gets worse because I think the problems across a broader base of   banks are getting worse  Commercial real estate is now feeling a little pressure  I think we are   beginning to see a turn in agriculture again and a turn related to energy  These problems are   going to become more difficult, and how we go forward with the next iteration—and I wouldn’t   call it the TARP any longer—of this banking problem is important   One thing that I have some disagreement with regarding Nathan’s conclusions is whether   we have the mechanisms to do a kind of Swedish model, given the more-complex institutions   and the size of this country But I suggest that we do  We have a cadre of experienced people   across the United States—in the Comptroller’s office, the FDIC’s office, and the Federal   Reserve’s offices—so that when this comes, if we think about it now and plan, we can begin to   say which banks should be looked at   Part of the problem with the last issue of the TARP was that we went in and looked at a   lot of these institutions and they were on the margin  But we were changing the criteria as we   went along instead of having the criteria set and going in and looking at these institutions    Which ones are solvent at the moment, and for which ones would capital help maintain   solvency?  You can’t have any guarantees on this, given the trends in the economy  But we   ought to have a systematic, equitably applied solution for the next wave that is coming our way      January 27–28, 2009 62 of 267  That would be very important to have set up because it would help keep a lot of commercial real   estate loans off our balance sheets  If we handle the next section as we have the past around   asset-backed securities, we are going to have a lot more assets on our balance sheet, and that   does worry me  So that is something for us to think about going forward   Mr Chairman, since the last FOMC meeting, our District’s economy has   continued to weaken, and this weakness is widespread and is taking on more of the complexion           January 27–28, 2009 119 of 267  of the national economy  Led by a sharp decline in manufacturing and slower export growth,   year-over-year private employment growth slipped into negative territory in November for the   first time in our region since ’04  Consumer spending weakened in December despite heavy   discounting, and residential real estate activity remains quite depressed  Conditions in   commercial real estate have deteriorated markedly, and financing in this sector has become   extremely difficult  I might add a footnote here  In discussions of this with some of the folks   involved in commercial real estate, they are concerned about a couple of years from now because   in 2002, 2003, and 2004 there were a lot of commercial real estate projects put into play at very   low cap rates and very good interest rates, with a 10-year balloon So those are all turning now   with obviously less value because they are assuming that the cap rates will be higher  They are   also assuming that the buildings will not be as new, and therefore the values will be under   pressure So they feel that the problems in commercial real estate are only beginning   Those parts of the District that depend on energy and agriculture continue to be   somewhat better, but these areas are expected to show—and are, in fact, showing—declines, and   we expect pretty sharp declines in ’09 due to the falloff in commodity prices  District businesses   are moving rapidly to address the sharp slowdown  Many have instituted hiring and wage   freezes, and layoffs have risen considerably  Many businesses have significantly curtailed   current production and future capital spending plans  For example, our energy industry contacts   expect a 30 to 50 percent reduction in drilling activity and a 35 to 60 percent reduction in capital   expenditures in ’09   The fiscal situation for states and local governments has also deteriorated very rapidly    Most District states are now looking at significant budget shortfalls over the next two years    Most states plan to address these deficits through spending reductions rather than tax increases      January 27–28, 2009 120 of 267  The situation for local governments is somewhat mixed, depending on whether they rely on   property taxes or on sales taxes for the revenue base  Many states and localities are looking for   assistance from the federal stimulus package to avoid more draconian cutbacks in spending    Banking conditions are deteriorating within the region  Nonperforming loans are increasing, and   losses are mounting as well   Turning to the national economy, recent economic data have been worse than expected,   leading me, like others, to revise down the forecast for growth this year  I now think we could   see negative growth into the third quarter before the economy picks up as the fiscal stimulus   begins to take hold later In the near term, I see considerable downside risk to growth due to the   pervasive weakness in the US and foreign economies and the substantial financial headwinds   that remain in place  Indeed, I fully expect banking conditions to deteriorate further, even as   financial markets begin to stabilize  I am especially concerned that commercial real estate, as I   mentioned earlier, could be the next shoe to drop, with broad implications for banks and   insurance companies across the country  Consequently, the strength and the timing of the   recovery appear, obviously, very uncertain at this point   In terms of inflation, the significant decline in energy and commodity prices, along with a   weaker economy, has obviously put considerable downward pressure on overall and core   inflation, as a cyclical effect of this recession  I think it would not necessarily be timely to start   projecting deflationary pressures, and although I get more questions about that, at this point I   don’t consider that the highest risk we have Thank you   They disowned you   Mr Chairman, obviously, as we have said, the downside risks to the   economy are quite large, in part because we are involved in very serious banking conditions that   probably also will worsen significantly over the next several months  In particular, the exposures   of the banking system and insurance industries to commercial real estate, as we have said,   represent a significant risk both to financial stability and to economic activity  There has been   some improvement in financial market functioning in recent weeks, but most of the improvement   is tied to the significant support from our programs and other government programs and not from   the markets repairing themselves  These repairs still lie ahead, I suspect, and this will absorb   increasing amounts of our time as we try to deal with that   Second, over the next several months, fiscal policy will take center stage  I think this is   the first phase that we are hearing all the discussions about now, and this Committee will need to   decide how it should position itself relative to a potentially large amount of new fiscal stimulus   that has really not all been defined at this point  I suggest it would be prudent then to wait to see        January 27–28, 2009 173 of 267  more about the form, timing, and likely effect of the fiscal stimulus before firmly committing to   new expansionary policy programs that would be defined in alternative A  In addition, fiscal   steps to deal with toxic assets and thereby improve the functioning of the financial system may   alter our approach to supporting the financial system and market stability  I think there are some   pretty significant issues around these institutions that will be discussed in the very near future    Consequently, I favor alternative B rather than alternative A at this time   Also, as to additional nontraditional monetary policy measures that we might employ, I   agree with the Board staff’s recommendation that we retain the option of purchasing long-term   Treasury securities at a future date but not engage in these purchases now  I do agree with what   President Rosengren had to say about that Treasury purchases would send a clear signal  In   addition to what President Rosengren said, they would clearly begin to acknowledge the   monetizing of our deficit At this juncture, I would prefer that we continue with our previously   announced efforts to reduce the spreads of agency and private securities over Treasuries  I   would also like to recommend that we think ahead as to how we might provide support to   institutions and markets that provide financing to commercial real estate, should conditions in   that sector continue to deteriorate  It would be helpful to try to outline a process that does not   force us to again go around the intermediation process or find ourselves in a kind of very quick,   over-the-weekend approach to things   I also favor the inflation risk discussion in alternative B As I indicated earlier, the   decline in overall and core inflation in the last couple of months and during the recession is to be   expected and represents really no surprise, although it is significant  Although I expect inflation   to remain low for some time, I do not feel that deflationary risks have increased to the point that   we need to reflect them in our communications  In fact, I think that to do so could only lower           January 27–28, 2009 174 of 267  inflation expectations and put pressure on real interest rates  I’ll stop at that point Thank you,   Mr Chairman   Mr Chairman   Two or three people have mentioned the last sentence in paragraph 3  I   would just like to get a bit of reaction from Governor Kohn or President Yellen  My concern   with putting that sentence in is that you change expectations toward the thing you are trying to   avoid If we suddenly start saying that we are thinking inflation is getting too low and it is not   consistent, people then are going to be convinced that it is getting too low and we are going to   put more pressure on it  We ought at least to think about that before we get on a bandwagon   here That is my caution  I do not know if anyone wants to comment  "
8685,2009-02-07,HOENIG," Yes, Mr Chairman  Thank you for the briefing  I have a couple of   questions When we do this scrubbing of these banks, is the source of the capital the remaining   part of TARP, or is there additional funding anticipated for this?   If you encounter a bank—one of the largest 22 and beyond—that is    insolvent, then would we basically use the FDIC’s resolution process to go in and recapitalize   and create a bad bank for that institution at that time and have to be 100 percent owner of that   and then move forward from there?  Is that the plan?   I ask that question because, if we can clarify that, then you would have, I   think, a greater certainty in the sense of Yes, we are going to take it over, and yes, we are going              February 7, 2009 20 of 65  to run it and then reprivatize it  And that takes uncertainty out of it if the banks are, in fact,   insolvent  And if they are not insolvent, then you’re going to take ownership up to whatever it   requires to bring their capital ratios up, and you’re going to take a managing role and reprivatize   them, so that they are systematically administered all the way through     You also mentioned in your comments that all banks can seek this capital, and I don’t   know what that means exactly going forward  In other words, if, after the 22, you go into these   other banks, those with less than $100 billion and they weren’t insolvent, but they were   undercapitalized—we have a ton of commercial real estate ahead of us—would the FDIC, I   guess, be in a position to add capital and then these banks would become part of this Government   Investment Board oversight as well?   Not to disagree with you, Bill, but most of these 8,000 banks are being   prioritized now and are being scrubbed across the country  So I think this issue is coming   forward, and it will be focused on commercial real estate  I can assure you of that  I have   another question   Well, Deborah, I’m not sure I understand your answer, because if you   have an institution and you do the exam and it has X number of assets in difficulty, which brings   its capital down to, say, 3 percent, they would then choose to apply for capital under this   program, and then what would you do?  Would you acknowledge their request and provide them   that capital, or would you say no because—whatever the reason?                 February 7, 2009 22 of 65  I appreciate that  I have two more questions  In terms of the TALF—   just to clarify and maybe take some of my confusion away—in this morning’s paper there was   discussion about the TALF encompassing our willingness, as these new asset-backed securities   are developed, to actually work through hedge funds, and you had mentioned possibly confining   this to commercial banks or broadening it  Can you clarify that for me, so that I understand   whom we would be working through as the counterparty on this, as we engage in the TALF?   One last question about the Government Investment Board, which has   the oversight role If we had enough ownership, would they select an individual to sit on the   boards of directors of these institutions, or would that be determined separately from the   Government Investment Board in terms of the government’s ownership and representation?   Thank you, Mr Chairman   Thank you, Mr Chairman  Just a comment, and I’ll try to keep it brief,   because I know you’ve been very generous with your time here, but I have to tell you my   thoughts as I look at what we’re trying to do and the strategy  The US economy over the last   decade has leveraged up incredibly  The numbers are dramatic—a doubling of our leverage in   the financial sector Right now we’re going through the deleveraging process  And as the   leveraging went up, there was enormous misallocation of resources  So those resources are now   shifting back and forth, and there is going to be pain with that—I don’t think we can avoid that    The deleveraging process requires us to acknowledge hundreds of billions of dollars of loss  The   loss is there—we can’t avoid it—and the need to recapitalize by significant amounts is a fiscal   action that we have to take   What we’re trying to do, if I understand today’s meeting and other meetings, is to try to   temporize the adjustment process—to give us time, or give the Congress time, or give someone   time—so that a fiscal stimulus package can help make up the difference, or something like that   It worries me, though, that we’re doing it through the TALF, because it does further   misallocate resources, although I know we’re trying to make it as broad as possible  I am   confident that we have a major commercial real estate problem coming, and that will bring us—   again—losses that have to be taken and will put us in the position of having to figure out how   we’re going to temporize and lend, and that may in fact further distort things  So if we can                February 7, 2009 62 of 65  develop ways that would minimize our involvement, rather than continuing to accelerate it up to   $1 trillion, I think we would be well served in the long run, because the loss is there, and the   adjustment is going to have to take place  And if we distort, I think we will only prolong, in the   end, some very harsh realities that lie ahead  That’s my concern, and I know you realize that, but   I just have to voice it at this point Thank you   Thank you  "
8706,2009-03-17,HOENIG," Just a clarifying question Can you quickly give me a matrix that says   what TALF issuance we’re talking about and how much, starting with the original $200 billion   and then the various add-ons, up to the total—just so I understand what we’re talking about in   each issuance or expansion of the TALF program?   This would go all the way to legacy commercial-mortgage-backed   securities?   Newly issued Okay   That’s helpful Thank you   I’m trying to understand this  The  TALF is for three years, and the way   I see it, we’re taking the assets they put into this organization, which you expect to liquidate and   recover at least enough to the point where we’re protected  But how confident are you that we   can roll this stuff off our balance sheet in three years?  These are distressed assets  So we might   have to turn them over later, or the market would have to change so much that you could sell            March 17–18, 2009 67 of 266  them, and whoever has the 20 percent risk would take any write-off  I see us as taking the “bad   bank” position in a “good bank–bad bank” scenario   As long as in the liquidation we don’t go past the capital that’s placed   into it, right?   In your exploration of this, have you thought about the Congress setting   up a good bank–bad bank facility?  Are they resistant to that?  Or do we just think that’s not a   good option?   Mr Chairman, let me give my comments on expanding our balance sheet   by first saying that I agree with those who have said, and I think you have said, that we cannot   get the economy going until we get the banking and intermediation process fixed  And I think   that’s an important premise for going forward  That means we need to focus on resolution, and I   think this proposal that’s being worked on using the TALF and using us to help finance a bad   bank is actually going to delay dealing with this very serious problem  Given the comments that   President Rosengren and others have made, I think we have an opportunity to get this done with   some legislation that would create the ability to put some of these holding companies in   receivership and move forward, so that we can get the banking system fixed on a sustained basis   I think that’s important, because I am very concerned about the TALF and growing our   balance sheet, even at this meeting  I think we should pause, because we have the TAF, we have   other means to provide liquidity, should it be needed, and we have excess reserves that are   sizable I think we should focus on fixing the banking system and conserve our balance sheet   carefully I wouldn’t want it necessarily to decline dramatically, but I don’t think it would with   the TAF, and so forth; we have the mechanisms to provide liquidity   But if the majority decides to go forward with it, then I do prefer mortgage-backeds to   Treasuries I disagree in a sense with President Lacker because I think it would just open us up   to charges of monetizing Treasury debt  And my experience is that it doesn’t matter if you’re                       March 17–18, 2009 87 of 266  holding mortgage-backeds or Treasuries; when you try to sell them off your balance sheet,   interest rates go up—it doesn’t matter; people are going to be upset  So we’re better off with   mortgage-backeds because it makes a cleaner line for us to say we are not in that business   I also want to talk about excess reserves and Fed bills  I think that, as the banking   industry itself has learned about excess reserves and the payment of interest, it is learning to   arbitrage From a governance point of view and from a simplicity point of view going forward,   if the FOMC were made the party responsible for setting the interest rate on excess reserves, we   would set the floor and control the fed funds rate  You don’t need Fed bills if, in fact, the   banking industry has learned how to arbitrage it  I agree with President Plosser—getting us into   issuing bills or in a so-called cooperative relationship with the Treasury, where we’re taking   Treasury bills, is a very tenuous path for us to go down, and I’d stay away from it  I think paying   interest on excess reserves would go a long ways to managing our balance sheet, or, I should say,   our ability to control the fed funds rate   On the swaps, I understand where they’re coming from on that, and I take that pretty   much as a given, but hopefully it will be carefully managed and not easily accessed by the   institution that needs it Thank you   Mr Chairman, I would say that the Tenth District is going to reflect very   much what you have heard in the national briefing  It was doing better than the nation as a   whole but is now quickly deteriorating into the national average  Our labor markets have   continued to deteriorate  Unemployment rates are going up in each of our states  Our   manufacturing activity has actually plummeted, importantly because of the weakening of the   export market that was mentioned earlier  Our agricultural sector is still holding its own, but it,   too, is showing signs of weakening, as is our energy industry  Commercial real estate is showing   signs of weakening because of some of the refinancing that’s now required and because of the           March 17–18, 2009 131 of 266  increasing vacancies that are affecting the cash flows off these and, therefore, affecting some of   the parties holding these notes   I would point out, too, that financing in the region has deteriorated, I’d say “badly”   almost, and I’ll give you one anecdote  I understand that it’s not hard data, but it gives you a   sense of the situation We have an insurance company that does premium financing, about   $1 billion financed out of a major New York bank  It went back to refinance a portion of the   loan, and the bank wanted LIBOR plus 500 The CEO of this company said, “You know, I   understand I have to help recapitalize that industry, but this is taking all my profit”  So it is   trying to get other types of financing  And that kind of pressure is, of course, trickling down and   affects how they do business as well So it is a pretty daunting task for businesses in this type of   environment, I realize   Finally, when we look across the District, we’re seeing increasing numbers of problem   banks, as well as banks that we would put on a watch list because of the concentrations in, say,   real estate or some sectors of agriculture  So, overall, the District is reflecting the deteriorating   conditions in the nation as a whole, and, that is, of course, a concern to us as well as to everyone   else here   Thank you As we talk about this statement, I think it’s sadly ironic that,   after we’ve doubled the size of our balance sheet, we’re having a conversation about being   worried that it may shrink a little bit  It’s incredible to me that we would have that  And I agree   with what Governor Kohn said in that I don’t think we should start talking 10 percent monthly   growth or whatever it is We’re trying to deal with a broken intermediation and banking system   at the same time, and I don’t think we can turn it into a monetary policy instrument in terms of   how much we expect the balance sheet to grow at this point   With that, I would say I am much more in favor of statement B as we had it  I would   admit that the banking system is broken  That’s part of the reason we’re doing the TALF  If   we’re going to expand and we’re going to address the broken intermediation process, we should   focus on mortgage-backeds  That’s what the idea was to begin with  Let’s stick with it If we   now introduce Treasuries into that (1) I think it’s only going to be confusing, and (2) I think we   do have to look long term Our introducing purchases of longer-term securities farther along the   yield curve sets a precedent, and I don’t think it’s easy to back off from that once we get through   this mess we’re in right now  So that’s why I prefer B   I also want to take just a minute and talk about the legacy TALF  There’s reference to   populist reaction to this, and I actually think that this reaction is justified in important ways  We   ought to think about that, because people are now confused between TARP and TALF, and I   think when we add the legacy TALF, it’s going to confuse things even more  The reason that   they’re reacting to it is TARP  I agree that it was necessary to keep from having a meltdown, but   the execution of it was so confusing and so inequitable across the system that it created great   backlash Some of the backlash was very justified—for example, when you have some banks   being told, “You’re going to take it,” and a thousand other banks being told, “You can beg for        March 17–18, 2009 201 of 266  it,” and following that up with changing the rules, you’re not going to get anything but a   backlash I think that’s important to keep in mind   So as we think about going forward, I come back to President Fisher’s point about   needing a decision tree on how we’re going to deal with these legacy assets  Our getting   involved in the legacy TALF, as I’ve heard it described to this point, is, I think, very risky—very   dangerous, almost—in terms of what the outcomes might be, because there aren’t clear, defined   decision trees indicating who’s really going to be accountable for what  We need to get that   clarified before we have another reaction like the one we had recently   Finally, I do want to come back to something Governor Kohn mentioned yesterday in   reference to my comment about using excess reserves to help manage the balance sheet and set   the rate floor  I know that it got off to a rough start, but I think we are getting our sea legs and   the industry is getting their sea legs  If we start issuing Fed bills, I think we are introducing   another tool that will start out with the best intentions, but expectations will be raised, how we   use it will be brought into account, questions will arise about trying to get around debt ceilings   and so forth I think we should try to avoid that if we can and see if we can use our interest on   excess reserves as a management tool  So with those comments, I’ll again say I’d go with B    Thank you  "
8733,2009-04-28,HOENIG," Just a question on the maturity on the TALF  We want to go from three   to five years That, of course, means that rolling off our balance sheet will be slower  Is the five   years determined by conditions that they told us about or the length of the assets being brought   on?  What caused us to move from three to five years?   So the maturity they are really looking for is 10 years   Right, because that is what they are turning over now  So this would   help them  When they come toward the five years, then they would be pressed pretty hard   because they would still have these assets to deal with—to refinance and so forth  Is that right?   We will see future pressure as they come against the five years because they need the ten-year   length?   Thank you   Let me start with the District, and I’ll be brief  I have talked to several   dozen people in the region, and I have not had a single one tell me that they think things are   improving  But what I do hear is that things are not getting any worse except for a couple of   areas One of those areas is natural gas production, which if those rigs are moving your way, I’d   look at them pretty carefully before I put them in production, given the price of natural gas right   now The other is commercial real estate There is a lot of angst about commercial real estate in   the region It is under pressure Projects are on hold and have been stopped  A lot of banks are   holding this stuff, and a lot of them have pretty heavy concentrations of it, which gives me pause    On the other hand, when they say things are not getting worse, there are some indications of   manufacturing beginning to stabilize, some retail sales beginning to stabilize, and even some of   the housing, even though it is down from a year ago, in the last couple of months has shown   some stability as well in the region   About the national outlook—I think that, as we go through the rest of this year and into   next year, we will see things improve  There are a couple of positive forces and then one thing   that I consider a real negative  The two positives are that, as we see inventories and values   adjust, people then will begin to move forward  Complementing that is the fact that the stimulus   package is starting to flow  We’re seeing a lot of highway projects really getting going,   especially in our region  The one thing that I find interesting is the value of subsidies because, as   the ethanol industry is collapsing, we are now in the wind tunnel—seeing enormous amounts of   investment on wind energy being placed there  There is no way to get it out yet, but they are   building these towers by the thousands, and that is adding a lot of activity in the rural areas,   particularly of our region            April 28–29, 2009 79 of 201  The negative is the credit and banking conditions  There is a fair amount of capital in   these banks, but when you see their asset issues and their uncertainty around those assets, they   are conserving that capital and they are holding back on lending  Another part of this is, as we   have introduced each new plan—whether it was the PPIP or whatever—money has gone to the   sidelines to see how that is going to evolve  That has made things slower than they might have   otherwise been, and I think we need to be aware of that   As you boil all of this down, I think the stimulus will be a big plus as we move through   this year and into next  As we stabilize, there’s a real upside, but the credit market banking level   is a big risk going forward I don’t think we’ve begun at all to address the commercial real estate   problems that are just wreaking havoc  Thank you   We hope so for Richmond’s sake  [Laughter]   Thank you I guess as we consider all the options, I do prefer   alternative B and not the primes  I guess I’m more concerned about and more interested in the   fact that we are increasing our balance sheet by the extent that we are, and I’m not enamored of   the idea of doing that and saying, “Here’s the path that we’re going to take”  I’m more   concerned about the amount than I am whether we have a path, because that’s the striking point     I also like the wording in the sense that the Committee under any of these is prepared to adjust   the timing and the amounts  If you think about how much the projections have changed in the   Greenbook, for example, from the last meeting to this meeting and if we are near the bottom,   things could change, and I think the Committee would need to reconsider even the amounts at   another meeting  The wording in the B alternative allows us to do this   I did note and am very much appreciative of the work that the staff did on the projections   on the balance sheet because I think it does point out that, if we go to these sizes, we have some   real challenges ahead of us  I think the June meeting is extremely important in terms of thinking   about an exit strategy That’s very important because, if we do achieve the total amount under   the mortgage-backed securities, our holdings will be larger than those of either Fannie or   Freddie, and that’s a striking statement as far as our role in the economy goes  That gives me   some pause  So B is fine I hope that the next meeting will show even more positive news and   we can adjust these numbers going forward  Thank you   I kind of like it as well, but I thought it gave us some flexibility to say,   “We won’t go as far”  If this doesn’t serve that purpose—and I think I would defer to you,   Kevin, on this, because I hope that conditions evolve so that we don’t have to go to the total—   then I would back away   Okay So then I would strike it     April 28–29, 2009 154 of 201  Just to add to that, we should not release the individual names  You will   undo half of what you have tried to do so far As open as we should be, we also have a   responsibility to make sure this thing is managed in an orderly way, and if we release names, I   think the stigma will be back in a flash and lots of issues around it  So I agree with those   comments  "
8772,2009-06-23,HOENIG," Thank you, and this is a question for you, just to clarify  I understand   where Jeff is coming from, but when I read these papers and I listen to these presentations, I   think we have more than an exit strategy discussion going on here  Eric has kind of drifted onto   one discussion about managing rates  Another is around managing the portfolio—how we   adjust Then there is the exit strategy, which has two dimensions, but I think we are only   discussing one The first dimension is the traditional monetary one of how you get the fed funds   rate up The second is around large-scale asset purchases, which we’re not really talking about   today, since we still have this line showing our holdings going up and the only thing is how we   are going to adjust the line going up, but that is not an exit strategy  That is about how we are   going to manage going up that line; that is the concern, I think           June 23–24, 2009 42 of 261  So I wonder if it would help to split these up when we are talking  I mean part of this is   about managing the rate, which is different than exit strategy, and it would help clarify when we   get into the discussion part of the meeting to say which one we are going to focus on first  Right   now I think we are focusing on all three intermittently here and back and forth, and I think that   will cause maybe more confusion   Just quickly, I want to go back to Governor Kohn’s original question on   the accounting In this document there is a discussion about investments held in consolidated   variable-interest entities, with a conservative assumption that we could take a $5 billion hit and   then no more losses after that, even if interest rates went up pretty significantly  Is that a   conservative assumption?  That is, if interest rates went up significantly, wouldn’t you expect   more losses out of that?           June 23–24, 2009 52 of 261  Went to neutral  Okay The second question is also related to the earlier   discussion In some of the accounting that I’ve seen and what I believe I saw discussed in here   was the establishment of a prepaid account to the Treasury to go back and, therefore, bring your   surplus up so you could continue to pay your dividends and so forth  Are those only allowed   under special circumstances, or would those be allowed in any kind of a loss circumstance, so   they would enable us to continue to pay dividends?   That would address part of Governor Kohn’s concerns about continuing   to pay for operating expenses and continuing to pay dividends   I have a clarifying question on the discussions around exit strategy and   the LSAP Would there be, then, a discussion at each meeting as to whether we should go to the   “up to” limit?  In other words, should there be a specific decision whether to go forward?  I think   you have to address that before you start talking more generally about raising the fed funds rate   All right   Thank you, Mr Chairman  I would start with Brian’s description, and   I’m generally supportive of this proposal  It does give an end date, and I agree with President   Stern—I think the firmer that end date is, of course, the better   On the TAF issue that President Fisher brought up, I think he has valid points, but I do   think we need to look at that pretty carefully, and I know you are going to do some follow-up on   that                 June 23–24, 2009 84 of 261  And because we’re talking about exit strategies, and these liquidity facilities are part of it,   it does extend to the LSAP  From my perspective, the most unusual thing that we have is the   LSAP, and I think that’s where we need to focus when we think about exit strategy  I think at   each meeting we should first make a decision about whether we even want to go to where we   have said the “up to” figure is It becomes very important that we make a rational choice around   that, because the first step of exiting is not going any further  I think that’s critical and takes   time and effort  I also think having the equivalent of GSE assets on our balance sheet with these   MBS is questionable in terms of the role of the central bank, if we have, in fact, stabilized the   markets  And I am very uneasy about purchasing long-term Treasuries  Perhaps it is optics, but   I think in some sense it’s also reality—you are monetizing the debt  So that’s how I think about   our exit strategy across all the actions we’ve taken   In terms of the flexibility on how to administer this, I think we should not have   flexibility If we met the needs of the MBS that we put on, and now our additional purchases are   causing other issues, then that’s a sign, perhaps, that we shouldn’t be going to the limit  I think   we should be aware of this and take note of it and not just say, “Well, we’ve got to get to the   total Let’s shift over to long-term Treasuries”  There’s information in the feedback we are   getting from the market that we ought to use and not ignore  That’s how I look at your three   questions, and less flexibility in the third is better than more   Well, Mr Chairman, in our District, clearly conditions do remain weak,   but the information we are receiving suggests the contraction has lessened, and expectations for   future growth have actually improved  We are seeing some reductions in residential real estate   inventories in the lower-priced housing sector, partly because house prices have adjusted and   partly because of some credits for first-time home buyers  Manufacturing continues to contract,   but there are signs that the decline has moderated noticeably  Our May manufacturing survey   showed that the pace of decline in production has actually reversed and in employment and   capital spending it has stabilized  Preliminary results from our June survey further indicate that   we are close to almost recovery levels in terms of District manufacturing  Our energy sector,   having fallen pretty significantly, has stabilized, but we are primarily producers of natural gas, so   stabilizing is about as good as we expect for any time soon  Commercial real estate remains a   source of pretty considerable weakness Our directors and District business contacts indicate that           June 23–24, 2009 133 of 261  a combination of higher vacancy rates and some difficulties in obtaining financing are really   limiting that market in our region   On the national front, our outlook isn’t a whole lot different from that of the Greenbook,   except in one important way, and that is that we have a more aggressive policy path for interest   rates They increase almost a year sooner than some outlined in the Greenbook  In terms of the   inflation outlook, we are not seeing any pressures towards deflation and, actually, not seeing any   signs at this point towards inflation either  So I see the risks as fairly balanced as we go forward    Thank you   Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’m fine with alternative B, and I would at   some point—not today, but in the future—have a preference for C  I could work with the   language that’s in the brackets, but it’s not essential to me   Obviously, the economy remains weak  But, as the discussion and as the projections   have indicated, it’s also true that economic and financial conditions have improved  We expect   to see some modest improvement in economic growth, perhaps in the latter part of this year and   even next year, as we’ve discussed We’re now in a situation where the data are changing, and                 June 23–24, 2009 189 of 261  we are beginning to talk about the possibility of a turning point, and in that regard, I agree with   President Stern—the data are mixed, and they will be mixed for some time   Looking toward the decisions ahead of us, I think that, given the mixed data and given   the experiences that we had in the fall of 2007 and in the summer of 2008, there will be an   enormous power of inertia at this table not to make that downward mistake  It’s hard to perceive   that the monetary and fiscal stimulus that’s in place, as significant it is, will really carry the day   forward  We’re going to resist that until we actually see the data  Furthermore, this period of   low inflation is going to kind of reinforce our view that we should wait and we should make sure   that the recovery is strong  I think that’s where we do risk the other side of this, and that’s how   we create inflationary issues or bubbles four or five years down the road because of this extended   period of accommodation, and we shouldn’t lose sight of that  I think it’s extremely important   With that in mind, I was pleased that we had the conversation yesterday about our exit   strategy My goals around that are that we find ourselves in a position where we can talk about   our policy rate being moved back towards neutral and we can talk about the fact that we’re   shrinking our balance sheet and the degree of excess reserves  I agree that we don’t want to   repeat the experience of the late 1930s, but that was a very blunt movement up in reserve   requirements  Hopefully we’ve learned that lesson and would be much more sensitive and much   more gradual Given the degree of stimulus, I think it will take us years to even get back close to   neutral So the economy is going to be growing slowly, but our moves back toward neutral also   will be very slow   Another goal, besides shrinking our balance sheet, should be restoring the composition of   our balance sheet We are now in the credit allocation business towards the housing market, and   that, of course, gives me some pause        June 23–24, 2009 190 of 261  I do think that a case can be made for scaling back our asset purchase program, doing less   than is currently authorized When we originally began these purchases some months ago, the   outlook was considerably weaker Deflation was a possibility, although a small one, and   financial stress was, in fact, elevated With the improving economic and financial conditions,   with the very significant fiscal stimulus beginning to kick in, and with deflation even less of a   threat, I think it would be prudent to reevaluate these purchases and determine whether we need   to go up to the total amount  That is what I mentioned yesterday about carefully reviewing that   at each meeting  I also would be very reluctant to expand the Treasury purchase program    Given the size of the debt that is being issued, the optics on that can be nothing but harmful   going forward   So we have lots to think about in the long term, and I want to begin to raise the need for   that long-term perspective today, even though some decisions along those lines are still in the   future Thank you  "
8799,2009-08-11,HOENIG," In a sense this is going to carry the discussion where it has already been,   but if I remember right, we had some discussion of this at the last FOMC meeting and went   against going forward with it at the time  And given my sense of things, although things remain   fragile in the housing market and elsewhere, things have improved  They are better than they   were It is not that I mind having it brought back, but I am wondering, Brian, what has happened   between the last FOMC and this FOMC that makes this worth bringing back for discussion?  The   market is not perfect yet  We still have this distortion in the ARMs, but there is some   improvement showing  I think that the markets will straighten out with time, especially if the   economy is on a healing path  Is there enough need for this to accelerate the recovery or settle   out the markets to bring this back and reconsider it at this meeting?   Thank you very much, Brian   Thank you   Thank you, Mr Chairman  Let me start with the District  Like the   national economy, we are showing some signs of stabilization  In our manufacturing surveys   and with contacts, we have seen modest increases in production and new orders for the past   couple of months, driven in part by rising export demand  In housing, sales and home prices   have stabilized, and the inventory of unsold homes is the lowest in some time  With the collapse   of the energy market, we did see some really sharp declines in drilling and production activities,   and the declines account for much of the fall in our structure investments during the first two   quarters of this year With the stabilization of that market, that area has also stabilized in our   region as oil production or drilling has begun to stabilize and increase slightly   The labor markets, as everyone else has said, tend to lag, and they remain weak  In the   nonresidential real estate markets, the volume of commercial construction activity continues to   fall relatively sharply, and the financial difficulties in the industry continue to worsen    Delinquency rates on construction loans are rising  CMBS quality is deteriorating, and there is   little refinancing available for maturing loans, and that is the case even when the properties are   leased There is just a very significant reluctance to finance right now  Appraisers are also being   quite conservative If they take a leased property and they look at their 2006 appraisal values,           August 11–12, 2009 86 of 165  they will discount them 20 percent, the assumption being that the higher cap rates have to be   worth less and harder to finance  For those that are not leased or not occupied, the discounts run   from 30 to 60 percent, with the greatest number in the condominium markets  However, they are   working through that The banks are being conservative right now, and I will come back to that   in just a second   In terms of the national outlook, I agree with others who have said that the economy is   showing mixed data, and that is usually an indication that we are likely at the bottom of the   recession I expect very modest growth in the second half of this year and then a picking-up of   momentum as we get into 2010, as fiscal stimulus engages even more than it has at this point    Monetary policy remains easy  Inventory rebuilding begins to occur, and consumer and business   attitudes hopefully improve, and I think the consumer attitude will  It has been there in the past,   and I think it will be once again   Obviously, the risk to the outlook is in the financial system, which remains weak  Setting   aside the largest institutions, we know that there is some retrenching in regional and community   banks, especially in the commercial real estate area  What we find—and I think it is   interesting—is that the banks with stress in their commercial real estate portfolio usually have   stress in the rest of their portfolio as well—C&I loans and so forth  But in this instance, I think   that going forward their effects will not be as negative as we sometimes fear, for a couple of   reasons They are in a defensive mode right now  They are conserving capital Those that can   survive will survive; and as the economy improves, they will be able, and will be interested in   beginning, to lend again For those that will not survive, another fiscal net is there, and that is   called the FDIC because many of those regional and community banks will go under purchase   and assumption when they fail  What that does is take the bad assets out, set them aside, and     August 11–12, 2009 87 of 165  recapitalize the bank, which is then actually in a better position to reengage as a financial   institution than it otherwise would be So they are either going to strengthen themselves and   come out of this, or they are going to be taken over, which will recapitalize them  I think that   will be a mitigating factor on the drag that these banks will otherwise have   So it is a climb out It is not an easy climb out, but on the outlook side, I think that it is a   pretty positive outlook going forward so long as the economy is basically turning around and   improving  Thank you   Thank you, Mr Chairman  Let me give the background on where I   come out on this  That is, as I mentioned yesterday, the evidence is that we are at or near the   bottom of this cycle  At least the evidence is pointing that way, and in that environment at this   point, we obviously have excess capacity  railroads, 50 percent in use  That is to be expected    But I think as we look ahead, we are starting to see improvement, and that should continue and   perhaps accelerate, given the fiscal and monetary policy that is in place  So it is not where we   are; it is where we are going that matters importantly as we consider our choices  I am not   suggesting here that we tighten or exit where we are from a current easing policy, but only that   we, as President Lacker said, stop increasing our purchases or increasing our easing process and   back off in that because we can’t exit until we complete our entry into this, and I think it’s time   to complete that  We may not see inflation or asset bubbles now  I think that is clear  But the        August 11–12, 2009 140 of 165  more we pump into this balloon, the larger it will eventually be and the more difficult it will be   to bring back down And that is what I think we need to begin to think about if we are, in fact,   recovering   So my view is that we begin to signal that we are  I think that is perhaps what alternative   B (revised) does Although I would like to see us begin tapering immediately, I would be in   favor of that alternative and that, as soon as possible, we stop purchasing assets and turn to the   TAF and the primary credit facility as means of providing liquidity into the intermediation   process or the banking industry and allow our economy to move more toward normality  So my   immediate goal is to cease purchasing assets and cease growing our balance sheet or allow our   balance sheet to begin to shrink normally  But the reality is that I think alternative B (revised) is   the reasonable place to be at this point  Thank you  "
8826,2009-09-22,HOENIG," I’d like to follow up on that, Brian, and anticipate, perhaps, a bit of   tomorrow’s discussion  Looking at these spreads and where the market is heading, what is the   likely reaction to our saying that, instead of going to $1¼ trillion we are going to $1 trillion for   the MBS purchases, and we’re going to taper it so we end this at the end of the year, anticipating   that the economy is recovering and therefore we have to begin to think about our exit strategy  I   know a bit of uncertainty about this may be out there, and I’d like to get your sense of how much   turmoil was circulating around that possibility and what the effect would be   Given those basis points, and given the fact that you would have, then,   time following that, are we talking about a bad thing, necessarily, given where the market is and   that we’re in the process of shifting away from our having such a dominant role?  In other words,   do you think that the action would be disruptive to the economy more broadly in terms of its   effect on the market?  Now, if it lasted, that would be one thing, but if it were temporary, that   would be another thing, given that the market may begin to work again   Fair enough Thank you very much   Good morning Thank you The Tenth District, like the rest of the   nation, appears to be climbing its way out of the recession  We’ve seen some slight   improvement in retail sales, our manufacturing index is up above 50, and there’s clearly some   improvement in our inventory situation, notably in housing, which has stabilized—in fact, we’re   actually seeing some improvement  Where we continue to struggle is, obviously, with   commercial real estate, which is a big issue for us  Our agricultural sector this year will be   down, because prices are down, primarily for bumper crops  Also, our labor markets are stable,   they’re not improving They may show some uptick, but very little, we suspect, as the economy   and the region has settled out Even our energy sector, which has been in the doldrums—as   President Fisher said, because we produce a lot of natural gas—has at least stabilized for now    So we’re working our way out, and, I would say, in a manner similar to that for the nation as a   whole   When we consider the nation and the outlook, I think that we are in recovery  There are   signs, in our region and elsewhere, of self-correcting mechanisms—the runoff in inventories, the     September 22–23, 2009 101 of 212  rebuilding, manufacturing picking up  Some of that is self-sustaining, hopefully, and will move   us forward   As we’ve started this recovery, and as we look forward, there continues to be enormous   stimulus that is yet to play out, both fiscal stimulus that is under way and will go through 2010   and monetary stimulus as well  And I think that’s very important to keep in mind as we look   ahead As we anticipate inflation and issues like that, I think it’s also important to remember that   we do need to look many quarters ahead, because everything that’s happening today reflects   steps we were involved in several quarters ago, or at least in the spring  In that regard, I think we   face a challenge looking at the immediate recovery, sustaining that recovery, and then looking   far enough ahead that we don’t introduce new problems for ourselves  And that’s what I do   worry about regarding inflation and other asset issues that might come up   We’re going to be in a position of trying, as you say, to bring our monetary policy to a   more neutral level in those quarters  It’s going to take a long time to do that  And we’ll be using   instruments we’ve never used before—that means there’s going to be slippage, and that means   there are going to be mistakes  Anticipating the next discussion a little bit, as we think about   first quarter, when I think there is a good chance the recovery will be sustained, I cannot help but   wonder if one of our most important tools—and there is risk with every choice we make—is to   do nothing in terms of buying assets that we would then almost immediately have to sterilize   On the matter of excess capacity, of course, we are just starting the recovery, so there is   excess capacity For example, a while ago, if you took a railroad in my part of the world and you   asked the CEO about capacity, he’d have told you that he had cars parked that would just about   cross the state of Kansas—and for those of you who don’t know Kansas, that’s a long way    [Laughter] More recently, though, his parked cars stretch only as far as Great Bend, Kansas—        September 22–23, 2009 102 of 212  and for those of you who don’t know Kansas, that’s still a long way, but less so  So the capacity   is being worked off, and that’s the process that’s under way  So we have to be thinking about   when the capacity will be used up compared with when our monetary policy will be in a more   neutral position Those are the hard choices I think we have, and that’s why I am worried about   our timing in terms of purchasing assets and continuing on that path  So thank you very much,   Mr Chairman   Thank you, Mr Chairman  As I look at the circumstances that we’re in,   I would prefer alternative C  And I don’t say that lightly, and I don’t say it because I don’t   happen to be voting I don’t have to put it out there—that’s an issue sometimes   I think it’s important that we look at the stance of policy, and we’re in a very   accommodative stance today  And looking ahead to 2010, 2011, 2012, we’re still going to have   a reasonably accommodative policy  I recognize that the short-run costs are always right before   us And I don’t want to stanch this recovery any more than anyone else does, and that is a major   concern I remember, perhaps unfortunately, sitting around worrying about 1 percent inflation in   2002 and 2003, worrying whether we would have deflation, and worrying about short-run issues   as we kept rates low for an extended period of time—I think that was our language  I just want   to make sure that we’re thinking about the long-run costs of this much stimulus and of the   difficulties we will face ahead in withdrawing it, because we’ve never before used these tools to   neutralize this much stimulus  We have enormous reserves in, and already some of the “chasing   yield” has begun with this amount of funds out there and available  We are taking on not only   risk in the short term and on the downside, but, by delaying, we also are taking on longer-term   risks, which may seem easier to take on precisely because they are longer term  So I’m very   sensitive to that   I also am very sensitive to the fact that this might surprise the market, and that is a very   serious worry But at some point I think we need to surprise the market, to some degree, and that   is why I was so interested in what the basis-point effect on mortgage rates would be as well as        September 22–23, 2009 160 of 212  the psychological effect But I think it’s a risk that we need to take on at this point, because if   we don’t announce this now, we will be very close to year-end at our next meeting, and I don’t   think we can then say that we’re really pulling this stuff back  At that point, I think we’d be even   more reluctant to do it So now we can shoot for year-end  We could tell them we’re not getting   out now, and we’re going to move this very carefully towards year-end  In the long run, I   suspect that we’d have—I can’t say better outcomes—reasonable outcomes   There are a couple of other things  I would push for first quarter—if at all possible    Also, I’m uneasy with the phrase “extended period,” because it has been such an issue with me   in the past So I’ll end with that Thank you   “Up to,” yes [Laughter] Safe bet  "
8852,2009-11-03,HOENIG,"  Just a suggestion  It would be helpful to me, given the breadth of choices   among us, if there was following this meeting a one-page summary of each list of questions, and   then I’d feel much more comfortable responding to that after some thought than to try to give an   answer at this point   Thank you, Mr Chairman  Conditions in our District and my views on   the outlook haven’t changed a lot since last time  On the region, I think the operative words   there are “moderately improve,” and you can kind of go through that  We have seen our   manufacturing moderately improve, driven by new orders and some orientation toward exports    Actually, there has been some hiring in manufacturing, but that is mixed  Of course, you get   some hiring, and you get some layoffs  So in a sense, that is pretty stable but not improving   dramatically at all  Housing has also improved  How much that is related to the homebuyers’   credit is not clear, but we do see improvement  Our big downside in the region is commercial   real estate, and that is going to remain so for at least a couple of years, we think  Our energy   sector has also moderately improved, oil particularly  Our natural gas, which is a big part of it,   still has plenty of supply; depending on the season, that will be effective  But one thing about   the energy industry is that they have been very able, in terms of current independence, to   renegotiate their lines; they have had no trouble getting those renewed  Our labor markets, on   balance, are still weak, but they are not declining, as indicated perhaps by this morning’s   numbers  One other thing I would comment on Our larger companies do have fairly sizable   cash balances For cap-ex, they are talking about maintaining and spending to maintain, but not   expanding, at this point as well   On the national economy, our outlook for GDP is not unlike that of the Greenbook  We   have a little more modest growth in 2010, and then it picks up  We also have an assumption in   there where policy is less accommodating sooner  Still, we see modest growth going forward                 November 3–4, 2009 93 of 201  and, in that environment, a very modest pickup in inflation over the next couple of years  And   other than that, things are stable, moving forward, and I will leave it at that for now  Thank you    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Like a couple of others, I would have some   preference for alternative C; but this is not the day, and I recognize that  The reason I have some                       November 3–4, 2009 153 of 201  preference is that I do worry about this environment in which we are at such low rates and we are   purchasing assets and sowing the seeds of some future imbalances  It does significantly rely on a   reversing at the right time  And to the extent that we are prepared to do that, I think the language is   good I would prefer the language sometimes in alternative C—if not today, then at some point as   we transition to this The three factors language is fine  I’m fine with “very low” as well and also   with $175 billion I am also looking forward to the discussions about how we reverse ourselves and   the discussions of asset sales or interest on reserves and how to juxtapose those very hard choices   that we have ahead of us, and I think that will be an important part of our future deliberations  So   alternative B, as you are describing it, I think will be the way to go with my preferences noted    Thank you  "
8880,2009-12-15,HOENIG," Thank you Mr Chairman, this question is more for you  Your   comment at the outset and then President Plosser’s reaction to it was describing a discussion that   would take place in January  I’m not clear on how you are outlining the policy discussion that   might take place in January versus perhaps now, and if you could clarify that for me, that would   be helpful   I agree I would assume that we could at this meeting hint about our   preferences as we look forward to January, because of the very developments that are taking   place now in the economy, and not just wait until January for their discussion   Absolutely I agree with that Thank you   Rather than in this meeting?   With the boards of directors—I understand   Thank you, Mr Chairman  Given the structural challenges that our   economy is experiencing and has ahead of it, I’m relatively optimistic about the economy    Rather than discussing the national picture, because our District mirrors some of the national   events, I’ll focus on some of that information           December 15–16, 2009 70 of 247  First of all, we’re experiencing some improvement in our manufacturing sector  It’s   small but systematic, and we get fairly good reports back on our surveys  Our retail sales reports   are up across the District This holiday season has been better than most people expected  We   are seeing some slowing down in job losses, as others have reported, certainly, across the region    And even in our housing sector we are seeing modest improvements there as well  Our ag sector   is actually improving very nicely, with improvements in the international sales area, with goods   sales to China, for example, and so our ag sector is really quite good right now across the region    Even technology seems positive  As one of our contacts described it, compared with the tech   bubble bust, this has been a very mild event for them, so they’re much more optimistic as they go   forward and think that they will have further strengthening moving from here   It’s interesting in talking with some of these individuals—it’s like listening to the FOMC    They’re optimistic, they’re doing pretty well, but they’re not quite sure, so they’re holding back,   waiting for more certainty before they invest And they have a good pocket of money to invest   once they gain that confidence to “pull the trigger,” if you will  That was striking in a number of   conversations I had with some of the tech people and some of the others who were thinking   about investing going forward I think that’s worth noting   As others have said, commercial real estate is really quite difficult for banks that are   caught up in the commercial real estate cycle  But, for our region, I think it’s also important to   make some distinctions  In the urban areas, where some banks have plunged into commercial   real estate, they’re in deep trouble, and they’re not going to be able to make loans  They’re just   hanging on But there’s another group of banks that did not plunge as deeply, and it’s a fair   percentage of our banks They have kind of the same issue that I talked about earlier—they have   the money, but they want to be very careful, they don’t want to get caught up in any false        December 15–16, 2009 71 of 247  recovery, and so they are being very thoughtful before they extend it  Even though they have   funds, their standards are fairly tight, and they’re also claiming they’re not seeing the demand   from the small business, so they have both sides going  But as the economy improves, I think a   good number of them will be in a position to lend, even though there will continue to be a drag   from the commercial real estate side   So overall I think we are on the right track  Things are improving in our region, and I   think I see that in the models on the national economy  I have no major disagreements with the   Greenbook, as we think about things going forward   I do want to note and make a comment on the issue that Jim Bullard mentioned  I think   that the approach of not reinvesting proceeds in the maturing MBS is a very good approach  And   I would tell you that, the way I look at it, even if you were to do that, in 2016 you’d still have   half your portfolio left But it’s like phase 1 of this extraction process  We talked earlier about   raising the spread, letting these roll off, and then, depending on how the economy recovers, we   might be more actively engaged in managing that portfolio down, if we’re permitted to do so, by   circumstances, and we should be considering that  Part of that, hopefully, will be discussed   tomorrow, and certainly a big part of that will be discussed in January And I look forward to   both of those conversations Thank you   Thank you, Mr Chairman  It’s an interesting meeting  The way I’m   trying to think of the context is that economic circumstances obviously have changed  You and   others have described them  You might think of this meeting as an inflection point, where we’re   beginning to think a little bit differently about how we’re doing monetary policy and how we   might do it in the future  There are a couple of aspects to it  In this meeting, we’re beginning to   describe, I guess, more definitely our exit from the extraordinary facilities that we’ve engaged in            December 15–16, 2009 120 of 247  Paragraph 4 walks us through that, and I think that’s a good thing  And I also would probably be   in agreement as we move to January for the increase in the spread  With that, I do agree with   President Plosser that we should also increase the minimum acceptable bid rate on the TAF as   we go forward to keep that in line  So that is, kind of, phase 1 of this     Phase 2 is the more difficult, and that’s the process of removing the highly   accommodative policy and perhaps firming policy as we go forward  That, of course, will   depend, as many have said, on a variety of economic circumstances  But that’s always the case   I’m very sensitive to the fact that unemployment will be very slow to come down over the next   several quarters, but I also would remind the Committee that if we started today, it would be a   long time before monetary policy is brought back up to what most would consider a normal   policy under normal circumstances as well  We’re going to have an accommodative policy for   many quarters ahead, even if we were to start removing some of it today, and we shouldn’t lose   sight that  We need to be thinking about removing this accommodative policy and restoring our   balance sheet, as others have said, to pre-crisis levels We need to do that in gingerly way, of   course, but we also need to begin to prepare the markets for that   I’m very concerned  I know how we need to be walking on eggshells, I really do  But   I’m very concerned about this “extended period” language when we’re near zero, because it also   provides a safe harbor for those who are going to engage, and are, in fact, engaged, in   speculative activities around that, and we encourage that, and I think there is a price to pay at the   other end of this So as I balance this out, I’m not inclined to wordsmith things, but I do have a   slight preference for C for a couple of reasons  I think it does more forcefully respond to the fact   that conditions have improved  It does allow us to scale back some of the purchases that, in my   opinion, should be scaled back, and it does change the language from “extended period” to        December 15–16, 2009 121 of 247  “some time”  I think, yes, there would be some jitteriness in the market, perhaps, but, at the   same time, it would set the stage for giving people some confidence that things are improving   and that we are, in fact, anticipating and avoiding some of the mistakes of the past that we are   duly being reminded of  So that’s how I view it at this time  Thank you   Just one   Just need one to execute   So you don’t have to   Thank you Just a short observation  This is, as others have said, very   interesting in terms of inflation dynamics and output gaps  And I agree that we need to use   models and work them and then apply our judgment to the situation   But I also want to remind the Committee that we do need to begin to think differently in   some ways  I can’t help but recall that in 2003 Borio and White gave a paper at the Jackson   Hole Symposium on issues around not so much bubbles but very strong expansion and the   conditions we create that cause these cycles, if you will  It means that you can look at where   interest rates are relative to at least an estimated long-term equilibrium rate and at how fast credit   growth is moving in a particular period of time  If you reread that paper now, you will think they   were on to something  While we need these output gaps, and so forth, the financial system is   driving a lot of what’s happening, and we need to bring that into the equation more directly    Maybe that’s what you were referring to regarding the updates to the papers that you have been   involved with           December 15–16, 2009 184 of 247  There’s more to it than the output gap, and I’m a little worried, because of that, about   making inflation targeting your goal, because you can have a very stable inflation environment   for a while and have a very volatile financial environment with the excesses that go on there  So   I recommend that you all reread that paper  Thank you  "
8909,2010-01-26,HOENIG,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I guess I’d start out by saying the one thing   that’s obvious here is the degree of uncertainty about any of these tools and what their effects will   be  And that suggests that we need to go carefully and gingerly  But I would say sooner rather than   later so that we can begin to see what these effects might be  On raising the primary credit rate, I   January 26–27, 2010 69 of 260    am supportive of that  I think the timing of that is a matter of when we feel we are ready to explain   it, and then we should take that action   Beyond that, on the questions, I think a gradual sale of these MBS over a period of time is   the right way to go once we get started on this  I would redeem all MBS and not Treasuries  As far   as the sequencing goes, I think the interest rate on excess reserves will be where we start  We need   to find out if there is a relationship between moving the rate on excess reserves and the fed funds   rate, and I think long term we should be moving back toward a market rate as our target  We have a   lot to learn before we get that completely implemented, and so that’s the process we have to begin   right now  I think we just need to begin to see how these tools work in reverse  I do like President   Kocherlakota’s systematic proposal, but I think the first step would be to move the interest rate on   excess reserves  I will leave it at that    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Our region of the country continues to show   modest, steady improvement across the areas  To begin with, in terms of the investment   outlooks, in energy, where we’ve seen some pretty nice recoveries, there is a return to some   pretty vigorous investments in that area, in oil rig counts and so forth  Agriculture also has   shown improvement, and we’re seeing investments regain there  Our manufacturing side, our   manufacturing survey shows continued improvement in the most recent survey for this month    There is an issue around other industries in terms of the ability to invest, but because of excess   capacity, there is a tendency to wait and see, but I think they are in a position to begin to invest if   their confidence continues to improve  We have had a couple of instances, anecdotally, where   one of our directors has had a desire to expand and has found the financing to be readily   available  Another has had one of their companies acquired, and the acquiring company’s   financing to make that acquisition was fairly readily available  So there is that note of   improvement  On the labor market, our layoffs are subsiding clearly, but the hiring is very   modest, so one interpretation of that is we may be at that inflection point, I hope   Looking to the national economy, I am seeing, along the lines of the broad consensus   here, 3¼ percent growth in 2010 and, beyond that, further improvements toward 4 percent,   spurred in part by the stimulus and in part by monetary policy  The inflation outlook under these   conditions still is modest, and I see that in 2010 as well  On balance, though, I see the story on   January 26–27, 2010 140 of 260    the national economy as continuing to improve and continuing to show a strengthening outlook,   and I think that is the critical element for us  Thank you      Thank you, Mr Chairman  Part of the consensus that I have heard here   today is that economic and financial conditions have improved steadily in recent months and that   this is obviously due in part to some very stimulative monetary policy  Although the convictions   vary around this table, we are all projecting improved economic growth  And, yes,   unemployment is too high  Part of that is structural  And if we wait until it is low enough to   satisfy everyone, we will delay actions that I think are necessary  In my view, President Bullard,   uncertainty is always above average in a bust and always below average in a boom  [Laughter]    January 26–27, 2010 187 of 260    That is the problem  So I think we need to think about that, because in this period, uncertainty   impedes actions that I think are necessary  We have had language of reassurance regarding low   rates for nearly a year, even though circumstances are considerably different than they were a   year ago  My point is that we need to turn more deliberately to more-aggressive thinking about   our long-run issues   There are three risks that I am concerned about  The first, and perhaps most important, is   a commitment to near-zero rates for an extended period  It lays the new foundations as the   economy recovers for future financial imbalances, and I think this is where we are in danger  In   my experience, artificially low rates for an extended period invite resource misallocations  No   matter the upside data, we will not reverse policy significantly or quickly  It’s just our   experience  As this occurs, and we use this “extended period” language, we have handcuffed   ourselves for any action for at least six to nine months it would seem  Maybe not     Another risk is that we are seeing and will experience significant borrowing needs of the   federal government  This will, as our economy continues to improve, put upward pressure on   real rates, and therefore we are in this handcuffed position   Third, as noted in the Bluebook, the combination of near-zero interest rates with the size   of our balance sheet will cause long-term inflation expectations to systematically, over time,   become less well anchored, I guess I’ll say  Thus, we need to change the forward guidance and   cease our commitment to “extended period” language  We should allow ourselves the flexibility   to begin to raise rates modestly, not just let liquidity facilities rescind as the economy improves,   assuming that it does continue to improve, and, if it doesn’t, then we don’t move  The Bluebook   recognizes part of this in terms of growth protection and the fact that we could have and should   have higher rates  And I would point out that an effort to move the fed funds rate to ½ or   January 26–27, 2010 188 of 260    1 percent is, if anything, accommodative  It’s not tight policy, and we should think about it,   because the longer we wait, the more the resource allocation issues come up   Now, on the market, I certainly realize that changing the word “extended” may rattle the   market, perhaps importantly, perhaps temporarily  It depends on how we explain it and how we   go forward  But if we are going to remain handcuffed and we are going to remain committed to   the markets’ expectations that they define, then we are going to have future problems—maybe   not next year in this economy but in a future period as we have had in the past  Therefore, I   would very much prefer alternative C as we move forward  Thank you  "
8934,2010-03-16,HOENIG,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’ll be brief  I guess some of my questions   have been asked and answered, but I will say a couple of things  Your clarification helps me,   because I also wasn’t clear on what the purpose of the discussion around redemptions was, but   you’re telling me it is one part of a broader issue    I think the discussion in April would be very good because the goal for   me is to get the excess reserve levels down as quickly as possible  So I’m very much in favor of   Treasury redemptions and also the systematic sale of the mortgage-backed securities to the   extent the market can handle it without being disrupted  So that, I think, is the most important   element that we can have as a discussion item   On the RCAs, I do associate myself a little bit with President Lacker and President   Evans  I see it as more of a transfer than really a competitive enhancer into the market  The   enhancement is by giving the guarantee—you basically transfer earnings over to the GSEs    They’ve chosen to narrow their scope in terms of whom they’ll have as a counterparty  That’s   their choice  I don’t know that we need to get involved in that  I don’t think we’re going to   gather that much more information, especially if we focus on getting the excess reserves down as   quickly as possible  So I’ll leave it at that    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’ll focus mostly on the region and let that   carry into the national outlook  If you talk to people in our region, as our economy continues to   show modest, systematic improvement in the manufacturing and especially in our energy and   agricultural sectors right now, there is an attitude that we are basically grinding our way through   to a sustained modest recovery, barring shocks from congressional action, fiscal policy,   international events, and all those caveats  So there is a certain confidence building of a modest   recovery going forward   Turning to the sources of some strength, manufacturing activity is increasing steadily and   has been so since September  Production has nearly returned to year-ago levels  Even some in   manufacturing are becoming more optimistic in terms of their production outlook  In the energy   sector, capital spending is now expanding even though natural gas prices have been relatively   low  The technology and the opportunities are there, and they are investing pretty significantly   right now  I would point out that our agricultural sector has improved, and there are stronger   income levels that have led to a rise in loan repayments and fewer reports of loan renewals and   extensions  Crop land values have strengthened pretty noticeably—we have a director in our   Omaha area, and he is in the land auction and brokering business and management business   across the country, and some of the increases in the last couple of months have been quite   striking  Sales of land that was once $3,000 an acre is now $8,000, and when asked why people   are leveraging off adjacent property, the answer is, “I can’t put it anywhere else and get any   money, so I might as well put it in that”  We’re seeing some pickup in mergers and acquisitions   March 16, 2010 59 of 146    as well  Retailers report January and February were weaker than they expected and flat relative   to a year ago, as others might have said  But they are optimistic as we look ahead   Commercial real estate, as others have said, remains very weak, but I would note the   following  We have worked with some of the real estate companies and some of the appraisal   companies in our part of the country; now, for Class A space, the cap rates are actually coming   down again  So we are seeing some improvement in that top layer in terms of the willingness to   finance and the willingness to lower the cap rates, and I think that is of some importance   There’s little evidence of wage and price pressures in the District  One thing I would   report  A former director of ours who has a temp employment company said that, since last   spring to the middle or maybe the first week in February, the firm has seen a 50 percent increase   in activity  Part of that is market share, but part of that is the level they’re starting from, and it’s   also kind of the company’s trial balloons, and this sort of thing, but it has picked up noticeably   On the national outlook, I continue to hold the view that we are in a state of recovery—I   think we’re probably looking at 3 percent economic growth, not unlike the Greenbook  So there   are differences here and there, but I suspect we’ll have a sustained recovery going forward   On the inflation front, I agree that if you look at the trimmed numbers or you look at the   core, a 1 percent outlook for near-term inflation is a reasonable estimate in my mind  Over the   longer term, of course, those projections change  I would also mention here, and I will perhaps   mention it later, as well, that an issue that keeps coming up in terms of the guarantees on the low   rates is that—and we learned this a little bit and this why we’re suffering some of our   unemployment—those very guarantees encourage the leverage that we are concerned about and   encourage some of the distortions that we’ll have to deal with later  So it’s not just the inflation   March 16, 2010 60 of 146    outlook, but how we’re encouraging leverage going forward that I think we have to be mindful   of  I will stop with that, Mr Chairman  Thank you    Thank you, Mr Chairman  A couple of comments to begin with  I   appreciate the reference to supervision, and I’ve been involved in it for a number of years, and   the thing that this very much reminds me of is more of a “back to the future” kind of   environment, because I have been through the energy price crisis and the agricultural land crisis   March 16, 2010 104 of 146    and the Long-Term Capital Management crisis, and there are many similarities  And to that   point, I know that we can’t necessarily identify bubbles  That’s not my point  My point is that   we do tend to create conditions that invite bubbles, and that’s what I’m concerned about as we   look forward  I do realize—very, very much—that the fundamental challenge for this   Committee is to balance the near-term economic conditions with the longer-term risk of   inflation, but, to my mind, also financial imbalances and financial stability  That’s a part of the   challenge we have   Certainly, current conditions warrant a low interest rate environment—I’m not arguing   that point  But I am equally concerned that the longer-run risk to financial and economic   stability warrant eliminating our commitment to exceptionally low rates for an extended period    My concern is that we need to give more weight to these longer-run risks now, before we   actually see them and ask “Is this a bubble?” because by the time you ask that question, you’re   probably too late  My concern is that, in not looking at the long run, we may keep rates lower   than we should longer than we should, thereby creating the conditions that foster the future   imbalances that I worry about  The Committee needs the flexibility in the coming months to   move from the emergency level of accommodation implemented during the financial crisis a   year ago to a level of accommodation that appropriately balances—and remember I said “level of   accommodation”—the short-run and the longer-run macroeconomic and financial risks that we   face   What are some of the longer-run risks that I think about and worry about and I know all   of you do as well?  While the research is early and not typically included in most models, some   past crises I, at least, have observed have stemmed in part from exceptionally low interest rate   guarantees, which have contributed to the buildup of financial imbalances—I think we’ve seen   March 16, 2010 105 of 146    some of that over the past decade—encouraging leverage and facilitating credit booms  Over the   past decade extensive resources under those conditions have been channeled to residential and   nonresidential construction and to financial markets  While they have benefited the financial   institutions, they also have penalized savers  I know the reasons for maintaining low interest   rates are important—we’re trying to maintain the broader economy—but there are consequences    And finally exceptionally low interest rates and the Federal Reserve’s large balance sheet, if   maintained too long, should lead to an unanchoring of long-run inflation expectations  That’s the   last of the issues that I have been trying to bring up and have brought up in the past   So in light of these risks, there is, I think, a case for modestly raising the interest rate on   reserves and the federal funds rate target sooner than the Greenbook or the markets necessarily   assume  I’m not talking about now, but I’m thinking sooner than the Greenbook and the   markets  Any such move, if it is to be effective, will be some surprise to the market, of course,   but less so if we remove our current guarantee of exceptionally low rates  And if we remove it,   we stop this issue of “What does it mean? Six months?  Or three months?” and so on, which only   creates its own set of uncertainties  I think we ought to have some flexibility in case we need to   begin to raise rates late this summer, to start bringing them back to 1 percent—which I think of   as a reversal of the emergency actions, not really a tightening of monetary policy  That   flexibility should be ours, and we can’t have that until we get rid of this language   Turning to the exit strategy, I know we’re going to have the discussion at the next   meeting, but I generally support C′, and if I had my druthers, I would say we’re going to start   redeeming government securities in April and not wait until after our next meeting   I’ll stop with that, except to say that for me C′ is where we ought to be heading  The   reason to begin tightening policy soon is not simply or even primarily to prevent the issues   March 16, 2010 106 of 146    around inflationary pressures immediately  That’s longer term and important  Rather it is to   prevent future buildup of financial imbalances and reduce the risks to longer-run macroeconomic   and financial stability that come from maintaining a commitment to exceptionally low rates for   an extended period of time  Thank you  "
8957,2010-04-27,HOENIG,"  Thank you  I have to add my thanks to the staff  This really was a very   helpful set of options, and thanks to Brian for such a great presentation   April 27–28, 2010 38 of 206                   Let me start by saying that, while I certainly realize that monetary policy is scheduled for   discussion tomorrow, it is hard, I think, to avoid touching on some aspects of policy as we   discuss these options today  But I won’t stray very far, I hope   I assume that, for the purposes of this discussion, our overall objective is to normalize   monetary policy within five years, the period during which we would expect the economy and   the financial markets to have returned to a more normal set of circumstances themselves    Included in this objective is the goal of restoring the size and composition of the balance sheet to   normal and raising the nominal fed funds rate closer to neutral, depending on inflation   expectations and inflation itself, of course   In considering the five options, I do judge option 2, asset sales after an increase in the   target, to be the closest to my preferred approach  Under this option, we eliminate agency debt   and MBS within five years from when we first increase the fed funds rate, depending on   economic and financial conditions  I believe this approach will be the most favorable to the   economy and financial markets as we move through this transition   While option 2 is close to my preferred approach, I do have some important differences   that may not surprise you  Importantly, as I will suggest during tomorrow’s go-around, I believe   we should begin to consider raising the fed funds rate towards 1 percent as early as this summer   and into September, and we need to do it in more than a quarter-point step, which would only   give the market the impression that we have this series of quarter-point steps into, it seems,   infinity  I’d also say that, after we get to 1 percent, we would pause and take stock of the   emerging economic and financial conditions  We would look then to determine whether and at   what pace the rate should increase beyond that, thus letting the markets know where we are   headed and that we will take conditionality into consideration  This would then also allow us, I   April 27–28, 2010 39 of 206                   think, to redeem Treasuries along the way  As the fed funds rate rises above 1 percent, we can   then begin to dispose of the mortgage-backed securities and judge at what pace this might occur   in a pretty careful way   Finally, let me turn to the issue of how we communicate our asset sales strategy  Once a   decision is made, I would disclose it in the statement following the meeting with additional   details included in the minutes  If this isn’t acceptable, perhaps we could do it through testimony   or other remarks, but I think we can do it following the meeting  Therefore, I generally support   the illustrative language in option 2 described in table 2 of the staff memo, subject to the   differences I have mentioned here  I also appreciate that the statement includes a general   description of the overall exit strategy that I think would be important to the market  Thank you    Yes, I think this allows us to do Treasury redemptions at this point   because we are thinking of raising the rate along the way    I just want to pursue this a little further  Nathan, what if they can’t come   to agreement, and Portugal and Spain need help next?  Because even if they do come to an   agreement, there’s that possibility for Portugal and Spain  I hope that someone is assuming that   this aid doesn’t come through and they do go into default because—    That would be bad  It has a familiar ring      Thank you, Mr Chairman  The Tenth District’s economy continues to   expand at a pretty steady pace  Manufacturing, agriculture, and now consumer spending are   showing strength and are contributing to the improvement of the overall economy within the   region  Energy conditions have actually softened somewhat but remain a contributor to our   recovery overall  Commercial real estate continues to be the weakest sector of our economy    Looking ahead, though, our contacts expect the recovery to continue at a relatively solid pace,   and a growing number of firms are anticipating employment gains through the end of the year    For the first weeks of April, District factory managers reported a sharp rise in production and   shipments and new orders  Manufacturers and transportation companies expect the rebound in   shipments to continue over the next few months, from every indication they have  And   employment levels in manufacturing are expected to edge up with this stronger activity  A   temporary employment company headquartered in our region has reported to me that their sales,   that is, their placements, are up 40 percent since the beginning of the year   April 27–28, 2010 112 of 206                   Conditions in the agricultural sector continue to improve  And I would note that   continued strong gains in farmland values have pushed value-to-rent ratios to record highs in our   area  We have received yet more reports of strong investor interest in farmland as well   While the energy sector, as I said, has remained a broad source of strength in the District,   in recent weeks softer prices for natural gas have slowed the expansion of our drilling activity,   and natural gas is about 60 percent of our drilling  In addition, the profits of renewable energy   firms have also declined, as might be expected   Our examiners and our contacts report that commercial real estate continues to be weak,   with sales, rents, and prices posting some further declines, and we are seeing further   deterioration in the quality of that commercial real estate on some of their books  One favorable   sign is that the degree of deterioration seems to be slowing  As I think I mentioned last time, the   cap rates are improving in the class A space, although the industrial space and the B and C space   are still under very serious pressure   District wage and retail price pressures remain subdued, as others report  However,   manufacturing reported a modest rise in the prices of finished goods and an expectation of   further increases, at least over the summer months  Manufacturers and transportation companies   in our region are systematically reporting that raw material prices have continued to rise   Like the region, the national data show the economy is expanding at a reasonably solid   pace, as others have said  I have edged up my forecast for GDP growth as well, to about   3½ percent  The recent strength in consumer and business spending and exports suggests the   economy is transitioning from a recovery driven by fiscal stimulus and inventory adjustments to   one that I think is more sustainably driven by private spending  The recent strength also suggests   that the pace of recovery may prove faster than anticipated  The recent improvement in the labor   April 27–28, 2010 113 of 206                   conditions is another encouraging sign for the recovery  Last month’s solid gain in private   payrolls, rapid growth of employment in temporary help services that I noted, and evidence of a   modest uptick in job openings, all suggest broader job growth will improve   In noting these more positive numbers, I haven’t lost sight of the important uncertainties   that we face  Commercial real estate, which I mentioned, continues to be adversely affected, and   that is affecting bank lending  Uncertainties remain in the job market, although there are   improvements  And fiscal policy, with the end of the Bush tax cuts coming, and the mounting   deficits for state governments as well, will almost certainly complicate monetary policy in the   quarters, perhaps years, ahead  I also am very much aware of the international activities that   we’ve described here already this morning   I expect core consumer inflation to remain low for now, and, as I said, just under   1 percent  Over time, though, I expect core consumer inflation will gravitate towards our longer-  term expectations  The gravitational pull will be helped along on the other side by a push from   an improving economy, perhaps a decline in the dollar, depending on the international   experiences, and rising commodity prices  To varying degrees, these forces reflect, I think, the   effects of important, sustained fiscal and monetary policy  With this outlook, I think the time has   come to be talking, as we did yesterday—and I will talk more about it in the policy round—about   a careful but deliberate exit strategy from our current policy  Thank you, Mr Chairman    I’m not sure if I agree with Jim or not  [Laughter]  I prefer alternative C,   and I think we need to get rid of the “extended period” language  I acknowledge that we’ve tried   to clarify that we can always change course, but that language is there for a purpose—it does   give a clear signal as to our intentions   I also want to say, before I go into more detail, that I truly have the same goals that the   Committee as a whole has in terms of the dual mandate  My perspective is longer run  I do feel   that maintaining excessively low rates over an extended period of time—we’re not going to be   tight any time soon; I can’t imagine it—raises the question of the degree of accommodation that   then builds the imbalances forward, the excess and the credit growth that you can’t catch up with   at the other end  That’s what I worry about, having experienced it   On the tail risks, I fully appreciate the concerns about the situation in Europe, and Bill’s   comments this morning were very sobering  I think we need to be very proactive this time in   monitoring and discussing these developments, with—I don’t know what we’re calling them   now—LFI briefings at our meetings going forward on where these institutions lie along the risk   scale to help us engage on financial stability issues  Our power of lender of last resort and as   liquidity provider could come into play, and I encourage thinking about that for the June   meeting, if we can  Hopefully, we don’t need to do it sooner than that   Now I want to pick up from where we were yesterday and suggest to the Committee that   we continue our efforts to chart a course of strategy where we normalize the stance of monetary   policy within five years It’s my view that, by taking careful and deliberate steps, we can return   the economy and the markets to a more normal environment with the best long-run benefits or   consequences  The achievement of this goal will be reflected in the realization of a nominal fed   funds rate close to whatever we judge to be neutral— probably a quarter above 2 percent and a   April 27–28, 2010 154 of 206                   combined Federal Reserve balance sheet half its current size—and an economy growing steadily   with less chance of creating a new set of imbalances and longer-run issues, either in terms of   inflation or asset valuation   I realize these are outcomes we all want  I propose that we describe this as an exit   strategy of two fundamental steps  The first step would work off the fact that we are well down   the road in terms of unwinding the extraordinary policy actions that we introduced in response to   the intensification of the financial turmoil that began in the fall of 2008—we have closed the   special liquidity facilities and returned the discount window to more normal operations  To   complete this step, we should let the public know—if not at this meeting, then soon—that we   intend to carefully raise the fed funds rate towards 1 percent as early as this September, or in the   early fall of this year  In doing so,  we also would make it known that, at that point, we would   pause and take stock before we move rates further, that we would judge where we are and what   conditions are; of course, this is all subject to conditions changing   This process has risks, I realize, but risks are unavoidable  Saying and doing nothing has   risks also, because waiting until we are certain everything is right could be too late  I think this   course offers us the best likely outcome, since most people realize rates have to move, and these   very low rates have serious risks  I think there are benefits to announcing the first step of our   exit strategy as a movement towards 1 percent, after which we will pause  It can legitimately be   explained as a continuation of the unwinding  The markets don’t have to be disrupted as much    It can also be explained as a rational move to take the fed funds rate from an unsustainable level   of between zero and a quarter percent  Of course, that means getting rid of the “extended   period” language now   April 27–28, 2010 155 of 206                   The second step for normalizing policy would then begin only after a pause and an   assessment of the outlook  We would explain this to the public and the markets, giving them   clear guidance  And we would explain that further moves would depend on our views on   conditions and would not necessarily proceed in a stairstep manner  The policy rate would then   increase from 1 percent toward 2 percent and then on to neutral, as conditions allowed  Indeed,   depending on economic and financial conditions, I can envision that the Committee would begin   raising rates beyond 1 percent at some point in 2011  Also, as part of normalizing the balance   sheet, we would wait and then—as we move the fed funds rate up and confidence in the   economy builds—we would begin selling the MBS portfolio  As I noted in yesterday’s go-  round, I recommend that we eliminate MBS from our balance sheet within that five-year period,   depending on the circumstances, of course   With this proposal, I urge the Committee to set out publicly its longer-run strategy for   monetary policy soon, because the fact is that the economy is recovering  Yes, it has a long   climb, but it is recovering  Real policy rates are exceptionally low  In regard to the actions   outlined here, policy will remain accommodative for years to come  The strategy outlined here   would reasonably parallel the likely decline in the unemployment rate, so, as it moves, we’re   moving the rate up, and that will preclude the likely steady increase in imbalances and longer-run   inflationary pressures that otherwise will occur over the quarters and years ahead  I think this is   a reasonable, balanced exit that reduces the longer-run event of pushing rates on the other side of   the cycle—which we tend to do—too high  It gives us a more level, systematic approach, once it   is announced and clarified, that is subject to the shocks that we have to deal with as a Committee    So I offer that up as the way to think ahead  Thank you   April 27–28, 2010 156 of 206                    To follow up on what I said earlier, could we think about a more   organized discussion around our systemic issues?  Would that be possible?  "
8982,2010-05-09,HOENIG,"  I have a couple of questions, and, if the timing isn’t right, we can defer   the discussion  One is in reference to what Bill Dudley said, if I understood it correctly  Were   you saying that these swaps would be kind of open-ended, subject to the demand for them?  Is   that correct?   May 9, 2010 19 of 42              That leads to my second question and kind of comes back to the political   challenge we have, Mr Chairman  I think it’s important to have a discussion on how we would   announce this, because the misinformation or the misinterpretations of our actions could   multiply, given the history that we’ve just suffered through  I think it’s very important that we   be very forthcoming  If we’ve given any thought to how this announcement would look, it   would be of interest to me at this point, or before we get off the call     Thank you  Just to carry this a bit further, I agree with what you said,   Michelle  In terms of the reaction of some members of the Congress, I think their concern is that   we might be exposing the taxpayer to the risk of having to pick up the tab to save organizations   in Europe  I agree with you, and with President Fisher, that it’s important to explain in simple   language that these are liquidity facilities, that we’re not risking taxpayer money, and that we’re   willing to show the contracts to verify that we will get paid back in full dollars  I think doing so   would go a long ways not to ending the criticism but to mitigating the sense of concern  So I   think you’re on the right track  And I hope that as soon as we hang up here you start drafting   that, because it’s going to take multiple drafts to get it as simple and yet as thorough as possible    That’s my suggestion and an admonition on that  Thank you    I have a question    Would there be pushback on this in the political context, where someone   might say, “Well, shouldn’t you collateralize this with their reserves?”  Is that going to come up?    And if it is, how do we answer that?    I mean, with the reserves they have denominated in dollars that they   could then collateralize, so if it did go into default we would—    It’s a question that I fear someone will ask, so I’ll ask it now, so we can   anticipate it    I agree with you  But someone is going to ask you that    Agreed    Mr Chairman, I support reengaging these swaps  We are the most   important central bank  For liquidity, we need to provide the dollars to make sure this doesn’t   unwind on us into a global disaster  To reemphasize, I think the quality of our statement   announcing this is probably the most important challenge we have, because we are going to get   pushback  We are going to get some off-the-wall questions, and I think we need to anticipate   them, including the point about our being in an economic recovery  We want to maintain that,   May 9, 2010 36 of 42             both for ourselves and for the globe  And then, how transparent we are should be described    With that encouragement, I’m supportive of this action, Mr Chairman   "
9007,2010-06-22,HOENIG,"  You mentioned in your comments, Brian, the possibility of selling MBS   and indicated that this coupon swap might be a better alternative  Given the demand there is for   MBSs, and the lack of supply, do you think selling our MBSs would be disruptive to the market?    Or, with the right explanation, would it be helpful to the market?  My own view is that it might   be helpful, given some of the conversations that I have been in with bankers    Mr Chairman, the reason I ask is that I’ve had some—not many, but   some—bankers of the $10 billion size saying, “We can’t get these  These are things we would   like  Why don’t you sell some of them?” And I thought it was a very fair question to ask us   June 22–23, 2010 10 of 213              May I?    But part of my goal would be to shrink our balance sheet as well, without   disrupting the market  So I don’t want to get confused in terms of where my objective is relative   to that    Thank you, Mr Chairman  First of all, if we were to go in a particular   direction, I would totally agree with giving you all the time you need to explain it in terms of the   Humphrey-Hawkins  I certainly understand that, and it needs to be explained  The reason I   raised the question is partly because we did say circumstances had changed, and I looked at it as   an opportunity to reduce our balance sheet without necessarily disrupting the markets or our   longer-run objectives, provided we give the right explanation  I still feel that we can do that    We’re already experimenting with term auction facilities to bring excess reserves down  This is   a favorable selling into a favorable market that would further allow us to reduce those holdings    It seemed like a reasonable thing to do, in my opinion   In terms of what President Lacker was saying, if we have that opportunity and the goal is   not to shrink the balance sheet, I would just as soon put shorter-term Treasuries on as other   mortgage-backed securities  So that’s where I am  On the narrow question, I suppose I could go   with option 2 as well, so we would move towards Treasuries  Thank you    Thank you, Mr Chairman  The Tenth District economy continues to   expand at a steady, modest pace  According to reports on our retail sales, spending is continuing   to grow modestly, although our auto dealers are reporting some pretty strong increases in sales    Our energy activity is expanding, and there has been a pretty significant oil play found in   southeastern Wyoming that’s creating a little bit of activity—we’ll see how that develops as we   go forward  Obviously, commercial real estate remains weak around the District, although   we’ve seen some stability on the residential side, that is, some less negative news   The manufacturing survey in our region shows continued expansion, but at a moderate   pace  I have reported to you in the past some activity in farmland, and that continues  I will tell   you that I’ve become a little more concerned—we  got a call from one of our contacts who had   gotten a call from another part of the country asking if there were any real good deals around   ”Wi-CHEE-tah,” Kansas  Don, you and I know that is Wichita, Kansas  When they do that, I   get real worried about where they’re coming from [Laughter]   On the whole, our District actually went into the recession a bit after the nation did, but   it’s coming out at about the same pace  So as I look at us and compare us to the nation, I’m   pretty comfortable with the outlook  We’ve had almost a year of growth, and I expect that to   continue over the course of the rest of this year and, I hope, into 2011  Thank you    Thank you, Mr Chairman  It’s interesting that we’re ending about a   year’s worth of economic growth  The recovery, of course, has gone through various phases, as   President Fisher and others have noted, and the data have been mixed throughout  Accordingly   there has always been a degree of uncertainty with us  I’ve been at this table many times in the   past where uncertainty has caused us to wait  Waiting is always attractive—certainly, I’m   attracted to it, as well  I recall discussions earlier in this last decade about concerns of deflation,   uncertainties regarding world events, just as we’re discussing here  There’s always a good   reason, and I don’t dispute that  I, too, worry about employment  Jobless recoveries seem to be   becoming the norm, and the adjustments seem harsher  But my bottom line is that our dual   mandate is a long-run mandate, and we need to go oh so carefully now to become less   accommodative, because otherwise we may face the risk of adverse long-term consequences   My view is that the situation we’re coming out of was, in part at least and perhaps   significantly, related to a period in which we kept rates very low in this world of uncertainty  So,   what is it we have here?  We have an outlook  There are tail risks; I recognize that  And we tend   to focus on those tail risks—they scare us to death, but that’s what we tend to do  However, the   economy is growing, and the outlook suggests further growth  That’s what we’ve all said—not   June 22–23, 2010 147 of 213             robust economic growth, but further growth  Inflation is modest, but our actions have effects on   resource flows as well, imbalances, and long-term stability, some of which President Bullard   referred to  Europe is a concern, and we need to keep our eye on it and be prepared to act, of   course  But it should not drive our decisions today  Asia is actually stronger and is a positive   factor that we ought to take into consideration   So I think it’s very important that we take this “extended period” language out, that we   open up the possibility of selling assets as the economy evolves  Taking the language out   doesn’t mean we increase the funds rate  I know it may have an implied tightening effect, but I   think, with the right explanation, that opening up our options is something we have to think   about very carefully  As I said at the last meeting, we ought to begin to talk about a strategy   going forward  Yes, that would take away this very significant accommodation  I believe there   are consequences to maintaining the accommodating, and that’s my major concern  Thank you   very much  "
9033,2010-08-10,HOENIG,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  In this go-around, I’d like to expand my   remarks a bit, but I will speak more briefly in the policy go-around   I want to turn from some of the short-run data and projections that we all bring to this   table and talk about some of the longer-run considerations that I think we need to be very careful   about  I understand that we can look at data from different perspectives and reach different   conclusions  So, while I offer these comments with some conviction, I also do so with humility,   because no one can predict the future, and because the past isn’t necessarily an indicator of the   future itself   I hear some familiar themes as I listen to the discussion around this table and the   discussions in the media and among the market experts, and here are some of them  We’re in the   era of new “normal” in which we’ll have high unemployment and low income growth, and   therefore, interest rates must remain at zero indefinitely; deflation is a serious threat, something   to be avoided at nearly all costs; I read in the Wall Street Journal that today’s meeting will focus   on the need for the Fed to do more, including the purchase of long-term securities; and I’m told   that we could be entering the next depression as the economy fails to gain traction   I agree that the economic conditions are far from what any of us want—certainly we want   a stronger recovery  But what are the long-term implications of doing more, or even of   maintaining the current level of monetary stimulus?  Can we actually improve the economy   faster by keeping rates at zero, or are we perhaps adding to the uncertainty by taking actions that   are, in my opinion, unsustainable in the intermediate and long run?  Are we, in fact, damaging   the long-run economy, as our last experiment with low rates, in my opinion, might have done?  I   August 10, 2010 49 of 160             think one can make a good case, using the same data, to show that we need to change our stance   on policy   In one sense, I think it’s interesting that some members of the FOMC and others are   constantly in fear of deflation  I would point out that the consumer price index was a mere 18 in   1945, 172 at the start of this millennium, and today is at 219, and not once during that period   have we had a sustained decline in prices   In setting forth my case further, let me make some specific points  First, I would note   that the recovery is proceeding as outlined earlier this year by many  It’s a modest recovery with   mixed results that is likely to continue with a growth rate of somewhere around 3 percent or,   perhaps, a little less going forward  Month-to-month data are mixed—some positive, some   negative—as is typical in recoveries  For example, industrial production was negative 03 in   April, plus 13 in May, and plus 01 in June, and orders for nondefense capital goods, excluding   aircraft, were roughly minus 3 percent in April but almost 5 percent to the positive in May, and   positive 6 percent in June; factory orders were up slightly in April, down in May, down again in   June; durable goods orders were down in June after increasing almost 3 percent in April, and   corporate profits have been increasing consistently month to month  While monthly data have   been mixed, as this demonstrates, the trend data have been consistently positive  Private job   growth has been less than hoped for, perhaps, but, importantly, it has been positive  Private   payrolls have increased by 630,000 since January 1  This is a better pace of recovery than we   saw at this point in the prior two recoveries; admittedly, we went deeper this time  Regarding   labor, in the first half of the year we saw increases in all of the components of labor income   hours worked, employment, and wages  Hours worked have risen more rapidly than   employment, which is typical for the early stages of an economic recovery  Personal income   August 10, 2010 50 of 160             growth is at 23 percent since the second quarter of 2009  Consumption is up 16 percent since   the second quarter  Investment is up almost 15 percent  Industrial production is up more than   8 percent year over year  High-tech production is up 20 percent  Corporate profits are up   57 percent since the fourth quarter of 2008  Housing is up by 03 percent and, I hope, stabilizing    My point is that the economy is recovering, and, barring specific shocks and bad policy, it should   continue to grow over the next several quarters   My second point is that the financial and economic shocks we’ve experienced did not just   come out of nowhere  They followed years of low interest rates, high and increasing leverage,   and overly lax financial supervision, as prescribed by both Democratic and Republican   administrations  In judging how we approach this recovery, it seems to me that we’re repeating   the same policy patterns that followed the recessions of 1990–1991, and 2001; because of the   uncertainty of the strength of the recovery and our intense desire to avoid a recession, we are in   danger of leaving rates too low too long and of allowing supervision to be more lax than we had   originally intended, as witnessed by recent Basel capital agreements   Here are some other facts I’d like to share about the period from 1991 to 2008  The real   fed funds rate averaged 16 percent from 1991 to 1995, 037 percent from 2001 to 2005, and   minus 1 percent from 2008 to the present, hardly a tight monetary policy environment  Gross   federal debt increased from 60 percent of nominal GDP to 75 percent  Consumer debt increased   from 62 percent to almost 100 percent of nominal GDP  Nonfinancial debt increased from about   186 percent of GDP at the start of the decade to 225 percent by December of 2008  Between   1993 and 2007, the average leverage of the 20 largest financial institutions of the United States—  total assets to tangible equity capital—increased from 18 to more than 25 and reached a high of   31  We increased our debt to the rest of the world dramatically, as well, from about 5 percent to   August 10, 2010 51 of 160             25 percent of nominal GDP  The effects of these trends in our economy, encouraged by what I   think is accommodative policy, have been significant and stressful  They will not be overcome   quickly, and the continued use of zero interest rate will only add the risk to the longer-run   outlook   My third point is that, with a clear policy path towards less highly accommodative policy,   financial deleveraging will, or should, evolve slowly, and many of the remaining economic   imbalances will rebalance  Under such circumstances, the economy will expand at a sustainable   moderate pace with similar, that is, moderate, job growth  There may be other ways to accelerate   GDP growth, but it’s not through highly expansionary monetary policy   Let’s talk about the consumer  Consumption as a percent of GDP for decades was around   63 percent  During the strong boom period, it was nearly 70 percent  Consumption most likely   will return to historical levels, which are also, perhaps, more sustainable  Thus, the consumer   will contribute to growth but is unlikely to be part of its intensification  To provide another   perspective, personal saving declined from nearly 10 percent of disposable income in 1985 to   less than 2 percent in 2007  It’s now closer to 6 percent—better in many ways, but still below   historic norms  Assuming it stabilizes where it is and personal income grows as it has so far,   then it will be, I think, a positive factor in the economy’s growth, but not a factor that causes it to   accelerate   Now to businesses  Profits are improving  Balance sheets for the nonfinancial sector are   rebalancing and strengthening and seem able to support investment growth as confidence   rebuilds  Although credit supply and demand may be an issue impeding the recovery to some   extent, a shortage of monetary stimulus is not the issue   August 10, 2010 52 of 160             Federal government deficits, state government debt burdens, and uncertain tax programs   surely are risks to recovery, and increased business uncertainty will inhibit the recovery in   important ways, but they are not new to the US and, by themselves, should not cause a double-   dip recession unless they go unaddressed   If, in an attempt to bring fuel to this recovery, a zero rate of interest is continued, it’s   likely to bring its own unintended consequences and add its own source of uncertainty  The zero   policy rate during a crisis is understandable, but a zero rate after a year of recovery actually gives   legitimacy to questions about the sustainability of the recovery  It feeds the alarmists, and it   breeds uncertainty and fear   Fourth, the media and markets should not be so influential  When mixed data are   reported as systematically negative results and the more positive long-run trends fail to be   acknowledged, it’s an invitation to hasty action  The Committee must be careful not to get   caught up in that moment and must, instead, look to the long run  I will note that, in its first year,   this recovery saw GDP growth average about 32 percent  The GDP growth rate of the 1991   recovery was 26 percent, and for the 2001 recovery, it was 192 percent  Now, this has been a   deeper recession, of course   I have one final reminder  I went back and looked at news files and other comments from   the spring and summer of 2003, just before the federal funds rate was lowered to 1 percent,   where it remained until 2004  Let me give you just a few samples of what I found  One person   noted that the Federal Reserve Board recently warned that America faces a risk of deflation;   Japan has been suffering from it for more than a decade; Europe may be heading toward it; the   entire world economy could succumb to it; this could be the first round in a deflationary cycle    More examples  The Commerce Department reports orders of US factory supplies down   August 10, 2010 53 of 160             29 percent in April from March, the largest decline in 17 months; with fewer jobs and stagnant   wages, Americans won’t be able to buy enough to keep the economy going  I’ll stop with this   last one  On the surface, one can make the case that the Fed doesn’t have to do anything at all,   because interest rates are incredibly low; still, the Fed will not sit on its hands—its motivation is   to avoid deflation; another rate cut, even of ½  percentage point, doesn’t guarantee that there   won’t be an economic collapse, but it makes that collapse less likely, and, hence, we get the   notion of a rate cut as insurance policy—as insurance, a rate cut is pretty cheap, it says; lower   rates aren’t going to trigger a burst of inflation, and if they did give the economy an extra boost,   well, who’s going to complain about that?  The following quarter, real GDP expanded at an   annual rate of nearly 7 percent, and still rates were left at 1 percent until credit began to expand   significantly, and until the stage was set for one of, if I may say, the worst economic events since   the Great Depression   My view, Mr Chairman, is that it was one very expensive insurance premium    Unemployment today is 9½ percent  I think that, had we been more patient during that   deflationary discussion, had we not lowered the rate to 1 percent, perhaps, and kept it there, we   would have been far better today  Now, I fully acknowledge that I was on the Committee at that   time, but I certainly feel I learned some lessons from that experience  Therefore, I once again   suggest that the recent financial crisis and recession were not caused by high interest rates but by   rates that were left low for a considerable period  As a Committee, the FOMC chose that short-  run need over some of the longer-run risk that we again face  I think the Great Depression of the   1930s was a traumatic event  I agree that we need to be aware of its lessons, and we need to   avoid its mistakes  But in doing so, let’s not forget other lessons  We will not and should not   August 10, 2010 54 of 160             double our reserve requirements as we did then, and, more recently, the great inflation of the   1970s should be remembered and, of course, the crisis of 2008  Thank you    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I obviously would prefer something closer to   option C  I don’t see it on the table, so I won’t wordsmith it  I would just say that the economy   is improving—we keep saying that  I believe that if we allow ourselves to think far enough   ahead, we can follow my proposal and explain to the public that we’re leaving policy highly   accommodative but away from zero; that is, it would be 1 percent over a period, then a pause   while we see how the economy is doing, and so on  I think we can do it without shocking the   economy or the public  To ease policy in an improving economy, as we are proposing here, is, I   think, unwise   August 10, 2010 119 of 160             And I do not support rolling over principal payments into Treasuries or anything else    We have an opportunity to allow our extraordinary easing policy from an earlier period to   decline gradually on its own, without major disruptions to the market, and we’re passing that   opportunity up with the view that we’re taking out an insurance policy  But I think of it more as   planting the seeds of a briar patch that we will have to deal with not a year from now, but three   or four years from now, as we have in the past  So I very much oppose this policy  "
9058,2010-09-21,HOENIG,"  So moved    Thank you, Mr Chairman  My views have not changed from our last   meeting, and I will try to be brief  What I might do is give you a perspective on our region   through some anecdotal information that I think is germane  I’ll start by saying that, from   anyone’s perspective, monetary policy is not on the sidelines  Monetary policy is highly   accommodative  In talking with bankers in the region, from regional institutions down to the   smaller ones, they’re saying, “We have more deposits than we can deploy  Liquidity is not an   issue for us”  One quipped to me that his largest nonperforming asset was his fed funds sold  He   can’t deploy this stuff  From his point of view, our monetary policy is not the issue     This situation is showing up in other ways  We’re seeing a lot of pickup in activity, as   I’ve said before, in farmland  Properties that were expected to go for maybe $4,000 an acre are   clearing $6,000 and above  Some that were in lower-quality areas that should be selling for as   little as $1,000 an acre are selling for twice that  The loans on that—and here’s where I get   worried—are 80 percent of the value of the sale price  You say to the lender, “Well, aren’t you   worried about that?”  And he says, “Well, others are making the loan  The credit system is   active” So we’re seeing a lot of lending activity out there that is looking to deploy money   The other thing—and we have verified this in some of the data—is that, as they look for   yield, a lot of these banks are under pressure to go longer in their maturity structure, on their   government securities  If you look at the average length of maturity, it’s going out, so that   they’re taking on more risk as they look for some form of yield going forward  And I think it’s   building its own unintended consequences in the long run, if this were to continue  In talking   with some of our regional companies, ones that are non-investment-grade, they’re finding   financing plentiful, especially if they have a strong balance sheet and good audit  So they’re not   looking for financing   September 21, 2010 50 of 151             One of the largest temp companies in our region, which is national in scope, says people   are turning to temp help because of the uncertainty  Its sales volume on temp help is up   50 percent again since the first of the year—it was up 50 percent since the middle of last year,   towards the end, and now it’s up again  It could put more people to work, but the people who are   on unemployment will not come off it for those more modest wages, and that’s impeding some   of the sales that it would otherwise have   So when you look at these developments, our District is continuing to grow modestly  It   is not booming, it is not moving fast  The strong areas are agriculture and energy, but around   that the rest of it is steadily up and going forward   My outlook for the national economy is similar—steady, modest economic growth  I   think that’s really quite encouraging when you think of the amount of adjustments that are taking   place in the economy—the deleveraging that had to occur and the risks to the outlook in terms of   the uncertainties that have been discussed by others  We are really on a fairly good path, and, in   that context, monetary policy is highly accommodative in facilitating that process  Thank you    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I must tell you that I do agree with you on   one thing  [Laughter]  I think we should have a discussion around regime change, if we’re   moving that way  Alternative B strikes me as moving towards a new regime, and some of the   other discussions seemed to take that direction, and I think it would be healthy to have a   conversation before we get too far  I’ll come back to that in just a second   In listening to this discussion, it reminds me that we are a central planning organization,   for monetary policy We come here; we discuss monetary policy for the nation  And one of my   fears is that, as a central planner, we think we can do more than we can  That really bothers me   I know people don’t all agree with this, but, again, I think the crisis we’ve just suffered   was not caused by high interest rates or accelerating interest rates, but by an extended period of   exceptionally low interest rates when unemployment was 65 percent and we were afraid it was   too high   I think we have to be modest about what we can do  I am not arguing for high interest   rates at all—I never have been  I am arguing for getting off of zero, getting away from thinking   that if we only added another trillion dollars of high-powered money, everything would be okay    It won’t  There are other things going on in this economy that have to adjust, are adjusting, and   we want to mitigate the consequences of that, but we can’t solve all of those problems  For that   September 21, 2010 105 of 151             reason, as I’ve said in other meetings, I judge that it is not appropriate to indicate that the   economic and financial conditions warrant basically a zero interest rate and to guarantee that the   fed funds rate will be zero for an extended period of time  I think the “extended period”   language tells the market and businesses that after a year of recovery, it is not sustainable  I   think we’re telling them that, and they’re acting accordingly   Also, there’s the issue of a commitment to zero rates over time  Zero rates, like any rates,   are allocative mechanisms, and they lead to future imbalances and increases in the risks for our   long-term macroeconomic and financial stability  That’s part of our mandate—longer-run   performance, not just performance today  We need to put bounds around ourselves, so that we   don’t give in to that temptation to think that if we only do more, everything will be okay  The   economy is continuing to recover modestly, as most of us anticipated from the beginning    Maybe it’s more modest than we would like, but, still, it’s recovering systematically   I believe that we should take a longer-run perspective and allow our balance sheet to   decline gradually as mortgage-backed securities are redeemed rather than continuing to make   Treasury purchases to keep the size of our asset holdings constant and encourage banks and   others to take on the risk of longer-term instruments  Banks are extending their maturities now,   because we’ve given them this guarantee of lower rates for an extended period  There are going   to be consequences from that     Of the statements and the alternatives offered, again, I prefer C   But, even in this   instance, I prefer it only as long as it is interpreted, as Bill said, as signaling that we would soon   end our investment in maturing mortgage-backed assets  Otherwise I find the statement not   acceptable  I realize the implications of that for the markets, and, therefore, I would start with   September 21, 2010 106 of 151             just removing the “extended period” language—nothing else—because I think it would signal   that we’re more confident in the economy, and I think that would be helpful   I object to alternative B not only because it continues our commitment to zero rates, but   also because it, in effect, eases policy further by heightening the expectation of additional asset   purchases in November  It just signals to the market that’s what we’re going to do, and,   therefore, it will react accordingly  I would be especially concerned with a policy statement like   alternative A1 that elevates our inflation goal and could be seen as establishing the Federal   Reserve as an inflation targeter when we’ve really not discussed that adequately  At this point,   the crisis should have taught us that we need to increase our emphasis on longer-run   macroeconomic and financial stability and not just on inflation goals  We have allocative   effects, and I think we should be very, very mindful of that  Thank you, Mr Chairman  "
9080,2010-10-15,HOENIG,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I, too, have to thank the staff for putting these   memos together  They were well done and interesting and helpful  They are, by necessity,   however, somewhat asymmetric in terms of the actions that they outline, because they read as if   further action is pretty much in train, and there’s no acknowledgement of how you move in and out   of this and what the effects of doing so will be  And that leaves me a little uneasy   October 15, 2010 31 of 62             I would prefer to view the memos as laying out a contingency plan should we reencounter a   crisis when we are constrained by the zero lower bound  As a contingency plan, we develop the   elements in a comprehensive manner, looking at our targets, potential instruments, our balance sheet   size and composition, and looking, if you will, at conditions in the market  For example, if there   were another financial crisis, I could, perhaps, support a “shock and awe” policy of quantitative   easing  As a contingency plan, though, I believe we need to keep asset purchases in reserve and not   get them out as an operating tool  As Charlie Bean said earlier this year, “…asset purchases aimed   at flattening the yield curve are probably best kept in a locker marked For Emergency Use Only”    Because in my opinion we are not in an emergency, I would reject introducing asset purchases at the   November meeting  I believe that, at this point, they would needlessly increase market uncertainty   about monetary policy, both in terms of our objectives and in terms of our operating procedures   Let me turn, then, to the discussion of how to specify the objectives for monetary policy    My obvious preference at this point is to maintain the status quo  The qualitative dual mandate   approach that is outlined in draft statement 1 is preferable for me  I’m not convinced that there   would be any significant benefit from providing anything more explicit than the estimates we   already provide of long-run values for inflation, growth, and unemployment  And there could be   significant costs if we go forward; for example, as others have mentioned, with respect to   quantitative long-run employment goal, I question whether we can estimate the current natural rate   of unemployment, much less what it might be in the long run  In addition, I am concerned that our   long-run objectives will be viewed as short-term to intermediate-term goals—and that could be too   confusing for many  Those objectives will be used to justify policy actions directed at the short to   medium run, rather than the medium to longer run that I prefer as our policy horizon   October 15, 2010 32 of 62             We need to be cognizant of the possibility that taking large action based on gaps between   current conditions and fixed long-run objectives may lead to undesirable asset price movements,   financial imbalances, and uncertainty  Such imbalances ultimately undermine our ability to achieve   our longer-run objectives in the first place  Acting aggressively based on these gaps may also lead   to significant overshooting of our ultimate objectives  A related concern is that such a framework   will make it harder for the Committee to continue using a risk-management strategy to address tail   risk  This is particularly important to me because I believe that maintaining our current policy is   likely to lead to imbalances and lower economic activity and higher inflation sometime down the   road  But I know that others may worry about deflationary risk  I also worry whether we would be   happy with an explicit objective when unemployment someday falls to 4½ percent with low   inflation  In that circumstance, would we really want to increase interest rates, or would we feel   compelled not to?   I have a few more comments regarding the various options for providing additional policy   accommodation  As I mentioned earlier, I view quantitative easing as an emergency tool rather than   a normal operating tool  However, given that this will be viewed as a new framework, let me   discuss a couple of other quantitative easing concerns  I understand that asset purchases would   lower long-term rates to some degree, but I think the effect would be relatively small  For example,   we have a zero interest rate today and significant quantitative easing already in place  With this   degree of stimulus, in time this 96 percent unemployment rate will decline towards the natural rate    I would suggest that adding stimulus now will have a marginal impact on accelerating this decline   in the unemployment rate, as much as we would like to force it down, and, in doing so, it also may   invite negative consequences that we cannot ignore  We’ve talked about those negative   consequences—the imbalances and the issues related to our independence—and I know that this   October 15, 2010 33 of 62             isn’t the time for discussing that  But I think we need to be mindful of those issues as we think   about quantitative easing as an operating tool   Another issue that needs to be considered before adopting this framework is a clear   statement of our exit strategy  While I agree that the tools to reduce excess reserves are available,   we haven’t really talked about how they would be used  We also haven’t talked about what the   impacts would be, and I think that’s very important to do also  The Federal Reserve just doesn’t   have a good track record of withdrawing policy accommodation in a timely manner  In addition,   without a clear exit strategy, and with decisions made by a Committee, the natural tendency is and   will be to maintain an accommodative policy longer than we think we will now, as has been the   case in the past   These are some of the concerns I have about adopting this as a framework  I think it’s   something we need to be very mindful of going forward  As far as other points are concerned, such   as press conferences and so forth, I don’t have any problem with those  But that’s not where my   main concerns lie  Thank you, Mr Chairman  "
9101,2010-11-02,HOENIG,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  One of the difficult things behind all three of   these, I think, is that when we speak with individuals off the record, no one knows exactly what   was said  We also get into this issue of signaling with what is done off the record, and that binds   us and puts us all in an awkward position going forward   I think that if we don’t address that issue, the other issues will still stay confusing  For   example, by asking different people questions off the record, they get what they think is a signal    And that puts others in the position of having to speak on the record to modify things and say,   “Well, that may not actually be the case,” and so forth  So I think that’s a major issue to   consider  Thank you    Oh, I have one other thing I was going to say  On the second issue you   raised, I think President Fisher was referring to the idea that some people advertise themselves as   in a consultancy role to the Fed, and that’s an issue that’s becoming more predominant  I had   correspondence with, I think, the same individual that President Fisher did, and he also asserted   that he was the 19th or 18th member of the FOMC, very important, and so on and so forth  So   how we put strictures on those from whom we get information that we need is a very important   consideration as well    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I will start with the national outlook and   speak the obvious, because it has been talked about here already  The recovery continues to   improve steadily, even though we are undergoing some pretty major rebalancing—and those   have to see their way through, as I have said before  But over time I do expect the expansion to   pick up, with GDP rising slowly but steadily from its current level as the recovery gains some   momentum   Since the end of last year, consumer spending on durable goods has risen nearly   6 percent, and industrial production is up nearly 5½ percent  Since December, the economy has   November 2–3, 2010 42 of 238             added 860,000 private-sector jobs  That is not a level that anyone is satisfied with, but it is   positive, and it is moving forward  More to the point, temporary jobs are growing fairly   robustly   The inflation outlook, obviously, remains low in the near term, but I suspect over time   that it will increase as demand picks up and as our monetary policy has its effect  We see that in   commodity prices today, and I think we can anticipate it somewhat in the declining value of the   dollar  We did talk with some of those who do the Blue Chip survey, and, for the first time, they   do have a 100 percent positive response that the FOMC will engage in quantitative easing at this   meeting, which is fairly significant from that survey’s point of view   Let me turn just briefly to the District economy and say that conditions in our region are   certainly consistent with developments at the national level  The District economy is growing at   a moderate pace, with a little bit of variance among the states, because those states with   relatively large energy or agriculture sectors are doing the best and remain the strongest  District   energy firms have extended the expansion in hiring and capital spending that started this year    They’re shifting employment from natural gas to higher-priced crude oil, and that shift is going   fairly rapidly right now  In some areas in energy, in that sense, there’s a real boom going on in   our region   In agriculture, obviously, we’re seeing a big crop, and high crop prices have spurred a lot   of further increases in capital spending and gains in farmland values  Again, we’re seeing   farmland auctions move up to where fairly good land in parts of our region and in parts of Iowa   are being auctioned off at better than $8,000 an acre, which is a pretty dramatic increase over the   last year  One of our contacts, who is in a widely diversified multinational company, has   observed that the company’s businesses are seeing strong growth in a number of places around   November 2–3, 2010 43 of 238             the world, especially Asia, and also noted that conditions in Europe are stronger than expected   last spring  One interesting indicator of economic activity the contact mentioned is the usage of   diesel and jet fuel, especially in their Alaska operations, which is fairly large because of the   traffic between here and Asia  It’s up in the last quarter about 30 percent in terms of the traffic   that is going back and forth   Contacts noted that companies with access to capital markets have all the money they can   use  The cash-accumulating firms were seeking places to deploy it, with many choosing to   invest abroad rather than in the United States, and we heard something similar today from   Nathan  They noted that today’s market provides a solid spread for borrowing at low rates in the   United States and investing elsewhere, and they’re doing it at a fairly significant pace and level    One contact acknowledged that access to capital was not an issue for his firm, its 20,000   customers, or its competitors  And, to avoid bad business decisions otherwise encouraged by   ready access to cheap money, his company has implemented an interest rate floor for internal use   of capital, well above the firm’s unusually low cost of funds, and that is global   Finally, I will just say that business contacts that we have talked to around our region   generally agree that an exceptionally uncertain business climate—particularly around health-care   costs, tax policy, and environmental issues—is a major concern for them and has caused them to   hold back  Otherwise, they are kind of waiting in the wings to see how things go, and they   certainly do have the capital and wherewithal to move forward when they choose to do so    Thank you    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Today I know the Committee will adopt   some version of alternative B as it goes through this process  The markets are, as I said   yesterday, 100 percent certain, and so am I  And Bill English has appropriately outlined the   market’s reaction should we fail to act on alternative B, and that’s unfortunate and unpersuasive   to me   I acknowledge that we all want what is best  Certainly I do, and so I hope the Committee   is correct and that I’m wrong  I strongly disagree with the course being charted here today  The   Committee takes this action expecting it will incent portfolio adjustments, thus changing relative   prices and somehow spurring aggregate demand  This will stimulate gross domestic product and   reduce unemployment, as we pursue maximum employment; support higher but stable inflation;   support lower but stable long-run interest rates; and support stable long-run growth—all   desirable outcomes  I, in contrast, see other outcomes, and they’re not unprecedented  We have   experienced them here recently  They’re long-run consequences  We may see some short-run   improvement, but not long run  There will be, I’m sure, in the end, a lot of givebacks    Experience tells us that   November 2–3, 2010 157 of 238             This course sows the seeds of instability, in my opinion  We’ll get more portfolio   adjustments  We’ll get, I think, portfolio distortions  We may get some stimulus, but we’ll also   get asset price inflation  And we’ll get higher longer-term inflation expectations in time as we   continue on this course  We’ll have more fragile, less stable GDP growth, and more fragile, less   stable employment in the future, even though we may get some temporary reductions in   unemployment  The economy is undergoing major and unavoidable rebalancings from past   actions  That includes the deleveraging of consumers and financial institutions encouraged by a   period of very low interest rates  Even though we are going through these adjustments, the   economy is expanding     For reasons I have given in prior meetings this year, I believe our funds rate target should   be low but not zero, to encourage a better resource allocation than zero will get us  Still, I clearly   do not agree that we should undertake another LSAP  In the most general terms, the purported   benefits are small and the risks are large, and I’ll outline three that are of particular concern to   me  And I’ll state that my overall concern focuses on the longer-run effects of well-intentioned   short-term actions, the accumulation of small effects that will eventually lead to problems   First, without clear objectives, we’re likely to keep the funds rate too low and our balance   sheet too large, leading to further misallocations of resources and more imbalances down the   road  Notice that I have said nothing yet about inflation  Under an LSAP program, would we   continue asset purchases until the unemployment rate is 9 percent, or maybe 8 percent, or maybe   less?  Would we continue until near-term inflation rates climb to 2 percent or 3 percent, so we   get an average rate that we would like?  Would we aim to reduce the 10-year Treasury rate to   2¼ percent, or maybe 2 percent, or less?  We will chase an open-ended commitment, I think,   over time that introduces additional uncertainty and volatility into an already chronically   November 2–3, 2010 158 of 238             uncertain business environment  Also, I agree that the tools are available, as has been pointed   out here, to reduce excess reserves when the time is appropriate  I do not believe that we will act   at the right time or at the right speed—that’s our practice—because the Federal Reserve doesn’t   have a good track record of withdrawing policy accommodation in a timely manner, no matter   how much we say we will   Second, we risk undermining the Federal Reserve’s independence, in my opinion  When   we are a ready buyer of government debt, we become a convenient source of cash for fiscal   programs  During a crisis, that may be justified, but as a policy instrument, during normal or   recovering times, it is a very dangerous precedent  Moreover, by purchasing $600 billion of   Treasury securities, with the projected 2011 budget deficit of $1 trillion, we appear—and I use   that word advisedly—to be monetizing more than half the deficit   Third, I think adopting another LSAP program risks over time letting inflation   expectations become unanchored, no matter our admonitions to the contrary, thereby   undermining our credibility  One of the objectives is to raise inflation in the near term while   maintaining longer-run inflation expectations at about 2 percent  That’s a policy that amounts to   fine-tuning inflation expectations—a variable we cannot precisely or accurately measure—and it   could easily lead to greater uncertainty and volatility and untimely higher inflation expectations    Moreover, with the balance sheet approaching $3 trillion, we risk undermining the public’s   confidence in our commitment to long-run price stability, as well as contributing to inflationary   expectations becoming unanchored and encouraging speculative investments—that’s almost   certain  I believe that, by monetizing the deficit and by having long-run inflation expectations   rising more than planned, we risk undermining our credibility as a central bank  In time, we   November 2–3, 2010 159 of 238             could see longer-term Treasury rates rise rather than fall, thereby negating one of the purported   benefits of the policy   While I agree that unemployment is too high, I do not agree that inflation is too low or   that there is a serious risk of deflation  Moreover, since the economy is recovering, it is most   likely that the maintenance of the exceptionally accommodative policy rate that we have had so   far will lead, over time, to moving our economy forward  If we ease further, or if we leave the   accommodation there too long, we will overshoot, and that’s not consistent with our long-run   mandates  Thank you, Mr Chairman  "
9127,2010-12-14,HOENIG,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Our District is growing and is similar to the   nation in many, many ways  Our manufacturing sector has picked up  Our retailers are also   seeing a pretty good season so far this year, and the responses we get are that things are steady or   improving or improving nicely—those kinds of descriptors   Two areas in our region, of course, are doing quite well  One is energy, and the other is   agriculture  Energy is quite brisk  They’re switching their activities from natural gas into oil    We’re seeing many more efforts to bring oil out of the ground in the region, and that has put   forward a little bit of a mini boom in parts of our region, which are actually expanding   December 14, 2010 46 of 127             In terms of agriculture, this is now what I would refer to as a boom  We’re seeing strong   global demand; obviously there have been some shortages  Prices are moving up  Commodity   prices are moving up well, and farmland values are continuing to climb rapidly  Across much of   our area—and I think nationally as well—we are seeing substantial increases in land values over   a year ago  In our area, the increase has been about 10 percent from a year ago, although   obviously, it varies with the quality of the land  That’s a 60 percent increase since 2005  Ratios   of land values to rents—that’s like a price-earnings ratio for us—in some parts of our region are   now at 25, which surpasses the previous high in the 1970s  The high value-to-rent ratio implies a   pretty low cap rate; based on what you assume about continued cash flows coming off that, the   cap rates move back down to around 3 percent  When you speak with these individuals about   their choices, they say, “It’s a lot better than what I can get at a bank,” and they certainly don’t   want to go into the stock market  So there’s momentum   The next question is  Who’s lending on this stuff?  Of course, banks are or the Farm   Credit System, and, at the margin on the properties that are selling, they’re lending about   70 percent of value, which is an accelerated value  They’re saying that’s not a problem because   they’re spreading that against other properties owned, but of course, all the properties are going   up  So you get the signal that the loan-to-value ratios are still very modest  That’s because, of   course, you’re moving the values up as you move the loan  So they are increasing their debt   carry, and they are assuming not the highest prices in the commodities, but what they think is a   good estimate of an average, which is much higher than historical levels  So, what do we tell our   examiners?  Do you look at land values of five years ago and say “this is too big a loan on it” and   get the blowback from that?  You probably won’t  So this is going to continue to build, I   suspect, over time, and it’s a worry of mine   December 14, 2010 47 of 127             Now, this is only one sector, I realize  My question is, given that we’re trying to affect   asset values, what other assets might we be affecting through our current policies?  The point is   that the national economy and the local economy are improving only modestly  I see inflation   also as very low right now and increasing very modestly over time  But there is an allocation   effect now going on as there is an asset value effect that’s going on in different segments of the   economy  I think we should be mindful of that this time around  Thank you    Thank you, Mr Chairman  As I listened to the discussions today during   the first go-round, it does appear that many have revised up their forecast, as I have  I also   expect inflation, as others have said, to start low, but I do expect it to increase slowly over time    I join those who would like to see immediate stronger growth and lower unemployment  I   continue to judge that additional monetary stimulus carries more long-term risk than short-term   advantage to our economy   The economy is undergoing a major and necessary rebalancing that includes the   deleveraging of consumers, financial institutions, and state and local governments  The process   will take time, and shortcuts are costly  With the amount of stimulus in place and the extended   size of our combined balance sheets, the effect on expectations, confidence, and asset prices will   be significant once we initiate or hint at initiating an exit involving even the most modest steps   from our current highly, in my opinion, accommodative policy  Thus, the process of exit from   an accommodative policy will be a major challenge, far more so than we’re willing to   acknowledge today, in my opinion  It starts from the very fact that we are easing into an   improving economy because unemployment is too high  Then there would be the obvious   concern that, as we start to raise interest rates, the initial downward effect on asset prices and   December 14, 2010 90 of 127             financial activity will be outsized  The markets will despair  As a result, I suspect pressure for   the Committee to delay its exit from current policy will be significant   I suspect the challenge will only increase for the Committee going forward from here    I’m already hearing today that we can’t change because we’ve set this path for ourselves  The   funds rate is near zero  Our balance sheet is growing, approaching $3 trillion, and excess   reserves are approaching $15 trillion  Accordingly, the longer the Committee delays in   preparing for exit, the greater the difficulty of doing so in a timely manner, increasing   systematically the likelihood that it will inadvertently invite future imbalances in inflation   impulses because of the delay   Mr Chairman, you mentioned 2003, and I remember it well  We talked a lot about not   wanting a repeat of Japan, being afraid of deflation and not having enough inflation  So the   Committee delayed, held back  Unemployment was too high at that time, at 6½ percent  I worry   about our focus on unemployment even though I’m as concerned about it as you are   And when we exit, we’ll require time, I realize  Nonetheless, we should begin that long   process now  We first should adjust talk of the need for further monetary stimulus  We should   indicate that sufficient stimulus is in place to attain over time long-run potential growth for the   economy  It won’t come quickly, but it will come  We also need to reopen our dialogue about   an exit strategy so that we don’t shock the market as we move forward from here   Of the options presented, I would take some combination of C and D, but I won’t go into   that, because I know that’s not on the table today  But I will, in summary, say that I believe that   our current highly accommodative monetary policy is inconsistent with our long-run mandate in   an economy that is recovering and shifting from transitory, I think, to sustained sources of   growth and picking up some speed  To maintain such a highly accommodative policy in this   December 14, 2010 91 of 127             economic environment increases the risk of imbalances developing in the longer term and the   risk of longer-term inflation expectations necessarily rising over time   We need to begin shifting our language to regain policy flexibility and avoid locking   ourselves deeper into a long-term policy position that is becoming in my opinion, of course,   increasingly difficult to reverse in a timely fashion with each additional step over the next six   months  Thank you  "
9153,2011-01-25,HOENIG,"  My thought is a little different I don’t get too confused on what I can   say about data and what it may mean  But when I read articles in the paper that say, “Inside the   FOMC there were discussions, and so-and-so said this and so-and-so said that,” to me, that’s an   obvious a violation  In that case, you might call for a review or an investigation—whatever word   you want to use    Right  It’s usually a judgment call, but the clear indicators are when they   start going inside the meeting and saying, “This was discussed,” and, “here’s where so-and-so or   such-and-such came out”  I think that’s where you get the issues    Thank you, Mr Chairman  My outlook for the District economy is very   similar to that for the US economy  We expect improvements, as others have said and others   will say around the table  Therefore, I’d like to  spend just a few minutes, if you will, being like   a “broken record” again and focusing on asset values and some of the things that I see coming   and some of the things that I am worried about from a broad perspective   Certainly, we have seen and discussed higher commodity prices, but we’ve also seen   lower interest rates and lower exchange rates, which have fueled a surge in farmland values   nationally, not just in my District, raising concerns for me about inflation in asset values in   agricultural real estate markets  Since June, for example, grain prices have doubled, and futures   markets suggest that prices could remain elevated through 2014, but historically low interest   rates and low cap rates are needed to justify the current farmland values that we’re seeing across   the country  By the beginning of 2010, US farmland values had risen more than 25 percent   from their 2005 levels, lifting the total value of US farmland to north of $2 trillion  Over the   January 25–26, 2011 96 of 282              past year, farmland values have posted double-digit gains, with additional gains expected in   2011  While farm operators own the majority of US farmland, nonfarm investors are buying   more land now; according to a recent survey by Iowa State University, investors accounted for   about a quarter of Iowa’s farmland sales  Low interest rates, which have pushed capitalization   rates down, contributed to the recent spike in farmland values as one asset class  And I use   farmland as an example, because other asset classes are being affected as well   Capitalization rates on US farmlands have fluctuated over time, falling in periods of   negative real interest rates, like the 1970s and the 2000s, and rising during periods of higher real   rates, like the 1980s  According to the USDA data, for example, Nebraska’s capitalization rate   on cropland was 51 percent at the beginning of 2010, well below its historical average of   7½ percent  Despite regional variation, capitalization rates on farmland values have fallen to   record lows across the nation, with rates below 5 percent in almost all states  Oklahoma and   Texas have lower capitalization rates due to mineral rights, inflating land values even further   Given the low cap rates, farmland values face significant interest rate risk  For example,   irrigated cropland in eastern Nebraska is valued at about $5,000 per acre  A historically low   capitalization rate of 5 percent is needed to rationalize this land value at current corn prices and   yields  If interest rates were to rise and lift cap rates to their historical average of 7½ percent, the   capitalized value of irrigated farmland in eastern Nebraska would fall by a third, to $3,300 an   acre  If cap rates were to rise to 10 percent, as they did during the 1980s farm crisis, land values   could drop by half  Additional analysis suggests that other regions face similar kinds of effects    Rising interest rates could also cut farmland values by reducing farm revenues  Historically,   higher interest rates tend to raise exchange rates, thus limiting agriculture exports—even though   January 25–26, 2011 97 of 282              we do have strong global demand right now—which, in turn, depresses commodity prices and   farm revenues   In 1981, the spike in real interest rates led to higher exchange rates and contributed to   lower agricultural exports  Exports, commodity prices, and farm revenues dropped, which   pushed farmland values to their 1985 lows  If a similar event occurred today, farmland values   could fall  For example, if cap rates return to their historical average and corn prices drop to just   $4 a bushel, which was the 2009 average, irrigated land values in eastern Nebraska would fall by   almost 50 percent, to $2,700 per acre  Other regions face similar risks  In sum, rising interest   rates could trigger a sharp decline in farmland values   Yesterday we talked about asset values for commercial and residential real estate, and I   understand that situation  But I’m also thinking about the future and what values we are going to   distort  About 450 community banks and regional banks across the country have high   concentration levels of agricultural loans—above 300 percent of their capital  That was the   commercial real estate kickoff for us  If you lower that threshold just a little, the number of   banks with those exposures increases  Some of the largest banks as well had agricultural loans   and land loans, but had pulled back from those  But as these values and this enthusiasm increase,   I think you’ll see those large banks go back into making land loans or other operating loans in   this sector  Also, the Farm Credit System announced this morning that they were reducing their   interest rates across the board by 35 basis points, because their profits are so good, their capital is   rebuilding, and they want to provide this interest rate benefit to borrowers, because demand is   back   My point is that we want to be thoughtful not just about the problems we have—and we   have plenty of them—but also about the problems we may be buying across a number of asset   January 25–26, 2011 98 of 282              classes  It’s the unintended consequences that I’m concerned about right now  Thank you very   much    Yes  In fact, our senior person in Kansas City is working with the folks   here at the Board  We’ve suggested that we need to be thinking about how we deal with these   banks on a national basis in terms of the underwriting standards that go with this situation  What   happens, of course, is that, when the asset values go up, the bank’s loan-to-value numbers go up,   and the bank feels very secure  But when developments start going the other way, the bank gets   caught below the line    Right  There are strong cash flows coming off their property right now    But there is a lot of financing of the land part  There are also a lot of   loan repayments, because the cash flows are so strong right now  But that’s my point  Things   are so good that you can move the price up, and then you are only borrowing 50 percent to 70   percent against it and assuming that the value will go up further  Of course, two or three years   from now, you will get caught behind, and that’s the thing we’re worried about as we share this    January 25–26, 2011 99 of 282               Absolutely    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Today we have talked about evidence that   the economy is growing at a more sustainable pace, and I certainly agree with that  I also see   further upside risk to current forecasts, as do the analysts in most of the recent Blue Chip   surveys, and I do think that the first paragraph in alternative C is more appropriate than the one   in alternative B  The economy is undergoing a major and necessary rebalancing  It is taking   place, and I think it is risky to try to accelerate that  We must be careful  The process takes   time   We should, therefore, begin to remove policy accommodation slowly to make it more   balanced as the economy rebalances  Obviously, an early challenge we face is to reduce the   large and growing level of excess reserves  I am not concerned with the ability of our reserve   draining tools  We have tested them, and I think they are sufficient  My greater concern is the   natural tendency of this Committee to delay the start of removing policy accommodation, leading   to new financial imbalances and longer-term inflationary pressures   January 25–26, 2011 174 of 282              I very much agree with President Kocherlakota, in that I think we should begin to think   about exit now, so that we can address it in a timely and systematic way  Bill English   commented today that if we change the language, we’ll upset the markets—I agree with that, and   we’re going to hear it over and over  That encourages us to delay our actions  But the longer we   delay, the greater will be the disruption, both expected and actual, to markets when we do move   to tighten  So we have to keep that in mind, and that’s why I think this analysis that President   Kocherlakota outlined is so important  The first step that we have to take will be to shift our   public statements from indicating a need for more monetary stimulus to indicating sufficient   stimulus is in place to attain our long-run goals of maximum employment and stable prices  I   won’t go into detail on the wording in the paragraphs, because I’ve already indicated that I agree   with looking at this longer term   I also want to discuss price targeting  My inclination is to favor it  Rather than calling it   a target of 2 percent or a bit less, we can talk about the central tendency of participants being   2 percent or a bit less  I know we think that’s the right thing, but I want to point out that this   crisis we just went through was not caused by missing our inflation target  It was caused by our   fear of deflation, which caused us to push real and nominal rates down for an extended period of   time, and that led to asset price bubbles and the consequences of their bursting  Therefore,   adopting an inflation target doesn’t mean we will not find ourselves causing other imbalances in   the future, unless we take a look at our policy as more than inflation targeting  I will end with   that  Thank you    Thank you, Mr Chairman  And thanks to the subcommittee—I really do   appreciate the work you’ve done on this  When these questions were circulated, it triggered my   memory, so I went back and looked at FRAM, and I think it may have the essence of what we   need  It’s a matter of what you want to formalize, because right now these are voluntary   January 25–26, 2011 199 of 282              guidelines  In paragraph 5 of FRAM it says senior officials “should strictly preserve the   confidentiality of System information that, if revealed, could benefit any person or impair the   effectiveness of System operations and policies”  I think formalizing that would put us all on   notice  The next one involves considering invitations to speak at meetings sponsored by profit-  making organizations  “Such officials should carefully weigh the public benefits likely to be   derived…against the possibility that their participation might afford such organizations a prestige   advantage over competitors”  I think that’s a good guideline for us to continue to follow    Paragraph 7 says, “In public speeches and relations with news media, senior officials should be   particularly mindful of”—and I will shorten this part to “conflicts”—“and, in addition, should   avoid statements that might suggest the nature of any monetary policy action that has not been   officially disclosed or that might confuse or mislead the public with respect to the monetary or   other policies of the System”  And the last paragraph I will mention is senior officials “should   feel free to express their personal views concerning questions of System or public interest, but   they should carefully consider whether their remarks might create public misunderstanding of the   System’s actions, or impair the effective formulation and implementation of System policies or   lessen the prestige of the System”   So we have much of what we were talking about, and it’s a matter of formalizing the   voluntary guidelines  I would be in favor of formalizing them first   Another issue is whether we make this public, so that everyone knows we’re on notice  I   think this is something we ought to consider, because then it not only puts us on notice, but it   also puts them on notice  I think that pretty much reflects my comments relative to the   questions  Thank you  "
9181,2011-03-15,HOENIG,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  To Nathan, I want to just suggest that when I   became a member of the FOMC, I had a friend give me a crystal ball to use, and over the years it   has done just about as well as our models  [Laughter]  So feel free, if it would be any help to   you   March 15, 2011 35 of 165              I’m going to focus on my District because the District is moving pretty much in parallel   with the nation, with a couple of exceptions, which I’ll mention  The District is continuing to   expand  It has since the last FOMC meeting in several areas  Our labor market is improving  In   fact, in some of the high-skilled areas, we’re seeing some indications of shortages  But other   than that, of course, we have a lot of slack there as well  District manufacturing activity   continues to strengthen, thanks to export activity  Our input costs have risen further, and a few   contacts are indicating that they are purchasing additional raw materials way in advance, as they   try to anticipate higher future costs  More District contacts also reported higher prices for   finished goods, and expectations for higher finished goods prices increased sharply in our last   survey   One exception, of course, is energy, which in our region is picking up a lot of momentum   as they shift from gas to oil, and we’re seeing a lot of investment activities in those areas, and   some increase in employment in those areas as well  In addition, strong global demand and tight   inventories continue to push our agricultural commodity prices up, and we are seeing increasing   amounts of interest from money managers and others in not only our commodity side, but in the   land side as well  As I have been pounding away at the fact that our land speculation is getting   more out of hand, my most recent example is a pretty strong signal that we’re heading in the   wrong direction  In a conference we had on lending in Omaha a few weeks ago, one of our staff   was talking with one of the possible lenders that was looking at activities; the individual was in   lending from Los Angeles and felt that lending in movies was too risky and was turning to land    They were actually looking for land deals in the region, so it’s in trouble  Other than that, the   inflation outlook continues to be modest but building, and we will continue to watch that in our   region as well; I think it is very similar to what we’re seeing at the national level  Thank you   March 15, 2011 36 of 165               Thank you, Mr Chairman  As I think we have all noted around this   table, the recovery continues to gain strength and increasingly appears to be sustainable, and   there have been significant recent improvements in the labor conditions  While we would all like   to see stronger growth and lower unemployment, the fact remains that the economy is   March 15, 2011 109 of 165              undergoing a major and necessary rebalancing that includes the deleveraging of consumers,   businesses, and financial institutions  Thus, having this kind of economic growth in that   environment is, I think, an impressive thing  Now, this process will take time, and maintaining a   zero rate is as likely, in my opinion, to impede the process as it is to help it  You heard around   the table that we are seeing new leverage being introduced almost as we speak   I also want to comment on President Rosengren’s point, which I think is an important one   and a good one, but I think he has it backwards  Low rates are, in fact, in place and designed to   increase asset values, and that’s what they’re doing  I gave the example of agriculture, because it   is immediate, I know it, but it is an example; there are other asset values that are increasing fairly   significantly now using leverage  And I think this increase, whether it’s an acquisition of a   company to expand under very low interest rates that causes an appreciation in value, has to be   taken into account  So if you are going to now have supervision calibrate the movement in the   asset value that your monetary policy was designed to increase, you are going to have to have   your army stand pretty tall to do that   If you take, for example, this agriculture situation, we can go into a bank, and the loan-to-  value ratio for the land has been priced up to 70 percent, which isn’t a bad number, and if you   look at it with the prices and the cash flow you say, “Ah, that’s a great deal  It should pay off    Let’s stress test it”  And you say, “Well, if you have 300 or 400 basis points, it’s too low,   because those prices will come down”  What do you tell the banker?  Raise capital?  Do you   classify the loan?  No, because the cash flows are good, the asset value is there, and the appraisal   is terrific  The problem is, in that situation—and there may be others—you also have a GSE   down the road who is making loans for agricultural land that are sweetheart deals  So you tell   the banker to get out of the way?  The problem is, the policy that we have taken on is designed to   March 15, 2011 110 of 165              move asset values, and it’s working  The problem is  How long do you let it stay in place?  My   point is that we need to move to a more balanced policy  Specifically, we need to be, again,   preparing the market for a rate increase soon, so that you don’t get the imbalances that a   collapse, whether in agriculture or the high-yield market that we talked about earlier, where   yields are at historical lows  That is what we need to be thinking about   I see little need to continue purchasing longer-term Treasury securities  Instead, I   recommend the purchases end sooner rather than later, and at something less than the number   that’s been tossed out there  I also recommend that we begin to form an exit strategy as soon as   next time, if not sooner, to stop reinvesting principal payments from our securities holdings and   to allow the size of our balance sheet to begin to stabilize and shrink  Also, I continue to   recommend that we change the forward guidance on the targeted level of the federal funds rate,   because this banker I’m talking to says, “You’ve got to let rates low for an exceptionally long   period”   The point is that we are still in the process of crisis policy that’s keeping rates artificially   low, moving asset values up, causing these banks and others in the market to take on increasing   risk by design  Supervision, as good as it may be, can’t offset or fine tune any better than   monetary policy can fine tune  And that’s what I’m really worried about  I am just pointing out   that our current highly accommodative monetary policy needs to be turned down—not made   tight policy, but needs to be turned down—and the sooner the better, so that we don’t create a   new set of financial imbalances and develop longer-term inflationary expectations, because if we   wait until we know we have it, it’s too late  If history has taught us anything, it has taught us   that   March 15, 2011 111 of 165              So that’s where I am on this  I know I am outside this Committee’s boundaries, but I   really strongly feel we are on a path that has a whole new set of issues that is coming at us, not   next year, but in the long run  That’s why I’m also concerned about an intermediate type of   discussion, when the long run is where we really are setting things up for future challenges   So that is my issue around asset values  It is not just agriculture  I think that’s important    Thank you    I have a question, and I do have a comment  Governor Yellen, when you   say “full ownership” of remarks and Q&A, what do you mean by that, in terms of the   Chairman’s having full ownership of that?  In terms of, he is responsible for it, or in terms of, it   reflects the full range of views?    Okay  The second question that I have is around the idea that we are   comparing ourselves with other central banks  I may not have this right, but if I read it right, the   United Kingdom doesn’t actually have a press conference after its meeting; it’s when it releases   its projections  So that’s different than what you’re suggesting    And that is not unlike our Humphrey-Hawkins—I mean, in the sense that   we put out our projections and respond to questions before Congress  My other point is—and   I’m a little uneasy about doing this, but—at the ECB, they don’t produce minutes, and they don’t   have a vote  So it’s a different model altogether than what we’re talking about here  And my   concern around that is, as we compare ourselves with them, we are not comparing the same   things  There’s a question of handling the difference in views  We have a broad range of views,   sometimes broader than others, and I know that the Chairman represents those, because he does   the summaries very nicely  But we do have minutes that are released, we do have a statement,   and if we want to really have that incorporated, my question is  Why don’t we concentrate on   moving the minutes up more quickly, so that you have them out sooner?  And we also have   transcripts that others don’t   This Chairman, I understand, would do it very well, but as you get the Chairman up there   trying to represent very different views in this press conference, sometimes more different than   others, the concern is that you get that out there clearly  And then, a day later we’re out giving   speeches, and if it doesn’t line up, we’re going to have some real problems  What we’re going to   do over time is be forced to the mean  That is, you don’t want to get too far out of line, if you   didn’t quite hear it that way  And what people hear and do are sometimes quite a bit different   March 15, 2011 133 of 165              So those are some of the concerns I have about going forward with this  And I apologize,   I didn’t send notes in, because I got to this later than I wanted to  But those are the things that   occurred to me as I was reading this on the plane here    Betsy, and to Governor Tarullo’s point, one of the things that makes me   a little bit uneasy is that you’re talking about the blackout period  Well, the blackout period   originally was because we didn’t announce anything, and you had to wait until markets figured it   out, and so you didn’t want to get ahead of them  Now we have the statement, which mitigates   that need  But now Governor Tarullo wants to extend the blackout period because the Chairman   speaks, and we don’t want people contradicting it   I’m not sure that you’re allowing for the diversity of views you get out there  And, you   begin to say, well, we’re going to confuse people more because the Chairman spoke here, and   now we’re going to have a speech that’s a day and a half later  Those are things I think we ought   to think through carefully because this is a regime change  This is a big deal in terms of what   we’re doing and how we are going to affect the dynamics of the Committee going forward    Now, it’s more of that long-term concern that I have    No, no  I’m opposed to Governor Tarullo’s point to extend it  I think it   is inconsistent with why we originally had the blackout    Well, my argument is that the original blackout was there because we   didn’t announce anything    That’s a positive  [Laugher]  It’s not good enough, but it’s a positive  "
9205,2011-04-26,HOENIG,"  I have one    Just curious  Let’s assume for the moment that inflationary pressures   become more pronounced and the markets become more convinced that it is perennial if we   don’t take an action  Which of the options— in terms of either moving your funds rate or selling   assets at that point —do you think would have the greatest effect on changing expectations about   inflation?    Then it wouldn’t matter which option you’d choose—at that point you’d   want to move more quickly, right?  So that would push that option forward    Rather than selling the assets?    So, you would begin with the repos and so forth to get the rate up more   quickly and then allow your balance sheet to run off?    Okay  I appreciate that    Can I ask President Bullard a question?  As you’re describing your   strategy, you’re selling out of the portfolio  Is that what you’re saying?    And that would have effects, but you wouldn’t actually change the fed   funds rate or the interest on reserves—for how long?   April 26–27, 2011 35 of 244               And conditions would tell you when to make that move—in terms of   what?  Inflationary expectations, events, and so forth?    Thank you  Thank you, Mr Chairman    Thank you, Mr Chairman  A couple of people around the table have   mentioned 1937, and I think it’s an interesting comparison and one we should keep in mind  I   think it was in that period that we have some similarities to today  There were efforts to increase   taxes and concern about excess reserves that were sloshing around, and I think we doubled   reserve requirements overnight, which caused a major shock to the economy  And I certainly   would agree that we do not want to shock the economy  And I don’t think we’re going to double   reserve requirements—I certainly hope not—or take actions that would move us in that direction   The second thing I want to observe is that, as we deal with this exit strategy, I think we   will be adjusting it as we learn because whether you like the definition of “perfect   substitutability” or not, we have no idea what the substitutability is between our fed funds rate   moves and our removal of the sizable assets on our balance sheet  So it’s going to be a careful   learning experience for us   The third thing I want to note is that in part our comments on option 1 or option 2, as I   have listened to them around the table, depend on our own intuitive feel for how close we are to   needing to take action  I can understand that, because it has influenced my own view; I think   that as we look at the economy today, we should be talking about where we are in terms of our   accommodation, and that we should in fact be thinking about removing accommodation  It is   highly accommodative, as we will talk about later today and tomorrow, and we need to think   about doing that  That means I would focus on the fed funds rate, as we always do  And to your   point, President Bullard, I think that is what people understand best  They don’t understand   QE3; they just know it’s out there  But they do understand moving interest rates, especially the   fed funds rate  And that’s what we need to focus on  One other point—I don’t know that we   April 26–27, 2011 67 of 244              will know whether QE2 has been successful at least until the year 2015  It’s a long, long   gestation process   Around those issues, then, how do I answer the questions?  How do we proceed, subject   to the idea that we need to be thinking about our fed funds policy?  I do say yes to the first   question that we should in fact stop reinvestments as conditions allow us  But my first step in   the exit strategy is to change the forward guidance from exceptionally low interest rates for an   extended period of time  That is the key, that is the signal, and we should be thinking about that   as we think about exit  With that, our next move should be to move the fed funds rate up—  1 percent by year-end or something—but that means the process has started   Then, the second question  I think, after raising the fed funds rate to some point, I would   pause and assess our economic prospects—where we are, what the effects have been, whether we   shocked the market, what are the conditions  When and if conditions warrant, I would then   begin again to normalize policy at a deliberate pace, raising the fed funds rate and redeeming and   selling securities concurrently to the extent that we can  There is judgment here  We would   regularly review changes in the fed funds rate and asset sales in light of incoming information   and adjust the exit program as needed to best foster maximum employment and price stability—  long-term, stable variables, not short-term ones  As long as conditions unfold as expected, I   would also expect to continue normalizing policy at some regular pace  Of course, if economic   conditions do not unfold as expected, then we should prepare ourselves to normalize policy more   or less rapidly based on those conditions, as we judge them at each meeting   For the third question, my preferred sequencing is that we raise the fed funds rate from its   crisis level to closer to 1 percent as quickly as possible, ideally by year-end  I believe we should   then normalize both the fed funds rate and the balance sheet in terms of size, composition, and   April 26–27, 2011 68 of 244              duration  I think that part of the reason we are doing these repos and so forth rather than selling   assets is that we want to keep the duration on our balance sheet and out of the rest  I think we   should try and get that transitioned as well, so we should be selling assets as we can, and on a   faster timeline as well   On question 4, yes, I agree  Of course, my definition of “intermediate term” may differ   from your definition of “intermediate term”  And that should be a discussion that we have here    I think it’s important  I would expect that we can renormalize policy and our balance sheet more   timely than either option 1 or option 2 outlines  But I am willing to debate that over time, as   long as we get on the path to take this excess accommodation out of the system before we get a   very bad surprise on the other end   With three interest rates—the federal funds rate, the interest rate on excess reserves, and   the discount rate—I believe we will eventually move to either a floor system or a corridor   system  Before making this decision, though, I would prefer to see how events unfold as we   move toward a more normal stance on monetary policy overall  Thank you, Mr Chairman    Thank you, Mr Chairman  First of all, our region of the country is doing   well-to-booming  If you look at the downside, our housing market is comparable to other areas   April 26–27, 2011 129 of 244              where there was a buildup of supply that exceeded the buildup in household formation; that   we’re working through  Once you get by that, our manufacturing sector came down slightly in   our most recent survey, but that was from a record high and we are seeing that continue to   expand  Our retail sales did slow down in the first part of the quarter, but did pick up pretty   significantly in March, which, from our point of view, is very positive  Agriculture is continuing   to do very well—a boom—and energy is also in a boom environment   To add an anecdote on my concern for leverage, I think it is worth sharing this  We have   a pretty sizable energy company, recently formed in the past five years  It shifted its strategy   toward oil, away from natural gas  And they were able, because of the low cost to leverage, to   buy 1 million acres of development rights on land in our region for about $200 million—$200 an   acre of development rights  They then formed a royalty trust and took approximately 65,000 of   those acres from which they had borrowed the $200 million, went on an international tour and   raised money from sovereign wealth funds for rights to this royalty unit, and then closed their   deal here in the past few weeks for rights on 65,000 of the 1 million acres for $238 million  So   leverage is doing well in our part of the country  low cost of borrowing, easy money, lots of   liquidity sloshing around, here we go  So I bring that up as a caution to this Committee   On the national level, I agree—information we have received since the last meeting   indicates that the economy recovery continues and that our labor markets are improving   modestly but steadily  Household spending and business investment in equipment and software   both continue to expand, while at the same time improving their balance sheets, which is good,   from my point of view  Since the last meeting, we have also seen that inflation expectations   have remained, as we say, contained, except that what we are seeing for energy, food, and now a   broader basket of goods  indicates confidence may be waning in that particular sector  One thing   April 26–27, 2011 130 of 244              on unemployment—if you break it out, we are seeing pretty significant improvements in   employment for college graduates  We are seeing less in terms of high school and non–high   school; I’m not sure monetary policy can solve that, and I think we should be mindful of that   One other thing that I worry about is that while we talk about our very accommodative   policy as necessary, we also see these energy and commodity costs rising and moving forward    And, yes, they may transitory, but I’m afraid that when you have wages that are not rising, real   income is falling, and high prices in that environment actually kill demand because incomes   can’t keep up  And the effect on that middle income group that we are so concerned about   supporting is going to be negative, not positive  So we may not see the inflationary pressures   three and four years from now, but that may be because we have a new economic crisis built   around the fact that we put all of this liquidity into the system, built these commodities up, and   when the prices adjust and come down, it will be because we have starved the middle class in   terms of real-wage increases   I think we need to be careful about how long we leave this very accommodative   monetary policy in place, because we are creating imbalances  They are going to correct  And   that, of course, will fall most heavily on those with middle and lower incomes  Thank you    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I prefer alternative C  Economic growth, as   I’ve said many times, will most likely continue to be moderate, as consumers and businesses and   financial institutions balance their increasing spending motives with the need to deleverage,   which is in process and has to take place  This process will take time, and maintaining a zero   policy rate, I think, invites future imbalances that will undermine longer-term growth, which is   our mandate  Inflation is increasing  Energy and food inflation have been especially notable,   obviously  The broader inflation measures are moving higher as well  I am concerned that   maintaining our highly accommodative policy stance amid a recovering economy, even though   modest, and rising underlying inflation puts us behind the curve and risks a repeat of the policy   mistakes of the ’70s and the 2000s  We are just inviting trouble by staying too low too long   To rebalance the risks to the outlook, we need to rebalance our monetary policy, and I   would start modestly, by taking the “extended period” language out  And I’d also at least   consider seriously stopping our investments at the $450 billion number  Thank you  "
9234,2011-06-21,HOENIG,"  Mr Chairman, I like this, thank you  I don’t think it will end the   discussion, but I think it will clarify things for people and will be very helpful, and I hope it is   public as quickly as you can feel comfortable doing it  Thank you    I don’t mean to be throwing this out loosely, but I know I heard a lot of   desires to see all timing taken out  However, if you want to create chatter, let everyone start   guessing as to whether it’s three or four or two years  This gives them rough guidelines that I   think can be helpful  As you work on the amendments, keep that in mind as well    I have a question on exhibit 2  It’s around the discussion of why   consumer spending is so sluggish, and you compared it with the three past recessions  I’d be   curious, did you track, for example, the ratio of personal debt to disposable income and compare   it with those three periods?  Because although you say one-fourth of the mortgages are   underwater, I think it could be more than that; it could be just the leverage that the consumer is   working off that is slowing consumption    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I really thought this was a good report, and   the chart show was enormously useful as we think about it, because one of my concerns has been   that we have this fairly fragile equilibrium at these very low interest rates  You can see it come   out in different forms  And I thought President Rosengren’s point about money markets was   right on  I think another area is the repos that are also funding longer-term assets under the guise   of short-term liabilities  It is a problem that I think needs to be addressed   In my region you see it in different ways, as I mentioned before  Agriculture is still   moving very, very much toward leverage as gains are recognized and new opportunities present   themselves  We are seeing it in energy, where there are now huge profits on some of these   drilling projects, and they are leveraging that up for incredible turnovers  I think it’s something   we need to pay a lot of attention to, and I know we are  One element of the ag sector I want to   mention once again is the effects of GSEs  There are two things—what they say and then what   they do  And they are saying they are tightening their standards, but when you look at what the   Farm Credit System is doing, it’s something else  Our commercial banks and ag banks are fairly   concentrated in agriculture loans, but still less concentrated than the Farm Credit System, and yet   the Farm Credit System is maintaining half the reserve levels as the commercial banks are in that   area; it is setting the standard, and it drives you toward the lower common denominator  So you   see the leverage going up, and we are seeing big increases on a quarterly basis now in that sector    We are seeing big increases associated with energy, and then some leverage deals on energy  As   they search for these returns, we are seeing the financing around money markets on a broader   June 21–22, 2011 104 of 282              scale than other repos  This is very helpful, and the use of leverage around this is going to only   grow  How we work our way out of this very fragile equilibrium matters, and that’s why this   exit strategy, I think, was so important, that we had that discussion today, and I think it gives us,   if you will, a guide for beginning to think forward on how we deal with this  This is a very good   report  These are things that are emerging that we should pay attention to, and I think it will   serve us all well  Thank you     Thank you, Mr Chairman  First of all, our region has slowed as others   have around the May–June time period  We are seeing some pickup more recently  Our regional   factory activity has decelerated a little more than we thought it would, but it has appeared to   stabilize, and we’ve seen some real pickup in our technology industry, especially in the   communications sector  Certainly energy remains strong and agriculture remains strong, with   very sizable profits in those sectors   Turning to the national economy, I do expect that the outlook over the next several years   is one of moderate growth for GDP  I think that reflects the fact that we are going through a   necessary rebalancing due to both demographics and leverage, as households, especially an   entire generation, are saying, “I want to get this debt off my balance sheet”  And we have a   younger generation that had too much and has to get it off the balance sheet, and they’re pulling   back  Businesses are repositioning themselves, and certainly local governments have to get rid   of a lot of commitments and a lot of debt  The federal government is the only exception to that   at the moment, and we see what they’re doing with that  I do, though, expect a resumption of   moderate growth  I think it’s a testament to this economy that, given the amount of leverage we   are trying to work our way through, we have seen economic growth at 2½ to 3 percent  As far as   inflation goes, I think it’s inevitable as long as we keep our policy as accommodative as it is  It   will slowly—not rapidly, but slowly—increase, and we will have to watch that as we go forward   from here  In terms of the risks, I think they’re real  I think we have a very fragile equilibrium    June 21–22, 2011 133 of 282              If you think about how many things we’re worried about that could draw us back into a   slowdown, it’s pretty amazing  And when a situation in a country the size of Greece has the   world at risk, we know how fragile this economy of ours is, global and nationally   Solutions are not simple, I realize, and I know that’s a discussion for tomorrow, but I’m   not sure that keeping ourselves in this highly accommodative situation indefinitely will do   anything but make it more fragile to where something very minor will tip us back, and that’s   what we have to be mindful of  Thank you    Thank you, Mr Chairman  The issue, I think, for the US economy is   the fact that households and businesses and financial institutions are in the process of   deleveraging  But with adjustments like these under way, the economy grows at a moderate   pace, and I doubt that we can stimulate strong growth anytime soon through monetary policy,   given the deleveraging that has to take place  And as much as we would like monetary policy to   solve the growth problems in the economy, I think it is beyond its reach  In my view,   accommodative policy generally is appropriate  I remain convinced that what I think of as   excessive accommodation will set conditions for the next set of problems and potentially the next   crisis  Going forward, I think the Committee should consider ways to limit the amount of   June 21–22, 2011 173 of 282              accommodation that we put in place  Experience suggests to me that we often react to negative   outcomes by easing policy extensively and often  This easing bias artificially stimulates the   economy for a time, as has been noted, and eventually the positive effects of the artificial   stimulus fade off  When the negative effects, such as financial imbalances, emerge, we are   forced to engage in even more accommodative policy to combat the ensuing downturn  In this   way, we become enmeshed in what I think of as an unfavorable cycle of easy policies to offset   effects of previous easy policies  And I think it’s a very tenuous way to approach this  What I’d   like to see instead is that we do keep policy accommodative but within boundaries, so that it   would not be excessively so  And I think we’re at a point where using the exit strategy that   we’ve worked on can set the context for going forward  It can address some of what we might   call an unstable situation that we have from an extended easy policy that we can’t get out of    And it would enable us to more gradually bring policy away from this excessive accommodation   toward more modest accommodation, and preclude future problems that are years ahead,   perhaps, but nevertheless ahead  Thank you    Just a point of clarification based on this conversation  These are   identified as “policies,” and, Eric, you said “guidelines,” and, Richard, you said “guidelines”    It’s subtle, but are these guidelines, or is this a policy?     Right  And just to clarify it, “policy” is a stronger statement than   “guidelines”    Just quickly, I put time frames in there because everyone knows we’re   going to do this in some systematic fashion  We don’t even have to talk about that  We don’t   even have to put this thing out  This gives them a concept of what we are thinking about  And   paragraph 7 says, “Of course, we’ll make adjustments if we need to, but here’s what you can   look to”  And it gives them I think more information rather than less  Keeping it too general is   just too general  It doesn’t provide anything useful  So that’s why I like “three to five,” and   “two to three”  Let people know, and then we’ll see what happens, obviously  "
9281,2011-08-09,HOENIG,"  Thank you  I will note to the Committee that I want to apologize  I had   no idea the markets were going to react this way to my leaving  [Laughter]    I would imagine    Thank you  [Applause]    Brian, I don’t know if I’ll ask this question correctly, but it follows up on   President Fisher’s to some extent  In the conversations we have with the market participants—  most markets, like anyone else, talk what they want, or it’s not so much about expectations, but   the way they form their answers is to guide us to what they want  What kinds of conversations   do you have around that?  Are they looking for something specific right now—ease because we   have to—or are they more up in the air themselves?   August 9, 2011 14 of 162               But that’s not in their self-interest?  Or are they able to look beyond that   in terms of longer-term outcome?  They are dealers and they are working on their own book, and   I worry because some of the conversations I’ve had suggest that their focus is very short term   and that they are trying to influence where we come out by how they skew the information   toward us  That gives me some pause  But you think they’re more objective than that?    Thank you    Thank you  Dave, I think I understand, but the equipment and software   revisions that you did were pretty drastic, and given the balance sheets of some of the industry,   this has to be, then, driven by confidence  But my other question is, where are they redirecting   this to?  Just Treasuries, or are they going overseas with it?  Because the BRIC countries still   have demand growing—would they be investing there?  To see this kind of a drop-off, you   wonder what their thinking is and where they’re going with this  Do you have any sense of that   in any discussions you’ve had?    You don’t think that much of it is going into foreign direct investment   elsewhere?    I mean, if I were them, I’d be doing something with this stuff, especially   given the growth in the BRIC countries    Okay  Thank you    Thank you, Mr Chairman  A couple of things  In our region, things are   about as they were—modest economic growth  We still have an energy boom  Whether that   stays, given recent events, we can all guess at  It depends on whether it’s temporary or longer   term  Agriculture’s still doing well  We’re still seeing very significant increases in the value of   properties as people deploy their liquidity into any kind of a hedge they think they can find  One   thing we have found, in talking with some of the major railroads in our part of the world, is that   traffic is up in the past month—pretty importantly up, using their words  So we have this modest   economic growth  It’s at risk given all the world events that we see today, and who knows for   sure?   I realize, in terms of the comments that I’m making, that we’re all well intentioned, and I   take the original comment that we have to be open minded about this, but we are products of   experience  As you mentioned, I’ve been through three recessions here, but it is actually more   than that, since I was in the Fed before that  The question I ask myself as we go through this   stuff is, what’s wrong?  Is it that capital’s not available, that there’s no liquidity in the system,   that we’re not able to deploy it because of the impediments that monetary policy might have   contributed to?  Is the policy rate too high?  Is there a liquidity shortfall somehow?  Or, perhaps,   are there other issues?  The consumer in America is highly leveraged and remains so  The states   August 9, 2011 61 of 162              are highly leveraged with their future promises, and they have to deal with that  Do we have a   US, but also a global, sovereign debt issue that people are thinking about—whether it’s real or   not, they feel it’s real?  Is this affecting confidence, and is it inhibiting the deployment of capital   around the world and especially in the United States?  And can we, as a policy body, increase   confidence by actions we take?  Perhaps  But I think we’re finding out that we tend to do it on a   temporary basis as we revert to the real issues that are ours, our country’s, and others’ to deal   with, and that is the highly, highly leveraged world economy today that needs to be worked   through  Our political systems—not just here, but also in Europe—are having difficulty coming   to grips with that because it requires significant adjustments in how we use our resources  And   that’s really what we’re facing today   I suspect that we are going to struggle through this for some time to come, and I worry   that what actions we take now, with our good intentions, will have longer-term consequences as   they are deployed  And I’m not just talking inflation  I mean consequences for the allocation of   resources—I think the misallocation of resources is a risk as much as anything  President Evans,   I understand what you’re saying in terms of, “Would we be reacting this way if inflation were   5 percent?”  But I will tell you, history and experience tell me, that over time, we—because we   do care so much—tend to favor trying to bring the unemployment down over our inflationary   goals  We did it in the ’70s  Inflation systematically got up because we were constantly pushing   to try to keep unemployment lower, until finally inflation was so high that we had to take a pill, a   very bitter pill  Yes, I think we could easily find ourselves, if unemployment were to stay high   or come down more slowly than any of us want, biasing our outcomes toward 5 percent   inflation—not today, maybe five or six or seven years from now  But I remind people that in   economics that’s not a long time, actually  And this housing crisis started in the 2002–2003   August 9, 2011 62 of 162              period and didn’t erupt until 2007–2008  So my only point is to say that I agree  I wish we   could do more  Don’t misunderstand me—I wish we could do more  But I think flooding more   liquidity into the market, while it may have a temporary impact, has intermediate-term   consequences—not just longer-term consequences—that I think force us to be more careful right   now  And I think we would be wise if we are more careful  Thank you, Mr Chairman    I’m listening    Thank you, Mr Chairman  You know, I keep coming back to the fact   that the fundamental problem is, we have issues outside of monetary policy that we’re not   willing to address, and this country has a problem—an economy that has systematically   consumed more than it produces  And that means leverage has to continue to increase, and we   have to move that forward  If we’re going to take care of our employment problem, we have to   increase production  And I keep asking the question as I look at the projections—that’s why I   was asking Dave about the investment outlook  It’s going down, not up, even though we have   dumped tons of money into this economy of ours, and here we are  How is further quantitative   easing or further guarantees of zero rates going to take care of the fundamental problems that   we’re not willing to step up to as a nation?  I think that the central bank should be pushing other   elements of this government to address long-term problems when it’s not  The same thing is   going on in Europe where you’ve got the central bank in Europe now doing a bridge loan so they   can have time to get their bailout, which the markets are already saying isn’t going to be enough    And we have a problem in this country where we need to be boosting investment, and it is   languishing   I think that monetary policy that goes and says things about 2013 is going to have a   temporary effect for today, which will die off very quickly, and we’re going to be back here   again  We are going to be talking about QE3 until we take care of these long-run problems  And   I think we’re in a box, and we need to be pushing other sectors of this economy toward longer-  August 9, 2011 107 of 162              run solutions, and we’re not willing to do it  So I’ll leave it at that  My parting words, Richard    [Laughter]  "
