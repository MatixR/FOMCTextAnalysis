 As a matter of fact it is and that's a warning to all of you   Mr Chairman, do you want to hear from our District?   I appreciate that  -25-    10/1/91   I might just make a couple of comments that might be of some value   Our District economy has been growing fairly modestly, and I think it's particularly important that this has happened in the manufacturing area as well Our automobile manufacturers are operating at capacity And while our aircraft industry, which is important in parts of our District, had a downturn in the first half, it is anticipating some recovery, which is good news for us I might mention that residential construction activity in our area has been picking up, but nonresidential has continued to languish, although not as seriously as in other parts of the country I might even mention that in Denver, although there's not a lot of activity, there is an appearance that lease rates are firming up and that is important to us  In agriculture, the situation is very similar to what you've heard here There is some strengthening in crop prices but cattle prices have been falling fairly importantly and we anticipate about a 10 percent decline in agricultural income in our part of the country Energy also is weak, particularly in the natural gas area It has been very harmful to our Oklahoma area where prices have been down and therefore rig activity has been falling as well  On the national economy, I would like to mention that our analysis is, like others, very similar to what is in the Greenbook We are a little more pessimistic in the consumption area and net exports but a little more optimistic on the investment side We think it might be even stronger if long-term rates were to continue to come down We are also in agreement with the projections on inflation being less than 4 percent We think that's a very important focus as we go forward because that will help long-term rates to come down and that will have a much more important stimulus on the national economy So with that, Mr Chairman, I'll make my remarks short Thank you   "B" symmetric   I totally support taking this action tomorrow for the very reasons that Governor Angell, Governor Kelley, and others have expressed We need to get it out   May I ask a follow-up to Tom's question? As you described the economy, there were some fundamentals in terms of real estate and some adjustments in leverages and so forth that are going to be constraining If we ease now, what in your judgment is the risk of pushing inflation [up] and compromising our ability to bring it down in the future, given these fundamental adjustments that probably should continue regardless?   The Tenth District continues to outperform the nation to some extent, although if we keep talking about it we may talk ourselves out of any improvement It's doom and gloom from a number of people, although the numbers continue to show some improvement For example, most of our automobile plants continue to operate at capacity Now, in aviation manufacturing, there has been a decline in production over [the level] a year ago and that's primarily due to a drop-off in foreign demand The District's oil and gas exploration activity remains lackluster, as it does elsewhere Drilling rigs were up very slightly in October over September and are still well below--about 23 percent below--year-ago levels In  -14-    11/5/91  agriculture, cattle prices have turned [up] and are now back to the break-even point And in the grain area, prices have increased, which has been a help in that sector Finally, the indicators of construction activity in our District quite frankly have been improving Building contracts awarded in the District in August were up 11 percent over year-ago levels Residential awards are increasing in most of our states And we're even seeing some improvement in non- residential contracts in Colorado and in New Mexico So, the District's economy is consistently showing improvements  As far as the national economy goes, we continue to forecast sustained growth although slightly weaker, as the staff is projecting Our forecasts are for a little better growth than the staff has in the first half and a little more moderate growth in the second half We see a little stronger inventory investment and some continuing strength in consumer spending; even though the attitudes are down, we don't see that dropping sharply As for inflation, we anticipate the inflation numbers will stay modest and actually fall somewhat below 4 percent So, that is how we are viewing things right now Thank you   Mr Chairman, I have some concerns about easing now in terms of inflation down the road I assume that there may be a discount rate cut If that's the case, that would make for an announcement from the Fed and then I would recommend the possibility of a 1/4 point cut on asymmetric [language toward] easing based on new information that may come to you So, I'd be slightly different   Thank you, Mr Chairman Our District growth continues to be slow and we see no real improvement in [prospect] in the near future In agriculture, we expect declines in income of between 5 and 10 percent this year and we anticipate similar declines next year Activity in the oil and gas areas of our District continues weak Drilling operations activity as of November is down about 30 percent from the year before and there are no signs of any significant improvement there Manufacturers, particularly the auto companies that are operating in our District, are now increasing their furlough periods The General Motors plant is going to go out for four weeks starting I think this week or next week In the construction area, our District has seen improvements As I mentioned last time, it's partly because we've had such deflation; but we've seen good residential activity and some nonresidential activity in parts of our District  As far as the national economy goes, our staff feels that its projections are generally in line with those in the Greenbook We're not quite as pessimistic for this quarter or the next quarter, but we're certainly not as optimistic about the rest of 1992 For inflation, our forecast is very similar to the Greenbook forecast We see no really strong inflationary pressures going forward  As for the implications for policy, then, we think there is room for easing, although our preference is along the lines of what Governor Mullins said in that we think it's something we ought to be prepared to do down the road but would wait and choose our time I think that would be perhaps a more effective way of going forward Thank you   I agree with your recommendation   Given the circumstances that we have today, I would not be in favor of the tunnels I think what we have now does give us the flexibility we need to move toward price stability, and that's what should be our focus As for the alternatives here, I am in favor of alternative I for the reasons that have been given That gives us the flexibility we need to continue to move toward price stability, and to adopt either of the other alternatives I think would give an incorrect signal at this time   Yes   Mike, I want to ask something relating to the single-family residential area because it's an important part of the projections as we come into 1992 Given the comments on restructuring of debt that have been made and some of the demographics, can you explain to me again why we're going to have such a strong residential recovery even without the fiscal stimulus which, if I understand it, was not part of this projection? [Your forecast] seems very optimistic to me   We think our District is growing somewhat more slowly; it might be described as flat at best In the agricultural area, because of the subsidized grain shipments, the wheat price that we've talked about has gone up and that, of course, has been positive But livestock prices, which had fallen sharply, have only come back slightly And we're still projecting a slowdown in agricultural income, which has [adverse] effects on suppliers to that industry Also, with natural gas prices being so weak, the energy industry, which is a very important resource in our District, is suffering As someone said, the rig count for us is about the same as for the nation--about 33 percent less than it was a year ago--but very weak; and employment in that sector is very weak as well In manufacturing, we are involved in the auto industry Shifts have been eliminated and cutbacks in production schedules have caused unemployment to increase in that industry; layoffs of about 1,000 people in Kansas City were just announced recently General aviation has also seen some modest falloff, but for us that is important The construction industry has been positive, particularly in the residential area Some significant gains have occurred there, and that has been the most positive note out of the District  On the national economy, our projections are less robust than those in the Greenbook, partly because we have seen such a poor fourth quarter for the economy and we look at what impact that would have going forward We see a slower increase in the first quarter, or perhaps no increase at all, and a pickup after that, putting our projections below the central tendency [unless] we assume that there will be some modest fiscal package, which would bring us back up toward the central tendency With that we see unemployment in the same range as the staff projection and inflation without the fiscal stimulus probably being within the same range or lower So, that is how we see the national economy as well as the District economy   I, too, am inclined to follow your recommendation First of all, I'd start by saying that there is a lot [of stimulus] in the pipeline and we should be patient However, as I mentioned yesterday, our projections are that the real economy might actually grow more slowly than what is in the Greenbook forecast, and that gives me some pause I also am concerned about the growth of M2, which I think has been erratic and too slow So, I am inclined to go with "B" asymmetric toward ease, but I would wait until we have some more information on the real economy and on M2 before I would charge forward   Our District continues to show a mixed performance on balance with very slow recovery [emerging] For example, our employment in January was up about 01 percent over the prior month As for the positives, one is retail sales Retailers around the District tell us that there has been a pickup in sales and they are, as we've been saying, cautiously optimistic that that will continue Construction-wise, we are still seeing improvement January was about 12 percent over a year ago for the District, but that was primarily in residential Commercial property continues to be fairly weak, with vacancy rates in Colorado, for example, still in the 24 percent area and higher than that yet in Oklahoma So, that sector is going to remain weak; but residential [construction] has been very strong Manufacturing is mixed for us In the auto industry there are still plans to continue with two shifts, but there has not been enough optimism for them to reverse [the decision] in process of being implemented to lay off 1,000 employees in Kansas City Also, other manufacturers we talk with are seeing some pickup, but it's very modest and they're not at all convinced that business is going to continue strong as we go forward They're waiting to see Economic activity is also being dragged down a bit with some defense cutbacks Martin Marietta in Denver, for example, is laying off 1,000 workers; and Allied Signal in Kansas City is laying off about 750 So that's a bit of a drag offsetting the anticipation of stronger sales in the auto industry Clearly, our weak sector is energy It's still very weak The rig count is down 25 percent from a year ago--not as much as in Louisiana, but down As you may have read this morning, Oklahoma has passed a law trying to restrict production of natural gas in an effort to boost its price; we'll see how successful they are In agriculture, the outlook is a little mixed In the grain area, there is some optimism with regard to prices In the cattle area, there is more pessimism Land values have remained virtually unchanged because of some concerns about pricing going forward So, our economy is mixed, although people are trying to be optimistic  Nationally, we generally agree with the Greenbook although our forecast is not quite as strong We anticipate and we're optimistic that the economy will grow a little less than 2-1/2 percent over the year However, we differ a little We think investment will be a little stronger and consumption a bit weaker than the Greenbook is projecting On the inflation front, we are also about in line with the Greenbook in terms of seeing core inflation continue to trend down So, that's where we see things right now   Mr Chairman, because the Greenbook and our forecast agree that the economy is improving and because year-to-date, at least as Gary said, the money numbers are near the midpoint, I'm comfortable with alternative B At the same time, I recognize that the money numbers that have just come in cause us to flinch But more importantly, I can support the asymmetry [because], although our economy is being projected as stronger now than it was in February, it still remains a very modest recovery by any [historical] comparisons and it is in my mind still a very tender recovery Therefore, I feel comfortable with the asymmetric language toward ease   Mike, just to follow up on your comment on inventories You say that in the revised first-quarter numbers inventories are playing a more important role but that should not have an adverse effect going forward That is what I think I heard you saying Can you go through that again as to why we would not have some repercussions from that?   Thank you, Mr Chairman Our District economy is growing, but it's still very slow and somewhat mixed As others have mentioned here, the agriculture area is subject to some uncertainty due to the dry weather Also, in our area cattle is a very important industry and, although prices are up, there's a lot of uncertainty there With this environment of uncertainty there has been some very reduced activity in the agricultural sector; in fact our banks' loan-to-deposit ratios in that sector are at their lowest levels in some time, at just over 50 percent Manufacturing is mixed to flat, I would say In the aircraft industry there has been some slowing in shipments recently And in our auto industry, there has been activity but no real expansion in activity, with some modest gains overall in employment Our energy industry is suffering very significantly The level of drilling activity in both oil and gas is at post-World War II lows and [the outlook is] not at all good Everyone one talks with is blaming it on some of the regulatory restrictions as much as on some of the economics, so that is a very sore point in our area As to the construction side, construction activity in the residential sector has been very high but our anecdotal information now suggests it is backing off from those highs just as you hear is happening elsewhere  On the commercial real estate side, there is some increased absorption but still enough vacancies out there that we're not seeing any significant pickup in prices An important factor we've heard in very recent conversations is that in some of our areas the lease rates remain extremely low And until those pick up we don't really expect that the price levels are going to pick up at all That includes Denver, where there has been some activity; still, lease rates are very favorable, and though we have had some sales we're not seeing a real pickup in the prices or bidding to any large extent  On the national economy, our projections are very similar to those of the Greenbook There are some differences We are looking at a little weaker consumer spending and residential investment, and a little stronger government spending and stronger still business fixed investment On the inflation front, we're very much in line with the staff forecast; we may be a little more optimistic on inflation but not enough to make a real difference overall at this time Thank you   Mr Chairman, I certainly would support "B" As far as symmetric or asymmetric, my preference would be toward asymmetric I may have heard some good things about the real economy, but I don't consider it all that much stronger than where we were some months ago when we were talking about being willing to live with money growth above the midpoint And now suddenly we're very satisfied with it being at the bottom [of the range] and are satisfied that [it will be sufficient] to carry us forward We're now relying on an accelerating velocity that we really can't predict I don't see that there is all that much strength going forward But I certainly can live with symmetric language given that we would have a consultation if there's other news coming forward   I would support your approach, although I have a lot of sympathy for Jerry Jordan's comments The difficulty, as others here have said, is that we are in transition; we are uncertain In that position, changing targets--whichever way--leaves open so many    6/30-7/1/92  questions that I think it will only confuse the participants, and that is unwise So, I'd go along with your recommendation I'd carefully explain it and, as Jerry Corrigan said, make a little [comment] on our record and our commitment to price stability in that context I think that will be accepted better than our suggesting that we know something when we don't   On Charts 5 and 6, just to make sure I heard what you said, is the projected improvement in our export figures due more to the devaluation of the dollar than to the economic activity in this country?    6/30-7/1/92   Okay, thanks   Thank you, Mr Chairman Our District continues to grow very sluggishly in my opinion We have seen some job growth in construction, particularly residential construction, over the last year This is primarily in our northern area, in Omaha and in the Denver, Colorado area Beyond that, agriculture is at best steady; we've seen some production loss in wheat because of the weather but that is being helped a little by some firmer prices So, we don't expect a drop there but we're not seeing [that sector provide] any strength to the economy, as it has in the past Our manufacturing sector was very sluggish through the first quarter; while we have seen some improvement there anecdotally, it really has been very modest at best Others have talked about the auto industry; we've not seen any pickup in jobs in plants in our area, at least to this point Our energy sector is, as it has been, very, very poor for a lot of different reasons, so it's not generating a lot of activity in our region of the country So, we expect continued growth but at a rate less than we're seeing for the nation as a whole  As far as the national economy goes, we also are very close to the Greenbook projection, which we would note was adjusted down in the period going forward; that's consistent with our view We see the economy growing very sluggishly and we're sensitive to that That is consistent with the type of credit activity we're seeing on loans and what is being reported to us So, we think there is a downside risk to the economic recovery right now and, although we see improvement in the inflation rate, we think that downside risk is something to be alert to as we go forward with the policy discussion   As I look at the discussion that we've had and your models, I prefer your second model as well I think it is suggesting that we still have an environment in the economy generally of great uncertainty and the building of liquidity And in that context staying where we are is, as Jerry stated, a tightening In addition, it's not just the money numbers but other financial information and the financial environment that suggest that we could and should ease My strong preference, then, would be to ease now; however, I can live with an asymmetric directive It's consistent with where I was at least last time And if the information comes in, given the way you answered President Keehn, I can live with that   The ranges we have now reflect an expectation that these [aggregates] are going to fall below [for the year], and I think we should drop that last sentence because it only adds--   Our District continues to show sluggish growth in most sectors except for real estate construction in some areas As for the farm economy, it's stable but as you've heard elsewhere prices are down and that is bringing the prospects for our ag sector toward the down side as we go forward; there may even be a decrease in [farm] income depending on what the near-term future holds Manufacturing in our District is flat The aircraft industry is feeling the effects of slumping foreign sales Our auto industry is not pushing production at all and that is showing through In energy, we have had some pickup in the rig count, but that is a very sluggish industry and we are not going to see much economic activity coming from that sector As far as the real estate area goes, our residential sector does show some strength There is a considerable amount of refinancing But we are also seeing new construction in some parts of our District, particularly in Denver where what is almost a boom situation in residential housing gives us some pause  -21-    8/18/92  I would add a couple of anecdotal points We have talked with bankers in our region and we also hear and observe that the problem is not that they are unwilling to make loans but [that there is little] demand for loans But that is a very unique situation Beyond that, though the banks will say demand [is the problem], where their [loans] have picked up or they want to add [loans], they have changed their underwriting on the margin--how many guarantees and how much collateral they require In one instance when they did that we observed that they were able to add significant amounts of loans, some of it taken from other banks who wouldn't change their underwriting I'm not talking necessarily about throwing out all caution, but just that some changes will make a difference I think banks in our region as they anticipate the need to bring their capital levels up are keeping their underwriting standards higher than they might otherwise and are trying to build those capital levels; and it is showing through in terms of the level of their lending activity  As far as the national economy goes, we have some differences with the Greenbook quarter-to-quarter, but overall our GDP projections are now similar We've adjusted ours down and we've adjusted our inflation expectations down as well I see the national economy, with the things that are going on right now, in a sluggish mode, and as I listen to comments here I think we can anticipate further sluggishness The situation does in fact suggest that perhaps we need to take a more forceful action   I would be more with President Forrestal's alternative now, but I would accept your argument of holding back and thus would accept "B" asymmetrical   Mike, I'd like to follow up on Ed Boehne's question If I understood you correctly, you were saying that within the context of having provided a fair amount of liquidity for the readjustment, you are expecting things to improve down the road next year and beyond based on where rates have already fallen But if the improvement doesn't happen, you suggested toward the end of your comments that we might have to make substantial reductions in rates to move the economy along Having said that, is your discussion about a    10/6/92  modest reduction now an insurance policy on the rates that have already come down or did I misunderstand you?   Our District continues [to expand] at a very modest pace overall and employment is up just a little over last year The agricultural sector is flat; there may be a little decline in [farm] income, even though crops are good, because prices are less robust Manufacturing is basically flat Our aircraft industry is suffering because of the reduced demand overseas Our manufacturing of autos is either flat or there is significant [unused] capacity So, there is not a lot of activity there As far as construction goes, the residential sector is still strong throughout the District and in some areas the nonresidential sector remains good In the energy sector, the movement in natural gas prices is in a sense positive I think more fundamentally than the effects of the hurricane there has been an improving trend; supplies have been brought into a little better alignment with demand so prices are increasing nationally In talking to people in that industry, though, they say if that were to continue, they wouldn't really have resources until sometime next year, so that's not an immediate pickup for our District at all  On the national scene, we have no real differences with the Greenbook We're not quite as pessimistic for the fourth quarter Fundamentally, we're looking at the negative numbers and adjusting our projections of real activity down a little Also, like the staff, we do not expect inflation to be a major problem  With regard to policy considerations, I have to admit I'm a little more ambivalent about easing than I was last time, partly because we have talked to business people, as others of you have, and they're saying that interest rates are not a problem right now We don't need it, given the other aspects of the economy and the so- called headwinds we've talked about Credit growth is a little better and I have some concerns about the foreign exchange situation But on balance I'm personally still comfortable with easing because we are looking at a continued [sluggish] and maybe even weakening economy And while I say that credit is improving, it's still weak in every way The monetary aggregates, M2 and so forth, are still weak by every definition And price inflation is not at this point a major issue; we don't see inflation picking up again given these other factors and, therefore, we have some room to ease And on the margin I feel that easing would facilitate this restructuring that is still in process, even though we don't know where the equilibrium may be We know it is in process and there are still significant adjustments that have to take place So, as I wash all this out, I have to come down on the side of some further ease   To repeat myself a little, Mr Chairman, I came in a little more ambivalent, and I think we have had a very good discussion The preponderance of views is that ease is appropriate I think now would be the time [to ease], having had the discussion, and it would be a deliberative move However, given your [explanation], I can live with "hard asymmetric"   In terms of what Mr Gonzalez is asking for--and that is a detailed record of some kind as well as timeliness--as Jerry said, to have cameras in here or to have an immediate release of a detailed transcript or memorandum of discussion would inhibit the process under all these circumstances Going back to your issue that the public has a right to know at some point, I think we have had in the past, as I've read this material, a position that says, yes, we would be willing to accommodate them with a detailed memorandum of discussion again if we could have some assurances that there wouldn't be premature release of that material to the public through a FOI request That issue still stands and we can be consistent with protecting the deliberative process and making [a detailed transcript] available if they're willing to protect that over time And, as we apparently did in the past, we can make some compromise in terms of what others are talking about here--releasing the results in a more timely way than we do now, which is waiting until after the next meeting That may be of more value in essence to the public than having the TV cameras in here   Mr Chairman, our District continues to show some modest improvement and considerably more optimism looking forward Our agricultural sector is really trading off between improvement in our livestock business and some deterioration in our grain business, so that overall we have flat prospects for that sector this year and into next year The manufacturing sector is a bit mixed Our aircraft manufacturers are still weak The auto sector is mixed because production at our GM plant is still very slow whereas Ford is going to be investing significantly in its plant in Kansas City, which I think will bring in some jobs Other than that, activity in our nondurable goods area is "decent," as they say, looking forward The rise in natural gas prices has spurred drilling activity in the District; the third quarter was up over 20 percent from the second quarter, although that doesn't bring it back to anywhere near what it was a little more than a year ago But we are seeing some pretty robust [growth in] activity there right now Our construction area is still doing pretty well That is particularly so in the Denver region where economic activity is coming back rather strongly right now In fact, for the region construction activity is up fairly dramatically over a year ago, well over 10 percent Our employment levels are up over last year--our estimate is about 06 percent--and the anecdotal reports we're getting from our directors are uniformly positive in terms of their reading of the environment and their own attitudes The banking industry in our region, with a couple of notable exceptions, is really quite strong; earnings are strong across the region, and I think there's a little more of an attitude of making an effort to get into the lending business again, although [bankers] are keeping the lessons of their past experience close [to mind] Overall, I see some general improvement in our region  -11-    11/17/92  As far as the national outlook, as we look over two quarters ahead our view is very similar to the Greenbook on average although our timing is somewhat different, which I don't think is significant We're looking for inflation to be in the 3 percent range So, we are fairly comfortable with the Greenbook projections as we look at the national economy Thank you   Let me talk about the short-term issues first The economy is showing strength--more strength than I saw last time-- and I think it is real There is a fair amount of liquidity in the system to accommodate future growth should that continue, so I don't  -40-    11/17/92  think we would be hurting things by staying where we are So, I am inclined towards alternative B As for asymmetry or symmetry, I'm inclined at this stage to go with symmetrical language partly because we meet again fairly soon and partly because I think the economy is fundamentally stronger Even though I recognize the downside risks from the trade situation and all these other factors that we have talked about, I think we do have a fundamentally better economy  As for the long-term ranges, I think they should be lowered, and my preference is for 2 to 6 percent [for M2] I believe that's orderly and consistent with what we may see going forward As to when to announce it, I don't have a strong preference It's something that takes explanation, though, and if we try to put it in a letter we won't have the opportunity to explain it, which is so important We need to weigh that against what may be bad timing next February But we have to do something next February, and that is the normal timing So, I guess I lean toward doing it later in the [usual] form   Yes   Mr Chairman, our District continues to improve modestly, although we would note that the anecdotal evidence is much stronger than the statistics are showing Our energy activity continues to improve, especially in gas drilling Our agricultural area is sound, with improving livestock prices offsetting some of the    12/22/92  negatives from the lower grain prices But overall, our agricultural income is still solid Construction activity generally is improving a little more modestly, but the single-family housing area is very strong, particularly in the western part of our region In manufacturing, although we continue to hear about expansion plans by Ford Motor Company in our area, that expansion has not taken place yet Our manufacturing job growth is flat for the time being We hear a lot of optimism from our small business groups They are still saying that they would like to expand even more but are having some difficulty getting credit from banks; that's on their minds still  On the national front, we anticipate growth as we look out to 1994 similar to that of the Greenbook, although our path is a bit different and a little more modest inintially Still, we end up about in the same place We are a little less optimistic on consumer demand, though We also see improvements in inflation We've revised that somewhat; it's not quite as favorable as we thought earlier Overall, though, we think the economy is expanding at a persistent pace going forward into 1993   Mr Chairman, I agree with "B" symmetric I feel that the economy is in a continued modest expansion [phase] But there are some underlying [concerns] that you and others have identified, including where we are in the employment picture, the deficit picture, and the spending picture So, I think we would be well advised to stick with "B" symmetric at this point   Don, I've read this and listened to what you said One thing that bothers me as we look at these simulations of alternative strategies is that you've given reasons for and against why velocity can increase, but this is very dependent upon having the velocity at a rate that has only been reached, I think, three times in decades How confident then can you be on the arguments for why velocity should continue to be very high?   Mr Chairman, I understand where you're coming from on your proposal and I don't see many options Like others around here, I am very bothered by it because we are setting a target that we know we will not be making any time in the near future And  -45-    2/2-3/93  that will cause us a lot of grief as those who are pushing us follow up on this and see that we cannot and did not make it That perhaps emphasizes Governor Mullins' point that we've got to find a way to explain by other means what we're doing or we will be under heavy, heavy, criticism going forward despite the fact that we dropped the range down 1/2 point But it's a 1/2 point that I think we're not going to make right away and that really bothers me   You're suggesting that if we dropped small time deposits out we'd have a fairly fast growing M2, which would only add more confusion   I think alternative "E" should be pursued and looked at more carefully because we are starting with an agreed upon premise that we should be as open as we reasonably can And I don't think announcing an action, whether it's [in terms of] the fed funds rate or reserve pressure is inconsistent with that; I think it is consistent with being open And I doubt that it's going to compromise our ability to have discussions and come up with reasonable policy So, that is one avenue that we ought to pursue pretty vigorously   Just one question on savings Given some of the demographics you showed here, I'm curious as to why you are expecting the saving rate to stay as low or lower than we might otherwise have thought   Then this could be more of a temporary--   Mr Chairman, our region of the country continues to grow slowly, steadily however, with strong agriculture and construction sectors and less robust manufacturing and energy sectors First of all, I would say that our employment picture is mixed, with fairly decent employment growth in the Kansas City area and in Colorado and New Mexico, and fairly poor employment growth in other parts of our region, particularly in Oklahoma Although that is the case, the optimism is uniformly good even in Oklahoma where there's less job growth A lot of efforts are going forward to encourage employment growth where [possible] In the agricultural area, as you well know, increased livestock prices last year kept farm incomes higher than originally expected However, I'm pleased that as far as the land prices go, there's a little speck of renewed optimism in that they have stayed fairly flat Construction activity is very strong, obviously helped along by residential construction And though there has been some modest slowdown since November, our construction levels are still a good 25 to 30 percent higher than they were a year ago Manufacturing is generally sluggish There is a stable environment in the auto industry, particularly at GM where there's a lot of uncertainty in our area And [activity at] our Ford manufacturing plants is very good We, too, are affected by the announcements of [cutbacks at] Boeing, which will affect our Wichita area Generally that will be handled gradually, but it will be a drag because it's a very important part of that economy Nevertheless, overall there should still be some good job growth in Kansas, particularly in the Kansas City area In the energy area, natural gas drilling has fallen off since the end of the year because of tax changes Nevertheless, the number of rigs operating is still 50  -15-    2/2-3/93  percent over what it was a year ago and that is at least a positive event in our part of the country So, overall, we [anticipate] steady growth for the region going forward  As far as the national economy goes, our projection, allowing perhaps for some differences in fiscal policy, is very similar to the Greenbook forecast We have a little slower growth in the first part of the year but that picks up For the year as a whole our projection is very similar to that of the Greenbook both for GDP and for the inflation picture   "B" symmetric   Mr Chairman, our District recovery continues on track for the most part Tourism trade is still good in the region Oil and gas activity, though, is still subdued after the year-end peak and that does not look to be building up Construction activity in the District remains strong; there has been some weather-related slowdown, but that [strength] will reemerge In the agricultural area, there is a degree of greater uncertainty, although aggregate income should remain good for our region But the facts [about] the grain loan repayment and what the Russians can afford after the more recent crisis have put a real pale on things and I think that has been partly responsible for the lower prices Secondly, in the cattle industry there have been some very significant weather-related losses in the area That has driven up prices to their historic highs but on balance it probably has hurt that industry, and that may have some degree of impact Nevertheless, overall our District will continue to grow at a moderate pace, still better than the nation as a whole  On the national economy, in terms of the GDP growth we see things about in line with the Greenbook We are a little less optimistic on consumption and a little more optimistic on residential investment Overall, we don't really differ too much with the Greenbook On the inflation front, our view is that inflation has come up a little but that doesn't really portend problems going forward, although I think it also says that our gains on inflation may have run out So we're in this steady state and we'll have to make some decisions along those lines in the near future Thank you   Mr Chairman, I support your proposal My own view is that we're in a stage where we're looking at a moderate recovery The issue is whether inflation will stay at the current level or begin to rise We don't know at this point And because we don't know, I don't think we should be acting as if we do So, I would feel comfortable where we are and I strongly support symmetric language I don't think we should be trying to tip our hand or anticipate at this stage On the language, I prefer the alternative language at this time   Mr Chairman, I'll start with our District, which continues to show a very moderate pace of growth In agriculture, winter wheat is in good condition and our cattle feedlot operations have rebounded from some winter problems Construction has bounced back from the winter-related slowdown; it now has strengthened in all areas In gas and oil, prices of natural gas have improved from year-ago levels and drilling has leveled off I would point out that drilling has not picked up and is not expected to accelerate until there is more confidence in the price gains and that those prices will be stable Absent that, they are very reluctant to push forward on any exploration or drilling Manufacturing in our area remains sluggish and it is consistently operating below capacity as we hear from area business leaders Banking has been extremely profitable in our region Bank earnings are at record levels in the first quarter In fact, in Oklahoma banks have reported returns on assets of higher than 2 percent  Looking ahead for the District, we think moderate growth is continuing Despite some expectations that cattle prices will come down and wheat prices may also, we still think income in '93 will be at a level close to that in '92 In construction, there is now a whole pipeline of activity that bodes well for the summer in our region In energy, although prices have risen we don't expect a lot of activity unless those prices remain stable [or] rise In manufacturing, the possibility of a turnaround, as I've said before, has been set back by some continued restructuring As an example, Boeing is laying off about 7,000 people in Wichita  At the national level, we continue to expect moderate growth and moderate inflation as we move through '93 We expect GDP growth of about 2-1/2 percent and inflation of just over 3 percent fourth quarter-over-fourth quarter I might add that an important reason we scaled back our growth projection is because in talking with business  -16-    5/18/93  leaders around the District we heard a lot of anecdotal evidence [pointing in that direction] They are thinking about or have put [plans] on hold because of expectations about taxes--particularly Federal, but even the states are talking about very dramatic increases in taxes So businesses are focusing now more than ever on cost containment and trying to get their profits up I think this is one reason businesses are raising prices; they want to see if the higher prices can take hold This has been complicated in the health care industry because in some sectors, like medical devices, activity has virtually stopped because of the anticipated health care program Also impeding renewed spending is this continued effort by businesses that we've spoken about for some time to pay down debt and to consolidate their positions in an environment of increasing uncertainty If I heard it once I heard it a hundred times in the last three weeks Business people are very, very concerned about the environment of uncertainty, so they are trimming back or are holding back a little more than they would otherwise Having said all this, there is still a willingness to go forward where opportunities show through in a strong way, as we're seeing in the western part of our District So we pared back our projections--not quite as much as the Board staff--to the 2-1/2 percent level for growth Those are my comments, Mr Chairman   Mr Chairman, my inclination is to say that although there is some pessimism, it is fiscal-related My own bias is that these inflation numbers are bothersome and that tightening would be the better path if I were convinced that they were permanent At this point I am willing to wait and see a little longer So, I would leave [policy] the same When we do act, though, I think it should be by vote, so I would also say symmetric for now   Mr Chairman, I understand where you're coming from with regard to moving these targets now I have some concern because we have spent a lot of time talking about the uncertainty of these M numbers and where they're going and trying to discount them in a sense as targets If we now go in and lower the targets, I think we are risking a great deal in the sense that if we change the targets, [the implication is that] we must know something; that will be the presumption if we bring it down If we aren't sure at this point, aren't we better to say we aren't sure and that, therefore, we're leaving the range unchanged until we know more, rather than raising suspicions?   But what we are then doing is changing the concept from one of targeting to one of forecasting where M2 might be given [emerging] circumstances--some of which are out of our control-- in terms of its velocity   Thank you, Mr Chairman Activity in our District continues not unlike what it was the last time I reported Farm income remains good within our District, helped by continued strong cattle and livestock prices; and our wheat harvest should be reasonably good Construction activity is being led importantly by residential construction in the Denver and Omaha areas; nonresidential building remains brisk through the second quarter Oil and gas drilling has picked up ever so slightly; thus that industry is remaining stable after some period of pretty significant decline Manufacturing for us, as you've heard from others, remains sluggish Some companies are hesitating; in a couple of conversations I've had, particularly with those in food processing and the nondurable goods areas, my contacts said they had just put off some additional expansion And one company's chairman said that they do not hire without his permission These are companies with several hundred employees So, the uncertainty is having an effect, I think, on some of these activities in the manufacturing sector  Looking ahead for the District, I think farm income should continue strong, with good harvests and continued good prices in the cattle area In construction the flow of new contracts is good, so we think activity there will remain good for our District With some weakening in the prices in the oil and gas area, it appears that this slight improvement that we've seen may not be long-lasting; we just don't know at this time Manufacturing, until we get some of the uncertainty out, I think is going to remain a little more sluggish than it might otherwise be  I have talked with individuals about credit and credit access in our region That has improved although we do still get some feedback that it's hard to get loans; that is much less the case than it was a few months ago And the evidence, in terms of increases in credit outstanding, would suggest that that area is improving  At the national level we, like others, continue to see modest growth Our forecast is also somewhat stronger than the Greenbook, led not by consumption but by somewhat stronger projections in residential activity, business fixed investment, and not quite as negative a change on the government spending side What that suggests to us, though, is that in this world of uncertainty--and especially as it relates to inflation--without some change in policy over the  -30-    7/6-7/93  forecast period we could see inflation at a somewhat higher level than is projected in the Greenbook Thank you   I would support no change at this time I would have a slight preference for symmetry; but having heard the arguments for having already made one change, changing back may be awkward now But on the merits of it, I think symmetry would be appropriate   Thank you, Mr Chairman In the Tenth District the economy, as I say every time, continues to grow modestly Retail sales seem to be holding up Construction activity has so far been strong; this strength is primarily focused, though, on the residential area Oil and gas drilling has picked up in the past and that's primarily due to the gas portion of that industry Coal output in Wyoming has slowed, though, primarily because of the transportation problems in getting that coal to the Midwest and South There has been some interruption there but it should be very temporary since inventories are down Manufacturing activity remains quite sluggish We've seen some continuing drop-off in jobs in that sector just as we've seen nationally The effect of the flooding is likely to reduce crop output in our area in Nebraska, Missouri, and a little in Kansas particularly in corn and soybeans; but there's not much effect on the wheat crop as we see it right now On the whole, prospects in agriculture should remain healthy despite this reduction in crops because of price effects Construction activity should remain good, focused on housing We have one matter [of concern] in the Denver area That airport has about 13,000 infrastructure jobs; the work is to be finished [soon] and they have to out-place that And of course the vacancy rate in Denver, while improved, is still rather substantial, so I think they'll have a bit of a transition issue in that area We also think that our natural gas drilling activity should remain fairly good But as far as manufacturing goes, we see no real signs of strength except perhaps with the auto plants that should be at full capacity Generally, manufacturing is very weak in our area  At the national level, as I've heard many others say here, we are revising our estimates down; we are a little more optimistic than the Greenbook but not enough to matter And we see inflation in check, but we are not of the mind that it's improving very significantly; we're still looking at around the 3 percent range Slack in the economy, though, should keep inflation at least not worsening And the outlook for growth in 1994 continues to look very modest to us In one sense the uncertainty has changed from what the  -14-    8/17/93  fiscal package will be to what the effects of the fiscal package will be and then we add on health care [uncertainty] to that So we see a very uncertain future and pretty modest growth going on into 1994   May I ask Don this question? [Laughter] If we leave it asymmetric for a long period of time and do nothing, do we not give away credibility with that kind of directive?   Mr Chairman, I think a symmetric directive is appropriate and I don't think that changes our long-run strategy toward price stability, which is what we should have This is an operating paragraph and it should communicate what the Committee is thinking I don't see any inclination to change in the intermeeting period Therefore, I think we build credibility making that change now as far as our future actions go So, I'm for symmetry   Thank you, Mr Chairman Our District continues to grow modestly, as I've said time and time again Construction remains reasonably good in our area mostly due to housing, primarily in the western portion of our region in Denver Energy has posted gains and that's tied to the natural gas industry, which is still fairly active in our area Banks' earnings are doing extremely well; in the second quarter, as for the nation, they were very strong In fact, in Oklahoma, which I think was once the worst in the nation, banks earned in the second quarter something on the order of 1-1/2 percent on their assets I was in Oklahoma last week and there were a couple of banks actually talking about making loans! That's the first time they've said that in almost a decade They said they wanted to wait two more quarters, though [Laughter] I'm only half kidding! The service industry is generally solid, although not as good as the nation Where tourism is very important, it's a little disappointing Manufacturing is really weak; durable goods employment actually has declined over the last year in our region, about 2-1/2 percent we estimate, and that has to do in part with the aircraft industry Prospectively in our region, we expect more of the same in terms of slow growth Low mortgage rates should keep housing starts strong in our region, especially in the mountain area where there is a bit of in-migration from California going on Agriculture will report solid income, we think, due importantly to livestock prices; and crop losses will not be sufficient to offset that, including [those associated with] the effects of the flood and of the drought, and also some freeze that we had in portions of our region In manufacturing, though, we see nothing that would show any strong improvement in our region, so we think it will continue to be rather slow as we go forward  For the nation, we expect moderate growth, as everyone else does, although we are somewhat stronger than the Greenbook We also expect modest inflation, about the same as the Greenbook Some of that comes from a little stronger growth in business fixed investment and a little more accumulation of inventories, but basically we see very modest growth going forward Because of our stronger growth projections, we see employment being a little better than what the Greenbook shows but, again, not enough to change how we view the economy into 1994   "B" symmetric   To follow up a bit on Governor Phillip's question, we really have two issues before us How we respond to Mr Gonzalez and the issue on releasing this to the public If I understand it, one of your options is to release lightly edited historical transcripts to the public Is it an option to generate the equivalent of a memo of discussion and hold the raw [transcript] 30 years? Or is that--   Yes, in order not to be releasing even lightly edited transcripts to the public that could be misinterpreted just six years back, could we say we'll prepare memos of discussion going back and we'll hold the raw [transcript] for 30 years Is that an option?   Okay, for the raw transcripts So that's what gets--   I see   That's because once we've done that, we'd have to release the [transcripts], the way it looks under FOIA   Okay, and that's not the case with a lightly edited version? The Archivist is saying that if we release a lightly edited transcript, then we do not retain the raw [transcript]?   Okay   Mr Chairman, I would start by perhaps echoing a little of what President Boehne said Whatever proposal we come forward with, if it is not accepted we should take the opportunity to present our case again in a hearing before the full Committee I think it needs to be reiterated that we are indeed the most open central bank in the world and that we do release very detailed minutes now I don't think that is appreciated as much as it perhaps should be   I understand that And I'd say that if what we propose gets no acceptance whatever, we should take the opportunity to present our case again before the whole Committee and reiterate those points We just absolutely have to It's very important to show how open we are and how detailed our minutes are What is happening, and we can see it now, is the very beginnings of disrupting the process What one may say in an open discussion, what may be a speculative gesture for discussion purposes, is likely to be taken out of context if this information is released quickly after a meeting So, I think that's very important  As for your proposals then, given the answers to the questions that have been asked, I see that we probably must go back and release lightly edited transcripts as you are suggesting with the proper redactions and so forth I favor five years minimum going back because there are [issues] of privacy here And there is the fact that very detailed minutes have been released in the past Going forward, appearance is an issue; and if there is not a big difference between Memoranda of Discussion and lightly edited transcripts, perhaps lightly edited is a better way However, the Memorandum of Discussion is fine with me I feel very strongly that [the lag] should be five years, not three years, because the longer the time period the less disruptive it will be to the process, which is so important That's why I would go for the five years   My first choice is lightly edited without annotation; my second is raw with annotation   Ten and five   Edited first; MOD second   Mr Chairman, our District's economy continues to grow at a moderate pace as it has for several months There are really no major changes Construction remains strong with most of the growth in housing Nonresidential construction will slow a little because of some major infrastructure projects coming to completion, but I don't think that will have a significant effect on our region The energy sector has slowed slightly because of lower prices Our services and retail areas remain solid The manufacturing area remains sluggish but there are some signs of improvement, especially  -70-    11/16/93  in the non-durable goods portion of it As we look ahead we think that [the regional economy] is going to continue as it has in recent months with moderate growth We expect to see housing starts continue to do well Energy activity should remain steady although we don't see any real boost there Agricultural incomes should be good both from crops and in the livestock area Manufacturing should remain steady with perhaps some signs of improvement So overall it is going to continue as it has in the past  On the national level we are expecting [activity] to be somewhat stronger than the Greenbook shows going into next year and throughout the year And for us that means GDP growth of around 3 percent or a little more We also see because of that perhaps a little more pressure on inflation So that will be a major concern of ours as we go forward in terms of our projections and what that means for policy For now our fourth quarter looks about like the Greenbook That's all I have   "B" symmetric   Two questions, Mr Chairman Number one Your proposal would have other members of the Committee or their senior aides coming over as a condition for individuals from Chairman Gonzalez's group coming over? In other words, these others have to be included--   Right  -47-    12/21/93   I want to make sure that something doesn't occur where just they come over and look at it themselves   I agree it would be, so I'd feel much more comfortable with your proposal knowing that there have to be other individuals there The second question is Not that my memory is that short, but is there a possibility that we can take a look at those parts of the transcript where we had conversations ourselves so that if we get a call we'll know what it is exactly?   In that case I would support it   Mr Chairman, our District is continuing to grow; actually it's showing some indications of faster growth through the last half of this year and we think going into 1994 Construction activity is still strong and should continue to be so We note that Intel is building about a $1-1/2 billion plant in New Mexico, adding about 1,000 jobs, and there are some other activities throughout the District Services seem to be good and improving, although perhaps not quite as strongly as some of the information we're getting on the national level Manufacturing in our District is either stabilizing or actually improving, with smaller job losses in durables and some real job growth in the nondurables sectors We still have some declines--McDonnell Douglas and American Airlines in their maintenance operations are laying off [workers]--but that's being offset with other job gains in manufacturing The farm economy is stable despite the flood Stronger grain prices are offsetting some weaker cattle prices and we may see some earnings pressure there in '94 The energy sector actually is holding its own despite the fact that the oil part of that is dead in our region Gas activity, though, is positive; and while there are some obvious relationships between the two, the gas prices are still holding and we have some drilling activity going on there  Within that context I'd like to provide you some anecdotal data; they are not data as such and they are not systematic but they are, I think, worth noting In the area of prices, for example, land prices are sensitive in our region In Wyoming we've had some sales and, in one recent sale, a fairly large ranch sold for perhaps 10 to 15 percent above what they expected; and this was to local neighboring ranchers, not outside investors coming in In north central Kansas, while the general trends are still for price increases around the level of inflation, we've seen sales recently that are maybe 5 to 10 percent above what the trend line would suggest In areas like Denver and Albuquerque we're hearing more and more comments about boom-like conditions We're seeing more speculation in residential real estate; and loan growth is fairly strong, especially in areas such as Denver, parts of Omaha, and Lincoln So we're seeing some activity there In the energy sector, as I've said, while oil prices are down gas prices are at least holding their own But in the sale of land or lease arrangements for exploration some of the large independents have told us that those leases are selling at levels significantly above what they expected So there are these signs out there of strong activity  -12-    12/21/93  and some price pressures It's not systematic yet, but we're hearing this more often  As for the nation, we expect solid growth next year In the first quarter we see a bit more of a drop-off than the Greenbook but following that, for the year as a whole, we don't see the drop-off that the Greenbook has projected We expect some continued growth that will not allow the inflation back-off that the Greenbook [projects] Now, whether that will turn out to be the case, we are not certain But from what we're seeing in our District and what we're analyzing nationwide we think there is going to be some fairly good growth, around 3 percent throughout the year, and that inflation will stay at least that high throughout the year   Mr Chairman, as I said earlier, I think the information and evidence are mounting that we do have an economy that will sustain itself through next year [with] inflationary pressures So I am inclined to see the rates moved modestly up to be, in a sense, anticipating that But I'm certainly willing to see how it goes after the first of the year And for that reason I also feel very strongly that it should be an agreed-upon action by this Committee So I would agree with your proposal   I think we should stay with the current targets as we have them, no changes And in my view we should not be projecting 1995   Mr Chairman, our District continues to grow at a very steady pace on the whole Within the District, though--as I mentioned I think in November and I'll say it again today--there is a little more of a boom-like atmosphere in the western and the northern portions There is very strong housing and a shortage of labor in that industry Manufacturing is doing better, especially in the nondurable goods area The slow areas are energy, except for natural gas, which of course is a little more on a roll right now Also, we think we will have modest activity in the agricultural sector because of the floods and the effects from that  At the national level, our view is that inflation may run a little higher than in the Greenbook forecast for a couple of reasons Our GDP projection is a little stronger than the Greenbook's, especially in the second half of the year But also we have estimated a little lower unemployment rate and we have a little higher, I guess, natural rate of unemployment in our thinking than the Greenbook and that is generating added price pressures as we see it in our projections I would add to that on the other side a point that may be of interest in terms of the amount of liquidity that is in the system In talking with some fund managers, it seems to us that an  -19-    2/3-4/94  attitude is developing--almost a bandwagon effect--in terms of the flows of some of these funds into investment opportunities they are seeing We are hearing a lot of this going on--emerging markets and those sorts of things--from these fund managers, and we take note of that I think it is having some impact on attitudes in the economy That, Mr Chairman, is how it looks   Mr Chairman, I understand the sensitivity of this I have a hard time understanding how this would not be precedential If we say it is desirable to announce this time because it makes sense and we've got this issue of a Friday and so forth, I think it will be difficult from a credibility point of view to argue against announcing in the future should we want to make that argument Even if we have to start our meeting earlier tomorrow, I'm wondering if we cannot position ourselves to know whether we want to take an action tomorrow, and then do so Then, as the questions come in, we can validate that we did in fact take an action so that we're not making a statement which sets a precedent I think we are going to set a precedent   Well, we may not be forced but I think the credibility of our position will be compromised   I'm uneasy about that, but I understand what you're saying   Mr Chairman, I think yesterday's discussion and this morning's indicate that we really need to take action now As for the amount, there is an economic case for doing 50 basis points now and I think it would in the longer term give us a more stable environment Bill McDonough's arguments are valid to some extent in terms of what kinds of reaction we would get, but I think those would take care of themselves and we would really be better off with 50 basis points   Mr Chairman, I have to admit some ambivalence toward this I think that to use the swaps, as the memos themselves imply, to influence exchange rate levels is risky business I do agree with Bill McDonough that they can be used to stabilize markets My question is about the size of the proposed increase From the material the rationale for the number that we are shooting toward now, the $6 billion total, wasn't clear to me other than perhaps that the economies are larger This is a larger number but it's not necessarily the right number for any particular reason Is that a fair interpretation?   I support the subcommittee's recommendation I think we have in a sense committed ourselves to this and I think Bill McDonough's point is well taken We should get decisions out to the market and the public as soon as we are making them, so I support announcing   Thank you, Mr Chairman To begin with our District, I will tell you that it's growing at a strong pace now Recent employment numbers show a growth rate for the District as a whole above 3 percent This is showing up in manufacturing not only of nondurables, which I've reported on before, but of durables as well, reflecting our auto industry and our aircraft industry, which for our region has shown some expansion Construction in the region generally is very strong I spoke with  in the Kansas City region just last week, and he indicated that the activity prospectively for the next 90 days is as high as he's ever seen it, higher than the 1985-1986 period As a result of that, they are seeing some strains in terms of getting access to labor, but not necessarily in wages yet, and also in materials  Agriculture is stable; there is a tradeoff between some increases in price in the grain side which is in effect hurting the cattle side to some degree Energy in our District is still modest, with oil being a negative but natural gas being a positive, and there has been some drilling activity as a result of that Banks financially are strong and are also seeing an increase in demand for loans And their attitude toward making loans I would say is very positive Just to talk a little bit about prices in the region, we are not seeing systematic increases yet in the data Land prices are increasing but at a rate only slightly above the inflation rate in the last survey that we did, and the same is true in some of the labor markets However, on the anecdotal side, I'm getting increasing information that some price pressures are beginning to emerge The same that I talked to said that they are seeing materials prices move up sharply He quoted a figure as  -32-    3/22/94  high as 15 percent in some of the materials that they were bidding for In land prices, I've reported at other meetings that in the rural areas of Nebraska, Kansas, and Wyoming we have seen land prices move up In some cases, we have seen them rise sharply and the impetus is not from outside buyers but from neighboring operations trying to expand So we are beginning to see that  On the national level, we continue to view the outlook as we did at the last meeting in that we see inflationary pressures that are increasing more rapidly than shown in the Greenbook--not by a lot but I think by enough to matter We see that widening as we go out into 1995 There are three reasons for that in our judgment Number one, generally we expect growth in GDP to be above that in the Greenbook Secondly, we see the unemployment rate coming down more than the Greenbook; the difference is small but combined with faster GDP growth it's important And finally, as you know, we view the natural rate of unemployment as being somewhat higher than the Greenbook So the combination of all those factors, in our minds, adds up prospectively to the emergence of significant inflationary pressures Thank you   Mr Chairman, from our point of view, in terms of the evidence we have seen, there is a very good economic case for a move of 50 basis points now I think we need to get to the higher level sooner rather than later Based on listening to your remarks on the markets, however, I'm inclined to go with Governor Lindsey's proposal If we are trying to bring some certainty to the markets, I think an asymmetric directive would be wrong because when it is read after the May meeting, it would reintroduce uncertainty in the period  -49-    3/22/94  between that meeting and the July meeting Such a directive means that we might do something between meetings and I think it would confuse people So, I would favor a symmetric directive to go with the 25 basis points And if the the numbers on the economy differ from our expectations, we can have a conference call and make the decision at that time   Thank you, Mr Chairman My question has been answered   Thank you, Mr Chairman Our District continues to be healthy Housing has remained very strong, although many now expect that perhaps some slowing will come with higher interest rates Manufacturing continues to improve Our auto plants are still producing at very high levels The energy area remains mixed but natural gas activity is still good Farm income may be hurt a little by some fall in cattle prices, but grain prices should be good, and therefore income should be reasonably good overall An executive with one of the larger rail lines in our region that goes to the West told me that activity has never been this high Not just whole shipments to fill backlogs but intermodal transportation volumes are at record highs, and shippers are increasing their prices and the increases are sticking  The banking industry has not been this strong in our District in three decades Our classified asset levels are as low as they've been since the data have been collected We had the lowest number of banks losing money since the '70s, and earnings are above 13 percent on assets Loan-to-asset ratios have risen from a low of about 48 to over 50 percent Loan demand, judging from what bankers tell us, is picking up There is this issue that was mentioned earlier with some interest rate rises--the FASB rule and what it might do to the banks and their level of activity That has not been a major concern to date Capital ratios at our banks are averaging over 8-1/2 percent So things are generally good in the region  As far as the national outlook, we have differences with the Greenbook in some individual areas, but overall we are fundamentally in line with the Greenbook growth projections We do have a little higher inflation projected than does the Greenbook, partly because of basic natural rate of unemployment issues and those sorts of things Other than that we're in line with the Greenbook That concludes my comments   I endorse the proposed moves, both of them The economic case continues to exist for this move and I think we do have a window of opportunity for making it I support symmetric language I am a little concerned about the statement giving the impression that we are satisfied or that this pause may run a while, although I can't think of a better way of saying it That's the only concern I have, Mr Chairman   Mr Chairman, thank you I have two comments First, on the debt aggregate, I tend to agree with your suggestion for bringing that range down As Bob Parry was saying, a lower debt range would make it more consistent with the monetary figures If that could be done, as Don described, without raising other issues or having other things read into it--   That is the other option, yes The second thing I want to comment on, though, is your reference to the 1996 projections I very much agree with you there It is, I think, unwise for us to be presenting specific projections into 1996 because they are often looked at as goals and also lead to the presumption that we know more than what we are really able to predict into 1996 If we do it, we would be well served in the long run to do so as Don suggested, by your making general statements about the 1996 outlook and not committing us to specific numbers   I need to ask Don and Mike for a clarification When you were answering questions earlier about the fact that you assumed a higher short-term rate, Don, you said that in terms of aggregate demand you had different alternatives including maintaining  -19-    7/5-6/94  the same rate or changing the rate What were some of the factors that went into the picture? As you have it here, the staff forecast must presume a fairly strong growth rate without this increase in short-term rates What were the factors in terms of your aggregate demand forecast that you considered in making this assumption of a higher rate?   Why you raised the assumption   And that's taking into account in your model the effects of the moves to this point?   And so you still see continued stronger growth?   Thank you   Thank you, Mr Chairman The Tenth District continues to grow at a very good pace Some early signs of price pressures have emerged and we have reports of high prices and short supplies of some construction materials and scattered reports of labor shortages in the District Also, we continue to hear of some increases in land prices; right now our land prices seem to be rising year-over-year at about twice the CPI rate of inflation At least to date, we do not see any upward pressure on consumer prices in the region Construction activity and especially residential construction are vigorous Manufacturing continues to rebound and we see growth shifting from nondurables to durables manufacturing with emphasis on autos and airplanes Higher oil prices have boosted drilling activity only a little in the District District crops are generally in good shape Of course, we have seen a sharp drop in cattle prices, and that has triggered some significant losses to some of our producers in the cattle industry  Looking ahead, we think the District economy should remain strong on the whole A rise in construction activity is anticipated, although residential construction is expected to level off during the remainder of the year We also think a strong national economy should maintain a rebound in manufacturing The outlook for firmer oil prices still points to only modest gains for the energy industry in the District As one of our directors pointed out, that industry is affected by so many different factors that they are very cautious in terms of going ahead with energy exploration Losses in the cattle industry, we think, will drag down our farm incomes this year despite the good outlook for crops  -25-    7/5-6/94  On the national outlook, incorporating the latest first- quarter revisions, we expect that real GDP will be just slightly over 3 percent for 1994, assuming an unchanged monetary policy Economic growth is projected to slow in the second half of the year as past increases in interest rates begin to affect, or continue to affect, interest-sensitive spending Nevertheless, we think growth should remain slightly above potential in the second half, and as a result we expect overall CPI inflation to rise to around 3 percent on the year for 1994 and to continue at that rate in 1995 Thank you   Mr Chairman, I would point out that even our more pessimistic projections suggest that the economy is continuing to build some inflationary pressures and that they will occur through the end of the year And so I think there is a need to move It's not a matter of whether but when I agree with you in the sense that I think doing so now would get things confused as to why we are doing it in terms of the international market The law of unintended consequences might take over and we could have some further problems from that With that in mind I would be inclined to take the "B" alternative with asymmetry toward tightening, and would look for an opportunity to do more I have no problem about doing so in the intermeeting period if we have the opportunity As far as announcing, I'd say we are down that track, and we need to announce I think the announcement should be very brief and it should say at most that no action was taken   Mr Chairman, the Tenth District continues to grow at a very healthy pace Construction activity remains strong, although perhaps somewhat slower than the boom environment we saw just a few months ago Manufacturing continues to improve, especially in durable goods, and we have seen continued employment growth there Oil activity appears to be strengthening due to the firming in prices; that is no surprise The agricultural sector will be okay, as record yields in a couple of the crops will be offsetting the lower prices that are expected And the cattle market has strengthened as well From what we see, our economy in the region should continue to be strong going forward  I want to share with you some data and anecdotal information that we have on bank activity in our District We have seen some increased interest in the use of the discount window in the last several weeks For all District banks, loan-to-deposit ratios have  -11-    8/16/94  increased from about 56 percent in March to an estimate of about 65 percent in June At banks that inquired about borrowing, loan-to- deposit ratios have increased from around 60 percent to almost 75 percent So we are seeing some liquidity interest there This reflects loan growth of about 14 percent in our District The reason given by banks for this growth is very strong loan demand across the board, not just in agriculture It's interesting that this also is true of our larger banks; some of the smaller banks that have come and asked us about borrowing have indicated that their upstream banks have been less willing to lend to them because of their own liquidity needs associated with outside lending, which is reflected in their increase in loan-to-deposit ratios as well This is supported to some extent by the fact that deposit growth in our banks, on which they rely heavily, has grown at about half the rate of that for loans Also, both the larger and smaller banks around the District report that they have eased their credit standards, that the loan demand is there, and that the banks want to make loans We see some heavy competition throughout the District for loans So the banking environment has changed, I think rather dramatically, in the last two years  On the national front, we like others, see GDP growth going forward above its potential if we leave policy unchanged and we also see the inflation rate pushing up well above 3 percent next year So basically, we are in agreement with the staff's forecast and see some increasing pressures in the future   Mr Chairman, I, too, agree with your policy recommendation Given my comments earlier, I think that it is the appropriate action to take I also agree that if we only did 25 basis points, it would create uncertainty rather than what I think we can accomplish with this move So I agree   Thank you, Mr Chairman The Tenth District economy remains strong, but there are some signs of slowing By that I mean slowing to a pace more in line with the national rate, so the regional economy is still very strong overall We are seeing some slowdown in residential construction which suggests that some of the earlier policy moves may be having an effect, but the slowing is modest We also are seeing some slowdown in the ag area and what happens there will depend a lot on prices Our energy sector remains  -23-    9/27/94  sluggish On the other side, we have manufacturing that is very strong, especially the durables side and automobiles Our services industry is very strong and our retail sector is strong Commercial construction, in contrast to residential, appears to remain fairly good, and we still are seeing some scattered shortages in the labor market We also are hearing continued comments about resource price pressures in steel and in paper manufacturing This has been going on long enough that individuals in these firms feel that something has to give Their margins are coming under pressure and how much more they can be squeezed is on their minds So, in contrast perhaps to our other contacts, I think they are thinking about inflation  As we look forward, we do think the District economy will continue generally strong There may be some further slowing, particularly in the construction area, but we think manufacturing will remain good in the context of strong national demand and as the foreign sector has its effect on our manufacturing Overall, conditions in our District are generally good and I think they will stay that way for some time  On the national level, we see growth slowing slightly this year, but we think it will stay above the potential rate and remain above 3 percent on the year We think that's also true for inflation as we end out the year Looking beyond that, and assuming we hold monetary policy unchanged, we see some slowing of the expansion next year toward the natural rate But we still see an environment where inflation is rising in a 3 to 3-1/4 percent range So that is a concern to us as we look to the future for the economy, especially as we see our own District remaining fairly strong Thank you   Mr Chairman, I would support your recommendation However, I would note that there are inflationary pressures in train I think they are fairly evident, and we might be well served if we were to act sooner Therefore, I would support your asymmetric proposal, and if the data come out at all strong, I would encourage you to move before the November meeting   I don't have a question In terms of this conversation and where it has drifted, I am not quite sure what we are deciding here, but--   What I understand, Mr Chairman, is that we have been operating in a very restricted way in the sense that if there is a disorderly market or some other fundamental development, you and others come together knowing that this Committee is generally  -58-    11/15/94  reluctant to intervene But it depends on circumstances and the proposed intervention is thought through pretty carefully I assume that's how we are talking about going forward from here If it is, I feel comfortable with that If we are talking about changing to large, multiday operations for different reasons than this limited context, then I would have trouble with that   Mr Chairman, the Tenth District remains strong, and the strength is spread generally across all our states Activity is robust in most of our key industries, although there may be some signs of a slowdown in single-family housing; that has yet to be determined Our farm income has weakened in 1994 The current data show that the number of payroll jobs in the District increased by about 3 percent in September over a year earlier, about the same as the nation I should note, though, that New Mexico had job growth in the neighborhood of 5 percent and only Kansas and Wyoming added jobs at a rate less than the nation, although not a whole lot less Manufacturing continues to improve with most of the strength in the durable goods industry The District's key automobile assembly plants have completed their model changeovers They have told us that they expect gradually restored production toward capacity levels In general aviation, aircraft production, another of our key durable goods industries, improved in the third quarter with billings up significantly over the second quarter and over a year ago Energy activity improved just slightly in October, but farm income is down due to poor livestock prices, and that will be offset just slightly by the record harvest that we expect or are having As we have been  -19-    11/15/94  seeing for the past few months, construction remains robust across the District But as I said, there are some signs of slowdown in the housing permits area Anecdotal reports point to some shortages in labor, and that includes unskilled labor in our area Upward pressure on wages appears to be increasing Loan growth in our District continues to be strong although slightly less than last summer; it was extremely robust last summer  Turning to the national economy, my view is that the economy has considerable momentum Domestic spending remains strong; export growth is trending upward With the exception of housing, it is difficult to see any immediate signs of a slowdown Indeed, activity appears to be picking up in several industries, particularly manufacturing At current interest rates, I would expect real GDP growth to remain above potential for at least the next three quarters As a result, with the economy already at more than full employment, an upturn in inflation seems inevitable We already are seeing inflationary pressures, not just at the early stages of production but at the final stages as well As Bill McDonough said, inflation starts out very slowly, and that is what we are seeing On a year-over-year basis, virtually all the price indices as well as the employment cost index and average hourly earnings have either bottomed out or are showing increases in recent months So, it seems to me that the issue before us now is not whether inflation will be picking up, but how much and over what time horizon   Mr Chairman, I agree with your recommendation completely I am convinced that the sooner we move on this, the less we will have to move later I am not at all inclined to say that we have to look to a 150 basis point increase at any time Right now the 75 is before us; I think that it is a wise move I also think we should make as little comment about this as possible, in line with what Bob Parry is saying in terms of the dollar or whether we should pause I think it would handicap us needlessly   Thank you, Mr Chairman The Tenth District economy continues to grow at a healthy pace and gains remain spread across all states and all industries Our bank directors are almost uniformly positive about current conditions and the near-term outlook for our region One key example comes from the transportation industry, where reports show strained capacity resulting from very strong demand for shipments of coal, autos, building materials, and a variety of other products In almost every part of the District, we continue to hear reports of shortages of labor, spanning both skilled and unskilled Consistent with these reports, current data show nonfarm jobs in the District up almost 3 percent in October from a year earlier, about equal to the nation Most states added jobs at rates close to the District average, but a couple--New Mexico for example--were substantially over the average  Manufacturing continues to improve, with most of the strength in the durable goods industries Our contacts in the District's key automobile assembly plants tell us that they are operating at capacity levels following the changeover to new models Major expansions are under way in the District for plants producing computer chips and other computer equipment Construction activity remains robust across the District Most of the recent strength has been in public projects with some modest slowing in home building The energy sector is at least stable over the past few weeks, but farm incomes are probably on the weaker side for us, especially in cattle and hog production Bank credit continues to increase at most District banks, with strong loan growth offsetting some modest decline in securities  At the national level, we are looking for growth in the last quarter to be as much as 5 percent I look for that momentum to carry forward into next year I also share the view that the economy is currently operating beyond long-term potential levels Such measures as the unemployment rate and capacity utilization certainly suggest that and perhaps even an overheating economy At the current policy stage and looking forward to next year, I think we do have continued inflationary pressures that confront us as we enter 1995 With that, to avoid going over the fence, I'll shut up   Mr Chairman, I would agree with those who say that we need to take some action at some point I think that that should be now, not later The best environment is to do it now while sensitive to market concerns I happen to think Governor LaWare is correct By delaying we would risk having to do more later and having more adverse effects, so I would prefer doing something now  -35-    12/20/94   First of all, I agree on immediate announcements, and I like the way we have done it That is, when we take no action, we say there is no announcement Regarding the statement, I think it should give no reason or be extremely brief We started making announcements to make sure there is no advantage to anyone Our procedure takes care of a lot of that and is one of the reasons I am pleased with it Now, if we take it a step further-- especially when we have a change only in the fed funds rate, and start explaining--we open ourselves up even more to misinterpretation, I think Every word is taken a different way, and that causes more confusion than it settles Except in very rare instances, and there are always instances one can think of, we should minimize any comments   If I may, it seems to me that the last part of that should be stated the other way There is a presumption that if there is no policy change, the meeting would end with no announcement An exception would be made if there is a policy consideration to be served, which we would discuss at the meeting Is that what I heard?   Thank you   I would say the current situation is such that as much as I would like to turn the tape off, I don't think we can Having said that, I must tell you that I think Governor Lindsey is right First of all, I believe the tape has had some chilling effect on our discussions I see a lot more people reading their statements I think it is harder to be as candid as some of us might otherwise be But more importantly, I think if we do start seeing the threat of a subpoena or inquiries, that will have a clear chilling effect, and it could happen at the most critical of times for monetary policymaking We are in a sense confined to this outcome of leaving the tape on for now I hate to see this enunciated as a formal policy I would like to see our options preserved for the time when we can seize the opportunity to turn the tape off   As the Chairman has defined the proposal now, I could live with it But as a concept, let me just say, number one, I think that we are a consensus-building body and our success has been very much built around that I also think that nuances and  -30-    1/31-2/1/95  differences are reported and defined in the minutes so that the outside world can see them I believe it would be a mistake to begin having concurring statements unless they are extremely limited I would define that as almost never if not never Otherwise, we invite into the process, as Bob Forrestal said, a feeling of obligation to state a view because one's view is not quite the same as the view expressed by another member or a member wants to get his or her name on the record But more importantly, if there are differences, I think concurring statements invite a proliferation of statements That then opens up even more the issue of releasing the minutes sooner This could take us down a very rocky road   Mr Chairman, as all issues go, I think both arguments have merit I believe a couple of things one, for us to change our emphasis, there needs to be some kind of legislation, and that is partly what this is about Among the alternative approaches that have been discussed, I am inclined toward something like the Neal amendment because I think that price stability is a necessary condition for long-term growth At the same time, I would not be  -49-    1/31-2/1/95  strongly inclined toward a numerical target, because I think there is a measurement problem with that So, I prefer the language in the Neal amendment regarding the objective of price stability I think that having that would not negate our need to maintain balance, but it would give us an emphasis toward price stability that is necessary for long-term growth It also would give us the important discretion to handle shocks or to allow for events to take place which monetary policy can address within a clear mandate toward price stability in the long term that in turn will give us a better opportunity for long- term growth That is how I would approach it   When you say "go first to the Treasury," the Treasury then is providing the backing, not the ESF?   Okay   Let me just ask How big is the ESF right now in terms of its assets?   Ted, why is the Federal Reserve involved in this? Is it because of a liquidity problem for the ESF?   The latter would have us involved for how long? For the ten years that was mentioned earlier?   Okay   I have to ask you, when you say "lock up"-- Are we committing to this now? Is this something that, if we have a change of heart after our discussions later, we can not take back because we are in this now?   I understand and I hear what Tom Melzer said What the Chairman is saying is that things are changing quickly Yes, we have approved it, but what are we buying into? That's what I just do not know   In the material that was given to us last night there are statements about--I don't know if they apply to the $20 billion--the issuance of guarantees What are they?   Would that be constrained by the total of $20 billion?   So the ESF could only advance or guarantee that amount?   A follow-up to that Is it anticipated that we would not have to advance the full amount--our $6 billion or the total of $20 billion--but that that amount is the maximum we would make available? In other words, are we announcing this amount so that the markets will feel more comfortable and will come in, and hopefully that will keep us from having to go in with the maximum of $20 billion? Or is it assumed that we are going in for the full $20 billion?   Mr Chairman, I think my questions have been answered I have a general understanding of what is proposed here There are two aspects to this One is to contain the immediate crisis and the other is to assure that it does not recur in two years or whenever I am very unclear on the process to assure that it does not recur, as you said that you are   In another sense, I think it is unprecedented for us to come into this process with so much uncertainty I will defer to your judgment This is important and must go forward But I have a lot of sympathy for what Tom is saying I am uneasy about it If it weren't for the magnitude of this crisis and your involvement, I would have grave reservations about doing this I defer to your judgment   Just a clarification question to you, Peter You talked a little about, and the Greenbook also referred to, some backing off in the growth of foreign demand for US exports But this morning you are still talking about continued robust growth Am I understanding you correctly? Is there still some backoff in your projection?   You are not looking for a change in Europe or elsewhere?  -80-    1/31-2/1/95   But otherwise the outlook is still pretty strong?   Thank you, Mr Chairman The Tenth District economy remains strong, bolstered by healthy gains in its key industries across the states Our directors from all parts of the  -89-    1/31-2/1/95  District report a robust pace of business activity A director from our utilities industry reports strong growth in electricity sales to important industrial customers including manufacturers of steel, automobiles, and plastics In the transportion industry, growing demand for shipments of coal, automobiles, and other products continues to strain capacity A national manufacturer of home improvement products in our District reported exceptionally strong sales over the last year His company has, for the first time in several years, successfully passed increases in prices to his customers Director reports about shortages that I commented on previously are not coming in strong Whether that is because some have stopped reporting because they already have done so several times or because conditions have changed is not certain  Recent employment data confirm anecdotal reports of economic strength Nonfarm jobs in the District were up nearly 3 percent December over December this past year, nearly matching the national average Three of our states including New Mexico had job growth twice the national average District manufacturing activity continues to strengthen, with most of the improvement in the durable goods industries Our contacts in the automobile industry tell us that the District's assembly plants are operating at very high rates of capacity Construction activity remains brisk but the industry's mix is shifting Housing construction is slowing, while commercial and public works construction is strengthening The energy industry remains weak due to crude oil and natural gas prices The agricultural sector has strengthened on improvements in livestock prices Bank credit continues to increase at most of our District banks, with strong loan growth more than offsetting runoffs in holdings of securities Our bank directors remain very positive about economic conditions  At the national level, I believe there is still considerable momentum in most sectors of the economy I think this momentum will extend well into the second quarter of this year, at least We are perhaps beginning to see some moderation, but it is a moderation from a very high growth rate and it leaves overall growth well above potential I do remain concerned about inflation prospects I am pleased that we have not yet seen an acceleration of inflation at the consumer level Anecdotal evidence as well as our experience over the postwar period suggest it is a matter of time More specifically, I agree with the Board staff's assessment that rates of unemployment and capacity utilization are currently at inflationary levels Given the lag structures, I still would expect to see a gradual increase in inflation in final goods this year   Mr Chairman, I support your recommendations for a 1/2 percentage point increase and a symmetrical directive I would like to say that whether or not we move now is based on whether we think it is prudent on the basis of the evidence The preponderance of the evidence I heard today and your arguments suggest to me that moving now is appropriate I am sensitive, too, to whether we are forward-looking or not, but there is one nuance in terms of what Governor Blinder said that is important as well That is, if we wait because we have this whiff of a slowdown and if we are reasonably convinced that there is increasing inflation in train, we will come perhaps to the point where we get just another whiff with a little increase in inflation and find ourselves asking what we should do now It will be harder to make the move then because we will have both rising inflation and this whiff of a slowdown at the same time So, I think now is the prudent time to move A move will help staunch inflation going forward I think buying the insurance now and heading off further inflation and a larger move later, as Governor Lindsey said, is the right thing to do I support you   Mr Chairman, since it is proposed to increase the access to Class I from 4 to 7, that means the same number of people can have access to Class I and to Class II as you noted It might be of some value, at least to us, if we could also move up by 3 the access to Class II I don't know if there would be any problem with that; at least I want to raise it as a possibility   I think it would be desirable to allow a few more people to have access to less important information for the experience of reading it and understanding it   I'm sorry I made my suggestion!   Mr Chairman, the Tenth District economy remains strong, with strength evident throughout the region Our directors are uniformly reporting robust growth in all District states Moreover, recently revised employment data confirm the strength of the District economy Nonfarm jobs were up 42 percent in January over the previous year New Mexico, for example, continues to rank among the top states in terms of job growth Six of our seven District states are experiencing job growth above the national average Manufacturing is a leading source of economic strength; factories in the region are generally operating at high levels of capacity Durable goods makers have been adding jobs at a rapid pace Retail sales are generally buoyant across the region, although automobile sales have shown some weakness recently In the construction sector, a recent surge in office construction has more than offset the slowing in the housing sector Notwithstanding the recent strength that I am reporting, there are signs that overall activity is beginning to slow Our quarterly survey of manufacturers suggests that activity has begun to cool somewhat Fewer factory managers are reporting gains in production and shipments than was the case last fall Also, loan growth in District banks has moderated lately from the rapid growth of  -27-    3/28/95  the fourth quarter last year Manufacturers report steady increases in prices of materials, with more of these hikes being passed through to final product prices Reports of wage pressures, however, are still isolated  Turning to the national economy, recent signs of moderation in economic activity to a more sustainable level are, of course, welcome But whether that moderation will be sufficient to cap inflation--to echo what others have said--is still an open question I believe that, on balance, there is upside risk to the forecast over the year as a whole I would like to mention some of the reasons The interest-sensitive sectors of the economy may show more strength than was projected, particularly if the recent run-up in bond prices is sustained Notwithstanding Mexico and South America, export growth may outperform our expectations, given the decline in the dollar Firms may be more aggressive in investing in new plant and equipment, especially given their capacity levels, and less aggressive in paring inventory growth than we currently believe Moreover, recent national bank lending data are consistent with an economy that is still growing at a fairly strong pace As for inflation, I agree that the core level of the CPI is likely to move up to the 3-1/4 percent range this year But if the economy comes in stronger than expected and if the dollar continues to weaken, I think inflation could move higher I do not look for much help on the labor cost side because traditionally labor cost movements have lagged inflation movements, suggesting that the best news on this front may be behind us The implication in my view is that the risks continue to lie on the side of inflationary pressures Thank you   Mr Chairman, given the data coming in, I can wait as you are suggesting But as I said earlier, I am concerned about the upside risks especially for inflation, and I am concerned about the inertia Don was talking about that can take place With that, I would very strongly support asymmetry toward tightening and would encourage us to move sooner rather than later   Mr Chairman, the Tenth District generally remains strong with some signs of modest slowing starting to emerge Overall, though, the District's sectors generally are continuing to exhibit strength and our directors do report consistently healthy growth across the region For example, recent monthly employment data show broad-based growth Our nonfarm jobs in the District were up almost 4 percent in March from a year earlier In six of our seven states the rate of job growth is exceeding the nation's pace, and New Mexico continues to rank among the top states Manufacturing activity remains robust across the region Durable goods producers have been adding jobs at a fairly consistent rate, even recently In fact, while there has been some reduction in overtime in our auto manufacturing plants, they have continued in some instances to hire new workers in the last three months There is strong growth in nonresidential building within our District We also have seen loan growth continuing at double-digit rates over the last two months  As I said, though, there are some signs of slowing in our regional economy There has been a little sluggishness in retail  -18-    5/23/95  sales according to reports from our directors and some of our other District contacts Residential building activity also has slowed recently And as others have mentioned, wet weather has led to substantial delays in planting spring crops, pointing to a slightly more difficult year for some of our farmers Overall wage/price pressures remain moderate in the District, but there are very scattered indications of emerging pressures  On the national level, our view is in line with the Board staff's projections We also believe that the projections are subject to considerable uncertainty Our sense at this stage is that the risks to the projections remain on the up side A couple of examples I think that consumer spending could remain strong in future months as employment income continues to grow Consumer confidence remains relatively good and household balance sheets are in good condition I think there is some potential strength in our export sector, given the depreciation of the dollar, as others have indicated The housing sector could turn stronger with long-term rates having come down a little So, I think there is some risk on the up side and that is a possible area for continued inflation concerns While I agree that the situation is uncertain, I think we do have to be diligent in watching those inflation numbers Thank you   Mr Chairman, I agree with "B" symmetric I do have concerns, as I mentioned earlier, that the inflation may be more than cyclical, and I agree that it is wise to wait and see   Mr Chairman, I agree with where you are coming from We have systematically deemphasized these ranges because they have not been reliable, and I think it would be presumptuous at this stage to conclude that we know where velocity is going to be And so I would feel comfortable with alternative I for the 1995 ranges; I would leave them where they are for 1996, although alternative I, which includes a higher M3 range, is acceptable to me for next year  -46-    7/5-6/95   Mr Chairman, the Tenth District economy remains moderately strong, but signs of slowing have emerged in recent months as I reported earlier For example, District employment growth slowed in March and actually turned down slightly in April and May, and the decline was rather broad-based However, total employment in May was still almost 3 percent higher than a year earlier, and our unemployment levels across the states are consistently below the national average In addition to slow employment growth, activity in the energy industry remains weak in our region, and the farm economy has been hurt recently by unfavorable weather and weak prices Other indicators, though, point to continued underlying strength in our District In construction, we have had recent job losses, but an upturn in housing permits and other construction contracts suggests the decline will be reversed in the months ahead In manufacturing, our survey of recent conditions indicates that this sector continues to expand, albeit at a somewhat slower pace District manufacturers also indicate that they still are operating at relatively high rates of capacity use Retail sales other than automobiles have been holding up quite well in recent months Moreover, retailers are generally optimistic about their prospects, although some inventory trimming has occurred Confirming some of this underlying strength in the District, loan growth at our banks remained relatively strong in May after moderating somewhat in earlier months this year Against this backdrop, wage and price pressures are easing to some extent We are seeing price increases in raw materials and manufacturing and we still have some shortages in labor in District markets But price  -20-    7/5-6/95  increases for finished goods have moderated and prices remain relatively stable on the retail side  On the national front, our projections are relatively similar to those of the Greenbook We believe the economy is going through a pause and an adjustment phase right now We expect that there will be a couple of quarters of growth below trend, but at the current level of fed funds we would also expect the economy to return to growth near potential by the fourth quarter and into next year This view is based on the fact that the fundamental determinants of consumer spending and business fixed investment are positive The outlook for net exports, while less robust than earlier thought, remains generally sound Inventory excesses do not appear large enough to require a prolonged correction This outlook permits the labor market and the industrial sector to return gradually to levels of activity consistent with more stable inflation We are looking for inflation to be capped at about 3-1/4 percent, which is not quite as optimistic as the Greenbook Looking beyond that, we see continued growth near the economy's potential in 1996   Mr Chairman, after listening to the Committee's discusion yesterday and today, one of the things that strikes me--it feeds a little bit off the Bluebook--is that if we take the outcome in the baseline forecast as reasonable and desirable, then we might go with a no-change policy In our own Bank's view and in my view that outcome is reasonable, and in their comments around this table a lot of people said that they found such an outlook reasonable This suggests to me that the real funds rate may be where it should be at this stage There is no strong evidence that it is not When we look at the risks, yes, there are downside risks But as others have pointed out, the strong financial markets, the favorable banking conditions, and our own Bank's projection point to upside inflation risks, and that leaves me inclined to leave policy unchanged There is a statement in the Bluebook to the effect that if we want to insure against a possible further slowdown, we might want to ease But I am concerned that that insurance comes with its own price When we vote for monetary stimulus, we are also increasing the risk of further inflation In addition, some members want to ease in anticipation of prospective shocks that have not yet materialized The odds of such occurrences are unknown and that, too, leaves me uneasy about moving at this time So, I think it would be prudent for us to adopt an asymmetric directive and wait for information rather than to move at this juncture based on the projections and the evidence that we have about the real fed funds rate    7/5-6/95   A quick question In your answer to one of the earlier questions, you talked about inflation flattening out I thought I read in the Greenbook that you were really somewhat more optimistic about inflation coming down somewhat In your projections by quarter, you have a pretty significant decline Yet, given where we are in the cycle and given where we are with your projections on output, that seemed a little optimistic to me, although I read your rationale Is there one particular reason why you are foreseeing the improvement?   Thank you, Mr Chairman I will start with the District economy, which remains relatively strong and actually shows fewer signs of weakness than it did the last time we met This firmer tone in the region's economy is evident across a wide range of indicators The broadest gauge of improvement is that the District's employment levels have in fact leveled off after some earlier declines this spring and are up substantially over a year ago Manufacturing remains sound It's not growing significantly but remains sound, with plants operating at relatively high levels of capacity and firms generally satisfied with their inventory levels The District's construction industry shows signs of improving from this spring's slowdown We have seen some movement in contracts in the commercial as well as the residential side Our directors are reporting improving consumer confidence and rising retail sales, and this has been evident this past July Finally, confirming the overall strength in the District, loans at our banks have resumed growing at a healthy pace after slowing earlier in the summer Indeed, we see some signs of increased deposit rates as loan and deposit ratios move up, and there seems to be a drive for increased funding at the banks  There are a couple of weaker spots The energy industry as you know continues to languish due to low prices The District's farm economy has been hurt by a poor wheat harvest, especially in Oklahoma and Kansas, and by financial losses in the cattle industry Despite the overall strength in the economy, wage and price pressures remain subdued; we have seen only spotty movements in prices  At the national level, we concur with the general assessment that the inventory correction is for the most part behind us and that the economy will be rebounding as we go forward Looking out over the remainder of this year and into next year, I anticipate a pickup in activity, as does the Greenbook, to the 2 to 2-1/2 percent growth range Factors contributing to this pickup are continued strength in consumption and business fixed investment and a modest turnaround in residential construction  On the inflation side, I am not as optimistic as the Greenbook While we are reasonably confident that inflation will be capped at the 3 or 3-1/4 percent level, I do not expect core inflation to move much below 3 percent, if at all With most measures of the economy still operating at or above capacity and likely to do so for some time, I think the fundamentals indicate that price pressures will remain firm I will stop with that comment   Mr Chairman, I support your policy proposal   Mr Chairman, I support the thrust of this bill and most of the specifics I agree with the premise on which this bill is based, and that is that by promoting long-term price stability monetary policy supports long-term economic stability as well So, given that premise and given that belief, I support the bill I also think that the proposed bill does give us flexibility in terms of the short-term effects of our policy and it gives us room to maneuver generally I would like to see more specific language that takes into account supply shocks or other factors One can rationalize doing that with the proposed language, but I would feel more comfortable if those types of shocks were specifically recognized in the legislation to give us a little more wiggle room in terms of policy actions that  -45-    9/26/95  we might need to take in the short term But otherwise I do support the thrust of this bill very much   Thank you, Mr Chairman The Tenth District economy remains really strong, with only a few signs of weakness here and there The improvement observed at midyear has been sustained, with strength reflected across several areas Employment has posted healthy gains over the last few months in our region Manufacturing staged a pretty good rebound in August from what we can tell, especially in the durable goods area including automobiles And the nondurable goods area, which had been a little weak in our area, is now holding pretty steady as we go forward In fact, some of our directors report that homebuilding activity has increased but housing construction still can not keep pace with the strong demand in some parts of our region We are anticipating some improvement in commercial building activity in the months ahead as indicated by lower office vacancy rates in most of the metropolitan areas in the District Activity in our energy industry has picked up a bit, especially in Wyoming On the other hand, the District farm economy continues to be weak; it is hurt especially by the cattle industry which is particularly important to our region The recent weather in the northern and western parts of the District may have hurt some crop yields, but we don't expect a big fallout from that Growth in bank credit has slowed as is true elsewhere in the country, and we think that may reflect the effects of inventory adjustments While the District economy generally appears to be strong, wages and final goods prices show no persistent signs of accelerating, though we are finding that some labor markets remain tight And we are getting indications from our manufacturers that prices of materials are continuing under upward pressure  Looking at the national economy over the remainder of this year and into next year, I expect growth to remain slightly below trend, but in the 2 to 2-1/2 percent range, which is similar to the Greenbook forecast Now, I think such growth is appropriate, given where the long-run potential seems to be and given the current level of resource utilization in the economy And that brings me to the issue of inflation I am still a little less optimistic than the Greenbook While it seems likely to me that inflation will be capped, I question whether the overall core inflation rate will drop much in the next year, in 1996 at least   Mr Chairman, I agree with your recommendation of "B" symmetric The reasons for me, however, are that I think the projections on the growth of the economy are reasonably accurate, and as I said earlier I am not quite as optimistic about the inflation outlook as the Greenbook I think we are in a good policy position As for the fiscal outlook, though both the Greenbook and our own projections view some fiscal restraint as possible, we don't know whether it will be more or less than we are assuming and we won't know for some time So, I am very comfortable with where we are right now   Mr Chairman, I just want to comment on the background of the informal arrangement with the Japanese The memo that we got was very helpful In the phone calls that I received, there were two issues that warranted some explanation One was that the arrrangement was a bailout, and I think that notion followed upon the Mexican deal The other was that the discount window was somehow involved and that we would be lending at the basic discount rate to subsidize the Japanese Dispelling those distortions became the duty of the day I think these issues are still a matter of concern among some individuals in the market or in the banking industry, or wherever else the distortions persist I think it was good that we got the memo and as much information as we did because we received a lot of phone calls related to this fear of subsidizing the Japanese   I think the individuals I spoke to realized that That's why they were saying that if a problem were to occur, we might get involved in a discount window loan; and lending at the basic discount rate would mean a big subsidy The issue was why would we allow that, and on and on it went Because they had this piece of misinformation, their concerns multiplied very quickly   Mr Chairman, the Tenth Federal Reserve District continues to be relatively strong Since the last meeting, for example, payroll employment in our District continued to grow faster than the national average District manufacturers continue to operate at or near full capacity In recent surveys, many of them suggest that their operations have pretty much rebounded from the summer slowdowns In addition, retail sales have been solid throughout the District and most of the retailers we have talked to expect a good holiday season Our directors are reporting that commercial construction activity continues to be fairly brisk, offsetting a bit of a slowdown in home building Reflecting the generally healthy tone of the economy in our District, growth in bank credit has picked up recently, supported by gains in consumer and real estate lending While our economy is generally stronger, there are a couple of areas that have shown some weakness energy and agriculture Low oil prices continue to hold down activity in the District's energy industry, and financial losses in the District's cattle industry are likely to limit the improvement in farm incomes, which some of us were expecting Wage and price pressures remain relatively subdued despite the overall strength of our regional economy and despite some spotty reports of wage pressures at the lower end of the wage scale  On the national level, the outlook in my opinion remains favorable By that I mean that, on the real side, I am looking for growth to be about 2-1/4 percent over the next several quarters While I note the strength in the third quarter, I see economic activity returning to this more moderate pace as we move through this quarter into next year But even with this slowing, the economy remains fundamentally strong in my view, except for government spending and inventory investment I expect most other sectors to contribute to growth over the next several quarters A growth rate in a 2 to 2-1/4 percent range is entirely appropriate, I think This is especially true with the economy continuing to operate a bit beyond capacity, by most measures at least With regard to inflation, I believe that we need to continue to be cautious I'm pleased with some of the more favorable inflation numbers But despite this morning's report, I think it is important to acknowledge that core CPI inflation is likely to rise this year over last, and with resource use still at fairly high levels, wherever one believes the NAIRU is, we are not likely to see a real easing in inflation below that 3 percent mark as we go forward I think that has to be kept in mind as we proceed from here Thank you, Mr Chairman   Mr Chairman, for the reasons that you outlined I agree with your analysis and I support your recommendation of "no change" Because I don't think we should be trying to guess which way the economy is going at this stage, I feel that a symmetric directive is quite appropriate   Mr Chairman, the Tenth District economy remains strong overall, with only a couple of our directors indicating some evidence of slight slowing Payroll employment in the District, for example, has been growing at a fairly healthy pace with gains in all our District states Among other signs of strength, District manufacturers continue to operate at levels near or at capacity, especially in our durable goods industries Our directors also report that retail sales appear to be holding up during the holiday season, although sales probably will grow less than they did a year ago in some areas Finally, construction activity has been brisk throughout our District, typically the building of roads and other public infrastructure While the economy in the Kansas City District appears to be generally strong, a few sectors are giving us some mixed signals One of those, of course, is the farm economy, which has been helped by higher crop prices, but financial losses continue to hurt the cattle industry, which is a very important industry within our region While oil and gas drilling activity has picked up recently, the District energy industry remains lackluster overall, with the workforce continuing to shrink somewhat  The final point I would make on the District is that, to date at least, upward pressure on wages and prices has been limited Labor markets remain tight in many parts of the District, but reports of rising wages, though evident, still remain scattered  For the national economy, I believe that, given current policy, conditions are such that growth for the next several quarters will be about 2 to 2-1/2 percent and inflation will be 3 percent, perhaps a little less In this environment, moreover, economic resources will continue to be used at or near capacity levels A little concern has been raised here about consumer spending and fiscal drag As for consumption, I think it certainly needs to be monitored, but I believe it can be maintained at levels consistent with the income growth projected in these GDP forecasts Consumer debt, while it indeed has increased relative to income, is not at historical peaks, and I think it would allow consumption to continue upward Also, if we assume that consumer debt burdens are excessive, I am not sure that monetary policy can address that issue in the longer run As regards fiscal policy, I agree that the budget debate should not be a consideration for us Reasonable estimates suggest, though, that the deficit reductions in 1996 are likely to be quite small Thus, any drag on the economy from fiscal actions will be limited in the foreseeable future at least I also would point out that lower yields in long-term debt markets have been stimulative That suggests to me that in the context of developments in those markets our policy has been neutral and not slightly tight Thus, overall, we have an economy slowing to potential and inflation capped at only 3 percent, and that is something that I think we should keep in mind as we go forward   Mr Chairman, I would prefer that we not change the funds rate right now given the projections of our economists in  -46-    12/19/95  Kansas City and in the Greenbook However, given that we are talking about a small adjustment and given that there would be the expectation, which I would fully endorse, of no discount rate change, I can accept your proposal at this time   I prefer Alternative I I agree with the staff and those members who say it is too early to know where velocity is or what its growth rate will be I also think that if we change the ranges now, we will have things backwards If we are changing them because we think the growth rates will be much higher rather than because we want to target what we think should be higher growth rates, knowing what velocity is, we could come up with different answers I don't think we have enough information in either case, and I don't think that we should signal to anyone that we do   Mr Chairman, I think most of the people who plan for the future try to do so with a goal in mind They should state that goal, and I think such a statement can serve very well I favor the idea of having a price stability goal because price stability does achieve all those objectives that we talk about Having a stated goal is a form of discipline that is especially useful during difficult times when it is easier to drift away from it The caveat that I have is similar to Bill McDonough's I think if we were to do that, it would have to be done very carefully within the context of Humphrey-Hawkins because that's the law of the land We have to be consistent with that law not only in substance, which we may be able to do by setting the goal, but also in appearance There is a debate going on in the Congress right now I would like to get us to the point where we have this goal, but I think we ought to let the debate play out If we do adopt a goal in the interim, we should couch it in terms that are very clearly consistent with Humphrey-Hawkins   Thank you, Mr Chairman To answer Cathy's question on changes in consumer confidence, I am struck by the fact that I have a pretty good report for my District, and I am beginning to wonder if I ought to give it or not! Our District economy continues to be strong overall with only a few signs of weakness in a couple of areas that I will mention For example, gains in payroll employment during the fourth quarter were solid throughout our District District manufacturers continued to operate at or near capacity, with a couple of exceptions Good growth in the durable goods manufacturing sector has continued Our directors report continued strength in commercial construction activity in many, if not most, parts of the District and even some modest pickup in residential  -16-    1/30-31/96  construction Capital and loans are still available and even plentiful in some cases  Although the District economy is generally healthy, there are a couple of weak spots energy activity remains sluggish despite some recent price increases, and continued financial losses in the cattle industry are hurting our farm income outlook even though crop prices are at their highest levels in some years Wage and price pressures remain modest in the District despite overall strength in the economy Labor markets remain tight in some parts of the District and some of our manufacturers continue to report shortages of skilled labor Despite that, upward pressures on wages and prices remain subdued  For the national economy, our projections are very similar to those in the Greenbook On the real side, we agree that the outlook remains favorable, with real GDP likely to run at or perhaps a little below potential Because of the mild overshooting in the level of resource use that we have experienced, however, I think we will see an inflation number that is comparable to last year's, about 30 or 31 percent So, I think the Greenbook is a little optimistic on that front Also, with growth running somewhat below potential, I expect unemployment to drift up a little this year Still, we are essentially in agreement with the Greenbook, and we share the view that the economy is on sound footing at this time Overall, the fundamentals remain sound or satisfactory as we look to the future   Mr Chairman, I would prefer not to move at this time We have an economy that is growing at about potential There are continued inflationary pressures They are not strong pressures, but I think we will be making little or no progress on inflation I realize we are long into this expansion, but there is also a lot of noise in our current data In my view, it would be wise for us to wait and gather more information to help us determine with more  -56-    1/30-31/96  assurance where we ought to be and where we will be down the road So, I think the wiser course would be for us to wait   Mr Chairman, I think that is accurate We    3/26/96  think the depletion of herd inventories has just begun, at most, and meat prices probably reflect that expectation in the context of rising grain costs The dominant factor is a strong supply of red meat that has not been liquidated yet   A lot of mad ranchers, but no mad cows! [Laughter]   Mr Chairman, the economy in the Kansas City District continues to grow at a fairly strong pace, with recent developments pointing to greater strength now than I reported at the last meeting Recent revisions to our state employment statistics showed stronger job gains in the Tenth District in 1995 than previously thought, running at a year-over-year rate of about 27 percent Moreover, all seven states in the District added jobs at a fairly robust pace in January Principal sources of our strength are in the manufacturing and construction sectors District manufacturing continues to operate at high levels of capacity, and our general aviation industry is doing very well right now Our survey of factories throughout the region also indicates considerable optimism about the next six months In addition, our directors are reporting continued strength in commercial construction and some expansion in housing activity As reported to us, loans are readily available at our banks to both commercial and other borrowers  Although District activity is generally strong, there are a couple of weak spots The region's energy industry remains lackluster despite some higher oil and natural gas prices in recent months Another weak area is agriculture, where a continued slump in cattle prices and continued dry weather are hurting the income prospects for many in that sector However, those farmers who do harvest a crop should do well in light of the high grain prices right now  Wage and price pressures still remain modest in the District, although labor markets appear to continue to get tighter More of our directors are reporting tight labor markets for entry-level and some skilled jobs as well Prices of raw materials are showing some increases  On the national front, I think that the fundamentals remain strong, and we expect, as the Greenbook does, growth at about the potential rate of 2 percent With the capacity in the economy being used at its current level, the rise in core inflation from 1994 through 1995 probably will continue, and I think that is a risk we have to keep in mind as I have said before That concludes my comments   I agree with your recommendation   Mr Chairman, I will repeat a little of what Bill just said We have a goal for inflation and maybe we should define more clearly what we mean by price stability in the long term Our discussion so far today has shown the difficulty of putting that in 1998 terms We would spend a lot of time discussing whether we have a forecast or goal and not a lot of time on whether it is consistent with price stability We would be right back where we are anyway So, if we go with the proposal, I think it will create more confusion over time than it will provide clarity   Mr Chairman, the Tenth District economy continues to grow at a strong pace with most indicators pointing to little change since our last meeting Recent employment reports show that the number of jobs in the District grew again in March and that employment in all seven of our states is growing at rates above the national average Manufacturing and retail trade remain principal sources of strength in our region Our survey of factories throughout the region indicates a recent rebound in production schedules and optimism about the next six months In addition, building activity is running above a year ago and our directors report continued strength in commercial construction The recent runup in oil prices and a more favorable outlook have boosted energy activity in the District Drilling activity, for example, has shown steady increases over the last three to four months, and energy employment actually rose in March, the first increase in recent memory  While economic activity is generally solid in our District, the agricultural sector remains weak, and the District's very important cattle industry is mired in a deep slump The liquidation of cattle herds appears to have begun One of our large packers said that their average slaughter rates are up 12 to 14 percent a month over three months ago Although our wheat crop is now expected to come in at about half its normal size, the rains that we have received point to a more favorable outlook for other crops, corn for example  Price pressures are still stable, but I do want to share some anecdotal information I am aware that the plural of "anecdote" is not "data!" With regard to the labor markets, our discussions suggest that highly skilled workers are getting some fairly good wage increases That would include Boeing-type employment in Wichita Those increases are having a ripple effect and are causing some gains down to the bottom end of the pay scale--such as increases to $600 an hour for entry-level clerks In the crafts area, business agents for workers in our area tell us that they have not seen such strong demand for their workers since the late 1960s and that their ability to negotiate favorable wage settlements has improved dramatically So, we are seeing some increasing anecdotal evidence that suggests rising wage pressures going forward  On the national level, our forecast is in line with that of the Greenbook In the very near term, we continue to see growth at a rate above that of the first quarter With the long-term interest rate increases that have occurred, we anticipate that the rate of expansion will fall back toward the economy's long-term growth potential later in the year With regard to inflation, I am less  -14-    5/21/96  optimistic than the Greenbook and increasingly concerned about the upside risk of greater inflation While current inflation does reflect the effects of supply shocks, I, like others around the table, believe that the economy is operating fundamentally at a level where the unemployment rate is around its potential and capacity utilization around its potential Accordingly, I see the upside risks of inflation as noticeably higher, and we should take that into account   Mr Chairman, I would prefer that we tighten now I think we have consistently underestimated the strength of the economy over the last several months and earlier, going back to last fall We are looking for the economy to continue to be strong We are no longer talking about capping inflation We are talking about seeing it creep up, or move up, and that is the wrong direction because we want positive economic growth over the longer term In my view, we may be compromising the sustainability of the expansion if we allow inflation to get much higher than what we are now projecting At a minimum, we should have an asymmetric directive toward tightness   You have lost me, Mr Chairman; I don't know where to go from there!  To address the question as you framed it in your discussion with Janet Yellen and Al Broaddus, I would like to observe that from my perspective the evidence as presented in Dave Stockton's paper and others is that high inflation is bad Everyone agrees with that It also is clear that, given the purpose of money, zero inflation properly measured is where we should be over time Our experience shows that even modest inflation causes distortions over time in terms of incentives and signals in the economy and that inflation therefore lowers productivity In my view that requires that we take the legislation that is in place now and pursue stable prices seriously I think the mandate is there In implementing that mandate, I would agree with Bob Parry and Al Broaddus that we ought to start somewhere I would accept 2 percent inflation as the interim goal if we can agree on a reasonable timeframe in which we would move systematically toward that goal I think we would be much better off doing it over some definite time period than arguing over whether we have a proper measure for zero inflation So, I think moving toward lower inflation, defined as 2 percent, is a good intermediate goal When we get there, we can see how the markets and producers react and discuss at that time whether inflation ought to go to zero and whether we have the right measure for inflation   Hasn't all the discussion allowed for taking shocks to the system into account? It is not that we would immediately react dramatically to bring down the rate of inflation   Mr Chairman, I am for leaving the ranges unchanged First of all, Dave Lindsey made a good point in the sense that, although his chart on velocity suggests more stability over the past 2 years or so, it is still too early to come to any firm conclusion Secondly, I think changing the ranges systematically involves more than explanations It involves raising questions in people's minds as to whether we have changed our attitude about our long-term goal for inflation Governor Lindsey makes a point in terms of 2 plus 2, but I think that requires another discussion It is 2 plus 2 for some, but it may be another number for others, depending on what they view as a proper measure of inflation, and that would affect where they want to set the ranges So, a lot more discussion is required before we undertake to change these measures systematically   Mike, I have a question on the housing sector We are seeing some quite good increases in the average price of houses in our area and some buying in the expectation of further increases That may help to explain the run-up in mortgage rates What do the data show more generally about housing prices? Are you seeing any of that in the data for the nation or is that just a local phenomenon?   Do you see it in terms of anticipatory buying more generally?   Mr Chairman, the economy in our District continues to grow at a relatively strong pace, with gains spread broadly across most of our industries Manufacturing and construction remain major sources of strength in our region Factory jobs in the District rose again in April, and industry contacts indicate that production schedules remain strong In addition, our directors report brisk activity in construction, although slightly less than earlier in the year Retail sales also continue to improve across the District While retailers and automobile dealers report modest sales gains, most expect sales to strengthen further during the remainder of this summer Energy activity continues to strengthen in our District despite somewhat weaker crude oil and natural gas prices Drilling  -21-    7/2-3/96  activity increased in May for the fourth consecutive month and is up noticeably over a year ago The agricultural area remains weak both in the cattle industry and with crops where prices are good but some of our producers got about half a crop at most, some none  While economic activity is generally solid across the District, we have seen signs of very modest price pressures in the retail sales area However, there continue to be strong indications of tight labor markets With regard to the anecdotal information, a major distributor of housewares headquartered in our region indicated that there actually has been a small decrease in the prices of the products that they purchase for sale across the United States, perhaps in the neighborhood of 1 percent, in contrast to consistent 2 percent increases in the last several years However, their wage costs are rising The average increase this year will be in the 4 percent range for new entrants, 6 percent for those in the training or the sales areas, and even higher for other workers So, they are experiencing differing pressures in their costs of doing business  On the national level, I am broadly in agreement with the Greenbook and look for second-quarter growth of 3-1/2 to 4 percent, with growth moderating toward 2-1/4 percent near the end of the year Looking into next year and assuming current interest rates, I would expect growth to remain slightly above potential Like the Greenbook, I believe the risks are largely on the up side Virtually all sectors look solid While we would expect higher long-term interest rates to temper demand, it is possible that interest-sensitive sectors of the economy may be more resilient to higher rates than we formerly believed Thank you   Don, I want to follow up on your reference to financial markets in terms of policy actions now or later It strikes  -80-    7/2-3/96  me that there has been a fair amount of run-up and perhaps even some artificiality in some of the financial markets, such as those for IPOs or indeed whatever market you want to talk about You indicated what the effect might be on the stock market if we made a tightening move now But if there is a certain degree of artificiality, what would be the effect of waiting, and what is the relative risk that we run by letting that market run up further and then moving versus moving now and letting the market adjustment occur and spill over to the real economy?   Mr Chairman, after listening to you, I have a better sense of the difficulties in this process--the uncertainty about the model or analytical framework that we use to assess the incoming data I also appreciate Bill McDonough's comment that we need to have the public's confidence and support I think, though, that we ought to be careful before we abandon the model we have been  -87-    7/2-3/96  using, as some members have said already I would be reluctant to abandon such a model given our past experience Our projections suggest that there will be increases in inflation, although the change in our inflation measures introduces a confusing element Given the upside risks that are associated with the projections and weighing that against the downside risk of a small tightening move, I think there is a very good case for moving now If I were voting, I would put it in that context But I probably would say that the asymmetric directive toward tightening that we have on the table gives us an appropriate direction for policy and we can wait for increasing evidence at least until August I would be willing to wait that long, but I really think that a small move now would have tremendous benefits in the long term   Mr Chairman, I appreciate the breadth of this discussion and for my purposes would like to put it in a different perspective In my view, the first issue relating to our swap lines is our attitude toward intervention That has been the reason for their existence, why they have been maintained and renewed My own preference is for us to intervene on a very limited basis, and I think that also has been a very strong premise for some time for many on this Committee I believe that should continue We have foreign currency balances that provide us with a mechanism for intervention should we choose to use those balances in circumstances that we deem appropriate As they have evolved over the years, our swap lines have been of very limited use, and I think they present a confusing picture about our role and intentions going forward We should phase them out As far as the timing is concerned, the European Monetary Union provides us with an opportunity We may not be in a position to choose the exact timing, but it is an opportunity to phase out the swap network in a rational way without raising a lot of questions or uncertainties I think we should take advantage of that opportunity  That brings me to the issue of liquidity, whether we call it reverse repos or lending to others I am very uncertain about that and would not want to indicate my leanings at this time because I think we need more information and a broader discussion I know on the basis of some of the documents that I have seen in the past that there has been a very strong reluctance to get involved in the appearance or the reality of lending to another central bank or other international financial institution So, I would like to know a little more about the potential liquidity needs, what countries would be involved, and how we would set general criteria for providing funds if we are going to move down that road I certainly would hesitate to do it very quickly Perhaps it is my own ignorance, but I believe we need more information on the table before we move to a decision And I think that is a separate issue from swaps in principle   I think we should do that over time in future meetings   Mr Chairman, the economy in the Kansas City District, like other parts of the nation, has slowed, in our case from a very strong to a still strong rate of growth; it just is not as strong as it was a few months ago Our directors confirm the positive tone in the region's economy, with many reporting healthy gains in businesses throughout the District The rail transportation industry, for instance, is reporting solid gains in rail traffic, and operations are at full capacity right now The signs that regional growth has slowed through the summer include indications in our latest manufacturing survey of slower growth in output than in our previous survey last spring Construction contracts and housing permits, consistent with data for other parts of the country, also have shown some easing, but it has to be emphasized that the easing has been from very high rates On the agricultural side, grain producers continue to do very well at currently high prices while the cattle industry is still suffering somewhat Our labor markets continue to be tight Reports of wage pressures, while still sporadic, are becoming more frequent now, and we are seeing some efforts to address those pressures through improved benefits So, I think inflation prospects are worsening somewhat in our regional economy  On the national economy, we continue to see an outlook for growth along the lines reported in the Greenbook I do not see a lot of differences in our projections and those in the Greenbook We agree with the Greenbook that, even if the expansion slows somewhat, the rate of inflation will register a very modest 1/4 point increase this year and maybe another 1/4 point next year, all other things held constant I think that is the outlook we have to deal with here today or in the next few meetings Thank you   Mr Chairman, I believe that we should increase the federal funds rate now at least 1/4 percent As I read the evidence, inflation is not slowing I think that is a fact and that the indications are that it will rise I would also argue that even small but persistent increases in inflation over time can have a fairly dramatic effect on the purchasing power of the dollar when compounded Also, in the context of our currently strong economy and the objective of sustaining growth over the long term--and I recognize that policy involves balancing risks--I believe that a small increase now would bring more benefits in terms of moderating the inflationary pressures that are facing us than the risks it would incur of accelerating the economic slowdown that is worrying us to some degree I think it would be prudent for us to take this action now The economy can afford this action, and I think the long-term benefits would be greater for us   Just a follow-up, Peter I want to make sure I understand the reason for your average duration proposal Did you choose the 18-month duration because that leaves you within the bounds  -44-    9/24/96  of intervention amounts that we have done in the past? What is the reason for the 18 months if it does not relate to that?   I am sure someone would assume that  -52-    9/24/96  SPEAKER(?) We could use the profits to support our "airforce"!   Thank you, Mr Chairman The Tenth District economy remains strong, and I do not have a lot to add to my previous reports I would point out that our directors continue to report healthy business conditions throughout our District Retail sales and home building appear to be holding up well in nearly all parts of the District Manufacturing continues to operate at high levels of capacity; employment levels remain high; rail shipments by one of our major companies are up about 5 percent this quarter over an already strong second quarter Crop producers are expecting a sharp boost in income as very large crop yields should be combined this year with good prices So they are very optimistic The cattle industry is showing some improvement as well, although ranchers are still losing some money and feeders are making just a little Wage and price pressures appear to have increased in the District according to the anecdotal reports In addition, price increases for replacement equipment and machinery parts are being reported to us somewhat more often as we go around the District Having said that, when we shake  -13-    9/24/96  everything out in terms of the anecdotal evidence, our retailers are still feeling the pressure from rising costs, but we are not seeing a lot of it being passed on into higher prices at this stage  On the national economy, I have no quarrel with the Greenbook forecast We see the outlook much as it is being shown there, with all major sectors in relatively good shape As pointed out in the Greenbook, methodology changes are serving to lower the CPI numbers, but when these numbers are adjusted and prepared on a consistent basis I agree with the projection that core CPI inflation will be trending up over the next two years I think we have to be aware of that I also have noticed, not only in our District but a little more widely on the basis of anecdotal reports, that there is a bit more of a speculative bent to the economy in terms of types of investments in land and in some of the asset areas I believe we should at least take note of that at this stage Thank you   Mr Chairman, I am uneasy about waiting I think that cost pressures are building I, like President Moskow, was fascinated by the productivity discussion and would like to see that analysis If I were voting, I would say that I prefer to move now, but I would accept your recommendation   Mr Chairman, the economy in the Kansas City District continues to grow moderately and consistently Our directors and other business contacts generally report healthy economic conditions throughout the District Retail trade appears to be holding up well across all seven District states A recent survey of District manufacturers conducted by our Bank found that moderate  -14-    11/13/96  expansion of production schedules is in place at this time Despite some generally favorable anecdotal reports, employment has leveled off in recent months It was unchanged in September and up just a little in August Improved conditions in our agricultural sector have raised income levels somewhat, and we are seeing some drilling activity in our energy sector as well Overall consumer and wholesale prices now appear to be rising slowly but consistently across our District Labor markets are indeed tight, and we are hearing more frequent reports of wage pressures for our manufacturers as well as for our retail and service industries  For the national outlook, our projections are very similar to those of the Board staff Over the next several quarters, I look for real GDP to advance at around the trend rate of 2 to 2-1/4 percent There remains, as others have mentioned, some uncertainty about consumption, but we believe that the underlying fundamentals are good Looking at other sectors of the economy, it appears that we can expect solid economic growth in the fourth quarter For example, the industrial sector continues to expand, and housing activity should remain healthy, given the declines we have seen in long-term interest rates While we have a CPI inflation rate that is now reported to be running around 3 percent, allowing for the methodological adjustments being made to this measure, that still reflects an upward move in the inflation rate I think this has been noticeable over the last 18 months As it has in the past, the rise in inflation continues to concern me Thank you   Mr Chairman, I continue to have two concerns One is that the risks of inflation remain on the up side, as depicted in the projections that both the Greenbook and our staff have laid out In that kind of atmosphere and related attitudes going forward, I am concerned about signs of a potential financial bubble Having said that, what you have defined is an environment involving a fair amount of uncertainty about activity in the real economy, where that may be going, and some uncertainty in the outlook for inflation So, I would be inclined to move now, but I could accept your recommendation of "B" asymmetric  -36-    11/13/96   Mr Chairman, I will keep my comments brief because economic conditions in the Kansas City District have not changed a great deal since the last time we met Our regional economy has continued to grow consistently, although at a moderate pace On the anecdotal side, our directors and other business contacts report solid economic growth throughout our District Retail sales have been robust during the first two weeks of the holiday season Manufacturing remains healthy Homebuilding has been strong Of the major sectors, I think the only moderately weak area has been nonresidential construction Estimated employment, reinforcing these other reports, actually increased in October after remaining flat for most of the year Our farm and energy sectors continue to improve Our grain sector reported excellent crops and is doing quite well at current prices We are again seeing some of that translate into purchases of equipment as farmers take some of their sales proceeds and reinvest them Our cattle industry is profitable on the feed side, although ranchers are still losing money In our energy sector, current prices have encouraged small but persistent increases in drilling activity Wholesale and consumer prices appear to be rising slowly but consistently throughout the District Our labor markets, as I have said before, continue to be tight, and we are hearing more reports of wage pressures  On the national level, I do not have a lot to add to what I have heard from Mike Prell today We are in general agreement with his forecast I would note, and again raise some concerns about, the fact that both we and the Board staff are projecting rising core inflation, even allowing for the technical adjustments The higher inflation would be even more apparent without these technical adjustments That concludes my comments   Mr Chairman, given that I also agree that the risks are on the up side, I support your recommendation   At the risk of proving your point here, [laughter] let me just say that I  agree with you on the alternatives With regard to the issue raised in our earlier discussion, I too  am a little nervous about picking an inflation number and target path That's not because I  wouldn't like to see lower inflation happen, but I see problems I noticed in this morning's  discussion that we had at least two interpretations of the monetary aggregate ranges within this  group And if we went outside of this room, the number of meanings would be multiplied by  however much We would have the same problem with inflation targets In other words, when  an event occurs, does it mean the same thing to me as it does to you? I think we could begin  talking about some of the wrong things in an environment reminiscent of the debate about how  many angels can dance on the head of a pin I want to be very careful about that because I sense  that right now we are migrating from the CPI to the PCE We have not really discussed that  issue but we appear to be migrating there So, a 2 percent inflation rate may mean something  different now as we migrate That is why I am cautious about picking numbers For me, the  inflation number is zero whatever the measure, and then it matters what affects us in moving  either toward or away from that number, whatever the measure I think that is what we have to  keep in front of us   I think so   Mike or Ted, I have a question on your oil price comments I don't  disagree with your projection of a decline in oil prices But I am hearing more from individuals  in the energy industry that, given their current outlook for world oil demand and the limited  ability of producers to accommodate that demand, they are increasingly of a mind that these  prices will stay higher longer As you judge this and from what you hear, do you have any  inclination to move away from your baseline projection toward a higher price scenario?   Okay Thank you   Thank you, Mr Chairman The economy in our District continues to  do well Our directors and other contacts report solid growth throughout the District  Manufacturing remains quite healthy Construction activity, while off slightly due to weather  conditions, is keeping pace with activity of a year ago I might mention that  who is involved with indicated that they had a very strong year  covers much of the western part of the United States, and what is happening to them provides a  pretty good idea of developments in the area's economy more generally I would like to share  some of that In terms of monthly year-over-year data, had  increased more than 6 percent for the sixth consecutive month in December Shipments of the  leading commodity groups were all posting increases, with energy products up 11 percent--a lot  of that being coal hauled out of Wyoming Intermodal shipments were up 8 percent; finished  automobiles were up 4 percent despite some lingering effects of the auto strike, and automotive  parts were up 11 percent This activity continued through January, and while results were under  budget last month they would have been on budget except for the weather conditions in the  western part of the system So, with this very good start for 1997, they  are looking for a very good year again  Reinforcing this generally favorable information from our District and from  particularly, we also saw some pretty sharp increases in District employment  for both October and November And on the basis of some of the anecdotal information we are    2/4-5/97  getting, such increases seem to be continuing in December In our region's energy sector,  drilling activity is up significantly over a year ago because of the effects of the cold weather on  oil prices Retail prices, I must continue to report, are not showing any sizable increases, but  wage pressures continue to be reported in our labor markets and these are becoming more  prevalent  On the national level, while I may differ on the components, I am in broad agreement  with the outlook presented by the staff here today In particular, I expect real GDP to grow at or  slightly above its long-run potential this year and on into next With GDP growth coming in  faster than expected in the fourth quarter of last year, I think the economy is further beyond its  long-run production capacity than we thought in December  I want to make one specific observation on the topic of inflation Coming back to my  question earlier to Ted Truman, I have some concern that the energy price increases that we saw  last year may not be as transitory as we may have thought Energy prices may come down but  perhaps not as much we had originally thought, given some of the conversations we have had  with contacts in the energy industry I also am concerned that the moderation in compensation  costs, particularly in the benefits areas, may be reversed as we go further into this year Looking  ahead then and given the current stance of policy, I would expect the economy to continue to  grow above trend, perhaps only slightly so, and inflation to creep up systematically as we look  forward to the next 12 to 18 months   Mr Chairman, I understand your argument I have to confess,  though, that I have some concerns about waiting The market is now aware that we experienced  very strong economic growth last year and that we are seeing some of the effects of that growth  in terms of capacity use and so forth As we go down the road, I do not think that the public will  be able to distinguish between a growth rate that is slowing from 2 percent to nothing versus  slowing from 3 percent plus down to 2 percent or a bit less So, if we do not move now, I think  people will be even more convinced that we will not take action under circumstances of slowing  growth We may therefore find ourselves more paralyzed at the next meeting, and that could  cause us some problems that will be very difficult to deal with   I understand   But I think that perception exists In any event, we now see at least a  reasonable consensus that higher inflation is in prospect, and that is what we should act on If we  do not move when we have that sort of consensus, I think we will find ourselves in a more  difficult position in terms of taking action down the road   Okay   Thank you, Mr Chairman The Tenth District economy continues  to grow at a robust pace As reported by our directors and other business contacts, growth is  strong across the board in all District states and in just about all industries Our  manufacturing survey suggests that firms continue to project strong production activity as  they look forward For example, one of the high-tech firms, Sun Microsystems, announced  plans to build a one million square foot plant in Denver and to add between three and four  thousand employees Reinforcing some of this anecdotal evidence, we know that District  employment growth in the last year has been somewhat higher than that for the nation as a  whole We know that bank credit has been growing in our region; it has been down more  recently, but that is seasonal The farm economy and the energy economy in the District are  both in good shape for now One crop, winter wheat, never has been in better shape in most  people's memory, so there should be an excellent harvest this year, assuming the weather  cooperates In the drilling area, activity is very high, higher than a year ago, and even though  both oil and gas prices have slipped somewhat, our producers remain profitable Retail  prices generally are holding steady, but wage pressures are continuing to rise Most of our  directors and other contacts describe our labor market as tight, and this includes both our  smaller manufacturers and some of the larger firms, such as Boeing and Eastman Kodak, that  have operations in the District  Nationally, I think the best way for me to describe our outlook is to say that we are  basically in agreement with the direction of the Greenbook forecast, though we do not see as    3/25/97  much strength in some of the components But in terms of where we see real growth,  nominal growth, employment levels, and inflation, we are fundamentally in agreement I  will not comment more specifically other than to note our concerns about the inflation  outlook as presented in the Greenbook and in our own projections   Mr Chairman, I support your recommendation on the federal  funds rate Though I might prefer asymmetry, given your comments I would also support  symmetry   Peter, in your statement, you said that you thought there were  more adjustments to come in the dollar/yen I don't know if that had to do with portfolio  adjustments Can you elaborate on that just a little?   Thank you, Mr Chairman The economy in the Kansas City  District remains strong, but as others around this table have mentioned with regard to their    5/20/97  regional economies, growth in our District has slowed a bit from the-rapid pace of late 1996  and early 1997 Manufacturing and services remain the primary engines of growth in our  seven states Manufacturers are operating at high levels of capacity, and growth in  service-related jobs is quite brisk Manufacturing activity has been slowed somewhat  because of strikes The six-week strike at the GM plant in Oklahoma City has idled about  3,500 workers The strike issue centers on GM's earlier decision to cut about 900 temporary  workers from its workforce and, as reported to me, that has resulted in a union complaint that  the cut is too large The union wants GM to hire some permanent workers, several hundred  in fact There also is a steel strike in Kansas City that is affecting about 1,000 employees  The issues there are outsourcing and pension benefits; they do not currently involve wages  Data for the District states suggest that our employment has been about flat since March,  indicating some easing in the region's pace of growth  Our farm economy and energy sectors are in good shape The District's winter  wheat crop is in good condition despite freeze damage in some local areas Soybean prices  have risen, and this is going to be beneficial to producers in our area Solid cattle prices are  giving the cattle industry its best profits in a couple of years In the energy sector, the recent  drop in oil and gas prices has not yet affected production Drilling activity is much higher  than it was a year ago In fact, there are some reports of capacity constraints in areas like  Wyoming where reported shortages of trained crews are hampering activity  Retail prices continue to hold steady in our District The labor markets are tight  and we continue to hear reports of wage pressures An informal survey of firms in our region  conducted by our Branch directors indicates tight labor markets in nearly all cities in the  District Labor shortages are pronounced for entry-level workers, as you have heard from    5/20/97  others here, and also for computer and other high-tech professionals Several firms are  reporting bigger wage hikes than normal, although the number of such firms is about the  same as a month ago or so So, we are not seeing an acceleration  On the national economy, we anticipate as does the staff forecast that the  expansion in economic activity will moderate in the second quarter after unusually rapid  growth in the first However, our estimates do not have the expansion slowing as  dramatically in the immediate future as does the Greenbook Consumer and business  confidence remains high and income and employment growth appears solid and able to  support substantial growth going forward Despite this and the fact that resource utilization  has continued high, inflation has been surprisingly well-behaved Thus, while I remain  concerned and alert regarding the inflation outlook, it is difficult to assess its near-term  course with any great certainty  Returning for a moment to District developments, like Jerry Jordan I have done  quite a bit of traveling, and what I found particularly interesting in my meetings with labor,  consumer, and business groups is a uniform view that the Fed should ease off in terms of  contemplating any preemptive move I found that an amazing change because when I went  out before, I heard many people saying that we were doing a good job, that we needed to be  vigilant, and that we needed to be ready to act I no longer hear that One group, a rural  group, said that "you guys need to chill out," to use their phrase What I am saying is that  while we can build a case for a move, the fact that we have not seen the anticipated rise in  inflation come through is leaving a very large number of people less patient with any kind of  action It is a noticeable change from 6 or 8 months ago, and I wanted to report that today  Thank you    5/20/97   Mr Chairman, like some others around the table, I would like to  move steadily and persistently toward price stability as measured somehow This will  require some further tightening and I think the economy could absorb that tightening rather  well However, it is also very apparent to me--I commented on this earlier--that this will  require a further debate, perhaps within this Committee but certainly with the public We  will have to make a greater effort to educate the public before they will accept the need for  some further tightening of policy For that reason, I would accept and support your  recommendation and encourage us to make a very conscientious effort to improve our public  educational activities   Thank you, Mr Chairman I have a couple of comments First, I  agree that this is a good paper and the right time to be talking about this issue It is an issue that  has to be put in the context, as you mentioned, of the more important goal of sustainable growth  When we put it in that context, it becomes a very important discussion item From that  perspective, what has been brought to the table is the realization that, regardless of the price  measure we may have in mind, we are not at price stability That is something we should keep in  front of us, continue to talk about, and introduce to the public at some point so as to broaden its  education on this issue With that in mind, I think we should take the paper and this discussion  to the next step, namely what it might mean from a policy standpoint and how we might proceed  With regard to your point about looking further ahead, ten years or whatever, to  anticipate what will be happening in the economy, I agree that conditions then will be  substantially different However, I am not convinced that prospective changes over that period  will be substantially more pronounced than those we have gone through over the past 10 or 15  years How we deal with the changes ahead is part of this discussion of how we measure prices  and define price stability We are constantly refining our thinking on that, and I think that is  what we will have to continue to do going forward In that regard, having this analysis and  working definition of price stability is very helpful and can assist us in our discussions as we  work toward making progress in achieving our price stability objective   Mr Chairman, I also agree with your suggestion and would prefer to  stay with alternative I I want to comment, though, on a point that Jerry Jordan made As I read  the Bluebook this time, I found myself facing a choice If I concluded that I wanted to use these  aggregates as indicators of our projections, then I would choose one alternative If I decided to    7/1-2/97  use them as targets with an assumed velocity, I would choose another If we do get to the point  where we are starting to put weight on these aggregates, I think we will need a careful discussion  of how we want to use them Otherwise, we are going to have split votes as we tend to do on  issues such as the interpretation of alternative I versus alternative II   Thank you, Mr Chairman Economic activity remains strong in the  Kansas City District, with only a few signs of slowing Our directors and other business contacts  report solid economic growth throughout the District Retail sales have been robust and  manufacturing remains quite healthy Two strikes that I mentioned at our last meeting have  ended satisfactorily, with some 4,200 or so workers back to work Conditions have continued to  improve in the District's farm and energy sectors The District's wheat harvest is under way and    7/1-2/97  expectations are that we will have the largest crop since 1994 Also, cattle prices have improved  and ranchers are now making modest profits In the energy sector, drilling activity registered  another small gain in May despite some decline in oil and gas prices Tempering some of the  positive economic news for our District, construction activity has tended to level off and total  employment fell slightly in April even after adjustment for strikes  Retail prices are holding steady in the Kansas City District, but labor markets are tight  and we continue to hear reports of wage pressures Many firms continue to have difficulty filling  entry-level positions and hiring skilled workers Our quote of the month is from one of our  directors in Southern Oklahoma who reported that labor markets were so tight in his town that  everyone was working who wanted to and some were working who did not want to [Laughter]  Several branch directors and other respondents that we survey informally reported above normal  wage increases in their markets, especially at the entry level For example, the owner of one of  our large retail chains reported that entry-level wages have increased somewhere in the  neighborhood of 10 percent plus over the last year However, this rate of increase is spotty; we  do not see wages pressing up at those rates uniformly across the District  On the national front, despite the more moderate pace of growth in the second quarter,  the economy appears to be fundamentally strong We would agree with much of what was said  in the Greenbook We expect real GDP growth to pick up somewhat in the second half of the  year and then likely move toward trend in 1998 Consumer spending should grow at a relatively  strong pace Contributing factors are solid employment, high levels of consumer confidence, and  substantial gains in the stock market Spending on business equipment should also remain  strong, rising in response to corporate profits and elevated stock prices While there is a great    7/1-2/97  deal of uncertainty about the inflation outlook, and we share that uncertainty, our projections for  economic activity and those in the Greenbook certainly suggest that the inflation risks remain on  the upside We continue to be sensitive to those risks in our analysis of the economy With that  I will stop, Mr Chairman   I would like to see clearer language We might want to negotiate  whether this is it, but I think we definitely could use clearer language   Mr Chairman, I can accept your proposal today with no difficulty  However, I do want to make a couple of comments I will preface them by observing that I  understand the complexity of the issue that was raised in our discussion over the last couple of  days and illustrated by the models in the Bluebook But I also must confess that I am a person of  the price stability faith With that in mind, I think it is interesting that as output has  strengthened, inflation has declined Though there are difficulties involved in explaining that, as  you have pointed out, Mr Chairman, it is a fact that we have seen an improvement in output  even as inflation has fallen from modest levels to more modest levels We need to keep that in  mind I also believe, however, that we are not yet at price stability So I have to wonder if some  small increase in the federal funds rate might not be wise I see the desirability of some  tightening not just as an insurance policy against increasing inflation but as a further step toward  price stability where the tradeoffs between recession and inflation are less dangerous in my  opinion We may have an opportunity here, if not now then at some time in the near future, to    7/1-2/97  move toward price stability if we do it carefully In my view, that is one of the objectives in  addition to preventing higher inflation that we should consider as we contemplate policy in the  future   Thank you, Mr Chairman As far as our District goes, not a great deal  has changed since our last meeting, so I will summarize developments and highlight a couple of    8/19/97  them for you Generally, we have a robust economy that is growing modestly; we have strong  production and increased sales overseas Our manufacturing sector is operating at high levels of  capacity, including the airline industry with Boeing and the auto industry with GM and Ford The  energy companies are continuing to expand in the District and are experiencing some production  backups because of supply constraints Bank lending picked up in July, with banking contacts  reporting a fair amount of activity With regard to the agricultural sector, you may have read about  our excellent wheat crop Kansas will have a record harvest of just under 500 million bushels, and  that comes after a spring forecast of a decline in production There is some pressure on the corn  crop and current estimates are coming in a little lower than earlier forecasts How that will turn out  remains to be seen  One of the topics about which we have talked a lot at these meetings is the cost of  worker benefits We had interesting conversations with an executive of They  are estimating that premiums probably will increase by 3 to 8 percent in 1998, partly because  capacity is being wrung out of the system and demand continues to increase  We are seeing some indications of moderating growth in our District Our employment  growth has fallen over the last two months for which we have data, the last one being June We do  not know if that slowing is partly due to the fact that we have such low unemployment rates to  begin with The rate is 2 percent in Nebraska and around 4 percent in some areas that are  experiencing our worst unemployment Also, manufacturers are saying that while their production  is still expanding, the growth is moderating Some of them are rethinking their projections and are  forecasting more modest growth going forward In construction, we have seen some moderation in  our region, especially in housing The latter is concentrated in the mountain areas around Denver  and Albuquerque, and it may be in part the result of a slowdown in in-migration However, the    8/19/97  moderation in those areas is being offset to some extent by pickups in the eastern parts of the  District Overall, District business activity is good, but there are some mixed signals and slowing  in some areas  On the national front, our projections of GDP and inflation are similar to the projections  presented here by the staff We do not have any real disagreements We currently see the economy  expanding at a pace a bit over potential, with only slight increases in inflation I will end with that,  Mr Chairman   Agree   Thank you, Mr Chairman The Tenth District economy continues  strong Our manufacturing sector is still operating at very high levels of capacity District retailers  are again experiencing good sales after a slowdown this summer The energy sector is strong The  District farm economy is in uniformly good condition; that includes both our grain and cattle  industries The construction sector has shown some slowing over the last several months but from  elevated levels to more moderate levels of activity We have seen some slowing in our labor  markets, but that may be due largely to the fact that we had very low unemployment to begin with,  anywhere from 2 percent to 4 percent across the District In the circumstances, our labor markets  remain quite tight and we are continuing to see some evidence of wage pressures across the board  That includes entry-level workers, technicians, engineers, and so forth Wages for entry-level jobs  are now reported as starting at about $10 per hour in the Denver area, and entry-level wages are  rising elsewhere in the District Mike Prell and others have mentioned that medical costs are  expected to increase, and we too are seeing evidence of that In fact, who is an  executive with said that they expect premium increases of 4 to 6 percent or  higher and that half of the health plans in Colorado are now losing money So, they are going to  push to recover their rising costs    9/30/97  On the inflation front we have not seen widespread increases in prices, but there are  indications of higher prices in some sectors such as the transportation industry Some of our major  railroads have pushed through price increases Their customers have complained, but since the  trucking industry is doing the same thing, competition is not forcing the railroads to back off  On the national level, I would be skeptical about pushing the concept that we are  experiencing a new paradigm I do think, though, that business cycles do not repeat themselves  exactly as we have seen in the past A host of special factors seem to be affecting various parts of  the economy, but fundamental economic forces may well come back to bear on the course of this  cycle I am alerted to that possibility when I look at the level of resource utilization throughout the  economy, and that makes me skeptical of the explanation that we have a new paradigm that will  last I do not mean to ignore some other developments, which I will keep in mind when Don Kohn  presents his alternatives to us a little later These include a real fed funds rate that remains high in  an historical context, core CPI inflation that has been trending lower, pipeline inflation that is  essentially absent right now, inflation expectations that continue to be stable for now, inflation  indicators that are pointing downward, a dollar that is higher at this point, and long-term rates that  are lower than they were somewhat earlier That is the other side of the coin that everyone is  talking about and debating, and we have to keep it in mind as we raise concerns about the level of  resource utilization and its implications for inflation Thank you   Mr Chairman, without putting odds on what we need to do at the next  meeting, I think I understand where you are coming from, and I can support your recommendation   Mike, I had a question in reading the Greenbook As you look out  beyond this year, you are forecasting a slowing in GDP growth, and even though you have  reduced the rate of increase in inflation, the inflation trend is still positive As the Greenbook  explains the surrounding circumstances, it seems that the primary reason for the continuing  inflation is the projected decrease in productivity, which raises costs Are the inflation numbers  being driven by labor costs?   Even with the GDP numbers coming down markedly?    11/12/97 30   Mr Chairman, the Tenth District economy continues to perform very  well I am going to focus my comments on anecdotal information partly because that  information, though not different from the statistical evidence, is in some sense at a higher pitch  as suggested by various stories coming out of our District First of all, manufacturing continues  to do very well, but there is a very persistent commentary that firms are continuing to do  everything they can to substitute capital for labor The reason is labor shortages, especially in  the low-paying, repetitive-type jobs  Members of our advisory groups corroborate our information that loan growth is  moving up One of our advisory panel members, a CEO, received a call from a major banking  firm that asked whether they should put the firm down for a $50 million or a $100 million line of    11/12/97 44  credit next year The bank did this without knowing what the firm's plans and loan demands  might be This story illustrates a very strong desire by banks in our area to increase their loans to  business borrowers On the other side, there are credit card fish stories that are scarcely  believable I heard one involving, for me, a new high in indebtedness by an individual In a  credit check for a new loan application, one of the banks in our region found that the individual  had debts on several credit cards totaling $180,000 The individual was using advances on new  cards to keep them all current Whether that person was trying to support a business endeavor or  just consumer purchases was a question in the bank's mind, but they did not consider the  application long enough to get into that kind of detail!  With regard to bottlenecks, the Greenbook mentioned some delays in rail  transportation and we are finding evidence of that in our region One firm in Tulsa leased some  trucks to go to Memphis to pick up some of its raw materials because the railroad bottlenecks  were keeping the firm from getting its supplies on a timely basis  On the salary issue, we are seeing continued escalation in the high-tech areas One of  our states was losing their programmers because of an average 25 percent increase in  programmer wages in their job market With regard to worker benefits, we are hearing from  organizations like PCI in Colorado that they are decreasing the waiting period for their workers  to get into 401(k) programs Other employers are increasing their use of stock grants to entice  people to stay or to come on board with them On medical insurance costs, we are hearing from  Kaiser Permanente and Blue Cross/Blue Shield of cost increases of 5 to 10 percent on renewals  and 9 to 12 percent on PPOs for next year Finally, though on the other side, we had some  meetings with a couple of labor representatives and, for example, the one from the International    11/12/97 45  Brotherhood of Boilermakers was talking about wage increases totaling 2-1/2 to 3-1/2 percent  However, the contracts were for 5 to 7 years, and the wage portion was not renewable though the  benefits portion was One of our major companies also indicated that they had now signed a  five-year contract That says something about future inflation expectations  Briefly on the national level, the only comment I would make is that we have a very  strong economy and very strong demand for labor I do not think the Southeast Asian crisis will  necessarily have a contagious effect on our economy So, we have very strong growth, but in  terms of its potential for inflation, I continue to be struck by a number of offsetting factors how  well balanced the economy is at present, a core rate of inflation that continues to decline, the  continued absence of pipeline inflation, persisting expectations of stable inflation, and from the  standpoint of monetary policy a historically high real fed funds rate So, the dilemma on the  national front continues to puzzle me Thank you   Mr Chairman, I agree with your policy conclusion I would point  out, though, that I do not agree with you because of the Southeast Asian uncertainty I agree  simply because, although I am very concerned about the momentum in the economy, I do not  think that we can offer an explanation for raising interest rates today that would be acceptable to  the public, given the price data and the analysis behind those data So, I agree with you on  policy   Thank you, Mr Chairman The economy in the Kansas City District  continues to do well Reports from our directors and other contacts suggest a healthy business    12/16/97 43  environment throughout the region Manufacturing activity remains strong, especially in our  durable goods sector Our manufacturing employment has grown about 16 percent over the past  year, and that is quite a bit higher than the national average Our most recent survey of  manufacturers found that production, shipments, and new orders are all increasing at least  moderately District exports of manufactured goods to Asia represented less than 3 percent of  our total shipments in 1996, so we don't think there will be a strong direct effect on District  manufacturing from developments in that part of the world Retailers reported higher sales last  month and expect a very robust holiday season across the District Our regional farm economy  continues to do well  As strong as this District report is, there are some signs of slowing Construction  activity has been flat, as are indicators of future construction activity Housing permits grew at a  rate of only 2 percent in October, down from a 13 percent rate the month before The value of  total construction contracts fell 6 percent in October, resuming a downward trend from earlier in  the year District energy activity has edged down somewhat for three consecutive months  Actually, the rig count in our District is now only about 1 percent higher than it was a year ago  Business loan activity is only modest throughout the District  Labor markets, though, remain tight in most of the District, and reports of wage  pressures have become more common in the last couple of months However, there is still no  evidence that these pressures are showing through to prices The District's unemployment rate  remains a full percentage point below the national average Almost all the firms we have  contacted are reporting labor shortages, and a substantial majority say they are raising wages and  benefits in an effort to attract and retain workers The labor shortages are especially severe for    12/16/97 44  some skilled positions As one rather frustrated Kansas City employer said, he now feels very  much like the owner of a sports team in his efforts to set salaries for data processing workers He  is being told to negotiate with the workers' agents, and he is only half joking about that But, as  I said, the higher wages are not enabling firms to raise prices  On the national front, like others, I expect to see strong economic growth for this  quarter followed by a slowing toward trend over the next year This slowing is caused in part by  the restraint on some economic activities in the United States stemming from the Asian financial  crisis However, domestic economic fundamentals remain quite healthy, and I think they will  keep the economy growing at a pace around trend through next year At this point, I expect  inflation to remain modest over the next year or two despite the tight labor markets, partly  because the appreciation of the dollar will keep import prices down for a while I think the  downward revisions in the utilization rate of manufacturing capacity also suggest less price  pressure than we might have thought previously Inflation continues to be low and stable, and  inflation expectations remain subdued and are declining at the moment Low inflation and  inflation expectations in fact may help damp future wage demands as we face these tight labor  markets  Finally, although I recognize the upside risks and I believe they are real for both the  growth forecast and the price environment, I do not see any evidence, at least not any  overwhelming evidence, that action is required at this time Thank you   Thank you, Mr Chairman I would support your recommendation on  the "B" alternative, and I certainly would not disagree with you on symmetry I will tell you that  I, like others, remain concerned about the tight labor markets and the possible effects they may  have on inflation, but I do not conclude that monetary policy has necessarily been overly  accommodative I say that partly because, as has been noted, the real fed funds rate has been  above its long-run average I know that average should not be equated to the real long-term  equilibrium rate, but still it has been relatively high I would also mention that while M2 growth  has been above the upper bound of the Committee's range, it has not been substantially above  that range and it is projected to moderate As I mentioned earlier, the utilization of  manufacturing capacity is near its long-term average after the latest revisions Perhaps most  importantly, as you also noted, inflation has been quite stable Core inflation has been stable or  declining, pipeline inflation is basically nonexistent, and various measures of short-term and    12/16/97 79  long-term inflation expectations are stable or declining Long-term rates have fallen in this  environment So, I do not think that right now we are in a position to change monetary policy  Thank you   Thank you, Mr Chairman The Tenth District economy  continues to do well on balance Manufacturing continues to operate at relatively high  levels of capacity utilization and is a source of strength for the District as a whole  Significant investments are still being made in our region Examples include the recent  announcement by Intel of a billion dollar upgrade to its New Mexico plant and the  expansion by Sumitomo of its New Mexico plant that manufactures computer chips  Construction activity generally has been flat in the District, but flat at a very high level  We still find firms in the construction industry that are trying to import labor into the  region The farm economy is generally in good shape, although developments in Asia  remain a concern for some in agriculture as well as in other sectors of the regional    2/3-4/98  economy For example, IBP, which is a large processor of beef and pork, has seen a 50  percent drop in its international sales, with Asia especially contributing to that Also,  Japanese customers are negotiating very hard for better deals to circumvent the effects of  the stronger dollar Some firms we have talked to, as I think Bob McTeer mentioned was  happening in his District, are having a little trouble because a number of their Asian  customers cannot obtain letters of credit, and that has hurt the exports of those firms to  that part of the world  Still, District labor markets remain among the tightest in the nation, and the  number of firms reporting larger-than-usual wage increases is rising To illustrate this in  terms of our current labor market situation, District unemployment was about 3-1/2 percent  in November and the participation rate was estimated at around 70 percent, in contrast to  the national level of about 67 percent About half the firms that we spoke to are raising  wages more than usual to attract and retain workers As an example, one manufacturer in  Colorado reported average wage increases of about 8 percent last year A furniture  warehouse in the Omaha area reported 10 percent increases at the lower end of their pay  scale and, as I mentioned, IBP for all of its concerns about Asia reported that they had to  increase wages over 15 percent last year because labor markets were extremely tight for  them Firms also are reporting a variety of incentives to retain workers, including the  expansion of benefits for their employees Overall, therefore, we have a very strong  economy in the region  At the national level, we expect growth into next year at a pace very similar to the  Greenbook forecast Having said that, we have also found ourselves spending a lot of  time trying to make sure we could rationalize our forecast We looked at the same factors    2/3-4/98  that others already have mentioned, including the outlook for inventory adjustments, the  strong dollar, a fed funds rate that in our opinion is not accommodative at this time, and  other factors bearing on a forecast of some slowing in final demand But when we try to  feel comfortable with that forecast, we remind ourselves of the very strong economy in  the fourth quarter and apparently into the early weeks of this year If the markets do not  become unsettled, I think there is every reason to expect consumer demand to stay strong  And unless we have a somewhat more negative multiplier effect from Asia, we are left  with some real upside risks to this forecast On balance, this seems to be a time to wait  and see Thank you   I am going to sound very similar I prefer alternative III in order  to bring the ranges into a consistent formulation, but given the uncertainties surrounding  the M2 and M3 forecasts, I can very easily accept alternative I as well   Don, I may not be asking this correctly but from reading the  Bluebook and listening to you, I had the impression that if we allow the unemployment  rate to fall below the NAIRU after a positive supply shock, analysis suggests that inflation  will re-emerge Intuitively, there is the differing view that if we have a meaningful  supply shock and it persists, we can in fact let the unemployment rate come down to  below the NAIRU and not have inflation spike up That seems to be part of the issue  today Could you give me a little more explanation in terms of whether you are letting  the model drive this result or whether there are other considerations?   It's a part of the struggle we have been having over the last year   Thank you   Mr Chairman, I support your recommendation I think it is  interesting that we are in a period when we are benefiting from a productivity supply  shock and wondering if it is wearing off, and at the same time we are waiting for a  demand shock from Asia and wondering how hard it is going to hit the economy I think  that describes our situation and it tells us to "wait and see" and that symmetry is right   Thank you, Mr Chairman The economy in the Tenth Federal  Reserve District remains quite healthy It appears to be growing at a faster rate than the nation  so far this year For example, we estimate that total employment rose at an annual rate of 7  percent in the first two months of 1998, quite a bit faster than the increase for the nation Some  of the surge in employment was due to the warm weather, which had a favorable effect on  construction activity in our region, but other sectors also added jobs across the District Labor  markets remain quite tight, with some continued evidence of wage pressures coming through  As in the last several months, about half the firms we have contacted said that they were  responding to labor shortages by raising wages more than normal  District firms report that they continue to operate at very high levels of capacity  Manufacturing remains strong The farm economy continues to do well, although there are some  signs of weakness related to developments in Asia For example, contracts in the food industry  show reduced exports to Asia this year District energy activity also has slowed in response to    3/31/98  the sharply lower oil prices The District rig count has fallen about 20 percent since the  beginning of the year Retail sales have been quite healthy in the District, partly due to good  weather, but again the gains have been broadly based across the District  Despite the concerns about credit quality nationwide, lending standards in the District  as they are reported to us do not appear to have deteriorated a great deal At the same time, we  are beginning to hear anecdotal stories of some speculative activities I will share just a couple  with you In one of the resort areas in Colorado--not Vail or Aspen but one of the more  modest resort areas--condominiums were offered for sale prior to construction The prices that  were considered minimum in the bid process could not cover the required cash flow even if the  condominiums were rented every day of the year Yet, people were standing in line to buy one  unit at a minimum and they were often going for two Another example relates to the recent  experience of a small investment firm with a good reputation that offered shares in a new fund  They were trying to raise about one- half billion dollars for investment purposes They started  the new fund in January, and when I asked them recently how they were doing, they indicated  that so far they had been offered about $1-1/2 billion to invest One of their examples of investor  interest was that although they did not want to take more than $20 million from any one investor,  a couple of them insisted on their taking at least $60 million So, some of the anecdotal reports  that we are getting suggest a degree of optimism and speculation that we have not seen for some  time in our region  More generally, our forecasts relating to the broad domestic economy are not unlike  others We see a very strong economy and one that we expect will remain strong The  contributing factors are the obvious ones low interest rates, high consumer confidence, strong  incomes and employment, and, of course, the stock market We do expect some moderation in    3/31/98  growth due to weakness in net exports and to inventory corrections that might occur However,  we think that the risks to the expansion are on the upside in the context of improvements in  productivity that may continue on a more permanent than expected basis as a result of persisting  high rates of investment and further improvements in technology But we also recognize that  inflation has been held down by some temporary factors How temporary is, of course, the  question These factors are the prices of food, oil, and imports As these favorable price trends  unwind, I think we're going to see some fairly substantial pressures toward increased inflation,  given our forecast of an economy that remains very strong on the domestic front Thank you   Mr Chairman, I can accept your recommendation as you presented it  There is information that suggests we can wait the relatively high real federal funds rate, fairly  low and trendless inflation right now, and bond markets that are signaling benign inflation  expectations But there is also an issue of timing I believe we should move fairly soon, if not at  this meeting, because of the information on the economy Our labor markets are obviously tight,  aggregate demand growth remains quite robust, monetary growth is accelerating even though  there is uncertainty about velocity, and finally, there are increasingly frequent reports of large  amounts of global liquidity seeking investment outlets and accelerating the inflation of assets  These developments do give me some pause and some concern So, yes, I can wait, but I have a  sense of some pressure to act on a relatively prompt basis   Mr Chairman, could I comment on whether we should make such an  announcement? In earlier discussions, I have expressed some sympathy with what President  Parry was talking about regarding announcements because I believe more information is of  value However, like others, I think that if we release a statement on this occasion, we will have  set a precedent and we will have to continue making statements going forward I do think that  requires a fair amount of discussion of what the impact will be and how we want to manage that  For that reason, I would also encourage you to prepare the markets in a sense through a very  carefully drawn up speech that outlines the issues that we face and gives the market more  information than would a short statement after each meeting   Peter, I have read your memo on our securities lending program Just  for my benefit, perhaps, is there some compelling reason for the Federal Reserve to be lending on a  daily basis? Is there fear of a market failure? I know we have increased our lending in certain  crises, but I am a little unclear as to why we should expand our daily lending of securities as you  propose It is not clear to me what sort of market inadequacies we as a central bank should be  trying to remedy Is there a problem in the securities market that is impeding smooth trading  activity whose resolution would be facilitated by this expanded program? I would appreciate your  clarifying that for me   Does it require that you go in on a daily basis to provide this  "marginal" help, if that is the right word?   I can see utilizing this for a situation involving a Drexel or some kind  of strain, but being there constantly on a daily basis seems more than necessary That is my  reaction to it I am not an expert, obviously   Right   Okay   I take it that you feel more comfortable going to a price constraint  rather than depending on the current quantity limits   Your words were subtle Is the Treasury comfortable with this?   I have just one final question, Mike If I understood what you said  about the stock market, you described it as a possible source of excess demand in the economy that  would cause us to be concerned Is that what you are saying?   Mr Chairman, the Kansas City District economy continues to grow  at a solid pace, without a lot of change since our March meeting Manufacturing remains quite  healthy Our survey of manufacturing for April found moderate increases in production, shipments,  and new orders Retail sales remain robust Real estate sales and construction activity still look  strong Over the past year, we have seen median increases in housing prices ranging from 8  percent in Denver and Kansas City to as high as 15 percent in our smaller Omaha market There  has been more REIT activity in the District's housing markets District energy activity continues to  slow despite some firming in oil prices  Our farm economy remains stable, but there are some signs of weakness District  wheat production is down in terms of acreage, but the quality of the crop is excellent So, perhaps  there will be some pressure on wheat prices The beef and pork industries are under some pressure,  but overall those industries appear to be stable for now    5/19/98  District labor markets remain tight, and there is continued evidence of wage pressures  Even so, there is still very little or only modest pressure on output prices  Turning to the national economy, like others we have raised our projections to reflect  the very strong first quarter That does turn our attention to the issue of inflation In that regard,  some of our discussions have focused on the issues that we've been talking about around this table  First, with regard to pressures on resources, I am convinced that the tight labor markets across the  country suggest that wages and labor compensation more generally are going to increase more  rapidly That outlook concerns me especially if the productivity growth numbers decelerate as has  been reported most recently On the other hand, capacity utilization is below its historical average  Secondly, we are watching carefully the temporary factors affecting inflation,  although what we mean by temporary may be changing, especially as we look at food and energy  prices that are still basically stable though no longer falling In energy, nonoil import prices  continue to benefit our economy If these benefits run out, we may well see rising inflation But  whether and when they are going to run out is the question  Finally, like others here I am concerned about the financial side of the economy I am  concerned about the high levels of money growth It remains to be seen if the projections of slower  monetary growth are going to materialize I see that as a very important factor for us to consider  because I think the rapid growth of money is carrying over into the financial sector where money is  looking for places to be deployed for a high rate of return that people have come to expect   Mr Chairman, I concur with your recommendation and would like to  make a couple of comments I am very mindful of the Asian situation, though I would not use  international considerations as a primary motivation for not changing our policy I think the  stability of the US economy needs to be our foremost consideration I come out this way because,  as I look at the US economy, I see a variety of factors influencing the outlook that do not paint a  clear picture They do not provide an easily defined rationale for moving now Moreover, I don't  find the argument that we should tighten policy at this stage for insurance or preemptive reasons a  very acceptable rationale either We need some hard data to justify a policy move In particular, I  think we need to watch the productivity numbers If those point to a clear policy course, we should  act On that basis I would be willing to wait and see   Much has already been said, but I want very briefly to reiterate some  of President Jordan's comments If I understood correctly, this model's parameters were  developed in a period when we had declining inflation I believe it is very important, though,  that we look at it in the context of zero inflation and a stable economic situation and then  evaluate the effects of shocks I believe that would be very important A broader discussion or  conference on this issue probably would bring out that kind of analysis   I am open to suggestions   Mr Chairman, I, too, believe in the price stability approach for setting  the long-run ranges In my view, there continues to be a long-term relationship between money  growth and inflation, and I think we will be returning to the use of money aggregates in the not  very distant future Therefore, I would support either alternative I or alternative III   Let me ask, Jerry, was the nature of your question to ask how far they  have left to fall?   Jerry, to return to your two descriptions of internal deflation or  external devaluation, my observation of what is happening in Japan is that they have experienced  an enormous amount of deflation that has not been recognized; they have put it off I am  referring to the portfolios of their banks, which are exerting enormous pressure As these  unsupportable liabilities to cash flows are being valued down and eventually recognized, I think  we are seeing the effects in the form of both internal deflation and external devaluation I think  they have a distance to go Their public estimates of the losses are now anywhere from $250  billion to $500 billion That is a lot to work through The fiscal issue is how much of the losses  they are going to bail out through government spending I think they have a long way to go   It has the highest unemployment level   Thank you, Mr Chairman Since we had a very fine report on the  Tenth District earlier, I will keep my comments relatively brief [Laughter] I will say, though,  that the District economy remains strong Our directors and business contacts report signs of this  strength everywhere Consumer spending is brisk, manufacturing is solid, and housing sales and  starts are robust Labor markets generally remain tight across the District    6/30-7/1/98  There have been some significant developments in the ag markets recently, and I  thought I would touch on that for a few minutes Overall, the agricultural situation is weakening  as farm prices continue to sag The District's important wheat harvest is well under way and a  large crop is expected, although about 10 percent smaller than the bumper crop that we had last  year In addition, recently planted spring crops are well established and are enjoying excellent  growing conditions Damping the farm outlook, however, are low farm prices Wheat, soybean,  and pork prices are running more than 25 percent below levels of a year ago Corn prices are  down about 12 percent Part of the problem stems from the drop in demand from Asia Wheat  exports to Asia have been especially weak, contributing to the low hog and cattle prices and  widespread losses in the first half of this year The weakness also results from prospects for  large supplies of both crops and livestock this year If weather patterns are normal this summer,  crop inventories will build for the second straight year If these low prices persist as the futures  markets currently suggest, we expect that farm income in the nation will fall about 5 percent In  our District where livestock is more important, farm income could drop as much as 10 percent  In real terms, farm incomes are sliding to near the lowest levels in this decade  Lower farm incomes will, I believe, lead to some rise in farm loan problems this year  However, most banks had strong portfolios coming into the year and should be able to absorb  likely increases in delinquencies Moreover, rising farmland values and strong cash rents  continue to indicate that many farmers still have strong balance sheets On a more positive note,  of course, the weak farm prices will moderate any upward pressures on food prices  On the national front, I think private domestic demand is fundamentally strong Even  though domestic demand growth may slow over the forecast horizon, I believe that it will remain  at or even above the long-run trend The first-quarter revision suggests that the economy carried    6/30-7/1/98  over more momentum than previously estimated, and so far the second-quarter consumption data  support that view Even though the expansion should slow this year due to the expected  inventory correction and the worsening of the trade deficit, I think the slowing will not keep real  GDP from growing above the long-run trend I recognize that inventories and the decline in net  exports are a significant risk to the expansion  Recent developments on the inflation front have caused me to revise upward my  inflation expectations for the year The increase in core inflation we have seen so far this year is  larger month-over-month than I had anticipated I also expect inflation to increase further next  year, perhaps as past favorable inflation factors unwind While I remain reluctant to draw strong  implications for inflation from the labor markets, I don't think we can ignore the upward  movement in wage gains arising from very tight labor markets In addition, we are seeing a  divergence between growth in domestic demand and growth in GDP To the extent an  accommodative monetary policy may be generating the strong domestic demand, I think we  should worry a little about inflationary consequences  Finally, the continued strong growth in the monetary aggregates, M2 and M3, suggests  to me that monetary conditions have become more accommodative Having said this, I am  aware that favorable offsetting factors continue to exert moderating influences Pipeline  pressures are small; capacity utilization has been declining; and the dollar, of course, is and has  been appreciating In addition, the historically high real federal funds rate appears to be  consistent with a slower expansion  I weigh all this and balance it out as follows The expansion recently has shown signs  of slowing to a more moderate pace, but I expect it to continue growing above its long-run trend  for at least the foreseeable future Also, as temporary favorable factors unwind, I think inflation    6/30-7/1/98  is likely to pick up later this year I see evidence accumulating to suggest that monetary policy  has become more accommodative As a result, there is a risk that inflation will rise more than  what I would be comfortable with However, I recognize that the data relating to the extent of  this risk remain mixed, and I also am aware of the unfolding events in Asia So, I look forward  to our policy discussion tomorrow   Thank you, Mr Chairman I agree with your proposal I am willing  to wait and see if the growth in domestic demand slows and I am mindful of the international  situation, but I have a couple of comments I believe domestic demand is stronger than is  consistent with long-term price stability We have to be very much aware of that My other  comment is that I do not want Japan's paralysis to become our paralysis in terms of what is the  right thing to do I am very mindful of that Yes, we should wait, but I don't think we  necessarily should wait until everything is perfectly clear Thank you   Mr Chairman, as I looked at this issue and went back and read some  of its history, it seemed clear to me that the whole idea of the tilt as it was designed in an earlier  period was to allow compromise and build consensus It is an internal mechanism for  decisionmaking I think the way we announce actions now is the correct way, and releasing the  tilt will not add to transparency because the directive language relating to the tilt is  incomprehensible If transparency is our goal and we want to have the context of our thinking  in our release of information to the public, then I believe Governor Gramlich has a very good  point We should then focus on putting the minutes together because they incorporate the full  context of our decision, and we could release them earlier But I think trying to come up with a  statement at the end of this meeting to be released to the public at 215 pm and to frame it in the  context of the discussion at this meeting is an almost impossible task for anyone So, I would  focus on getting the minutes in good shape as soon as possible if we want to release them early,  and that would be the way to enhance transparency I do not think immediate release of the tilt  as currently drafted, or probably could be drafted, will do anything but confuse   I move that we start the meeting   Peter, I think you just answered this question, but given the confusion  in the market, I will ask it again When you made your earlier comments, you indicated that the  market has suddenly begun to think about deflation though it is uncertain about that prospect  How is that reflecting itself in the market? In other words, how is this new attention to deflation  manifesting itself in the market's actions?    8/18/98   Better than mine!   Thank you, Mr Chairman The Tenth District economy continues to  do relatively well Year-over-year employment growth as of June was better than 2 percent,  slightly below the national average Consumers are still buying at a fairly brisk pace  Manufacturing for the most part remains strong, although in some areas, especially in Colorado,  our contacts have seen some effects from the fallout of the Asian crisis Construction remains  high for the District as a whole; we are experiencing a modest slowdown but from extremely high  levels Our agricultural sector is an area of weakness Like the Seventh District, we are    8/18/98  experiencing very large grain harvests and large supplies of meat, both beef and pork That is  having a depressing effect on farm prices and farm income Labor markets remain very tight in  the District We are receiving more reports of wage pressures going forward  Perhaps the most interesting change that is occurring, though very preliminarily, is in  the area of psychology We hear more negative talk even though we are enjoying a very strong  economy People talk about the good times, but they are more concerned about whether the latter  can continue Some of that concern relates to the outlook for energy I think it is important for us  to try to keep tabs on such attitudes as we go forward  Turning to the nation, I think our District largely reflects national economic trends Our  projections point to strong domestic demand that is being offset to an important extent by the  external sector We also do not rule out some possible retarding effects from the stock market  correction We continue to have supply shocks that are having favorable effects on prices As I  add all that up, I see a fairly tame projection for inflation going forward I cannot help but  wonder, given Peter Fisher's earlier comments on the markets' efforts to assess the outlook for  inflation and the risks of deflation, whether we are not seeing some of this negative psychology  and uncertainty spreading a little more widely I think that bears watching as we go forward   I support your recommendation for alternative B Frankly, I have  mixed emotions about the symmetry issue If I were asked, I would probably retain the  asymmetry at this point, given the strong domestic demand, but I am very comfortable with  symmetry as well   Mr Chairman, after reading the memo and participating in several  discussions of this question, my inclination is to go with Option 1 With regard to that option,  the simpler and more straightforward the language, the better Indeed, I would simplify the    9/29/98  language even further For the symmetric alternative, I would say something like "in view of the  currently available evidence, the Committee believes that developments are equally likely to  warrant a decrease or an increase in the federal funds rate" If the decision were for a tilt, I  would have the sentence say "in view of the currently available evidence, the Committee  believes that developments are more likely to warrant a decrease/increase than an increase/  decrease in the federal funds rate" I think that wording is understandable and straightforward  I also would like to see the minutes released even sooner than is contemplated in this  memo if that is physically possible That's because, as I said the last time we discussed this  matter, the minutes provide context for the Committee's decision If we are going to be more  transparent, sooner is better than later in that regard I know there are physical limitations  involved in the production of the minutes  In sum, my preference would be to put simpler language in the directive, release it  promptly, and then publish the minutes as soon as we can to give context to our decision   We need an interpreter to figure out what all that means That is true  even for us, let alone the public   Yes, I would be in favor of releasing it promptly after each meeting  with the simpler, clearer language   Ted, I have a question on Europe Some of the discussions that I have  heard in terms of whether Europe should lower its interest rates are that as they move toward  convergence, their interest rates are coming down in effect Do you agree with that?   Thank you   Mr Chairman, if you were to ask how the Tenth District is doing  today, you would get two answers If you looked at any metropolitan area, you would see that its  economy is still very strong, with tight labor markets and unemployment rates that are extremely  low When you looked at retail sales, you would find that they remain very strong If you  looked at housing, you would find it strong overall You also would hear a lot about changes in  attitudes in the sense that while business conditions are strong, people are much less confident    9/29/98  about the future We are seeing some of the effects of Asia in our manufacturing sector, in  health products for example, and we have anecdotal indications that at least some firms are  backing off on plans to invest in plant and equipment as they look to the future But, currently,  the metropolitan area economies are still in very good shape in our District  In the rural areas and in the energy sector, we get a completely different answer  Contacts in the energy industry, as you already heard for some other Districts, are very  pessimistic about the outlook for oil Natural gas, which is more predominant in our region, is a  question mark; its prospects depend on how the winter goes Contacts in the agricultural sector  are very pessimistic I know you have heard some of the statistics, but I would note that we  normally export about 40 percent of our agricultural products to Asia So demand is down   Nationwide, but I would say that percentage is not too far off the  mark for the Tenth District as well We are having some bumper crops this year, 20 percent  increases in some areas That is on top of earlier increases So, prices obviously are down Our  banks are saying that their loan portfolios currently are in satisfactory condition, but they  anticipate loan problems going forward They already are contacting us and others about what  the attitudes of examiners are going to be with regard to carrying over loans and so forth So,  there is a fair degree of bearishness in that sector of the economy and concern especially among  banks in the rural areas However, we need to put that in the context of the District as a whole,  which still appears to be generally sound  On the national economy, I think the most likely outcome next year is for real GDP  growth to slow to below trend and for inflation to remain moderate I am concerned about  further downside risks to the domestic economy Therefore, I believe a slight easing of policy    9/29/98  would be appropriate at this time But I, like Ed Boehne, would be cautious and deliberate in  adjusting policy at this time I don't think we would be behind the curve after a small move  I want to add a couple of points relating to policy First, while I see growth moving  down toward or below the economy's long-term potential, I am not as pessimistic as the  Greenbook at this time I think that is why I also am cautious about how deliberate we are in  adjusting policy Second, I believe there are significant downside risks to the outlook, as I  mentioned These stem from the fact that there are significant slowdowns in the economies of  Latin America and Canada that could cause our own economy to grow more slowly We need to  keep that in mind In that context, inflation should remain moderate in the near term, and a  number of factors should help to keep it in line for the foreseeable future I would not, however,  recommend a more significant easing I am mindful of the fact that our record in forecasting  growth slowdowns has not been overly accurate in recent years, and therefore I think we should  be cautious As others have mentioned, M2 is growing strongly So, I think a deliberate ease in  policy would benefit the economy, and I would go cautiously forward with it Thank you, Mr  Chairman   Mr Chairman, I also support a 25 basis point reduction As to the tilt,  I would much prefer no tilt for a couple of reasons Number one, I don't think the facts today  warrant it Number two, I think you are correct in your observation that events will drive what    9/29/98  we do next, and changing circumstances may well require a discussion at a telephone conference  before a decision is made   Mr Chairman, after listening to this discussion, I would mention first  that I think the solution that you and Al Broaddus proposed of placing "intermeeting period" at    11/17/98  the end of that sentence strikes me as a good suggestion I would then take out the sentence we  have been talking about I agree with Governor Kelley that it is confusing It confused me and I  think it will confuse others The authority is clear in the previous statement without that  additional sentence, especially if we put in a reference to "intermeeting period"   I agree with that   Mr Chairman, I have just two comments The first is on the issue  that is on the table right now I understand where Peter is coming from, but I would feel more  comfortable if the TIPS market were deeper; with time it may become deeper, and in that event  we would have less impact on it I recognize that Peter has had discussions with Treasury  officials and that this may be worked out, but I certainly would feel more comfortable if we  waited  On the second point, I would like to come back to Governor Rivlin's inquiry about the  discount window This is not the time, but I know that some work has been done on how the  discount window could be put to better use Some papers were written and some options were  explored but not followed up I think there were some good suggestions in those papers that  could make the discount window an instrument that the market might be more comfortable using    11/17/98  and in the process help us smooth or reduce some of that volatility in the market I would  encourage us to revisit this matter   Thank you, Mr Chairman Let me say a few things about the Tenth  District The regional economy is still growing moderately There are some signs of slowing in  the data and in some of the anecdotal reports from business contacts, but the degree to which  growth is slowing is not at all apparent Employment growth continues to be steady in our  District, although it is slightly behind the national economy Manufacturing activity, as others  have reported for their regions, is slowing in our District as well Our factory survey in October  was flat On the other hand, retail sales are generally good across the District, and some of our  retailers have indicated that they are anticipating a very strong holiday shopping season The  construction sector remains generally strong Some builders are reporting an easing of activity  but one of our largest construction firms, which is active in both the Midwest and the Pacific  Northwest, indicates that some of this has been due to the REIT activity that others have talked  about; the firm feels that reaction probably has been very healthy in terms of stanching some of  the excess that they thought was building in their markets Energy activity remains weak,  obviously due to the low oil and gas prices and the uncertainty there Our agricultural sector has  tended to stabilize a little; although prices are still low, they have stabilized and crop production  has been good There has been a recent infusion of funds by the Congress, but my contacts in  both ag and the ag banking sector assure me that next year certainly will be a disaster Despite  signs of slowing, the District labor markets are still very tight More than half of our Beigebook  and business contacts are talking about raising wages more than what they consider normal  Still, we have not seen the effect on prices in the District at all    11/17/98  On the national front, our outlook and the Greenbook are quite different in terms of  the projections for the next five to six quarters, with the Greenbook showing a much sharper  deceleration in growth than we are projecting Beginning with slower growth in the fourth  quarter, the Greenbook has five quarters of below-trend growth whereas we have growth in line  with trend or slightly below As a result, we have a less favorable inflation outlook, although we  do not anticipate that inflation will be a substantial problem  We think the risks are more balanced than they were at the time of the last meeting  We believe that the financial markets are more stable and are pricing more realistically We  think domestic demand is remaining fairly stable, and it could actually be stronger depending on  the stock market and other factors because, as others have reported, consumer confidence is  relatively high On the downside, manufacturing could slow more than we're expecting,  especially given the international uncertainty But on balance, we think that it would be prudent,  given that there are only five weeks to the next meeting, to wait and watch in this intermeeting  period   Mr Chairman, for reasons that others have cited, my preference  would be to wait I think President Poole said it best, that we could be pouring gasoline on this  economy I have concerns that a bubble economy syndrome may be building I believe it was in  place before the more recent events, and I think it may again come into being as a factor You  mentioned the stock market, and that gives me real pause    11/17/98  However, like others, I am not going to dissent for several of the reasons that they  gave One, the point you made, is that I do not see inflation as an immediate threat Secondly, I  understand the international circumstances that we face; I'm not sure this easing move is going  to make a whole lot of difference to those circumstances, but we will see Thirdly, I might hold  others to their statement that if this easing does prove to be more than we need, we will be firm  in our resolve to move back if that is called for   Mr Chairman, it is a good suggestion and I am in favor of it I think  we should learn from it and then decide if we need to do anything differently sometime in the  future But I'm very comfortable with it now   Mr Chairman, our District economy continues to chug along at a  pretty good pace We have some weak areas, and one of those, of course, is agriculture The  impact is not as dramatic as I mentioned last time because of the recent transfer payments to that  sector The concern is the longer term We don't know what the Freedom to Farm Bill will  mean or whether transfer payments will have to increase in the future if these price pressures  continue That is an issue in our part of the country  The other weak area is energy Obviously, the low price of oil is hurting our District  economy right now, although we, like others, are more diversified now Of course, mining,  especially the coal industry, is under a lot of pressure; capacity and price pressures are quite  damaging to that industry right now, I am told  Conditions in the manufacturing sector are more mixed in our region Activity in  some manufacturing industries is slowing as a result of competition with foreign, especially  Asian, products Our electronic components manufacturers are feeling some pressure On the  other hand, our auto industry is doing well as are some of our metals manufacturers that are  exporting They have worked very hard to increase their productivity and they probably are    12/22/98 41  going to have their best year ever in some instances So, we see mixed signals in the  manufacturing sector  Of course, housing is strong as are services, including retail Our banking industry is  quite active right now Our banks are competing very vigorously for loans and they are  competing on price They tell me their margins are certainly narrowing as a result We continue  to have tight labor markets There is some relief perhaps around the edges in some of the  manufacturing industries that have seen a slowdown But as a general principle, labor markets  are still very tight  As for the national outlook, I would describe our view as having come closer to the  notion that growth will slow toward trend because of two factors that are not completely  predictable I think we will have very strong domestic demand going forward We have the  continuing impact of recent rate cuts, and M2 growth is quite strong I think those portend a  stronger economy and some future upside risks for the economy Obviously, though, capacity  has increased in the economy and that will help restrain some of the price increases We also  have the external sector exerting deflationary pressures and we see many uncertainties with  situations like Brazil So balancing out those two effects, I would say that growth will come  back toward trend but that the upside risks are noticeable   I am speechless! But I'm going to say a couple of things anyway  First, I support your recommendation completely Without getting into bananas or agonizing, I  would caution us about how we look at the need for future policy actions Here I associate  myself a little with Bill Poole I think we need to look at the actions we take in terms of the  risks, especially the risks to the domestic economy, and the systematic forces that are in play that  lead to the upside risks our policy easings, the rapid monetary growth, strong domestic demand,  and robust income growth I think those factors do give us pronounced upside risks    12/22/98  On the other side, the downside risks, as Governor Rivlin said, are risks of shocks,  which are impossible to forecast I'd suggest that we consider not holding off too long on the  unwinding of our recent easing actions as we worry about the downside risks from shocks that  might occur but also might not occur So I want to be thinking about unwinding our earlier  actions unless some real shocks emerge   Mr Chairman, I like option 3 I agree with the language in the  middle sentence that includes both the coming months and the intermeeting period I would have  no problem with deleting the sentence on the money supply but I certainly would not get into an  argument if we left it in   May I add to that question? You mentioned in your memo,   Peter, that at a time of market crisis it had proved helpful in the past to raise the lending   limits above those that were in place It would help me to understand this issue if you   explained that    Thank you, Mr Chairman The Kansas City District continues to   do well and its economy is basically sound Our weak areas continue to be agriculture   and energy, and there has been some slowdown in certain areas of our manufacturing   sector Of course, there is some concern on the manufacturing side about the Brazilian   situation, particularly if that were to spread to Mexico, on which we are much more   dependent Having said that, the economy otherwise is doing very well even in some of   the manufacturing sectors as well as in the housing sector and construction generally   Retail sales continued strong, even in January Overall, our major cities are still   booming   On the national front, I expect the economy’s growth to moderate toward trend   this year with low inflation, as others have said In other words, basically we see the   economy continuing to grow The issue we face continues to be very strong domestic   demand set against the backdrop of weak international demand, which is further   complicated by the possibility of adverse shocks That has not changed much in the last   several months Nevertheless, compared to last fall I believe that the risks to the outlook   are now far more balanced because of the earlier rate reductions taken to offset the global   financial turmoil As a result, as others here have indicated, I am becoming more focused   on the potential upside risk to inflation if we continue to maintain our current monetary   stance To me, a key issue for this Committee at this meeting or very soon is whether,   when, and how fast the policy actions of last fall should be unwound Thank you    Don, having looked at the analysis in the Bluebook and at the   various charts, including Chart 3, and having listened to your comments this morning, I   want to talk a little about something I mentioned yesterday That is the possibility of   wanting to unwind the actions we took earlier Last fall we were projecting growth in the   fourth quarter to be less than half the growth we apparently got, and we were expecting   even lower growth in the first quarter of this year We took actions to ease partly because   of those projections and the financial turmoil that was occurring We have moved into a   much more stable financial environment  You did mention the idea of perhaps   unwinding our easing moves I assume for the sake of discussion that one reason we are     2/2-3/99 96   not looking more favorably at unwinding at this juncture is the continuing concern and   uncertainty about external factors Is that why you touched on it but did not really   develop an alternative for unwinding our earlier actions?    That’s a good point    Mr Chairman, I am satisfied with your recommendation As I   mentioned yesterday, we have put some additional stimulus into the economy over the   last several months and I think there is a case to be made for some unwinding of that,   perhaps in the not-too-distant future Depending on unfolding developments, that might     2/2-3/99 117   be appropriate to mention in your Humphrey-Hawkins testimony, as you suggested So I   am fine with your recommendation    Mr Chairman, the economy in our District continues to   perform quite solidly Employment growth in February was a bit flat, but we think that   may have reflected an absence of supply of workers as much as anything Retail sales   and construction are both very strong in our metropolitan areas, and our surveys show a   very high level of consumer confidence Manufacturing activity, as in other areas, has   cooled off a little, and the number of manufacturing jobs in the District fell a bit in   February and is actually below year-ago levels That’s the first time we’ve seen that   since 1992 Energy activity declined in January and, of course, people on the producing   side have hopes--from their vantage point--for the oil price increases that they see   stemming from the OPEC discussions The District labor markets remain very tight,   even with the weakness I talked about in manufacturing, and we have seen in our surveys   a slight uptick in wage pressures District labor markets now have an unemployment rate   of about 33 percent, and that actually may understate the real decline slightly because we   have a very high participation rate, well above the national average   The other area of some weakness, obviously, is the agricultural sector That   sector continues to struggle with good supplies and a falloff in demand, especially from   Asia And we are hearing more and more discussion about whether a farm aid package   will be needed again in 1999 as in 1998 As for how that will go, we’ll have to wait and   see Even with the continuing troubles in agriculture, economic growth in our region is   strong, driven by the strength in the metropolitan areas and even in some of the rural   areas   On the national level, our forecast is fundamentally very similar to the   Greenbook’s The difficulty is that we have as much confidence in our forecast as Mike   Prell does in the Greenbook’s In any case, the projected strength in the economy leaves   us a bit uneasy I want to raise again, though it may be a little early in the meeting, the   issue of where we were last summer and the actions we have taken since then as an     3/30/99 22   insurance policy I think those easing actions were wise But as I look back over the   three years ending in 1998, we have had for much of that period a funds rate of about 5½   percent, steady growth, and declining inflation And I can’t help but continue to wonder   if we should not be unwinding some of our easing if the circumstances warrant With   that I will stop Thank you    Mr Chairman, understanding the difficulties of these   decisions, I would still recommend that we tighten and that we present the tightening as   an unwinding of the actions that we took in the midst of the crisis last fall Last summer   we were continuing to experience strong growth in economic activity and jobs We took   some easing actions because of the Asian crisis We introduced additional stimulus into   this economy, which is playing out now I think we could legitimately and forthrightly   explain a tightening move as an unwinding of those earlier actions; that would make it   more acceptable In the long term such an action would be healthy   Having said that, I would make the directive symmetric if the Committee   adopts a no-change policy, as it appears it might, because we probably will not act during   the intermeeting period and I don’t think we should suggest otherwise So my preference   is to unwind However, if we don’t, I would not have an asymmetric directive    Thank you, Mr Chairman The economy in the Kansas City   District remains quite strong Employment edged up again in March; retail sales remain   generally strong; and construction indicators are quite strong   The price of construction materials has increased significantly so far this year,   both in the region and more broadly As a side note, I will tell you that about 10,000   homes and businesses were destroyed or severely damaged by the recent tornadoes in   Oklahoma and Kansas While the short-term effect is obviously devastating, that does   imply some additional building boom coming our way That will be a factor in our   District More specifically, though, one of our directors who is in the construction   industry has seen sizable price increases on materials in that industry since the beginning   of the year Prices of rock, gravel, and aggregates are up 10 percent, lumber 6 percent,   concrete 4½ percent, and sheet rock, of course, is up about 50 percent   While manufacturing activity has been a little sluggish in the District up until   recently, it is picking up Some of our manufacturers are seeing an increase in demand   from Asia, and that includes China, despite some of the other developments in that   region Also, at least from our directors’ point of view, some of the recovery in   aluminum prices reflects increased demand in Asia Energy activity within the District     5/18/99 33   has steadied in the sense of not declining any longer; firms in that industry are waiting to   see to what extent these energy price increases will stick before making their own plans   for future activity   Wage pressures appear to be increasing in the District, at least somewhat Our   unemployment rate is about 34 percent and we have a very high participation rate, so we   have very strong pressure on our labor markets In fact, in the construction industry,   which is obviously under the most pressure, and in the crafts industries such as carpentry   and plumbing, contracts for wage increases of 5½ percent per year for the next three   years have recently been signed in our area   Retail prices have edged up, as someone else mentioned And I would echo   the point, based on talking with business people in our region, that there is a hint of a   different attitude toward price increases There is a sense of challenging the status quo   and seeing if perhaps price increases will stick this time, with more of an expectation that   they will Whether that will occur will only be known in time, I realize   The farm economy remains fundamentally weak Supplies are large and   export demand has not picked up that we can see Despite this, farm finances remain   strong, and there is a lot of anticipation about what will come out of Congress this year   on that issue Our land values have remained resilient despite these kinds of pressures,   although our last survey indicated about a 1 percent decline in land prices in the   aggregate   Turning to the national economy, I see another year of strong economic   activity While growth in GDP may moderate, I think it is going to moderate to a rate   well above its longer-term trend and remain significantly stronger than the FOMC central   tendency forecasts from our February Humphrey-Hawkins meeting I must say that I am   struck by the strength of the domestic economy Over the last four quarters private   domestic spending has grown about 6¼ percent and we are forecasting that it will grow   about 5 percent this year If one put trend productivity at a very optimistic 4 percent-­  higher than I think one might expect--and added on 1 percent for labor force growth, that   would result in potential output of, let’s say, 5 percent And private domestic spending at   least has been growing faster than that Offsetting this, of course, has been the weakness   in net exports; in a sense the deterioration from the external sector has been the relief     5/18/99 34   valve But I think some of the relief now is coming from domestic demand rather than   the weaker external or foreign demand That is something we have to keep in mind in   terms of the pressures on global resources going forward   In sum, what I am saying is that I see increasing upside risks to our forecast   Look at the Greenbook forecast, for example, which shows a $450 billion deficit in net   exports by the end of next year--though I know the staff may reduce that--and still good   growth in the 3½ percent range Should our domestic demand or foreign exports pick up,   we could have even stronger growth The point is that against this background I have   become, as I think Al Broaddus has, increasingly worried about the current stance of   policy and our ability to maintain low inflation going forward    Don, since you spent a fair amount of time on whether we   should go asymmetric or symmetric, my question has to do with the wording in the   directive that relates to the tilt The way the current wording reads, the tilt applies to “the   intermeeting period;” it does not say that we might act on the tilt at the next meeting or   the meeting after that How important is the fact that it is confined to the intermeeting   period and not longer term in influencing your thinking of whether we should put that   language in the directive?    Mr Chairman, I felt last time and I feel now that we could   appropriately identify an immediate move as an unwinding of our earlier effort to   stabilize financial markets--an effort at which we were successful I would prefer that   explanation At the same time, I would buy your recommendation today in terms of the   tilt I would be careful about what the announcement says with regard to the period to   which the tilt may apply, whether it is the intermeeting period or some longer period, but   I certainly would accept your tilt recommendation    Yes    Karen, on your chart 12 entitled “US Current Account to GDP   Ratio” what assumptions do you have for your baseline?  How did you get the baseline?    In the Bluebook, okay    Refresh my memory, what is the import elasticity used in the   baseline?    Thank you    Thank you, Mr Chairman The Kansas City District’s economy   remains quite solid, as I reported last time Retail sales are well above year-ago levels   Real estate sales and construction activity remain quite healthy Manufacturing activity   actually shows some further signs of improving, following an earlier period of weakness   Factory managers are reporting to us that capacity utilization is up considerably from   earlier months this year and nearly back to year-ago levels Energy activity has   continued to improve in June according to our producers in the region The farm   economy remains in a deep slump, and I would say that we are hearing increasing reports   from rural America that the farm downturn is beginning to hurt Main Street and that we   are going to see some repercussions on the banks   Having said that, the labor market in our District remains extremely tight The   District’s unemployment rate edged down to about 3½ percent this past month And   there is now some additional anecdotal evidence that persistently tight labor markets are   limiting growth in some District areas Just as one example, American West announced   it will move 180 jobs from the Kansas City area because it cannot find people to fill the   jobs there Now, where they are going to move them to isn’t all that clear, but certainly   they can’t fill the jobs in the Kansas City area   Turning to the national scene, I continue to expect the trend in economic activity   to moderate by the end of next year For now, though, I foresee another year of strong   economic activity, with real GDP growing on average about 4 percent this year and   slowing to an average of just above 3 percent next year   As for my views on the inflation outlook, I would note a couple of points Similar   to what Bob Parry just said, my stronger forecast represents yet another upward revision   in the outlook I notice in the consensus forecast that others share that view I continue   to be impressed by the momentum of the US economy as we make these adjustments,     6/29-30/99 34   and I also continue to be impressed by the fact that the inflation numbers are still coming   in at a modest level   Having said that, I still judge that the risks on the inflation outlook are on the   upside First of all, as I have said before, the funds rate is 75 basis points less than it was   a year ago when the economy was already expanding at a fairly good pace  Since then,   the financial turmoil that occurred last fall has largely subsided, risk spreads are in fact   lower, and growth is projected to remain strong So in that context, I think the stance of   monetary policy is accommodative When one looks at M2 growth, while it has slowed   most recently, it remains relatively strong--increasing by about 8 percent over year-ago   levels And as others have noted in a different context, there are some signs that inflation   expectations are rising The inflation premium embedded in the Treasury inflation-  protected securities has been rising since last fall So, while recognizing that inflation is   modest, I believe there is some upside inflationary risk in the context of this very strong   economy right now    Don, I am going to try to ask this question clearly In the   Bluebook and in your comments you touched on a couple of issues One was whether we     6/29-30/99 74   need to move 50 basis points over the course of this year and then how we might go   forward from there My question is If one were to assume for the moment that we will   need to move 50 basis points, what is the best way to go about that?  If we say 25 basis   points now, assuming we move at all, that would create uncertainties regardless of the tilt   of the directive we adopt A symmetric directive would give a false sense to the market   and to Main Street that we’re satisfied with that 25 basis points, and things would begin   artificially moving forward again If we say 25 basis points, asymmetric, that would raise   uncertainty as to how much and when the next move will be If we say 50 basis points,   symmetric--suggesting that is sufficient at least for now--would that create more   disruption because it’s larger than the market expects?  Or would that settle the market in   the sense of saying, “This is what we’re doing and it’s enough”?    Thank you    Mr Chairman, I support your recommendation I came into this   meeting wanting at least a discussion of a 50 basis point increase, and I got that, which I   appreciate very much It was very helpful  Along those lines and in listening to you, my   assessment has been shaded in terms of the issue--the issue being the degree and the   durability of productivity improvements that we’re all trying to decipher So, I would go   with the 25 basis points It is a move up, which I think is appropriate And it represents a   continuation of the gradualist approach on which we have built a pretty high degree of   credibility over time, and that has served us well   Given all that, I would very strongly support a symmetric directive for this   meeting I believe it represents the consensus of the FOMC and I don’t think we should   be anticipating the next move until one of two things happens--either we get new   information that addresses some of the earlier issues you raised, or we as a group have a   change in judgment If either occurs, then we can change the rate again in the   intermeeting period or at the next meeting I think that is the right approach in terms of   dealing with the market and the information we share    Peter, I have another question along those lines When you brought   this before the Committee the concept, as you’ve just suggested, was more or less as a   lender of last resort But the frequency of use over the period strikes me as being far more     8/24/99 8   than last resort; it seems to me to be part of an everyday facility Why the frequency of use   if it is a last resort facility?    We probably should expect at least as much usage going forward?    Mr Chairman, I understand the importance of Y2K concerns, but I   want to follow up a bit on what Jerry Jordan was saying I know that Peter Fisher and others   have scrubbed this proposal pretty carefully, but in terms of the analysis I’m not as clear as   I’d like to be And I am a true believer in the law of unintended consequences When you   want to do things and get them done for the right reasons, you think of all the positives But   without some fairly rigorous analysis, you tend not to think of the other side I worry, given   the speed with which we’re taking this forward, that we may not have thought of all the   negative consequences, and that leaves me uneasy   One other comment I would make is that necessarily--and I understand the reasons-­  there is a great deal of vagueness in this proposal; one uncertainty is even the strike price I     8/24/99 28   hope in structuring this that we keep in mind many of the conditions we have in the special   liquidity facility as we go to these individual dealers, because we are treading on new   ground as far as how we conduct monetary policy And even though the authorization is   temporary, it does have implications going forward that I haven’t had the opportunity to   think through I hope that as the details are worked out we will be briefed again on what is   being decided with regard to the strike price and the reservation price I know you have to   talk with the dealers, but it leaves me uneasy to think that they might be structuring this   program So, those are my concerns I know Y2K is important and I don’t diminish that,   but I do have these reservations that I wanted to raise    That does give me some solace    I understand    Very good    Thank you, Mr Chairman The economy in the Kansas City   District remains quite healthy It has slowed from the rather strong pace of last year but   remains overall a very strong economy Employment has improved modestly, although the   growth rates have slowed, but we suspect that is as much a supply issue as a demand issue   Construction activity remains brisk; it’s down a bit from the torrid pace of last year but is   still very strong, and we are continuing to see price pressures on resources in that industry     8/24/99 53   Manufacturing activity remains subdued compared with past very high levels, but through   our surveys we have picked up an obvious increase in demand for exports coming from   some of the improvements in Asia and South America Others have spoken of activity in   the energy sector In our District the rig count is up about 25 percent from last April, but it   is still about 25 percent below a year ago Nevertheless, there is some pickup in activity in   that sector   As for wages, there are wage pressures They are not accelerating sharply, but we are   now well aware of steady pressure on wages Our labor markets are extremely tight and our   unemployment levels are very low Our participation rate is very high and that is affecting   our labor markets I’ll share a bit of anecdotal information on both sides of this issue In   Colorado, contracted with 600 software engineers in India because the   firm could not find anyone in their own area to do the job In Kansas City, our major   construction companies have imported skilled workers generally and in particular have hired   bricklayers and others in the higher skilled professions from both Canada and Mexico to fill   a crying need In fact, we have found in talking with school districts throughout the region   that they are having a problem replacing math and science teachers who are being recruited   and hired away by private industry On the other side, we had an interesting discussion with   one of the major accounting firms, which has changed its accounting and operations systems   to bring automation into its work papers and analysis The firm is counting on productivity   improvements to the extent that it is actually budgeting for the improvements by budgeting   down the number of people it will bring on board That’s a fairly risky position on their part   but they really are looking for some productivity improvements because they are paying   very high premiums for professional help   I will talk just briefly about our farm economy I know that the Northeast and East   more generally are in a drought That is not the case in our area We are expecting a very   large harvest; for both corn and soybeans we think it will be a record The wheat crop, with   even less planting, was very strong I talked with one of the major co-ops last week and   they are actually bringing back on line elevators that they had abandoned earlier in order to   store the surplus they have Livestock producers are doing better; cattlemen are actually   making money and, of course, the hog industry is now making money On the financial   front, the farmers did come in with much stronger balance sheets this season Frankly, the     8/24/99 54   benefits from government payments and prospective increases in those payments are really   going to buoy their net income flows So, while we are seeing a deterioration in some farm   operations--and as a result of that, in some Main Street operations--we are not seeing major   problems surfacing in loan portfolios The nonperforming loans are increasing, but nowhere   near as sharply as they did the last time we went through this kind of situation   Turning to the national side, I will only add a bit to what others have said I would say   first of all that we are projecting continued economic growth, though not as strong as the   Greenbook projection Certainly, some of the favorable factors seem to be reversing, but we   do see strong domestic demand And if the global economy picks up as we believe it might,   we may have some strong pressures on the demand side in the economy that we have to be   mindful of as we go forward With that I’ll stop    Mr Chairman, I agree with your recommendation on the rate   increase, and I strongly support the symmetric directive I say that because if we do in fact   make the ¼ percentage point move, we can sit back and analyze its effects, analyze the data,   and then move again when a change is called for I don’t think we need to have an   asymmetric directive of any kind    Call it drought insurance    Thank you, Mr Chairman The Tenth District’s economy continues to   operate at a relatively high level of activity Our year-over-year employment growth was 13   percent, and that is from already high levels of labor participation and employment Retailers have   reported that sales are flat but at high levels, and they expect to continue to experience good levels   of activity Despite the slowing in employment growth in some areas, construction remains our   fastest growing sector in the District Energy activity in the District has turned around   significantly--60 percent above the level in March--although it is still slightly below year-ago   levels in terms of employment   In manufacturing, few jobs have been added but that is due in part to cutbacks by Boeing in   Missouri and Kansas Taking that into account, exports of manufactured goods out of the District   are estimated to be at pre-crisis levels So there has been a very strong recovery in that area   The District’s unemployment rate edged down to about 34 percent in August and we   continue to have tight labor markets We hear an increasing number of anecdotal reports of wage   pressures, especially in our metropolitan areas such as Denver and Kansas City Consumer prices   have shown very modest increases, although on the input side prices of some manufacturing and   construction materials have edged up or have increased significantly, depending on the particular   type of input one is speaking about   The farm economy, of course, is the area that remains weak But government payments are   keeping farm incomes and finances at good levels and recent legislation may put farm support   payments at or near the record levels that we saw in the 1980s Overall, though, the District is   doing very well     10/5/99 28   At the national level, I have no major disagreements with the Greenbook I understand and   recognize that forecasting is a risky business in and of itself I think it is important, then, to look at   the circumstances we face at this time Demand is very strong--some would suggest excessive-­  with GDP growth well above 3 percent when, in thinking about labor growth and productivity,   potential may be in the 3 percent range In many ways we are comfortable with that because   inflation remains modest and productivity gains continue But it is important to look at some of the   other factors that are in play The strong demand is being accommodated importantly by a trade   deficit and a current account deficit that are at record levels Personal saving rates are estimated to   be in the negative range, labor costs are rising, and labor demand remains very strong When we   talk to business people about wage pressures, they give some indication that they’re paying “above   normal” to retain workers But the definition of “normal” is moving higher So we’re continually   seeing an increase in the so-called normal rate that gives me some pause   When I look at the demand in the economy in terms of both the consumer and corporate   sectors, consumer debt is rising to record levels and corporate debt is increasing I think we have to   take that into account Margin credit is rising to record levels as well The question for us, of   course, is whether monetary policy is accommodating this debt increase We’ve had two recent   funds rate increases and that is worth noting But at the same time, the growth rates in the   monetary aggregates remain at or above our projected targets I think that has to be taken into   account as well as we look at all these other factors So, I believe our policy involves some   continued upside risk for inflation and we should be mindful of that as we enter the policy   discussion phase of the meeting    Thank you, Mr Chairman I listened to your arguments with great interest,   and they are very persuasive At the same time, my own view is still that we should move the   funds rate up ¼ point now While I believe productivity is truly increasing, as I said earlier, I think   there are other important imbalances in the economy that, if addressed now, will result in a better   economic performance in the long term We should take advantage of that opportunity now Also,   to the extent that the productivity increases are positive in terms of the second derivative and are     10/5/99 65   continuing, we can act now to address some of these other imbalances and not affect those strong   gains We should keep that in mind as we consider monetary policy today   On the issue of symmetry, I personally would like to leave the directive symmetric My   reason is that I don’t think there has been a major change in our attitude The last two times we   met, we increased rates We’re obviously alert to the possible need for more firming We’re aware   of it today Because we don’t take an action today doesn’t mean we’re not as concerned as we   have been, especially as the data come out However, if asymmetric is the way the Committee   wishes to go, I think we’re in the stew here in terms of announcing The law of unintended   consequences has manifest itself on this and we are somewhat bound to announce how we are   leaning, although I will tell you that our original announcement does not say that we’re necessarily   going to disclose our decision on symmetry But that’s not what many people read So I think   we’re compelled in a way and I would have to suggest that we disclose our decision if we go   asymmetric But I think we’d be wise not to go asymmetric    Mr Chairman, given President McDonough’s earlier comments and my   own sense of this, is it necessary to spend so much time on the labor markets in this press release?    Right But could we take out the labor market reference?    Well, if we’re going to do that, there are a lot of other things I’d like to list    I’m not convinced    I’m okay with the latest changes    Mr Chairman, I’m inclined to echo what Governor Meyer just said in   terms of the impression we create in the market Rather than give you another iteration of that   concern, I’ll leave it that So, in terms of this statement, I’m in agreement with Governor Meyer    Thank you On the alternatives, I strongly prefer alternative I In my   view it’s more honest in the sense that we are balancing the risks If we weren’t, we could take   the action only at the time of the meeting So I think it is the better way of expressing how we   see the likelihood of developments in the future rather than implying that we have our finger on   the trigger So I strongly prefer alternative I   In terms of the proposed amendment to paragraph 2 of the Authorization, I welcome it   because the Chairman’s authority to initiate a policy action between meetings has been a source   of confusion in this Committee for as long as I’ve been a participant in these meetings This   defines and clarifies his authority and his responsibility for consulting with the Committee so we   won’t differ on what we think we’ve done in adopting symmetry or asymmetry I consider it a   clarification It puts some understandable parameters around the Chairman’s authority, which I   think is a good idea So I’m in favor of that    Larry, could you clarify your position?  Are you saying that this   paragraph should have stronger language?    All right    Mr Chairman, the Tenth District also continues to do quite well; we   have not seen a lot of change since our last meeting On the basis of our surveys of District   activity, there has been some slowing in the residential housing market from the earlier rapid   pace and a bit of slowing in some areas of retail sales   In the manufacturing sector, the picture is somewhat mixed While domestic demand   has slowed some, there has been a pronounced pickup in foreign demand in some of our   manufacturing industries For example, a foundry and some of the metals manufacturers in our   District have seen a very strong pickup in foreign orders Our energy sector continues to expand   right now as they look at these favorable prices We are primarily natural gas driven and, of   course, weather has some impact But even with some of the current mild weather patterns, our   producers still see a good outlook as they judge their supplies   Mike Moskow mentioned the weakness in the agricultural sector We, too, have had   very strong production this year, so prices remain low and that sector is very much dependent   upon the continued strength in transfer payments One of the secondary elements in our     11/16/99 29   agricultural and rural areas is that, frankly, there has been strong demand for autos and especially   trucks as these transfer payments have been made So, actually, cash incomes remain fairly   good, and that has been reflected in a strong economy in some of those agricultural areas   Overall, though, economic activity in our District is extremely strong Labor markets are tight   everywhere We hear constant discussions about the difficulties that firms are experiencing in   their efforts to find workers to fill jobs   Let me turn very briefly to the national outlook We, too, see the growth in GDP to be   at better than a 3½ percent pace, and we also are taking into account some of the improvements   in productivity in that outlook Looking forward, we see the foreign sector picking up and   offsetting some of the deceleration on the domestic side So as we look at these various   elements, the preponderance of evidence suggests to us that the risk to the forecast is on the   upside in terms of total demand within the US economy   Personally, I still think there is a good case for acting now, though we haven’t quite   come to that discussion, whether one looks at it as preemptive or as a reversal of the insurance   policy we took out a year ago We took that insurance in the face of a very strong real economy   Its effects are still working in the economy and I think that factor is aggravating the upward risk   that I see Thank you    Mr Chairman, I think both your recommendations for a ¼ point   increase in the funds rate and a symmetric directive are prudent, and I support them    Governor Ferguson, I’ve listened to all of the arguments, and they   are all good arguments When I sort through them, I’m back with the original   recommendations of your Working Group We can fool with this language to the nth degree   and something is going to be wrong with it Your draft language talks about risks and I feel   more comfortable personally talking to the public about risks than I do talking about which   way we are going to move the next time we take a policy action   The issue of the Chairman’s authority to make intermeeting policy moves is a tough   one, Al, and I have some sympathy for your point of view But it is related to a   longstanding practice and this amendment to the Authorization does codify that practice To   my mind, in some ways it sets the boundaries more clearly If some future chair abuses the   authority, that is something the Committee will have to deal with But the way the   Authorization reads now gives me a sense of confidence that it would be used only in the   most dire circumstances, and I think the Chairman has to have some flexibility to act in a   crisis So, I can generally accept the Working Group’s recommendations    Thank you, Mr Chairman The underlying trends in the Tenth   District economy have not materially changed since our last meeting The economy remains   healthy, with manufacturing actually showing some continued rebound I am hearing more   comments throughout the District that higher interest rates have slowed some construction   sectors, especially residential building Growth in home sales in the District was about 3   percent third quarter over third quarter this year compared with about 10 percent last year   At the same time, we are hearing from several of our business contacts that increases in   public works construction such as roads--actually jails for the most part--are offsetting the   falloff in other construction   While private construction is slowing, manufacturing is continuing to show good   signs of strength Our Beigebook contacts reported high levels of capacity utilization last   month The recently released data on third-quarter manufacturing exports also showed   continued improvement in foreign demand for District factory goods Based on reports     12/21/99 20   throughout the District, holiday shopping centers are quite busy; seasonal sales are very   strong and many retailers are reporting the best season that they have had in five years   While the number of business contacts reporting labor shortages increased slightly last   month, it was probably not a significant increase  Moreover, most of the increase came in   the manufacturing sector, which has been expanding production in the last couple of   months The District’s unemployment rate is about 3¼ percent Except for New Mexico   and Wyoming, all District states have unemployment rates below 3¼ percent, and some are   much below that District contacts report that wage and price pressures remain subdued,   however; that is no different from what I have been hearing for some time and have reported   in past meetings   Our energy sector has actually strengthened with the increase in prices and there are   some signs now of wells being uncapped but very few new starts at this stage The farm   economy remains fundamentally weak, although there is some improvement in cattle prices   But for now that sector will continue to rely on transfer payments for its health   Turning to the national economy, my view of the outlook has not changed   fundamentally since the November FOMC meeting The economy obviously continues to   grow well, with few signs right now of rising inflation I expect economic growth to slow   over the forecast horizon based on our actions earlier this year And, frankly, I find it highly   unlikely that with an unchanged funds rate we would have growth in the 4 to 5 percent   range as suggested by the Greenbook My view of the Greenbook right now is that it   provides a reasonable description of the upside risks to the outlook rather than the most   likely outcome In my mind the risks are balanced We do have upward pressures; there’s   no question about it But there are some other factors, such as our last three funds rate   increases, that I think need to play out   I agree with most people that core inflation is likely to rise to about 2¼ percent or   maybe 2½ percent in the year 2000 and beyond However, at this point I am not convinced   that it will rise to a rate higher than 2½ percent in 2001 So in that sense, I think we do have   some time to look at how things develop in the near future Thank you    Don, just listening to you tells me how difficult it will be to craft   any kind of asymmetric announcement today Wouldn’t it seem practical to have this be   one of those announcements where we say as little as possible--something along the lines of   we met, we didn’t do anything, and we’ll see you next year?    I prefer the symmetric one, Mr Chairman After all we have   invested in Y2K preparations, with options and special liquidity programs, changing our   bias as we get to this point near the end does not seem to me to be the best thing to do To   my mind the symmetric language makes clear to the market that a smooth Y2K transition is   still our priority and that we will get through that period before we take up the issue of   tightening again So, I much prefer the symmetric directive      Mr Chairman, changing these ranges is always a dicey issue these   days because no matter what we say or what we do, there are more interpretations than there is   reality  At the same time, I could be talked into it because I think there is a building consensus   that the rising trend in productivity improvements is real  And if, in fact, we are willing to   accept that--and there may be some who are not--then moving the targets does make some sense   in terms of their consistency with price stability  And I do agree with what Jerry Jordan was   saying about how we might have reacted to productivity shocks in earlier periods, but I think   things are a little different now  On balance, I could come down in favor of raising the ranges      Mike and Dave, with respect to your simulations, let me ask   something that I think has been hinted at around the edges in two or three previous questions  In   the Greenbook prepared last time for our December meeting, you had an assumed increase of 75   basis points in the funds rate in the works  In this Greenbook you have an increase of 125 basis   points  If one looks at these simulations, the analysis suggests that we are behind the curve          44  unless scenario 1 occurs  So let me ask what you think the odds are of scenario 1 materializing    Everything else suggests that we are behind the curve     That’s interesting  Thank you     Thank you, Mr Chairman  The Tenth District economy has not   changed appreciably since our last meeting and on balance remains very healthy overall  Labor   markets do remain tight but wage pressures, though increasing, are not increasing dramatically   that we can tell  Our agricultural sector continues pretty much as it has been, with low prices and   high subsidies making the outlook for that sector appear fairly stable  One thing I might mention   about this expansion is that rural America really has shared in some of the good times  Job   growth in our region has been nearly as high as that for the nation on average and, of course, in   our scenic and recreational areas it has been substantially stronger  So, we’ve had good uniform   growth in jobs across the rural areas as well          65  Let me talk a little bit about the oil sector  Even with the sizable increases in oil   prices, the effects on levels of activities in our region have been relatively modest so far  In   talking with our director in that industry, he said that the industry right now is still budgeting in   their capital budgets at around $18 per barrel for oil  They feel that if OPEC can manage to do   so it will maintain the price at between $20 and $30--not wanting it to go over $30 because that   will spark interest among other oil producers  So that seems to be forestalling the price  They   are watching developments, in terms of adjusting their capital budgets around those numbers and   those price levels  Unless we see an accelerating price level, his judgment is that exploration   budgets won’t increase dramatically     Let me mention another local anecdote  The Kansas City Southern Railway runs a   railroad through Texas, Monterey, and all the way to Mexico City  I was visiting with the head   of that company last week and he told me that the volume of traffic on the railroad over the last   18 to 24 months has increased by a good 50 percent in both directions  He said it was striking   how much business capital investment was being made all along that railroad  He said that the   state of technology at the manufacturing plants was as good as it gets and that the quality of the   products coming from there was as good as it gets  Interestingly, though, he also noted that   shipments of finished goods, not just intermediate goods, are also expanding dramatically along   that route as people’s incomes and prospects improve  That may be a sign of more positive   things to come   Let me turn to the national economy  Basically, I’m convinced that the US economy   is experiencing the effects of excess demand and that, based on the evidence, pressures probably   are building  While my projections are not as strong as those of the Board staff, it’s a matter of   degree and not direction  I see a greater likelihood that this demand will increase and continue to          66  outpace supply, even though the signs on the supply side are good  In my view this does put   increasing pressure on prices  And the situation is complicated a bit further by what we refer to   as “imbalances” that are also persisting, with levels of debt rising and the current account deficit   increasing as well  All this to me suggests that there is perhaps room for us to think about   increasing rates modestly as a minimum response  I’ll stop there  Thank you     Mr Chairman, I support your proposal completely  I believe the   increased risk of inflation is there, so I think we ought to say it  Also, I am very much in favor of   25 basis points for several reasons  First, while the models show direction, I agree that they   don’t show it with precision, so I think we should proceed gradually  Secondly, we are in an   environment where core inflation has been very modest, and we need to recognize that as we   begin to pave the way for higher rates  And thirdly, some imbalances remain out there, which   we are trying to take into account, but we don’t want to shock the system either  So I think   continuing the steady path that we have been on is the appropriate approach  Therefore, I   support your recommendation     Mr Chairman, walking into this meeting, I had an uneasiness about   this issue similar to what you have just expressed  So I will make my comments a bit briefer  I              - 16 -     know we have an immediate problem  But, depending on what we assume going forward about   the Treasury’s plans and budget surpluses--and what happens in the immediate future regarding   the demand for Treasury securities--there is a question of the mechanics in terms of how the   Federal Open Market Committee will choose to implement its policy in the future  What you are   suggesting implies I think a broader study that is commissioned by the Federal Open Market   Committee regarding our ability to implement policy in the future  We are now being asked   about that frequently--what are the best available options and how do they affect the mechanics   of monetary policy  So, in addition to Peter and Don, I would suggest that two or three others--  either members of this Committee or Reserve Bank directors of research--take a look at this issue   at the broad level, especially if we are talking about putting off the completion of the study until   either late this year or next year  I think it would be very beneficial to us to have a broader   participation in a study that is commissioned by the full Committee     May I ask the question a little differently?  Let me ask Peter and Don   the question  Do we need to extend this temporary authority before the study is completed?  Is it   so important to the effective conduct of open market operations that waiting until the study is   done before we address this issue is critical?  That was my basic question in terms of the study     Mike, I’d like to explore Jerry's question a bit differently  As I read   the Greenbook and the comments you made today, three factors seem to me to be in play  How   we weigh those factors in a sense rationalizes whatever policy we pursue  One factor relates to              - 38 -     how we judge the position of real interest rates in the context of the budget surplus we talked   about earlier  Another is the productivity issue, which is more dominant and has a very   important role in how we think of the economy going forward and whether we are taking the   right action  The third factor is the output gap on which the model is based--and the cyclical   factors and the NAIRU that are influencing it  Would you discuss for a minute how you weight   these factors?  I’m wondering which one is dominating your thinking in this model because that   affects how you rationalize your position going forward           Mr Chairman, activity in the Tenth District, as in other Districts you   have heard from, continues to be very strong and is little changed from last time  On balance,   there has been less of an impact than we might have expected from the higher interest rates and   from the higher fuel costs  Labor markets remain quite tight and wage pressures exist, but to   date we have not seen any strong move upward in the wage settlements  Part of our slow labor   growth may reflect the fact that our unemployment rate is so low; many firms are having   difficulty finding labor for some of the available jobs  Higher interest rates, as I said, have not   really produced any slowdown  The housing market and retail sales continue very strong in the   District, and auto sales remain brisk despite the higher oil prices   In terms of price increases, competition remains very strong and we hear a lot of   discussion about the need to move prices up as costs increase  But the business people I have   talked with continue to say that they are unable to make price increases stick, and that that is a   problem for them  The farm economy remains in a slump  Farmers have received the subsidies   we’ve talked about  They are aware of that; but they are also aware that people are beginning to   question that  In some sense that makes them all the more concerned about next year  There's a   note of desperation in some of their voices as they talk about it  And now there is talk about   drought conditions, and that has only exacerbated their concern  I think we're hearing more, not   less, from some of the agricultural sectors in the District   Let me turn to the national scene and policy for a minute  My outlook remains   virtually the same as it was at the last FOMC meeting  In my view part of the strength we saw              - 63 -     late last year and so far this year reflects the fact that we were slow to unwind some of the rate   decreases we took in the fall of 1998  Still, looking forward, I see some modest slowing in the   economy, primarily due to an expected settling down of the stock market--perhaps--and the   limited supply of labor, the higher real interest rates, and some elevated prices  Having said that,   though, I do expect inflation to rise this year as a result of developments that are now in train,   including the unwinding of some of the past favorable factors and continued strong demand in   this economy  I think the rise in energy prices is having some effect on the psychology in the   marketplace  And if we do see higher inflation expectations begin to emerge, I think we will see   that built into wage and financial price expectations   I am not convinced, however, that we need to be tightening aggressively  I think the   gradual pace of tightening that we have followed is wise  In fact, because of the uncertainty   surrounding the projections, it would be of some concern to me if we began an aggressive   tightening program  An aggressive mode has its own set of risks that I think we ought to be   aware of  So, I remain oriented to a gradual course of policy action as we go forward  I think   history has shown that to be the prudent approach  Thank you     I agree with your recommendation, Mr Chairman  I do want to make   a comment  When you say “strategy,” given the level of uncertainty that we've talked about   here, I want to clarify that our strategy is not necessarily that we are on a course to continually   increase the funds rate  I favor a strategy that says we know there are upside risks and are   prepared to move, but one that does not assure people that we're going to move in the future    Depending on how that is viewed, I think there can be quite a difference in terms of the message   that we would be delivering  It wasn't clear to me what conclusion in fact we may be coming to   here     Right                - 87 -       Right  With this move we will have moved 125 basis points since last   June and 50 basis points from where we were at the start of the year  It may be appropriate to   move again in the future, but by saying the balance of risks is on the up side, I also want to be   clear that it is not a sure thing  Our strategy isn’t to move these interest rates up 1/4 point until   whenever     Thank you     I agree     Al, I was anticipating your comment--that’s all!     Mike, I'm struck by your last comment that we've perhaps tended   to do too much late in the game because we did too little in the early stages  But does doing   too little in the early stages justify in anyone's mind doing too much later?     But if we are behind the curve, do we want to overreact in an   attempt to correct that?     Right  I like that answer       Mr Chairman, the Tenth District remains generally healthy    Employment growth is still running around 2 percent and we have an unemployment rate of   about 3 percent  But I thought I would take just a minute to convey some anecdotal   information on the District, which supports what Mike Moskow said in his comments in that   to some degree it shows a change in the tone within the District     First on wages and prices, there has been a subtle move toward pressing for higher   wages and some efforts to raise prices  We met last week with both our economic advisory   council and our board of directors  Fairly generally we heard from labor, including unions,   that they are beginning to ask for a little more on the wage front, 4 to 6 percent  But also they   are focusing very heavily on the benefits side, recognizing rising health-care costs and   wanting to keep those benefits up and recognizing, too, that benefits are the nontaxable   portion of income gains  Even among the non-union groups, there is continued pressure for   wage increases and we are hearing more about that   On the pricing side, we are still hearing the story that firms cannot pass on their   higher costs through price increases, but we are hearing about more attempts to do so  In our   area of Oklahoma and of Colorado there have been attempts to move prices up, say, 4 or 5   percent  Of that, maybe 1 percent will stick; but the fact is that the 1 percent is sticking  So,   we do see that taking place  Nevertheless, we are also hearing from the same individuals that   they sense some slowing in their regional economies  The obvious case is real estate  We are   seeing a fairly significant drop in housing demand in the Lincoln, Nebraska area, for example,      62  and some slowing, though not a decline, in Kansas City  Denver remains very strong, and we   are also seeing some carryover of that strength reflected in manufacturing, especially if it is   related to the real estate sector--in home improvement, say--though there’s just a hint of that   Turning to the national economy, our projection is very similar to that of the   Greenbook except for one important difference, which is that the moderation in growth in our   forecast comes with a less aggressive interest rate move  Having said that, with the   information we are getting on wage pressures, I would agree with those who suggest that we   will need to continue to move rates up somewhat  One thing I want to caution about, and I   hinted at it earlier in my question to Mike Prell, is that I think we want to be careful not to get   “sweaty hands" with respect to our policy of gradualism in moving the funds rate up  From   one point of view, we started this tightening when the funds rate was 4-3/4 percent and it is   now at 6 percent  We know that a good portion of the effects of that increase has not yet   played out  We know there are lags in policy  We know that the budget surplus is increasing,   and that has an impact that we have to keep in mind  Considering that and the lags, it seems   to me that the gradualist approach with quarter-point increases is still appropriate rather than   suddenly moving forward to a more aggressive policy  That is particularly noteworthy   because, while we may not be at the right rate yet, we started at 4-3/4 percent and are now at 6   percent, which certainly makes more sense today than it did a year ago  So, while I would   readily agree that we need to keep the pressure on the economy, I think there is something to   be said for staying with a gradualist approach  Thank you     Mr Chairman, everything you said convinced me that a 1/4 point   seems right  Inflation is not taking off and in fact a lot of the evidence suggests some easing off   in the expansion  Moreover, I don't think we should be validating the market necessarily  I think   we should be looking at what is in front of us, and 1/4 point with asymmetric language seems   most appropriate  A year ago when we were at 4-3/4 percent on the funds rate, there was a better   case for moving more aggressively in the sense that we had put in a lot of stimulus  And yet we   were very cautious in moving up  It seems to me that we have been on a pretty good track in our   policy actions and if I had my preference, I would stay on that track  I'll put that view on the   table for consideration     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Let me begin by noting that economic   activity in the Tenth District is still very solid  Having said that, it is also true that we are seeing   mounting evidence of slowing trends within the region  It starts with manufacturing, which   certainly has slowed, with firms clearly reporting smaller usage of capacity  Our latest surveys   of purchasing managers in the region--in the front range of Colorado--suggest that   manufacturing activity is slowing fairly substantially, at least more so than the national average    Also, in some of the conversations we’ve had, business executives have indicated that some   projects are being deferred  We are also seeing evidence that retail sales have softened  In   addition, housing activity, which had weakened in April and May, is reported to have weakened   in June as well  Nonresidential construction activity remains relatively strong, but many of the   executives in that industry are telling me that a more cautionary attitude has emerged and that   they are expecting some slowing as recent interest rate moves begin to have a greater effect on   them  Our energy sector is benefiting from the current level of prices, especially the gas drilling   area, which is fairly active  But in that industry, of course, there has been a downsizing from   earlier periods, so it is harder to get skilled labor for drilling operations and, therefore, activity   is coming up rather slowly  One                                                                 involved in gas drilling   in a fairly significant way says that inventories are low now  Consequently, if demand were to           63  be strong as we go through the year, he feels there will be a surge in prices of natural gas as we   move into the winter   District labor markets still are tight  We don’t hear quite the sense of urgency about   that situation as before but labor conditions clearly are very tight  And price pressures are   similar to what we’ve reported in the past There are some efforts to raise prices but still a lot of   competitive pressure holding them down  Our farm industry, especially on the commodity side,   remains weak  But with recent additions to government payments, farm incomes will be steady   overall     Turning to the national scene, recent indicators, in conjunction with various   developments in the District that I’ve mentioned here, leave me with the very clear impression   that the economy will slow and that recent inflationary pressures should ease over time    Specifically, I have revised down my outlook for growth this year and next and am now   projecting about 3-3/4 percent for GDP growth over the forecast horizon  That is only slightly   below estimates of trend growth  However, unlike the Greenbook, we get those projections   with a fed funds rate that remains at its current level  There are a number of reasons for this   likely slowing, in my view  One is the moderation in stock market gains; another is the increase   in real interest rates  Certainly, the elevated oil and gas energy prices are a factor  And most   importantly from my perspective are our recent increases in the funds rate and more restrictive   monetary policy  While the evidence we are seeing is still mixed, I think we do have more hard   statistical evidence of a slowdown  Also, I am hearing more views from business people, as in   the examples I cited earlier, that higher interest rates have led to a slowdown in economic   activity and a change in business sentiment that I think is important             64  Regarding the inflation outlook, I am aware that the effects of our previously   accommodative monetary policy and the passthrough of oil prices to the non-energy sectors are   continuing and will put some upward pressure on core inflation in the near term  But I am also   convinced that we will not necessarily see an acceleration in core inflation because we have   moved to a more restrictive policy over this past year and that tightening has not had its full   impact on the economy as yet  As long as we remain restrictive for some period of time, the   increase in inflation should be temporary, I think, rather than permanent  I’m looking for   inflation this year to be under 2 percent, as measured by the core PCE, and to rise somewhat, of   course, as we go into next year  But I don’t see an acceleration in inflation  I think we should   be mindful of that as we contemplate policy  Thank you     Mr Chairman, I support your proposal  I don't know if we have   moved as far as we need to, but I suspect that right now there are still a lot of monetary policy   effects in the pipeline from the actions we have taken here recently that are not yet fully in play    We ought to let them work and observe where that is taking us  And as others have said, a lot   of data will be coming in over the next several weeks that I think will provide us useful   information from which to make a further judgment on the effects of our earlier tightening   moves  One of the side benefits is that our press statement last time indicated that the balance   of risks was on the up side and today we are not acting on it, and I believe that is a healthy thing   to do as well  So, I think your recommendation is a very good one     Thank you, Mr Chairman The overall economy for the Tenth District   remains solid; it hasn’t changed a great deal from last time  However, there have been some very   slight signs of further slowing since the last meeting  In the interest-sensitive sectors, particularly   home building, there is clear evidence of some cooling  Also, manufacturing activity appears to   have slowed systematically across the District in both the durable and nondurable goods areas  And   while retail sales picked up in July, the environment in that sector is clearly softer throughout the   District than it was earlier this year     However, in the other direction, nonresidential construction remains very solid in the   District and energy activity has expanded fairly significantly as higher oil, particularly gas, prices       36  have persisted throughout the last several weeks  Labor markets remain strong in the region    Unemployment rates continue to hover around the 3 percent range  But having said that, there are   no real signs of increased wage pressures  So, the situation is fairly much the same within the   District   On the national level, my views haven’t changed significantly from the time of our last   meeting  The economy is carrying momentum forward, but more signs of slowing continue to come   in on the national level  And core inflation pressures obviously remain modest  Perhaps one way to   describe our projection is to say that it is very similar to that of the Greenbook except in a couple of   areas  In our analysis we don’t have in mind a level of demand as strong as in the Board staff’s   projection  Our forecast of productivity gains is a bit less aggressive and that outcome assumes less   aggressive interest rate increases over the period  So, going forward, we see some modest slowing   in the economy and continued modest pressures on inflation  Thank you     Mr Chairman, I support your recommendation  I would say that policy   right now is tight and the issue is whether it ought to be tighter We certainly can wait to see whether   that is the case  One comment on the bias  As a suggestion, I wonder if we should not consider          78   taking out the lone reference to tight labor markets as the reason for our bias  I don't know that there   is a one-to-one mapping into inflation over the time horizon we have been talking about  Given your   comments, as well as those of others here today, it seems to me that we see other risks that are just as   important right now in leading us to this bias  I think they also ought to be considered, or certainly   that tight labor markets should not be given more consideration in our statement than these other   risks     In my view it is something we ought to consider as we go forward     Dave, let me ask you a question  In reading the Greenbook and your   projections, I know you haven’t changed your forecast much from the last time  We need to adjust   for energy, I understand  But in listening to you I sensed a little more of an acknowledgement of   some downside risks in the economy emerging in manufacturing and elsewhere  Is that a fair      34  description of the tone that I heard this morning--that there is a sense of greater downside risks than   you felt before, even though the projections themselves are pretty much unchanged?     Thank you     Thank you, Mr Chairman  The Tenth District as a region is continuing to   do very well in terms of economic activity, but it is apparent to us that growth is slowing  While   overall employment growth in the District is about the same as in the nation, private employment   growth is about ½ percentage point slower overall  Nonresidential construction reflects the softer   conditions in our area  The value of District nonresidential construction has fallen in three of the last   four months and remains significantly below previous peaks in the region  Homebuilding also has   slowed--not as dramatically perhaps, but it’s still a couple of percentage points below year-ago      56  levels  Manufacturing activity in the District also has moderated  Manufacturing jobs actually fell   about 03 percent in August and are down about 06 percent from a year ago  So, we have seen some   slowing there, in part due to higher fuel costs and so forth   Of course, the area in our District that is suddenly doing well relates to the oil and gas   industries, especially natural gas  Like Texas, we produce a lot of natural gas  Our rig count is up   about 125 percent and employment in that sector is up rather significantly as well  So we do have   activity starting to pick up now as people are becoming more confident that higher oil prices are   going to last for a while and are therefore willing to bring some activity back into play     Retail sales generally have been steady and actually have been fairly strong in the Denver   area, as has the whole economy in that region  But, overall, with some slowing we have seen a little   loosening of labor market conditions  The unemployment rate remains about the same or a bit   higher in different areas of the region as well  Price pressures have also remained steady, despite the   fact that some raw materials costs, of course, are going up and have to be dealt with by the   manufacturing companies  We haven’t seen those higher costs come through at all at the retail level;   we’ve actually heard some talk of easing price pressures there     Our agricultural sector is still seeing very weak prices  That industry is very much   dependent upon government payments and will continue to be so through next year at least, based on   the bumper production we see in our region  So we have a strong economy but with some slowing   apparent   At the national level, incoming data have done little to change my outlook on the   economy  From the information I have heard here and our own analysis I would say that growth of   economic activity is in a longer-term slowing phase  Since the beginning of the year, I think the flat   stock market, the higher energy costs in play, and the tighter monetary policy have cooled off      57  consumer spending  And while investment spending remains very good, our projection is that its   growth will be down from the earlier high level, and I think that will play a role as well  As   compared to the Greenbook forecast, our projection is for a stepping down of GDP growth toward   the 3-1/2 percent area  We also see that occurring without further increases in the fed funds rate   from its level today  The risks, of course, are related to energy, which we’ve talked about  And, yes,   energy costs could push overall prices up and that could actually slow the economy  The situation   could be complicated if personal income levels fall and the debt burdens in our economy have to be   dealt with  So, those are the downside risks     In essence, while I wouldn’t fall on my sword on this, Mr Chairman, I think the risks are   more balanced than they have been  I would feel comfortable saying that with a balanced risk   statement, even with these economic projections, because I think the higher rates are still in play    We have seen a slowing expansion and I think that is continuing, which gives us a picture of an   economy with more balanced risks in the future  Thank you     I can accept your recommendation, Mr Chairman, although I think we   could go to a more balanced stance  But we can wait     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Let me spend a little time on   developments in our District  Growth across the Tenth District continues to moderate and some   of the slowing appears to be the result of labor supply constraints  But there is also evidence that   the pace of demand is slowing  Moreover, in talking with business leaders throughout our   District at least, I've noticed a shift in sentiment about future activity  There is increasing   concern about the possibility of a more significant slowdown coming  Having said that, private   employment growth remains close to the national average in most District states  Colorado’s   private employment growth, while still the highest in the District, has fallen considerably--from               29      about a 4-1/2 percent rate in mid-1999 to 2-1/2 percent now--and growth there clearly exceeds   that in the rest of the District   Manufacturing activity was flat in October in our District, although capacity   utilization remained relatively high  Looking forward, District manufacturers have been   lowering their expectations  A manufacturing survey revealed the second consecutive downward   revision in capital spending plans  This obviously raises some questions as to whether   productivity gains will be sustained in that environment  It may also help to explain the shift in   sentiment I mentioned a little earlier   Residential construction activity continues to cool in the District  Excluding   Colorado, single-family housing permits have fallen for four consecutive quarters, leaving the   level down about 20 percent since the fourth quarter of 1998  Indicative of the slowdown, our   business contacts in Kansas City report that start times on housing have now declined from about   90 days to around 15 days  In contrast, though, single-family permits in Colorado are up about   10 percent and median prices in that area are up about 15 percent year over year  Nonresidential   construction activity has fallen even more sharply in most of our District  For example, in the   third quarter the value of nonresidential construction was down about a third everywhere in the   District but in Colorado, where it was down about 10 percent   Energy activity, in contrast, continues of course to benefit from the higher energy   prices  District counts of active oil and gas rigs have increased for about eight months in a row   and are now the highest since December 1993  Drilling contractors have accumulated a sizable   backlog of job commitments, but growth is constrained by a lack of skilled workers in that               30      industry  Many have left the oil industry and it is hard to get them to come back at the wage   levels that are now prevailing   Labor markets overall have remained tight, but with very little change in wage   pressures that we’ve noticed  The District's unemployment rate was about 32 percent in   September, below the national average  Intel, for example, attributed a delay of several months   in opening a new computer chip fabrication plant in Colorado Springs, originally scheduled for   November, to difficulties in hiring--especially construction workers   Manufacturers are seeing higher input prices but they are not able to pass those costs   through in prices  And our farm economy continues to see little change  Cotton crop production   was very strong and, therefore, we continue to see obvious downward pressure on prices   Let me turn to the national economy  The incoming data confirm, as Dave already   noted in his briefing, an ongoing process of moderation in the economic expansion  The lower   rate of GDP growth in the third quarter helps to confirm that slowing  I realize the key question   is, of course, whether the third-quarter results represent a respite or a new trend  To be sure, the   third-quarter growth in consumption expenditures at an annual rate of better than 4 percent is   unlikely to be sustained, but early indications for the fourth quarter suggest that consumers are   following the rest of the economy toward a more moderate pace  And I think that's significant   Nevertheless, I remain satisfied with the outlook for economic activity  I expect the   economy to grow near its sustainable rate, along the lines described by the staff in its projection    Despite a pickup in compensation costs and the acceleration in overall inflation this year, the   underlying inflation rate remains relatively modest in my opinion  On balance, the unwinding of               31      the effects of higher energy prices in conjunction with the 6-1/2 percent fed funds rate should   place some downward pressure on underlying inflation over the forecast horizon   Let me note quickly, though, the risks in the outlook  While inflation risks are still   real, they have moderated to some degree for the reasons I’ve just described  In contrast--and I   think this is consistent with what the staff said in its briefing today--my view is that the downside   risks to economic activity have increased somewhat  I believe that growth slowing to trend is the   most likely outcome  But I also believe there are greater downside risks stemming from recent   developments, and I’d like to tick off some that I would highlight  First, financial conditions   have tightened and the downturn in economic activity has softened corporate balance sheets    Also, we have the higher interest rate spreads that we've talked about today, tighter lending terms   and standards, lower equity prices, an increase in the cost of capital to some degree, and   increased aversion to the risks of more speculative investments  Junk bond default rates are up,   rating downgrades are more prevalent, and profits are lower  Debt as a share of net worth has   been rising more quickly in 2000, after leveling off in prior years, and debt service costs are   increasing   These are factors that are on the horizon and they are affecting the balance of risks   with which we need to deal  And while none of these developments means that growth will   decelerate beyond our expectations, I think we are in a more risky period in terms of our   economic projections and the outlook  Thank you, Mr Chairman     Don, my question is similar to Governor Meyer’s  It strikes   me that how you view the risk statement depends on how you view monetary policy right   now  And this is what I think you were just saying  Suppose you view monetary policy   right now as tight--that is, the funds rate is above the natural rate, whatever term you   want to use--and the economy is slowing  If we still have the risk of inflation but we   have a tight policy, which is addressing that, and now we see a slowing, that means the   downside risks are increasing  We might then want a balanced risk statement because we   have a tight policy to address the one concern and the economy is heading in this other   direction  So, how one views the appropriateness of the risk statement depends on how   one judges the tightness of current monetary policy     Mr Chairman, I too would prefer a balanced risks statement,   and my reasons are perhaps similar to Bill Poole’s  I think we do have upside risks for   inflation, which we are addressing  That's why we have a fed funds rate at the level it is   now, which I believe indicates a fairly tight policy  And I think by holding that position   we have introduced new risks that bring the position more in balance in terms of the   outlook  In my view what is happening with your additional statement is that we've come   full circle  We're now finding ways to compromise on the risks statement; we are   neutering its role and putting more emphasis on the rest of the press release  That may in   fact be the option we end up with, which better describes the views of this Committee in   terms of the risks that have now been introduced and the policy actions that might be   taken in the future  But by having these two different statements, I think we are   introducing a new potential for confusion in the marketplace as well  So I would go for a   balanced statement now in the press release, but we’ll see how this works     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Since our last meeting, the District has   continued to expand, but quite modestly, and there are additional pockets of weakness and some new   areas of concern within the regional economy  There have been some highly publicized layoffs,   although the actual level of employment has remained relatively high  And private employment   growth continues to follow a modest slowing trend for the District, just as it does for the nation   Retail sales got off to an okay start this holiday season, but few expect the kind of year-  over-year growth seen last year  Also, some concern has been expressed that holiday sales levels   have been dependent on some heavy discounting  By far the weakest component of consumer   spending in our region has been for automobiles and light trucks  Both GM and Ford have reduced      36  activity at their Kansas City plants  One has eliminated all overtime and the other has actually shut   down its line for some weeks during the holidays                                             manufactures prefabricated metal buildings and serves on the   national trade association says he sees softening not only in his business but in many other segments   of manufacturing as well  And businesses appear to be taking a very clear wait-and-see attitude   toward investment decisions going into next year   Construction activity is down from a year ago but remains relatively solid overall in the   region, particularly in the Denver area  Homebuilders report that starts turned downward in   November, following a modest rebound the month before  Nevertheless, housing starts and home   sales remained high by historical standards, and the fact that housing prices in most cities continue to   rise faster than the general price level suggests that demand for housing is still relatively strong   Nonresidential construction starts have also stabilized recently, after trending down much   of the year  Energy activity in our District has leveled off recently but is still the highest in years   and is being held back mainly by a lack of rigs and skilled workers  So far, District energy firms   have benefited from both higher gas prices and oil prices     Inflationary pressures in the region do not seem to have changed significantly since our   last meeting  A somewhat higher proportion of business contacts reported above-normal wage   increases in November than in previous months  However, businesses did not appear to have any   more success than before in passing such costs on to the customers  Finally, the farm economy   remains in a slump and dependent on Government subsidies, although there has been some reduction   in inventories that may help to sustain prices in the future   In terms of the national economy, my outlook has not changed a lot over the past month  I   remain cautious about the economy  Economic activity clearly has slowed  So far the slowing has      37  been orderly and I expect it to continue to be so  The incoming price data continue to be consistent   with a moderate underlying inflation rate as well   Let me talk briefly about inflation  Obviously, we’ve received little new information   about inflation over the last month, but what we have received has been generally favorable  Despite   higher energy prices and rising import prices, core inflation remains modest  And we agree with the   Board's staff that it should continue that way  I realize, of course, that headline inflation will be far   from stable over the next few months  The spike in natural gas prices is just one example of the   factors that will complicate our reading of prospective inflation  However, as the winter passes   energy prices should retreat to more normal levels, a prospect reflected in the futures market  Thus,   while we may see some volatility in inflation, I expect it to remain modest for the foreseeable future   Turning to the economy more generally, growth appears to be moderating as expected in   the fourth quarter  Consumers are reining in their spending because of slower employment growth   and lower stock prices this year  Manufacturing activity has also moderated and businesses more   generally are retrenching  Tighter financial conditions, softer earnings, and softer balance sheets   appear to be causing firms to scale back their spending plans  One key question is whether the   economy is decelerating too quickly, as David mentioned  To be sure, recent reports on consumer   confidence and retail activity are noteworthy  While the jury is still out, the evidence is mounting   that the slowdown is real and may last a while  The stock market is down significantly and   anecdotal evidence suggests that labor markets are softening  And as I noted earlier, in our District--  and I think it is true more generally--holiday sales have gotten off to only an okay start and no one   expects strong sales suddenly to emerge   In essence, I agree with the Greenbook that growth will be below trend for some period    Also, as I mentioned at the last meeting, I remain somewhat concerned that tighter financial      38  conditions pose an additional and important downside risk  These include higher interest rate   spreads, lower equity prices, tighter lending terms and standards, increased risk aversion toward   more speculative ventures, and a rise in junk bond default rates  We see higher though still modest   C&I loan delinquencies as well  And finally, after-tax corporate earnings growth is down  As a   result, we're seeing debt as a share of net worth rise in 2000 after leveling off in prior years  Debt   service costs are rising and downward adjustments of capital spending plans are taking place  None   of these factors taken in isolation means growth would decelerate beyond expectations  But the   combination of tighter financial conditions and large financial imbalances increases the risks to the   outlook, and I think significantly     In summary, what the data suggest to me is that the economy can grow at a more modest   but healthy pace in the future and that inflation will remain modest  However, we might wish to   rebalance the risks to the economy by considering an adjustment in policy that goes beyond just the   words in our press statement  Thank you     Mr Chairman, I too would prefer moving now  I think the funds rate is   high and the effect has been to slow the economy as intended  In my view a quarter point reduction   in the rate now would still leave us with a tight policy, one that continues to slow the economy, and   yet it would recognize the risks that we've talked about around the table  I believe it is likely that we   will have a conference call and that we will lower rates at that point  And certainly we can wait until   then      Thank you, Mr Chairman  First of all, I’d like to say that   these papers were really outstanding and advanced our thinking along quite some   distance  I have some specific reactions to points raised in the papers and some broad   reactions to the questions that Don asked  Let me start by saying that I certainly do agree   with the principles outlined in the Beebe/Cumming paper  Of those, maintaining our   independence is the most important principle; I agree with Al Broaddus on that  In   addition, we should do all we can not to subsidize a sector of the economy or individual   institutions   But having said that and having read these papers, whatever our decision, some   asset class or set of institutions will benefit from our action  We know that  It is a matter   of tradeoffs, as Bill McDonough said  Since some segment of the private sector will be a   beneficiary rather than the US government, as is now the case, I think the decision does   have serious implications for our independence  In addition, we may directly or     1/30-31/01 21  indirectly end up affecting relative asset values and the allocation of credit across   institutions and sectors of the economy    So, given the guiding principles, how to proceed in choosing the asset   composition of the System’s balance sheet is the primary issue  For me there are three   implications to these principles and I want to mention them quickly and then go into a   little more detail  First, I think we should conduct outright purchases of US government   securities for as long as possible; I totally agree with that  Second, I think we should   avoid outright purchases of any private sector security  I am concerned that putting on   our balance sheet an asset issued by an ultimate private sector borrower would   compromise our independence in that we would appear to be subsidizing a particular   sector or institution  Currently the US government is the most important ultimate   borrower on our balance sheet  A third point is that we should deal with strong financial   intermediaries rather than with ultimate private sector borrowers  Financial   intermediaries put some “green space,” if I can use that term, between the ultimate   borrower and us  And basically I would prefer having securities on our balance sheet that   are issued by financial intermediaries rather than securities issued by ultimate private   sector borrowers  By using intermediaries we are one step removed from allocating   credit   These views have implications that would lead me to the following incremental   strategy  First, I’d increase our self-imposed limits on our holdings of Treasury   securities  I recognize that these limits were originally imposed in order to minimize the   likelihood that we would affect relative asset prices  But given my strong preference that   we hold Treasury securities rather than anything else, I would accept that we may affect     1/30-31/01 22  some asset values--that’s part of the tradeoff  Second, I’d consider outright purchases of   GNMA mortgage-backed securities  GNMA securities are backed by the full faith and   credit of the US government, and I would avoid outright purchases of Fannie Maes and   Freddie Macs  Third, I’d begin the process necessary to implement the ACF, the auction   process for loans  With the ACF we would be dealing with strong financial   intermediaries  Also the ACF is similar to an RP in that the loan rate is determined in an   open market auction  Unlike an RP the asset on our balance sheet is a loan to a strong   depository institution, not the actual security used in the RP  And finally, the ACF would   allow financial markets time to develop the benchmark security on their own without our   indirectly influencing their decision  I realize that we may in fact have problem   institutions, but I don’t think we would be triggering the public knowledge of that    That’s all publicly disclosed now  It’s part of market discipline  Most of those have   written agreements  I don’t think we will be triggering public disclosure of problem   credit situations if we have to redirect our lending from assets involving problem credit    And fourth, I would continue to use RPs as we do currently--that is, as a means to hit our   intended fed funds rate target on a daily basis  I would not use RPs to increase the size of   our portfolio; I’d use the auction for that  Using RPs as a primary means to increase the   size of our portfolio would permanently put private assets on our balance sheet, contrary   to our principles     So in trying to see how we would move toward a process--and not to dismiss   Al Broaddus’s proposal because I think it’s interesting--this is the incremental approach I   would follow  I believe it would allow us to achieve an orderly transition, as the     1/30-31/01 23  government retires its debt, in a way that is most consistent with the four principles that   have been set forth  Thank you for the time     Our goal in a sense is to try to get through this transition   without shocking the system as we move toward holding different types of assets  That’s   why I prefer this incremental approach, which takes us through a series of assets that we   might hold while increasing, to the extent that is feasible, the amount of our current   holdings  I think the ACF is one avenue to a long-term solution, although I recognize   that the ACF raises issues that need to be dealt with  But I’d hate to move toward   complete reliance on RPs or toward holding a particular type of agency security that   would have a more narrow impact for the particular markets or institutions involved       1/30-31/01 24    Peter and Don, I understand why you want to diversify into   the foreign sovereigns and why you dislike Fannie Mae becoming the benchmark and so   forth, but let me ask you to speculate a bit further  The market would be informed as to   why we were doing this and I wonder if there would be a political backlash in the sense   of our favoring foreign sovereign over domestic securities  That whole issue could come   back and bite us in a sense, as we try to move into that market  Is there a risk or even a   likelihood that we might have to deal with that type of criticism?     Yes     It does point out how carefully it has to be explained not only   to our most severe critics but also to those who immediately grasp it and understand it     1/30-31/01 66    Mr Chairman, just to clarify  On the request to explore   securities of foreign sovereigns for repos--one option we’re considering--when you say as   we go forward we will give context to this, do you intend that we would have a broader   discussion of this whole topic?  In other words, here is one solution for the short term    There are other long-term solutions under discussion, so will we provide a full context   and not raise expectations that we’re looking at foreign sovereigns as our solution for   expanding the depth of the market?      Okay, thank you     Second     Thank you, Mr Chairman  In the Tenth District, economic   growth has slowed further since our last meeting  Manufacturing and even some areas of   homebuilding are experiencing outright declines in activity while other sectors generally   are growing at a slower pace  As far as we can tell, for the District’s economy as a whole   growth is still positive and labor markets are still relatively tight but far less so than they   were just a month ago  Moreover, with all the layoff announcements and talk about the     1/30-31/01 134  slowing economy, consumers clearly are becoming uneasy  In our surveys of District   contacts, businesses are showing more caution; they are waiting to see how the economy   fares before they make any major decisions  Employment edged down last month and, in   a departure from prior experience, last month’s slowdown in job growth was due more to   weakness in demand than to the lack of qualified labor that we’ve talked about in the   past  A lot of the job losses in December were in manufacturing and construction, and   these are also the sectors about which we have been hearing the most reports of declining   activity lately  And we are hearing of extended layoffs at our local auto manufacturing   plants  We’ve also been getting a steady flow of layoff announcements from other areas   as well, which could limit job growth in the next couple of months  Retail sales have   been sluggish  Despite heavy discounting, sales in December and early January were up   only modestly over a year ago  Many of our contacts said unease about the economy was   causing consumers to put off purchases, especially of big ticket items such as autos     On a more positive note, some areas in commercial construction did hold   steady  Work continues on a number of large projects, and commercial space is still in   relatively short supply in most of our cities  A few contacts expressed concern about   overbuilding in the retail market, but otherwise markets seem to be in general balance    Of course, energy activity remains a source of strength in our region, expanding as fast as   firms can find equipment and workers  The District’s rig count climbed further last   month and is now at an 8-year high  In our District inflationary pressures remain   relatively subdued and may even have eased slightly since our last meeting  Only a few   of our business contacts reported above-normal wage increases, less than in the past   months  Retail prices also appear to have edged down last month due to some heavy     1/30-31/01 135  discounting  To be sure, some manufacturers have been hit hard by higher input costs,   especially for natural gas  However, they are not finding it any easier to pass those costs   on than before     Let me turn to my comments on the national economy  I think recent events   have confirmed our concern--or my concern at least--that the economy might slow more   dramatically than desired or than thought likely only a month ago  Incoming data on   economic activity suggest that the slowing continues and, like the Board's staff, I have   marked down my outlook for near-term growth  But also like the staff, over the longer   run I still remain confident about the underlying resilience of our economy   Currently, though, we are in a cyclical slowdown  Weakness in the economy   is likely to be broad-based  Consumption, especially durable goods expenditures, and   business fixed investment continue to soften  Residential housing should tread water, I   suspect, as low mortgage rates help to prop up demand  But inventory investment, as   we’ve already noted, is softening noticeably  Incoming inflation data confirm a trend of   moderate inflation pressures  Given that the economy is slowing, that energy price   increases are showing some signs of unwinding, and that inflation expectations remain   well anchored, inflation could ease some     This projected economic weakness and moderate inflation outlook suggest to   me that a 50 basis point reduction in the fed funds rate might be appropriate for us to   consider  In my view, the current federal funds rate continues to represent a tight policy    The issue is not just whether we’re in a recession but whether policy is tight, and I think   it is  A 50 basis point reduction would take us toward a more neutral policy and would   reflect prudence  I would suggest, as I have before, that it is in the early stages of a     1/30-31/01 136  policy shift that we can be more aggressive in our rate actions  As we get to lower rate   levels, we should be more cautious about any change or hold the rate constant to assess   the situation  It is at times like the present that I think we can, and probably should, act a   little more boldly   Let me also take a minute to talk about the risks  As I’ve said, I think the   longer-term outlook is for a pickup in economic growth as we get into the second half of   the year  But there are important risks to this forecast  First, I think investment could   decline further  Softer aggregate demand has a depressing effect on business fixed   investment and future business spending  In light of weakening financial balance sheets   and past spending levels, business fixed investment may be particularly vulnerable   Second, consumer debt service levels remain relatively high and asset values have   softened  These factors and the low saving rate, along with declining consumer   confidence and slower employment growth, could undermine consumer spending and the   economy’s growth  And finally, the foreign sector continues to embody some risks    With our large current account deficit and perhaps a slowing in economic growth   elsewhere, I believe there are some risks in that area as well  These are the kinds of   factors that we need to have in mind today as we consider our policy actions in the next   part of this meeting  Thank you     I’m in agreement with your recommendation, Mr Chairman     I have a couple of questions for you, David, and I’d like you   to look out a little beyond the forecast horizon  You commented on the alternative     3/20/01 22  scenario with a more aggressive reduction of the funds rate  I know you have projected   the inflation rate out to 2002 under that scenario and I’d just like to get your impressions   of what it might imply for 2003   My second question has to do with the effects of such a policy on construction   activity, given the comments in the Greenbook and in your statement about that sector    Banks in our region are beginning to lend more aggressively on real estate  If we were to   pursue that more aggressive policy easing, would that perhaps have the effect of pushing   the yield curve down?  If that lowered the capitalization rates on real estate, we could see   a fairly dramatic shift of funds into that sector as people look to deploy their assets,   which might cause some--for lack of a better word--overbuilding in the real estate area    If construction takes off as implied or real capitalization rates fall, what effects do you   think that might have down the road?       Thank you     Thank you, Mr Chairman  The Tenth District economy   remains sluggish but some signs of stability are beginning to appear  Manufacturing   activity continues to decline and auto sales in most of our areas remain relatively weak,   although some recent pickup has been noted  Incoming data on other sectors have had a   more positive tone  Interestingly, like David Stockton, we really did expect to find a lot   of gloom and doom with respect to the real economy and we didn’t  We found some   positive elements in the situation   Let me turn to specifics  I’ll start with the slower industries first, which   include, of course, manufacturing  Our Bank’s most recent manufacturing survey   showed a decline in January  Activity was below year-ago levels, for the first time in the   six years we’ve conducted this survey  Capital spending was also down from a year ago    And purchasing managers were not nearly as optimistic about future activity as they were   earlier  One of our directors,                                 indicated that his firm’s business was   down about 5 percent from a year ago due to lower export demand and also the effects in     3/20/01 58  rural areas of the decline in wealth among hobby farmers  He has had to lay off about   one-third of his workforce, a noticeable reduction in that particular market   Consumer spending remains soft but also has shown some signs of a firming    Auto sales were down sharply in January but subsequently recovered somewhat  And   most of the retailers we contacted in February said that their sales were about level and   that they were seeing some increase in traffic  For example, one of our contacts, a   furniture manufacturer who sells in Denver, reported a significant increase in traffic and   greater interest in some of their big ticket items  Construction activity, while down from   a year ago, rose sharply in January following a poor December  Retailers and   homebuilders in some of our markets view the slowdown relative to a year ago as a pause   and they remain optimistic about the period ahead    Labor market developments also provide some evidence that the District   economy may be stabilizing  Employment continued to grow in January, the latest month   for which we have data, and we have seen a noticeable reduction in layoff   announcements  Perhaps most importantly, our directors and other contacts tell us that   most of the workers who have been laid off are being hired by other firms, so there has   not been a great struggle in finding employment given the job vacancies that existed  The   supply of labor may not be as tight as it was earlier, but labor also does not appear to be   in excess supply    Energy activity is strong in our area  Shortages of equipment and workers   actually have constrained drilling activity  The equipment seems to be becoming   available but skilled workers remain in short supply  Conditions in the farm economy are   mixed, with livestock producers making a profit while grain producers will have to rely     3/20/01 59  once again on government subsidies  Inflationary pressures in the District have remained   modest, although we’ve seen some pickup in the general trend of inflation within the   region   Let me turn to the national economy  Recent developments indicate that some   broad-based weaknesses from the fourth quarter are spilling over into the first quarter    Like the Board’s staff, we also expect growth in the first quarter to be relatively slow--  below the 1 percent mark  While this represents a marked slowdown, we also expect the   US economy to continue to grow modestly as we go forward, a view that is not   inconsistent with the staff’s forecast  Moreover, recent inflation developments have been   relatively modest, a fact we certainly recognize     Though the pace of economic activity has been decelerating, as I said earlier   recent economic statistics and reports from business contacts in our District--and I think   more generally--suggest some stabilization is occurring  I was surprised at the relatively   favorable outlook painted by the many directors and business contacts we talk with, but   they had to look at the hard economic data and get their focus off the stock market in   order to do that     Sorting through all these data and impressions, I expect the economy to grow   modestly this year and into 2002  However, I also recognize that there’s a great deal of   uncertainty in the near term and some downside risks as well  On the down side,   manufacturing is clearly in a slump, problems in the high-tech sector have deepened,   consumer confidence has plummeted, and the stock market’s performance has nose   dived  It has been reported to me that CEOs are putting off new projects and cutting back   on some existing projects  While recognizing this, I nonetheless judge that the most     3/20/01 60  likely prospect for the US economy is that it will move back toward its long-run trend   growth  Several factors support that assessment, including our solid productivity trends,   our stable inflationary environment, and our sound financial institutions  Those factors   will provide a strong foundation as we move into 2002    Given where we are, I would feel comfortable with a modest reduction in   interest rates from where they are now  A lot of momentum has been put into the   economy through our easing moves earlier this year  In addition to that easing I would   support a further modest move, perhaps for a total of 50 basis points, to insure against the   downside risks that we all recognize  Those downside risks stem from the large and   growing financial imbalances in the economy, especially the unsustainably low personal   saving rate, the high level of consumer debt, and difficulties in the foreign sector  If   these imbalances were to worsen, we could see a further deceleration in activity or   possibly an actual slowdown in the economy   In such an environment I would not be surprised if consumers tried to boost   their savings, rebalance their portfolios, and offset their losses of net worth, nor would I   be surprised if businesses tried to cut back on planned capital expenditures  Such   reactions have the potential to magnify the economy’s modest slowdown and precipitate   a drop in aggregate demand  In my view that possibility is the key risk to an orderly   rebound in economic activity  And that’s why in the current situation I support a modest   policy move for insurance purposes  I would be very cautious about taking more than a   modest step because I believe there is a lot of stimulus in the economy that hasn’t yet   shown through  Monetary policy has long and variable lags, so I also worry about the   risk that our easing actions could become procyclical, with further stimulus coming into     3/20/01 61  the economy as it moves--in the scenario painted by the Greenbook and others around   this table--out of its current slowdown  Thank you     Mr Chairman, I support your proposal  As I said earlier, I see   enough weakness and risk in the economy looking forward beyond this quarter to justify   a 50 basis point cut  And I am relieved that we are not doing more than that because in   my view that would introduce some of the problems you noted  It most definitely would   introduce moral hazard issues with regard to the market and what it would expect from   us, which would be inappropriate  So, I am comfortable with your recommendation     3/20/01 94  I have two questions  When you spoke of an intermeeting move, did you have   in mind a conference call with the Committee to go forward with such an action?    Secondly, in the press statement coming out of this meeting, would you anticipate any   reference to the market or would the market not be mentioned?  If nothing else, we're   going to get ourselves in this trap--     Okay, thank you very much     Mr Chairman, when I was listening to your comments, I   thought you were going to put words in the statement that said we might move in the   intermeeting period  In reading this draft, I’m quite relieved that you are not doing that    So, I can live with this sentence  I would take out “especially” if I had my choice   SEVERAL  Yes     I can live with this sentence because if I can’t live with this   sentence, I can’t live with the sentence that precedes it either  I don’t think it says that we   necessarily are going to move in the intermeeting period  I would take out the word   “especially” so it is more parallel to our statement in December and not less  Other than   that, I’m fine with this     3/20/01 108    What does a “yes” vote mean?  Does “yes” mean “especially”   is in or out?     No     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I have had an opportunity in the last   several days to talk with different groups, including our economic advisory council and our     5/15/01     29   board of directors, and I would say that the view is still that economic growth in our District   remains sluggish  Businesses have been putting some of their capital spending plans on a wait-  and-see basis, not because they can’t find funding but because they want to see how things   develop  There was very little talk of recession in the discussions with our contacts  I was also a   bit surprised by the fact that a minority of those individuals commented that they wondered   whether additional discount rate cuts would really help with our problems, which are related to   energy and over-investment in some high-tech and telecommunications industries  So there was   a sense of how far the easing has gone and a question of whether it’s perhaps enough or more   than enough      More specifically, turning to our manufacturing survey, that sector continues to be   weak  The production index, though, did rise slightly from its January low  And on an anecdotal   basis, a minority of manufacturers talked about having made some very fast and harsh cutbacks   early on so that their operations are now profitable again and they are more optimistic going   forward    Consumer spending is mixed in our region  Retailers report that sales of big-ticket   items have been weaker than desired, which has offset the moderate strength they have seen in   sales of other items  The attractive mortgage interest rate environment has underpinned   residential real estate  There are some signs of slowing in the residential sector but very modest   slowing, and prices are still rising--although not as rapidly as they were in our Denver market,   for example  Commercial real estate remains strong but also is softening  And labor market   conditions have eased obviously and noticeably  Energy remains our strongest sector, with   further upside potential very clear  There is a lot of activity in that area and companies are trying     5/15/01     30   to get, as they say, iron and labor into the field  The farm outlook is unchanged from the last   time we met, with grains still in surplus and cattle and beef very strong right now       Let me talk briefly about the national economy  Obviously, as has been pointed out   here, the economy has slowed and certainly will continue to grow slowly in this second quarter    There are also obvious downside risks, which have been pointed out  Maybe we will have   further slowing in business fixed investment, for example  What are the effects of slower   earnings growth, foreign demand, consumption, and so forth?  And the psychology is negative    But there is no panic; we’re not talking about an overall sense of gloominess  Perhaps more   importantly, I believe, there is significant stimulus in the pipeline and with it I think the outlook   for the nation is generally rather positive, despite the powerful crosscurrents affecting the   economy  Accordingly, I would suggest that the staff’s forecast is a little too pessimistic on   growth and a little too optimistic on inflation  I would certainly acknowledge the existence of   downside risks  But GDP growth in the first quarter was stronger than people had expected    Sales figures, despite the downward adjustments for March and February, have been better than   people had thought  And a lot of inventory adjustments appear to be well advanced at this point    The outlook has been helped by our changes in policy  Our actions appear to have cushioned the   deceleration in activity  The decline in short-term rates, the decline in risk spreads, and double-  digit rates of growth in M2 are having beneficial effects in the short term  Moreover, our policy   easing has yet to be played out fully and will be felt more completely as the changes in monetary   policy kick in with a lag   All this taken together leads me to conclude that the economy will strengthen during   the second half of this year and into 2002, especially with the policy we now have in place  My   forecast is indeed much stronger than the staff’s  And financial markets, as we’ve discussed,     5/15/01     31   indicate that they also may be looking for a stronger outcome, given the steeper yield curve and   the decline in credit risk spreads   With that background, let me talk a minute about the inflation outlook  The gradual   increase in core inflation over the past year is a concern to me  While much of the increase may   reflect the pass-through of energy prices to core inflation, the current fed funds rate is   accommodative, in my judgment, and that heightens my concern for the longer-term outlook    Even assuming that energy prices decline somewhat and that core inflation stays at its current   level, our more accommodative policy may very well lead consumers, laborers, and businesses to   ratchet up their inflation expectations  There is some evidence that this is already occurring, and   it is likely to become more pronounced if we pursue policies that are increasingly   accommodating and aggressive  For example, the Michigan survey saw, in the steepening of the   yield curve that I mentioned, an early sign of this upcreep in inflation expectations  My   judgment is that core inflation could rise later this year and next year as our accommodative   policy moves forward     For these reasons I think the relative risk between weaker growth and higher inflation   has shifted since our last meeting  The economy remains vulnerable to downside risks in the   short run  Certainly, the behavior of business investment and anecdotal reports about rising   layoffs suggest that we are not out of the woods, and I’m not suggesting that we are  However,   our prompt and aggressive policy actions have served to address these developments to an   important degree, and the risks have begun to shift toward higher inflation as we move later into   the forecast period  Because of this change in relative risk, I would prefer to shorten our strides   and be more cautious as we take actions going forward  I have stated on previous occasions that   I believe we should front-load our policy actions and make our aggressive moves early  And     5/15/01     32   after four moves of 50 basis points each over the last four months, I believe a more cautious   approach may be in order this time  Thank you     Mr Chairman, I think we should pull back on the throttle today  Over   the past four and one-half months we’ve moved policy in a very aggressive way to an easier   position  In my view an additional 50 basis point cut will move us to an overly accommodative   position  We’ve added significant liquidity to the market  Now we should let it work through and   we should be far more cautious about further moves  I think we have an opportunity with a 25   basis point move and an asymmetric risk statement today to give the signal that you’re   suggesting  So I’m of the view that a 25 basis point cut, with retention of the statement that the   risk is weighted to weakness in output, is what we should do now  I certainly agree that the risk   of weaker growth continues to dominate over the risk of inflation for now  But a lot of easing is   in train  An additional 25 basis points would only continue the easing; it wouldn’t stop the easing   process  And policy, as we all know, works with a lag  Thus the relative risks have shifted since   our last meeting--though not to the point where the predominant risk is inflation, which is why I   think it is appropriate to reduce rates  My preferred approach would take us on a less aggressive   trajectory down and prepare the market for our acting in either direction     My suggestions are along the lines of President Minehan’s  I would   shorten the statement    Thank you This is just a clarifying question on Chart 8, the middle   panel In your discussion you suggested, I think, that the spark that created the movement down   in investment started with telecommunications and then moved over to real E&S spending other   than high-tech Did I hear you correctly when you were referring to the relationship of the high-  tech sector to the decline in other investment spending?    I ask because activity in the manufacturing sector was probably   declining even before the downturn in the high-tech sector  So I had it reversed in a sense I’m   just having a hard time following your theory exactly in terms of this downturn and I wonder   whether there are any implications if I disagree with you on that--if I don't think the tech sector   had much to do with this perhaps    I just wanted to make sure I heard it right    Mr Chairman, not a great deal has changed in the Tenth District  Our   economy does remain sluggish, as it was at the time of our May meeting  Manufacturing overall   remains in the doldrums  Capacity utilization continues to decline and plant managers say that   they are still working with inventories that they feel are too high  Firms are delaying some of   their expansion plans but the dichotomy among firms is interesting, reflecting somewhat the   contrasts mentioned in yesterday's discussion  A Corning plant in Oklahoma, which   manufactures optical fiber, has delayed additions to its capacity for obvious reasons  On the   other hand, one of our metal fabricators, while saying that the manufacturing industry is still in   recession, reports that they are beginning to see light at the end of the tunnel  They are seeing   some strengthening of orders, so they are more optimistic  That reflects, I think, a bit of the   contrast in the economy   Consumer spending has held up better than might have been expected, but the outlook   obviously remains quite uncertain in these times  While there are some signs of a rebound in     6/26-27/01 106   consumer confidence within the region, we are still seeing some cutbacks in discretionary   spending, especially in the consumption patterns of some of our higher income households   Residential construction has held steady but the demand for housing, based on recent   anecdotal data at least, is showing signs of slowing  Sales are down somewhat from a year ago    In most of our markets the inventory of unsold homes has increased and housing inflation in our   cities has slowed, especially in Denver where it had been most prominent  The picture is much   the same in commercial real estate  Construction is holding steady but there is some downward   pressure on prices and rents  Again, Denver is showing some increased problems, partly   reflecting their high-tech orientation, because Level 3, one of the companies building some of   these fiber optic networks, has laid off a considerable number of employees   The energy sector remains a strong factor in our economy  The rig count rose again in   May and is at a new eleven-year high, and drilling activity continues to be restrained to some   degree by a shortage of labor and equipment for that industry  Our agricultural economy remains   mixed; meat producers are doing well and grain producers are doing very poorly   As for the labor market, firms are finding it easier than it was a year ago to hire   workers From highly trained IT specialists to retail and other lower skilled workers, the market   has eased up The unemployment rate hasn't budged a whole lot, though, especially since our last   meeting  The proportion of business contacts reporting labor shortages has been about the same   recently as it was in March  Reflecting the sluggishness, wage pressures have eased somewhat in   our area and overall price pressures also have remained relatively subdued   Turning to the national situation, I have marked down my growth projections for the   near term but remain fairly optimistic, in line with the Greenbook, in terms of the longer run  I   now expect the economy to grow at a sustainable rate approximating the economy’s potential by     6/26-27/01 107   the end of the forecast horizon  At the same time, I've become more concerned about the   inflationary pressures that may follow  Price pressures should be contained for the time being  I   recognize that the current stance of policy has the potential to push up the underlying inflation   rate as we go forward   It is not surprising, of course, that the outlook for the US economy remains   pessimistic in the near term, which I think still reflects some of the lagged effects of tighter   monetary policy and higher energy prices from last year  And as we discussed yesterday, I   believe it also reflects a buildup of excess capacity in important sectors such as   telecommunications and technology as well as a significant slowdown in foreign economies   In this environment, Mr Chairman, our accommodative policy has begun to reverse   the effects of our previously tighter policy and has had an impact on certain sectors in terms of   increasing demand in those areas  It is not clear, though, that further easing can immediately   reverse the effects of some of the other factors that I've just mentioned  Of course, the question   we now confront centers on whether we should ease further to better assure recovery or whether   in a determined effort to turn things around we may be easing too much and therefore risk   overshooting our longer-run goals   I acknowledge that it is difficult to be patient in an environment of rising employment   and slowing growth but that, of course, is what I am suggesting here  I keep coming back to the   following logic  By most estimates the real fed funds rate is below the equilibrium long-term   rate, and policy is by that definition accommodative; additional fiscal stimulus is in process and   will have an impact on the economy later this year and next; monetary policy works with a lag, as   others have said here today, which suggests that our recent easing moves have yet to be fully   experienced; they will have increasing influence later this year and next  I admit that we don't        6/26-27/01 108   know if we are being too accommodative, but the risks of that are certainly increasing  I'm   concerned that if we follow a policy in which rates are set much below current levels and they   remain there over the next year, we risk over-stimulating the economy in 2002 and we risk higher   inflation in 2002 and beyond Thank you    Don, in terms of the press statement that you talked about at the end of   your remarks  What do you think the market's reaction would be to a statement that noted the   downside risks but also indicated that we might be finished easing, depending on the data that     6/26-27/01 133   accumulate over the next several weeks?  I don't want to put words in Bill Poole's mouth but I’m   thinking about his suggestion that we say we’re inclined to wait with regard to judgments about   our future policy course    But don't you think there's a possibility that the message is that if the   incoming data were weak, we would evaluate that, especially if we had a balance of risk   statement weighted to the downside?  Isn't that just as likely--or perhaps more likely, I think--to   be the real message?    Mr Chairman, if I had my preference, I would have stopped the   easing process by now I would not go the quarter point  But, given your recommendation,   including the third part of your recommendation on signaling that we are most likely done, as I   understand it, unless there is significant new information, I can accept your recommendation  I     6/26-27/01 150   would add that I would like to see more of an explanation in our press statement, but since I   argued last time for a shorter statement, I will not push that point here today  [Laughter]    Mr Chairman, the Tenth District’s economy continues weak    Manufacturing remains in a slump in our area  According to our Bank’s most recent   manufacturing survey, activity declined again in July, moving well below year-ago levels    Inventories were also down substantially and a significant fraction of firms said they plan to   continue reducing inventories over the next six months  One bright spot is that the capital   spending projections did not deteriorate further     Consumer spending held steady in most of our District, as it has elsewhere in the   nation I continue to hear that consumers are becoming increasingly value conscious, though, so   discount stores are enjoying the stronger sales at the expense of other retailers  Residential   construction remains stable  Home sales are solid in most of our cities, although inventories of   unsold homes are creeping up Throughout the District there is weakness in the demand for   high-priced homes, though, and that is telling in some areas, particularly Denver  Commercial   real estate is showing signs of softening further  Office vacancy rates continue to rise in both   Denver and Kansas City, as businesses in both cities cut back on their expansion plans  There is   still a substantial amount of construction in the pipeline but the surge in vacancies is causing   developers to have some second thoughts     The energy sector remains a bright spot in our District  Even with the recent easing in     8/21/01 35   oil and gas prices, the rig count grew again in July  Labor markets have eased further  Layoff   announcements remain high, although they have come down a bit from earlier in the year    Reflecting the sluggish economy, inflationary pressures continue to subside in our area  Only   one of the employers we contacted said that it had granted above-normal wage increases   recently   As mentioned earlier by President Stern, conditions in the farm economy have   improved  That sector has been helped not only by some price increases but also by the recent   package that was approved for aid to the farm industry  Our projections now show that farm   income on the national level will increase about 9 percent this year, so some spending should   accompany that     Let me turn to my views on the national outlook  It is noteworthy that while we   continue to adjust our outlook--both the value and the time horizon--our staff as well as the   Greenbook staff still see as the most likely outcome that the economy should strengthen toward   potential over the next few quarters  Therefore, it strikes me that the issue is  Do we continue   with the current easy policy or do we ease further at this time?  I say policy is easy as we might   measure it, using monetary growth and the real fed funds rate compared to the equilibrium   natural rate that has been estimated  I would add that from what I can tell, our last generation of   experiences suggests that it takes about four to five quarters from the start of an easing period for   the easing to have an impact that we can see in terms of GDP growth     This suggests that we are probably on track toward eliminating the cyclical   weaknesses that now exist But in our view of the outlook, we obviously have some rather   serious risks The incoming data are clearly mixed and it’s hard to do nothing when the data are   mixed  I would add that the foreign sector is weaker--and weaker than many had anticipated--    8/21/01 36   and that most certainly adds to the downside risks for us to consider  I think all this is   complicated to a degree by the difficulty of separating out the structural factors in our economy   that are weak--and will stay weak regardless of our short-term monetary policy--from the   cyclical factors So in some ways our difficulty today is to determine whether we are being--if I   may use this term--cyclically correct  [Laughter]    Mr Chairman, I think the proposal you put on the table is quite   reasonable and I would support it Let me make a couple of comments  I do think our policy is   accommodative right now and it will become more accommodative with this move  But in my   view it’s not just the markets that are nervous and uneasy  Main Street is also nervous and   uneasy Your proposed action serves to address that to an important degree and, therefore, I am   supportive of it I do agree with those who are concerned about the lags and about our ability to   reverse course at the appropriate time; that isn’t a science but in part it involves our recognizing     8/21/01 79   when to do so We have to trust that we’ll be able to do that at that time  So I’m very supportive   of your recommendation at this point   One thing I have to say, with due deference to Al Broaddus, is that I do not want an   expanded statement  I argued hard for the statement to be shorter and I think it should stay that   way In my view the market has to recognize our stance by our actions and by what is happening   in the economy--that is the best way to get the message across--and to react to that information at   the appropriate time     I’m flattered    Mr Chairman, the economy in the Tenth District, like that for   the nation, remains sluggish  Some people might say it was mixed at best prior to the   events of September 11th Of course since then, as we’ve heard around this table, the   anxiety and uncertainty that was already in the economy took an even greater hit and   caused the outlook to worsen noticeably, as reflected in the Greenbook as well as in our   staff and the Blue Chip forecasts    Let me give you some data on the District  These developments are consistent   with the national news because many of the reports are from firms operating nationally    First of all, the manufacturing survey we conducted in July was quite negative  Our   dispersion index was minus 28  When we took a look at the August survey, we became   somewhat hopeful because that negative had become much smaller, moving to minus 7    But in September--and part of the survey was clearly done after September 11th --that   index went back to minus 16  So we saw a big switch in sentiment in terms of the   prospects looking forward   On the transportation side, I would make a couple of points As for the   airlines, our experience is the same as others have talked about  Boeing, which has     10/2/01 43   operations in Wichita, has announced significant layoffs  But as a side comment, Cessna,   which also operates there, has a backlog on orders for corporate aircraft  And that   backlog is growing, apparently reflecting increased demand for fractional ownership as   the desire to find alternative air transportation is starting to take hold   Let me talk for just a minute about the trucking industry  Bill Poole mentioned   a firm in that sector  In Kansas City we also have a large nationally operating trucking   company that does a lot of shipping for manufacturing firms  We recently had a   conversation with their people, and they said the firm’s business is down markedly  It   was down noticeably prior to September 11th and since then it has only gotten worse, as   their customers have pulled back  Their comment to me was that they are now operating   at 1985 levels of business So, they have had very significant reductions in volume and   have just announced sizable layoffs They have about 10,000 drivers and have laid off a   significant number of them as well as staff in their corporate operations     Looking at the railroad industry, we have a major railroad operating north-   south from Kansas City and then into Mexico  Their volumes in and out of Mexico have   dropped noticeably and their order books have dropped as well  Previous to September   11th they had initiated layoffs, and there are no signs of rehiring at this point      As for the retail sector, like others we’ve talked to many retailers  They have   reported a fairly persistent return to the pre-September 11th pattern in terms of sales But   the experience is very mixed as they look to the Christmas season  Some are saying   they’ve pulled back dramatically  One, as was reported in the national press, followed   through completely in their Christmas orders as their sales were up 25 percent  So we’ve   heard very mixed reports on the retail side      10/2/01 44   Energy, which for us is a two-edged sword, is also a mix  Because prices are   down that’s good in the general sense  But it also means that we’ve seen a real drop-off   in activity in our region; it’s down about 10 percent by our estimate   Generally, activity in our region is slower  The change in psychology is   noticeable, in terms of the effects   Looking to the national situation and policy, I would say that we also see the   economy recovering eventually  But given the psychology and the uncertainty,   forecasting the timeline for the recovery is exceedingly difficult  I wouldn’t pretend to   have a better forecast than anyone else in this room; mine would be no better than Dave   Stockton’s, for sure   Another factor mentioned here that I think is an important consideration is   fiscal policy We don’t know how that’s going to evolve  Trying to pull all this together,   I would be supportive of an easing--pick the amount  I think an easing step would   recognize that at least for the next several months the downside risks are probably going   to weigh very heavily on our economy Our experience in other instances, as people have   pointed out, is that we tend to underestimate the downside  In my view that is a real   possibility in this case as well So I would be more inclined to err on the side of easing    We can reverse the easing should fiscal policy be overly stimulative or should the   economy turn up, and I believe the market would understand that  I think we are in a   good position in that regard So overall a case for easing policy can be well supported, if   that should be deemed necessary here  Thank you    I support your recommendation  I would make just a couple   of quick comments that relate to the chart we were talking about a minute ago  One way   I looked at that was to ask the question Going forward, which mistake do we most want   to avoid?  Given the fragility and the psychology of the market, I think we most want to   avoid not appearing to be willing to take this action  So what you propose is exactly what   I want Second, I would like to say ditto to what the Vice Chairman said earlier  I   expect--and maybe hope--that we will have to reverse this easing move  But I think the   market is already thinking about that  We don’t need to say it  And it is probably better   if our statement is shorter rather than longer  Thank you    Oh, you’re very welcome!  [Laughter]    Mr Chairman, the economy in the Tenth District has not really   deteriorated since our last meeting, but that’s not saying much since it is considerably weaker than it   was before the events of September 11th Layoff announcements have subsided somewhat but   remain significantly higher than before the attacks  The composition of the job cuts being   announced also has shifted in the last month, with more now outside the airline, aircraft   manufacturing, and travel industries in our region  District manufacturing remains in a slump but it   does not appear significantly weaker than last month  Outside of autos, consumer spending has not   recovered from the initial fall after the attacks and retailers in many areas are very much worried   about the upcoming holiday season  The convention and hotel business has not returned to normal   either, due not only to continued concerns about safety and travel delays but also to cost cutting by   businesses under earnings pressure  Housing activity has slowed in much of the District, especially   in the high-end sector and particularly in Kansas City and Denver Those cities are also being hit   with slowdowns associated with layoffs in the high-tech sector  These layoffs also are increasing   concerns about commercial real estate  We see a lot of subleased space emptying out right now      11/6/01 45   And though Realtors are prone to point out that it’s not nearly as bad as in the last recession, they are   in fact worried   Let me say a bit more on manufacturing  Preliminary results from our Bank’s latest   survey of manufacturers show that production was about as weak in October as it was in September    Our firms are more pessimistic about the future than they were in the previous month  For example,   the six-month-ahead production index was down about 6 points in the survey  Among other   forward-looking indicators, the capital spending index fell about 5 more points and the inventories of   raw materials index also declined  So, looking forward, there is quite a bit of pessimism in the   manufacturing sector     Let me mention the energy industry  It has eased further since our last meeting  The   District’s rig count is now down about 25 percent from the decreased level in July, as the steep fall   in natural gas prices since the winter has rendered some marginal wells unprofitable Spot prices   have turned back, as you know, and we’re at about the 350 MCF level, which is a level that at least   will sustain activity at about where it is now     In agriculture, prices have dropped in the cattle industry, as you know, partly because of a   drop-off in restaurant demand after the September 11th attacks but also because there is a large   inventory in the feed lines Crop prices also have been weak, although there’s reason for a little   more optimism there with storage levels not as high as they were a year ago  Overall, business   conditions in the District are generally poor   Turning to the national economy, I would agree with those who say we are in a recession    As for the outlook, while our forecast differs in some ways from the Greenbook, I would say that in   terms of the outcome it’s a matter of degree, not substance  In that context, though, I think it’s   important to look at two time frames  One is the immediate future--that is, the fourth quarter--which     11/6/01 46   will be negative and will remain negative as we move toward the first quarter of next year  The   other is the intermediate term--the first half of next year and into the second half--where the outlook   is more optimistic in both the Greenbook and, as others have said, in forecasts by private economists   as well That’s due importantly to a very stimulative monetary policy, fiscal policy that is   stimulative and should be more stimulative as we go forward, and to the fact that energy prices have   fallen significantly   In terms of policy, I think we need to be very careful, as we always are, but our task is   particularly difficult now In that context I’ll say just a couple things in summary  Regardless of the   funds rate, the fourth quarter will likely be negative and there’s nothing we can do about that today    With a significant amount of stimulus already in play, the economy should recover in the first or   second quarter of next year, and there’s probably not a whole lot we can do about the timing of that   recovery at this stage I would also point out that we tend to get very nervous when we have taken   actions and we’re not seeing a turnaround, and I think we need to be very careful and patient in such   periods So, I can’t help wonder if we shouldn’t pause, knowing the downside risks are very serious   as we look to the future, and watch events develop Thank you    Don, doesn’t arguing for a 50 basis point cut, on the grounds that the   economy may be worse than we thought likely, lead to arguing for an even larger cut because we   ought to do all we can now given the limited inflation risks from such an action?  You didn’t   mention making no change in the funds rate, but that would say that we reacted very strongly after   the crisis--which I agree is what we should have done--and are awaiting the effects of those actions,   which haven’t even come into play yet  But the rationale for a 50 basis point move is that we are so   fearful that we think we should make a large cut  It strikes me that that argues for an even greater   cut given the uncertainty and the lack of inflation risk from that    May I ask one other question?  With a 50 basis point move, in your   opinion are we going to affect the markets’ expectations going forward?  Will those expectations be   completely revised and instead of 75 basis points of ease on the horizon from where we are will they   talk about another 75 basis points from where we would be if we were to go with a larger cut?    Thank you    May I ask you a question?    I would appreciate your opinion on this  By going with a 50 basis point   change, are we likely to foster expectations, not just in financial markets but in the economy more   generally, that we will do at least another 25 basis points and will that induce people to hold back   because they anticipate further easing?              Mr Chairman, I will take your lead on this  But I also want to express a   differing view in the sense that while our economy obviously had a terrible shock, we have taken   very aggressive and I think appropriate action and monetary policy is now in an accommodative   position Some time has to pass before we will see an upturn, even with this accommodative   position, and I believe it will take place  I have confidence in the future  In my view the US   economy is quite different from Japan’s in terms of its soundness and its ability to recover from the   shock So I would be comfortable with no change or a 25 basis point change today  I think we are   raising expectations with this move of 50 basis points  People are going to be making decisions now     11/6/01 88   in the anticipation that there will be more ease to come and I think there is a risk to that as far as the   economy goes as well  I will certainly follow your lead on this  These are difficult times and I   realize it’s hard to know the right answer  But I think we could afford to be more patient and let the   flow of time work    Mr Chairman, economic activity in the Tenth District is likely to be lower   again in this quarter The manufacturing sector remains in a slump and labor markets are soft    However, the consumer sector shows signs of having turned a corner In our opinion, housing,   consumer spending, and auto sales are pointing up  We interpret these data as suggesting that   economic activity in the Tenth District may be at or near its bottom     12/11/01 34    More specifically, the Bank’s November manufacturing survey found that production was   lower than a year ago, capital spending continued to decline, and firms were not yet done paring   inventories On the positive side, though, the weakness is less than it was last month  The year-over-  year decline in production was not quite as great as in October and was significantly less than in July   when the manufacturing slump appeared to be at its steepest  In fact, some of the anecdotal reports   that we’ve received recently from a number of our directors suggest that they are seeing a pickup in   orders and actually are talking about hiring additional workers     Having said that, the labor markets have eased and are continuing to ease in the District  In   our latest labor market survey, only a quarter of the firms reported any difficulty hiring or retaining   workers, and that’s the lowest percentage in our survey’s history  However, while unemployment rose   in October, initial unemployment claims fell in November and layoff announcements in November   were the lowest we’ve seen this year   Consumer spending in the region has held up better than many people expected  Mall   traffic was healthy immediately after Thanksgiving, and sales during the first 10 days of the holiday   season were up modestly over a year ago in most places  And the anecdotal data we’ve gotten have   pointed predominantly toward fairly strong consumer sales  Residential construction and home sales   rebounded from the drop-off after the terrorist attacks  As in the case of retail sales, the lower end of   the market is doing noticeably better than the higher end  Home sales in Denver were not as far below   year-ago levels in November as they were in September or October, despite mounting job losses in   that city On the negative side, however, Realtors throughout the District say sales of high-end homes   remain very soft   Energy activity has fallen since our last meeting  Conditions in that sector have been a bit   diverse in the District, with Oklahoma showing a fairly noticeable decline in activity because of their     12/11/01 35    higher costs of extracting gas from their resources and Wyoming actually seeing a continued high   level of activity because of their lower costs  Price pressures in the District are in fact very minimal as   we see it   Turning to the national economy, Mr Chairman, my views have only strengthened since the   last meeting  I still believe it is helpful to split the outlook into two time frames, the very near term   and the intermediate term or second half of next year  Within these two time frames, I think growth   will decline in the current quarter, turn around probably late in the first or in the second quarter of next   year, and be more robust in the second half, which is very similar to the Greenbook outlook  For this   quarter and the first quarter of next year the economy, as I said, will remain weak  But my point is   that there’s not much we can do about that today  As for the intermediate term, growth in the second   half of next year appears likely to be relatively strong without requiring further action on our part    Like the Greenbook, I expect growth in the second half to be close to 4 percent  The factors   generating this growth have been noted elsewhere and I’ll just highlight them    Monetary policy, in my view, is accommodative and is contributing to strengthening   demand  Fiscal policy right now is stimulative and could become more so in the future  Energy costs   are declining, and the contribution from the change in inventories should begin to be positive in the   first or second quarter of next year  Certainly, there are risks to consumer and business confidence   that we have to be mindful of, and the weakness in foreign economic growth is also worthy of note    With our current policy stance, which is accommodative, the consensus forecast--both inside and   outside the Federal Reserve--seems to be for stronger growth in the second half of next year  Finally,   it seems to me that we should not take actions now on the basis of events or shocks that we cannot   anticipate or even assign probabilities to today  Thank you    Don, let me see if I can ask a question on interest rate volatility  I observed   that after we moved the last time, futures funds rates actually went up     Right    New information that brought it up, okay  But they are now higher   Secondly, assuming that we have an easy policy now and also assuming that if we have an easy policy,   it would be better to have less volatility in interest rates than more volatility, are we not risking, by   moving the funds rate down, increasing the volatility of interest rates?    Raise them more than you otherwise would    Mr Chairman, I really think we ought to stay where we are  A 2 percent   fed funds rate is stimulative  We’ve cut the rate 450 basis points this year, which is very aggressive   for us, and 150 basis points of that has been done since September 11th We are seeing some signs of   improvement and not all of the stimulus has come into play yet  While I recognize that inflation is not   an immediate issue, and I appreciate that, I still think we need to take a little longer-run view at this   time  So, I have to say I agree with Gary Stern’s comments    Given this discussion, I believe as Al does that things have changed here    But I think releasing the vote and identifying who dissents without context is counterproductive    I think it is harmful As you said, we have a consensus; we have someone who disagrees with it,   and the consensus carries  That consensus is really the message of the FOMC  And to have   “noise,” as someone characterized it, without any explanation is not better transparency  Perhaps   it does lead to more of a slippery slope, but I really don’t see how we can go this way without   releasing the minutes a lot sooner than we do now because that’s the only way we can get   dissents into the context of the whole discussion  That would be helpful, whereas just to disclose   the vote and indicate that we had a dissent but not say why is counterproductive in my opinion    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Our District economy in terms of the level of   activity is still relatively weak  But as others have said about their Districts, the signs are   growing that the situation is likely to improve, and there is a great deal more optimism among   manufacturers and businesses operating in the region  Turning to manufacturing for a minute,   the level of activity in that sector remains low  Our Bank’s latest manufacturing survey found   that production was down again in December after improving somewhat in November    Employment, new orders, and capital spending were again low in December relative to a year   ago   But importantly in my view, firms have become considerably more optimistic about the   future Many more of them are predicting a pickup in business and actually are seeing some   early signs of improvement in orders  So, looking forward, I think the situation is quite   encouraging In terms of our manufacturing survey, the six-months-ahead index for production   climbed fairly significantly  Granted, the rise was from a low level, but the index almost   doubled The new orders index more than doubled, and raw materials inventories as well as   finished goods inventories increased rather significantly according to the survey  So, there is a   fairly strong positive attitude about the future among manufacturers  Anecdotally speaking, I   talked with several manufacturers who seemed very pleased with the inquiries they’re getting   and the orders that are now being placed Moreover, they were saying almost uniformly that   their inventory levels and those of their customers are such that they are hiring or intending to   hire people again So there’s a great deal of positive news there, recognizing, though, that these   are improvements from a low level   As for consumer spending in our region, the story is very similar to what you’ve heard   from others  Retailers throughout our District were very pleased on balance with the holiday        January 29-30, 2002 Page 92 of 194  season They talked some about the extensive discounting, and they expressed concerns about   the pressure that has placed on their profits  Still, they are very positive about the volume of   sales Auto sales, like elsewhere, were very strong  There is some concern about used car sales   and about financing related to earlier leases A fairly large distributor in the Denver region told   us that each car coming back in on a lease has about a $5,000 write-down that someone has to   absorb So they are a little worried about the impact that will have   The energy sector has slowed Obviously, with prices coming down, the level of activity   has backed off considerably throughout the District, more so in the Oklahoma area than in the   Wyoming area, though activity in Wyoming is still down  Labor markets continue to be fairly   easy in terms of the ability to hire workers  It’s still rather easy to find new employees, and there   are no real signs of wage pressures that anyone is talking to me about  The farm economy is   legislation-dependent, so we’ll have to see how that develops  But overall, as I said, there are   signs of improvement    Looking at the national picture and comparing our outlook with that of the Board staff,   we’re generally in line with the Greenbook forecast  We see a little slower rebound as we get   into 2002, but activity picks up later, and for the year as a whole our forecast is about the same as   the Greenbook’s One thing I consider important is that, as others have pointed out, the balance   of risks is shifting The risks are becoming more balanced, though I’m not saying that they are   balanced at this point And I think it is a fact that we continue to have a very accommodative   monetary policy, which should be a positive factor for growth as we get further into 2002 and   beyond Thank you    Mr Chairman, I support your recommendation    Mr Chairman, if my memory serves me right, I think the last time we   talked about this I favored as a “least worst” choice going with the Ginnies before going with the   foreign sovereign debt But I have a lot of sympathy for what Al said regarding the downside of   the Ginnies Nevertheless, I still would go in that direction  The one thing that I am concerned   about relates to the type of problems that often arise by going ahead piecemeal on something    What I’d like to do is to hold off as long as possible and take a look at all the options again,   maybe at our meeting next January  We could have this as a special topic then and look at each   of these options together in context  By then perhaps the ACF will be further along and we can              March 19, 2002 Page 22 of 117  make some comparisons  I’d rather do that than say that the least worst option now is to go with   Ginnies and build in that direction only to find that they may not be the best choice in the long   run and then try to back out of using them Other than that, I agree that our work on   contingencies has to come first and that we can put this off until that is done, knowing what our   risks are and knowing what our least worst choice is after that    I see where this proposal comes from, and I understand it  I have a bit of   sympathy for what Cathy was saying in the sense that releasing the minutes earlier and delaying   the disclosure of the vote until those minutes are released made a lot of sense to me  That’s   because I still believe that putting the dissents in context helps  I know your committee   discussed that option; I read the memo  I don’t know how the lawyers would interpret it if we   got into an argument, but I think a case can be made for delaying the release of the vote until the   minutes are available  And the delay we’ve talked about is only two weeks, which is not an   unreasonable period But having said that, I think we are in a bind as far as releasing the vote at     March 19, 2002 Page 103 of 117  some point  So if we don’t want to release the minutes sooner, I don’t think we have any choice   but to release the vote after the meeting    President Moskow asked my questions  Thank you    Thank you, Mr Chairman  In looking at economic activity in the Tenth   District, we have to separate out Colorado a bit from the rest of the region  Excluding Colorado,   we are seeing fairly good signs of a turnaround  Layoff announcements have subsided,   consumers continue to spend, and housing activity is solid  Moreover, business confidence   appears to be inching back up in most of the District  Colorado continues to contract because of   some real weakness in the telecom sector, which continues to be plagued by excess capacity and   some rather tough price competition   Let me talk a little about the manufacturing sector  It is improving and, based on our   surveys, there are signs of greater optimism about the future  The Bank’s latest manufacturing   survey found that production and shipments strengthened a bit in February  In addition,   optimism about future production and orders continued to build  For the first time in many   months, firms in the manufacturing sector expect to be hiring workers in the near future rather   than laying them off  For now, capital spending remains below year-ago levels, but I’m hearing   a lot of conversations about how manufacturers are looking at taking advantage of the new tax     March 19, 2002 Page 57 of 117  law It is extremely interesting to them in terms of how they look at their capital investment   plans and the timing of any future investment  So it is on their minds at this point     Commercial real estate in the District remains weak  Vacancies are high in most of our   markets, putting some downward pressure on rents  Denver is clearly the hardest hit, with   realtors saying that there may be at least a two-year inventory in that city, so they are a bit   pessimistic right now  Consumer spending and housing activity are generally solid in the region    Apart from a few high-end stores, retailers say their sales have been improving and are   somewhat above year-ago levels  And home sales have also strengthened  Starter homes are   doing very well, and even the high-end area is starting to see some activity  Energy activity has   stabilized after declining through the second half of last year  The District’s rig count is the   lowest in two years, and coal prices have come down fairly sharply, making it hard even for low-  cost producers in Wyoming to be making a profit right now  Labor markets are slack, although   there are signs suggesting that employment is stabilizing  We continue to experience a shortage   of nurses in our region and a limited availability of workers in a few skilled areas, but employers   are still able to find help without very much difficulty  At our Okalahoma City board meeting, a   director who has a nationwide temporary help agency said that activity at the firm had picked up   significantly across the country So there are some signs of a pickup in demand for temporary   help Price pressures without question remain low across the region  And the ag sector is   waiting for the farm bill   Let me turn to the national economic outlook  Our assessment is really quite similar to   the Greenbook’s, namely that growth should be above trend beginning this quarter and continue   through next year The economic factors generating this forecast are clear, and I’ll only mention   them  First, monetary policy is clearly stimulative, with the real fed funds rate in the     March 19, 2002 Page 58 of 117  neighborhood of zero Fiscal policy has been stimulative and has become even more so recently    Energy prices remain relatively low, although we are seeing some increases in that area  And the   inventory adjustment is contributing to growth   Having cited these facts, I have a couple of observations—or maybe I should call them   concerns First, I think the likelihood that the rate of output growth will be greater than trend this   year is high and increasing; if I were to put a number on it, I’d say the probability is above   50 percent  While the output gap is positive, the probability that the gap will close sooner rather   than later is increasing, not decreasing  My second point is that the current fed funds rate, as   others have said, is clearly below equilibrium, and I would say perhaps significantly below   equilibrium  At its current level, it is generating substantial amounts of liquidity and, therefore,   setting up conditions that I think will give rise to future economic imbalances  Moreover, taking   into account Dave’s lesson number 4, it is creating conditions that could generate higher   inflation, say, twelve to eighteen months from now, based on the length and variability in the   lags So, in my view these are some of the factors we should talk about in the policy round  I   would offer one other thought I think moving sooner, maybe even today, may mean that we will   have to move less later  And I believe that would be very favorable in the long term for the US   economy  Thank you    Mr Chairman, I certainly see a need to proceed as you’ve outlined   today, and I would support that I would add, though, that I think we could continue to see some   fairly strong data and perhaps some data surprises on the upside, given what we’ve experienced   recently  So I believe that having the accommodative language in the statement is very   important  And in my view the possibility of an intermeeting move of 25 basis points should be   a possibility that is out there  If the market understanding is that we’re not planning to do   50 basis points but that we may be moving sooner than at the May meeting, I think that could be   very healthy for us I hope the press statement doesn’t foreclose that possibility    Thank you, Mr Chairman  The Tenth District economy is showing clear   signs of improvement, although the recovery still is a bit sluggish in Colorado  I would also say   that the manufacturing sector is showing clear signs of a turnaround  Our latest manufacturing   survey found that production and shipments strengthened in April, moving closer to year-ago   levels Also, for the second month in a row, optimism about future activity was close to survey   highs Reflecting this increased optimism, more firms are expecting to increase employment and   capital spending in coming months, although the capital spending is further out in time in the   opinion of many respondents  Most of these signs of a turnaround come from durable goods   manufacturers who, after having suffered a very steep decline, appear to be enjoying a stronger   recovery than other firms    Retail spending and housing activity have been holding up fairly well in our region    Retailers are cautiously optimistic about future sales as well  And homebuilding is higher than a   year ago except in Colorado But even there, home sales in Denver firmed a bit in April, and   realtors continue to report strong demand for entry-level priced homes  Commercial real estate,         May 7, 2002 49 of 81  on the other hand, remains in a slump, with very few signs of an imminent turnaround in that   sector Office vacancies continue to climb, and they climbed rather rapidly in the first quarter,   although we are hearing scattered reports of a pickup in leasing activity especially for smaller   businesses Public construction has helped make up for the slowdown in commercial   construction for much of the region  Energy activity also remains relatively sluggish in our area    Although oil prices have risen, our oil industry folks seem to be holding back and are more   concerned about reducing debt than expanding  The labor markets are generally slack, but they   appear to be stabilizing And as I reported last time, temporary employment is showing a steady   increase, as reported by one of our directors who has a national firm in that business  He feels   there is a very clear and strong upward trend in such employment Price pressures in the region   are subdued There is talk, though, in the manufacturing sector about trying to increase prices to   get profits moving But, of course, those manufacturers also say that right now they don’t have   the pricing power to do that  The farm economy is wholly dependent upon the recent farm bill,   which I don’t need to talk about here   Turning to the national economy, recent data releases continue to point to a recovery, as   we’ve described here The recovery probably will be modest by historical standards just as the   recession was modest by historical standards  I continue to expect the economy to grow at about   3½ to 4 percent for the year as a whole  As I think about it, one thing that is helpful, at least to   me, is to break economic developments down into their structural and cyclical components    Structurally, the US economy remains strong  With remarkable strength in productivity during   this recession, we can be more confident in an assessment of faster long-term productivity   growth, which was talked about earlier We have seen once again the remarkable resilience and   flexibility of the US economy from last autumn into the spring  Finally, our long-term                  May 7, 2002 50 of 81  commitment to low and stable inflation has served us well in terms of pushing up the potential of   the economy  Cyclically, it appears that the US economy is in fact recovering  The slower­  than-normal recovery, as I said, I think reflects a relatively mild recession  I would submit that a   slower-than-normal recovery is not necessarily a surprise, given that the slowdown was also   mild  The factors behind the recovery are, of course, that monetary policy remained stimulative   and fiscal policy was stimulative, especially with recently enacted programs  Moreover, the   continuing inventory adjustment should at least contribute somewhat to growth as we move   forward, although perhaps not as much as we’ve seen recently  Of course, I do understand the   risks I would in fact suggest that they are about balanced  The continued pessimism of CEOs is   a downside risk, and it does raise questions about capital spending going forward, which is a   concern to me  But there are also upside risks—in particular, stronger foreign growth, stronger   productivity, and our resilient US economy   Turning to the inflation outlook for the immediate future, I think the most likely outcome   is for stable or even slightly lower core inflation this year  Most measures of core inflation are   stable or down The median CPI is the one exception, and that is up fairly noticeably    Nonetheless, I do want to say a couple of things relative to the risks on this side  With policy   where it is today, I think we do have some risks of inflation and also some financial excess,   which in my view we need to keep in mind  Let me give you my three reasons for saying this    First, monetary policy is currently quite stimulative  No matter how one measures it, the real fed   funds rate is near zero or at zero  Second, monetary policy is likely to remain accommodative   for an extended period If we decide today to leave the fed funds rate at its current level, the real   fed funds rate will remain near zero or at zero for another seven weeks  If rates follow the path   suggested by futures markets, the real fed funds rate will likely remain below its equilibrium            May 7, 2002 51 of 81  level for the rest of this year and perhaps through early next year  And using the Greenbook’s   forecast, including its assumption of maintaining the funds rate at 1¾ percent through the third   quarter before gradually raising it, the real funds rate is likely to remain below equilibrium for at   least another year  Thus, according to the Greenbook, policy will still be accommodative in the   middle of next year, even though real GDP will have risen for seven quarters and the   unemployment rate will have fallen for perhaps three quarters, if those projections are correct    Third, while a funds rate below its equilibrium level is appropriate when the economy is in   recession, we must consider the risk of maintaining such an accommodative policy during the   economic recovery  With such a small output gap and a low real fed funds rate, we should not   dismiss the risk of higher inflation longer term as we get into next year  Thanks     I understand your recommendation, and I go along with it    Karen, I have a question on the dollar and capital flows  You broke out   the reduction in capital flows between equities and other US securities  Is there any insight that   you can share with us on that? Why the larger drop-off in bonds, other than perhaps inflation   fears?  Why, with a declining dollar, do we see capital flows slowing and bond issuance falling?    Fair enough    Thank you, Mr Chairman  The Tenth District’s economy has continued   to show signs of improvement over the past several weeks since our last meeting, although some   sectors obviously remain weak and businesses are still acting in a cautious manner Prospects for   District manufacturers actually have improved further though, with new orders rising above   year-ago levels for the first time since the end of 2000  Retail sales excluding autos remain   solid, with strong sales at both high-end stores and large discounters making up for somewhat   slow sales in other stores Home sales have continued strong in most of the District, and energy   activity has picked up rather noticeably in our region lately   Of course, not all signs are positive Layoff announcements were up in May and appear   to be up in June Auto sales weakened somewhat, and commercial real estate remains in a slump   in our area Also, while optimistic about future sales, District manufacturers appear reluctant to   hire enough new workers to meet the anticipated increase in demand  They are relying   extensively on temporary help, preferring to wait for further evidence of recovery before they   engage in significant workforce expansion Finally, several large District firms in the telecom,   agriculture, and energy trading businesses have experienced further deterioration in their   financial condition and credit ratings since our last meeting   On the inflation front, wage and price pressures remain mostly subdued, although   obviously we have seen higher steel prices and that has had some effect on a number of our   metal manufacturing companies   Turning to the national outlook, obviously recent economic releases have been mixed    Nevertheless, I do expect growth to be about 3½ percent this year and to rise to something over 4   percent next year The Board staff’s outlook is similar to my own second-quarter growth at   about 2 percent and second-half growth at about 3½ percent  I think the forces behind the     June 25-26, 2002 82 of 179  recovery are clear and have not changed all that much since our last meeting  That is,   productivity appears to remain basically sound, monetary policy—with the real fed funds rate   near zero—is stimulative, fiscal policy is stimulative, and the inventory adjustment is continuing    These factors are working to strengthen the economy and offset the downside risks to the   economy  Still, the downside risks are significant, and I acknowledge them  One is the   accounting scandal, which monetary policy really can’t do much about; another is the   geopolitical risk, which again we can’t do a lot about  But those risks are real, and they are   affecting psychology There is also a downside risk in capital spending, which has not picked up   as much as we perhaps would like to see  And that is still a risk in the future   Let me just say in acknowledging these risks that I still feel that policy remains extremely   accommodative  And I think we need to take a longer-term view of this  Every measure that the   staff has presented—every measure we have—suggests that the real federal funds rate is below   the natural rate by a significant margin  Let me clarify my policy position  I have not in the past   and I am not suggesting now that policy should be tight in any sense  The conditions aren’t at all   right for that I am suggesting only, and I think importantly, that we prepare to move to a less   accommodative position  I would say that for purposes of long-run price stability we are overly   accommodative, and we should begin to consider a longer-term strategy to move ourselves   toward—not to, but toward—a more neutral position And as others have indicated, we have an   opportunity after this meeting through your upcoming congressional testimony, Mr Chairman, to   begin to inform the markets of this need and to develop a strategy so that we don’t catch them off   guard as we necessarily move toward a more neutral policy    I support your recommendation  I do want to make one comment  I   agree with you that we have a lot of credibility in the market But I think a good part of that   credibility has been achieved because we have been open with the market  And what you’re   saying today is that we would have a balanced risk statement but we’re not quite sure the risks   are as balanced as the statement is going to say        June 25-26, 2002 127 of 179   My concern is, given where we are, that we’re sending the message that   the economy is going to grow and yet we’re holding the funds rate down at a very low level  I   think that deserves some explanation  That’s my point going forward    Mr Chairman, the Tenth District economy for the most part has   followed the national economy  After rebounding in the first half of the year, it has slowed   appreciably Layoff announcements rose noticeably in July and early August  Let me talk about   the manufacturing sector in our District, which appears for the most part to have improved since   last fall and winter But it also, in a sense, has topped off  Our July survey shows about the   same level of manufacturing activity as in June and, while firms are still optimistic about the         August 13, 2002 26 of 92  future, they also indicate that they’re cautiously optimistic  And that’s a bit of a change since the   spring Labor markets remain slack, with firms having no difficulty filling almost any position at   this point Retail spending and housing activity continue to hold up well  Retailers are generally   optimistic about future sales and are showing some willingness to build inventories  Auto sales,   as in the rest of the country, have responded to the financing incentives  And home sales and   construction remain solid on the retail side though, of course, office space is pretty much dead    Energy activity in the District actually remained strong, with the rig count holding on to earlier   gains However, there are some issues in Wyoming because energy firms have produced a lot of   natural gas but have no way of getting it out of the area  So that’s causing some pressures there    Price pressures remained subdued across the District  District manufacturers expect further   increases in materials costs, but they have no intimation that they can pass them on at this time     I want to talk briefly about the drought I know there is a drought generally in this   country, but it has been particularly severe in our part of the country  If you draw a line north-  south through the middle of Kansas and Nebraska, the area surrounding that line has been   enormously dry  In some parts of Kansas the residents consider themselves lucky to have had   almost three inches of rain since January 1 of this year  It shows in the soil I recently drove   through a good part of these areas in the District, and the picture is quite dramatic  Reservoirs in   Colorado are at anywhere between 20 and 60 percent of capacity in terms of their water levels    Dillon Lake, which some of you may know because the Interstate and the Eisenhower Tunnel are   near there, is reported to be between 50 percent and 60 percent of capacity  It looks like a wheat   bed in much of that extremely dry area  I talked with some of the agricultural people in   Colorado about the cattle situation Hay production, which is very important to them, is   somewhere in the range of 15 to 20 percent of normal  That puts them in a dilemma because            August 13, 2002 27 of 92  they need a lot of snow this winter and, if it materializes, then they can’t afford to feed the   livestock That’s why we have the liquidation of cattle inventory going on  In fact, cattle   auctions in some areas are being held seven days a week and there is no market  So the situation   is particularly dire there  As for land sales in the ranch area, as one major real estate dealer said   to me, the market is virtually dead  In sum, the drought is very severe  It’s as bad as in the   1950s and actually as bad as it was in the 1930s in much of this region  One likely impact of this   may be on fiscal policy, because as I understand it there is a fairly strong effort under way to   enact some type of bailout or support for stockmen in the western part of the United States    We’ll watch and see how that goes   Turning to the national economy, I’ll be relatively brief  We have no major   disagreements with the Greenbook  We also have revised down our forecast to below 3 percent,   for the reasons that others have delineated here  One point I do want to note, though, is that in   talking with contacts at major companies that are not investment grade but one level below that, I   am being told that credit standards have become tighter  One man in particular said that his   firm’s financial numbers—and they’re standing by their numbers—show pretty good   improvement in the past year  But even with that, when they’ve gone to their bank lenders to   discuss rolling over debt, they have been asked to show improved ratios before the banks will   renew those lines So in that sense credit standards have tightened quite noticeably     As for the outlook, I think growth will be slower but still positive  The reason for that is   the stimulus that continues to exist in this economy  We will watch that carefully, obviously    But we do look for somewhat less than 3 percent growth this year and into 2003  Thank you    I support your recommendation on leaving the rate unchanged  I, too,   have a slight preference for maintaining the balance of risk statement as it is  However, I   acknowledge that the risks have shifted Nevertheless, I still think, as we look at our projections         August 13, 2002 84 of 92  and the stance of both monetary and fiscal policy, that a lot of  stimulus remains and that will   carry the economy forward  But like others, I wouldn’t fall on the sword on this issue because of   all the uncertainties in the economy  On balance, though, I’d wait to see a little more evidence   before changing that balance of risks statement because it is going to change expectations about   future rate moves—although I agree that some good numbers would change expectations once   again for everyone I’d just make that comment         Thank you, Mr Chairman  The Tenth District has remained pretty much   in a holding pattern since our last meeting  It has maintained earlier gains but has shown no   further improvement since early in the summer Manufacturing activity was flat for the second   month in a row in August, after improving most of the year until then  In our Bank’s August   manufacturing survey, production and new orders both remained slightly below year-ago levels,   and firms are still cautiously optimistic about the outlook for six months from now  But that   optimism is not translating into any increased hiring or new capital spending  Firms are holding   back     September 24, 2002 59 of 115  Our District’s labor market remains generally slack, with firms having little difficulty   finding well-qualified workers  Fortunately, the announcements of job cuts have slowed in   August and so far in September  Consumer spending remains generally solid, though not quite   as strong as earlier in the summer  Retail sales were unchanged or down only slightly in most of   our areas Tourism in Colorado has fallen off but remains fairly good in the rest of our region   where it is important for income  Residential construction remains strong throughout the   District Home sales have also been solid, although inventories of unsold homes in the Denver   area have risen and that has been a subject of some press articles recently  Energy activity in the   District has edged down lately but still is fairly good  And price pressures, as you’ve heard is the   case elsewhere, remain quite muted in our region    Our farm economy is now in recession, due I think importantly to the widespread drought   that we’re experiencing and that I talked about briefly last time  Crop prices have rallied as   crops have withered, but farm income will drop sharply this year  Higher crop prices have not   offset reduced volume from crop losses in many areas of our region  In livestock, which is our   primary agricultural income source, the producers are booking rather sizable losses  Now, the   higher crop prices may mean reductions in government payments, but as you probably all are   aware, there is now talk about a supplemental aid package for that industry   Let me talk briefly about the national economy  The economic news, as has been pointed   out by others, is mixed  Consumer and business spending have been fairly robust, while   manufacturing output and employment have been generally weak In addition to weighing the   recent economic reports in this uncertain environment, I understand that part of our job is to   judge how the current opposing forces on the economy will eventually play out and to decide   what we should do about it Currently tending to push the economy forward, as others have        September 24, 2002 60 of 115  mentioned, is the stance of monetary and fiscal policy   Low interest rates, especially for   housing and autos, have led consumers to continue buying  Several factors, though, are holding   the economy back  Business spending remains sluggish due to the overhang of the surge in   investment that occurred in the late 1990s, as David pointed out  And for some sectors,   investment spending is going to remain sluggish for quite some time       Another factor that is keeping growth sluggish—and it’s an important one from the   comments I’ve heard here—involves, as President Santomero said, the headwinds of uncertainty    We don’t know if or when an attack on Iraq might come  We have no better idea about the   likelihood, the magnitude, or the nature of a future terrorist attack  We are feeling perhaps a   little better about the corporate scandals, but we don’t know where that stands  And in the face   of this Knightian uncertainty, the natural business response has been and is to hunker down, to   wait and see what develops, and to hold off on any major spending until we know more    Business individual after business individual has told me that story   That said, it’s interesting that in both the Greenbook and our own Bank’s projections we   still are anticipating GDP growth of 3 percent this quarter, 3½ percent next year, and 4 percent   into 2004 That is pretty much what we expected last time  I can’t help but wonder what the   outlook would be if this heavy hand of uncertainty were lifted  Of course, I recognize that we’re   unable to predict these other potential events, and we have to be prepared to act if they continue   to hold us down as they are now    I support both parts of your recommendation, Mr Chairman  As I said   earlier, it would be nice to see how this economy would be performing if we could lift this   heavy-handed uncertainty, but at the moment that is not an option  I think that does put us in the   position of having to watch the situation carefully  And if the economy doesn’t improve or if we   have a disruptive event, then we have to be prepared to move, whether in the intermeeting period   or at the next meeting    Mr Chairman, I think you should be prepared and willing to take   questions I think it serves a useful purpose of providing information  Obviously someone could   take what you say the wrong way, but that’s going to happen regardless  I think you’ll do more   good than harm    Mr Chairman, I’m on board with the Ginnie Maes  I think it makes   sense I said that when we met in early 2001  I’m interested in a little more study on the ACF   issue Looking at the federal debt projections, the need for that kind of facility has been pushed   off, so I certainly recognize that we’re not in a rush  But I think it also is something we ought to   give more thought to and establish a time frame for further study  Maybe, as Bob Parry said,   twelve months or so is appropriate  In any event, it would be very helpful in my view to work   out some of the details should we come to a point where we want to look at the ACF alternative   more seriously   You asked about the foreign sovereign debt issue, and I don’t know that anyone has   commented on it I thought the inclination last time was not to go in that direction, partly for   political reasons and especially if Ginnie Maes proved workable or if we decided to keep the   ACF as an alternative So I would put the foreign sovereign debt contingency on hold as well   And I would like to add my kudos to the quality of the paper on the ACF  It was really   great In terms of addressing the technical questions that are outlined in that memo, which I   recognize are important, the staff wouldn’t necessarily have to come back to the Committee for   discussion But if you want our comments, we could send them to you     This follows up on Bill’s comment from a little different direction  In   light of the animal spirits discussion, the alternative scenario in the Greenbook labeled “lower   funds rate” seems to produce a fairly optimistic outcome  I don’t know if you adjusted your   model or just allowed it to run in that instance to get the reduction in unemployment and the   pickup in growth My concern is, given the overhangs in capital and the capacity issues, whether   that is really a very reasonable outcome to project  In the context of a weaker scenario, perhaps   we would find less of an effect from that action    Or not operating as strongly through them    Mr Chairman, the Tenth District economy has shown signs of slowing   since the last meeting  But most of our business contacts still remain relatively optimistic about   the future Job growth has been slow, and layoff announcements have picked up, after subsiding   through late summer Reflecting the weak labor market and the general climate of uncertainty,   consumers are spending less freely than they were earlier  Also new commercial construction   has halted, as has the recovery in manufacturing in our region  On a brighter note, housing   activity continues to hold up despite increasing concerns that the boost to demand from low   mortgage rates is nearing its end There’s no real sign of that yet           November 6, 2002 53 of 122  Let me speak just a little more about manufacturing  It has been flat, as I said, for four   consecutive months following a strong rebound earlier in the year  In the Bank’s October   manufacturing survey, production and new orders moved slightly above year-ago levels but that,   of course, reflected the depressed levels last year stemming from the effects of September 11    Still, firms are moderately optimistic about activity six months from now, and they continue to   project improvements     The District’s labor market does remain slack, and job growth slowed in most states   during the third quarter And layoff announcements increased somewhat noticeably in October   after declining a bit in both August and September     Let me talk a minute about consumer spending, which has eased somewhat  Retail sales   have edged down from earlier in the summer, as uncertainty and slowing job growth have taken   their toll Auto sales also have slowed since August, as some of the manufacturers have backed   away from zero percent financing only to reinstate it subsequently  I think the way one of our   major auto dealers described the interest rate environment for the auto industry is very   interesting He viewed the environment before September 11, as we eased rates, as comparable   to how he might imagine smoking marijuana, whereas now it seems as if those in the industry are   mainlining the drug  His point is that they can’t get away from the zero rate financing and are   even expanding on it I think that’s important to take note of     Looking at wage and price pressures, they remain largely subdued in the region  In an   informal survey we conducted just a week ago, firms said that wages likely will increase about   the same in 2003 as in 2002  And as others have noted, health insurance costs will go up much   more; it is one of the areas that employers are concerned about                    November 6, 2002 54 of 122  Briefly, the farm economy continues to be rather mixed  The weather conditions have   changed again, with rain delaying some harvesting  But I want to mention that the drought   conditions and the plunge in livestock cash receipts are expected to drive farm incomes down   significantly in our region as we look to 2003   Turning to the national economy, obviously recent data show the news to be mixed, as   others have pointed out Growth in this quarter is likely to be low, though I would suspect not   quite as low as in the Greenbook forecast  But I wouldn’t quibble over the difference  Looking   to the future, like the Greenbook I expect growth to pick up, returning to trend levels in the   second half of next year and to above-trend levels in 2004  I think it’s important to recognize   that this outlook obviously reflects the stimulative effects of fiscal and monetary policy currently   in place But I realize that we are facing some important and strong countervailing forces    Vacancy rates, capital overhang, and excess capacity in the high-tech industry have damped   investment spending as we’ve noted  This is a situation that monetary policy probably will not   be able to quickly or easily offset Perhaps more important are the forces of uncertainty  There   is the risk of a war with Iraq; its timing, duration, and so forth are an uncertainty  Terrorism is   an uncertainty And the uncertainty of just how the economy is performing in this kind of   environment has its own effect  This leads me to understand why there is discussion of further   interest rate cuts But, not unlike Al Broaddus, I would sound a cautionary note  I think further   cuts will in fact stimulate consumer and business spending, as Dave Stockton said, but perhaps   more marginally than the normal statistical models would suggest because of the issue of   uncertainty   It’s important also to realize that the positive effects on consumer spending will come   primarily as a result of consumers taking on added debt  Maybe it won’t be substantial in terms               November 6, 2002 55 of 122  of the imbalances that we talked about  But I believe it is important in the sense of increasing   their fragility for the future So I think part of our discussion on policy should address the issues   of long-term against short-term tradeoffs, given the high degree of uncertainty and related to that   the uncertainty of how our policy might affect outcomes going forward  Thank you    Mr Chairman, given the uncertainty in the economy, which you   described in your remarks, I would accept and in fact would support a move of 50 basis points if   we are going to move at all  And since we are dealing with the issue of uncertainty, I think   having a balanced risk statement is a prudent way to do it  So I support you in your   recommendation    Mr Chairman, the Tenth District economy has shown some signs of   improvement since our last meeting, but I would say that the improvement is still very, very   modest, and I wouldn’t wish to overemphasize it  Manufacturing activity has firmed somewhat   over the last couple of months, and optimism in our surveys of manufacturers about the future   has increased as well And we are seeing some very modest signs that capital spending is   increasing   In our survey, the year-over-year index for production rose from minus 13 in September   to plus 3 in November  It’s the first time the index has been positive since October 2000, which   is good news as far as we’re concerned  In the survey we recently conducted, it is interesting   that, while about 40 percent of those we survey still are thinking about decreases in spending,   that’s actually less than last time  So in that sense it’s a positive note   Consumer spending actually has picked up after easing earlier in the fall  Both discount   stores and department stores reported that their sales increased in the first part of November and   that business was also better over the Thanksgiving weekend  But talking with retailers is to me   a bit like talking to ranchers in the sense that, while they said the situation was better, they’re still   very, very negative about the holiday season  The pessimism is due in part to the shortness of   the Thanksgiving to Christmas selling period  We’ll have to see how that turns out   Housing activity in our region also continues to hold up remarkably well  New starts and   resales are both fairly strong  Commercial real estate, on the other hand, is depressed—   particularly so in the Denver area  Vacancy rates are high, and there’s also leased space that         December 10, 2002 52 of 87  people would very much like to get rid of  Labor markets remain slack, and there are virtually   no wage pressures in our region Energy activity has edged up slightly in the October-November   time frame  And our farm economy is mixed, with ranching very depressed and other areas   doing well, based on the subsidies they’re receiving       Turning to the national economy, I would say that the picture is very similar to what we   are seeing in the region; the data are mixed  But a slight improvement seems to have occurred,   as others have noted, and I do agree with the Greenbook forecast  The downside risks are   obvious There’s uncertainty about whether consumer spending will hold up, especially given   the drop-off in auto sales, and about whether business fixed investment will continue to   strengthen, which is so important for the incipient recovery  And, of course, how well foreign   economies do also will influence the outcome   On the positive side, as has been noted, monetary policy is stimulative and has become   more so Fiscal policy is stimulative, and the likelihood that it will become more stimulative is   higher than it was a couple of months ago  And financial market conditions have improved since   our last meeting  So I think we are in a position where we can be a bit more optimistic, but we   really have to wait and see    Mr Chairman, I thought your comments were brilliant today, and I   support you [Laughter]     Mr Chairman, it’s late and some of my intended comments would repeat   what others have said, so I’ll be fairly brief  One point I would note is along the lines of Vice   Chairman McDonough’s comment on modeling human behavior  We have two models here,   and most of us probably can agree with some dimension of each model depending on the   circumstances  As I look at the models and at the circumstances, I find that my thoughts go to   the Chairman’s earlier point and Don Kohn’s  When we are confident enough about what we   should do, we act more boldly  When we are less confident, we act either more cautiously   because we don’t know or we take that one step too many because we don’t know  What these   models are trying to do is to pick up that behavior  Since that involves the human behavior of a   small group, we’re going to get some rather contradictory and conflicting outcomes  That’s   exactly what we’ve got here, I think, and it has been interesting  I’m not interested in signing up   for the psychological test, though!  [Laughter]       Thank you  Circling back from those lofty questions, I have a relatively   mundane one on the risks to your forecast and the outlook  It has to do with the consumer, who   has been very important to our economy’s ability to maintain itself through this difficult time  If   one looks on chart 3 at what I’ll call the debt burden ratio of consumer payments, it is nearly at a   record high—with interest rates at a record low  Looking ahead, if in fact our economy begins to   pick up, the expectation is for interest rates to increase, and there will be a migration into a   heavier debt burden—depending on other circumstances, of course, including income growth   and so forth  Since the consumer’s role has been so important and since it will be a factor going   forward, how do you assess the downside risks there, given that debt burden, which as you noted   in your opening remarks people are concerned about?     Thank you       Mr Chairman, my comments are going to sound fairly familiar  The   situation hasn’t changed much since the last time we met  The District economy has been and   continues to be sluggish  There aren’t a lot of signs of improvement since our last meeting    Manufacturing activity, from what we’ve observed in the region, actually weakened somewhat in   December, disappointing us given the growth that we had seen in October and November    Production and new orders both moved back below year-ago levels after firming in October    Consumer spending has been sluggish since the last meeting, and in most areas holiday retail   sales were flat compared with a year ago despite some heavy discounting  I had a conversation   January 28-29, 2003 109 of 195    with an owner of major shopping malls in the Midwest—in Kansas City, Denver, and   elsewhere—and I found his comments about the post-Christmas season interesting  He said that   he thought sales were pretty robust in the first week of January  But since then, in the last two   weeks, they’ve dropped off dramatically  Retail activity is just dead, and he hasn’t been able to   figure out why  It is a concern because that pattern is not unique to one city  It has occurred   throughout the Midwest, though Denver in particular has been very hard-hit in terms of a   slowdown   Our commercial real estate sector is depressed, with a number of vacancies as well as a   lot of space that is being leased but not used  We have some real issues there  Housing activity,   as elsewhere, continues to be the bright spot in the District except in Colorado, where a   slowdown has developed even though prices haven’t adjusted yet to that slowdown  I don’t   know whether that’s coming, but I suspect it is  Energy activity in the District actually has been   flat despite the oil price increases, and that’s because no one knows exactly where that price is   going to go  Many feel it could easily plummet, and if it does, no one wants to be in the position   of having made that kind of capital investment  So activity in that sector has remained relatively   slow  Wage and price pressures are largely subdued; there’s nothing unique on that front   On the national scene, I really can’t quibble with the Greenbook, given the levels of   uncertainty  As we’ve noted, the fact is that monetary policy is stimulative, and fiscal policy is   likely to be  Another positive is that financial market conditions, given the economic situation   we are witnessing, are relatively strong compared with what they’ve been in the past  So the   markets are in a position to foster strengthening economic activity  I, too, see the issue as the   fact that the risks on both the upside and downside are bound to be so much larger than usual    We could have a very good takeoff or a real slowdown  That is the situation we’re faced with    January 28-29, 2003 110 of 195    Whether the outcome is to the upside or the downside, I think perhaps the new phrase for policy   that may come from all of this is “prudently bold”  But for the time being we’re looking at   possibilities on both sides, and I think we’re in a position to wait and see  Thank you     Yes, I support your recommendation     Dave, let me ask a question about the structural labor productivity chart    In your forecast, the contribution from capital deepening stays relatively low going forward, and   yet the multifactor productivity numbers remain fairly strong  You also talked about the slump   in investment spending  What is your thinking on the multifactor aspects of productivity and   why it will stay so strong as we go forward?     The only reason I was asking is that, with a holding back in investment   and therefore limited gains from new technology, I wondered whether we can continue to harvest   that  I don’t disagree with you because it’s hard to explain otherwise       Thank you     Mr Chairman, economic activity in the Tenth District, as in other   regions, remains basically sluggish, though we have had a few signs of improvement on mixed   data since the last meeting  Retail sales have increased only slightly from the disappointing   holiday season, and commercial real estate is still mired in a very deep slump in our area  On the   positive side, though, manufacturing activity actually has strengthened a little since the last   meeting, and energy activity has picked up noticeably  Housing continues to provide support to   District activity, with solid sales of low-end homes making up for some slump in the high-end   part of that market  On the inflation front, wage and price pressures obviously remain pretty well   subdued   In speaking with our directors and with a lot of business people throughout our District, I   consistently hear that businesses are reluctant to commit to new spending and hiring until the   uncertainty of the current situation with Iraq is resolved  This wait-and-see attitude also   describes consumer sentiment more and more as it relates to new spending  However, not to   overstate this uncertainty factor, I would also note that in Colorado, for example, attitudes are   distinctively pessimistic and very much unrelated to the war  Many people in that state see very   strong parallels between now and the slump that they went through in the 1980s, with a lot of   excess capacity and a lot of pessimism in play     Let me talk a little more about manufacturing activity because it actually showed some   improvement on balance in February  Production and shipments rose above year-ago levels, and   new orders registered a fairly large increase—in fact one of the largest since early 2000  Firms   continue to express optimism about production and sales over the next six months once we get   through some of this immediate geopolitical uncertainty  However, employment and capital   March 18, 2003 29 of 101    spending has remained well below year-ago levels, and firms are keeping their inventories low in   case the higher sales they expect do not materialize  In our survey about attitudes among   manufacturers, it is a fact that as they look forward they are more optimistic, as they feel they   can get through this immediate crisis  So I think there is that element  But, again, I go back to   Colorado as evidence that other factors are operating as well   Let me talk very quickly about the farm economy, which is actually expected to   strengthen in 2003  Farm income in terms of cash receipts is expected to improve, and farmers   also are going to continue to receive government payments  Commodity prices could fluctuate,   though, because we continue to have a fairly severe drought in the central and western plains of   our region, which is bringing a lot of its own uncertainty in the agricultural production sector   Let me turn to the national scene  The broad contours of our economic outlook have   changed little since the last meeting  We still expect near-term weakness and medium-term   strength  Like the Greenbook, we expect growth to be about 2½ percent in the first half and then   to increase to 4 percent as we move forward, recognizing that the error bands around that kind of   forecast are fairly large  But the reason is—and I don’t think we should lose sight of it—that   monetary policy is still stimulative, fiscal policy is stimulative and could become more so, and   we have financial market conditions and a banking industry that are generally able to be   supportive of an expansion     The factors behind the near-term weakness remain the same as at our last meeting  Oil   prices and geopolitical risks have fostered near-term restraint  As these risks and uncertainties   are lifted—perhaps in the next couple of weeks or months but maybe even in the next few   days—I think we’ll be able to assess how these elements of monetary policy and fiscal policy   might play out in the real economy  At least by waiting a little longer we should also be   March 18, 2003 30 of 101    allowing more light in the room to see by as we think about policy  So my suggestion would be   in line with the Vice Chairman’s—namely, that we might be well served to wait and watch as   more light is shed on the situation  It will put us in a better position to make decisions  As far as   how we couch our policy decision, I believe we should be very careful about making any   changes  I think we will have an interesting discussion in the policy portion of this meeting   about what we say in our press statement  Thank you, Mr Chairman       Well, I support your recommendation, Mr Chairman  But I have a   question for you  Are you planning to say in the press statement that we stand ready to move, or   are you just leaving that open?     Yes, I agree  It wasn’t clear to me how you were planning to explain our   posture to the public  That answer was helpful  Thank you     Absolutely     Thank you, Mr Chairman  The Tenth District economy actually has   shown signs of some further modest weakening since the last meeting due partly, and only   partly, to the war  Both retail sales and manufacturing activity have edged down, and tourism   has been soft  Some of the reduction in tourism was very clearly related to the war  There were   a lot of cancellations in the tourist areas of Colorado particularly  On the manufacturing side,   May 6, 2003 43 of 115    just to give you a sense of recent developments, the year-over-year index for production derived   from our manufacturing survey, after having reached a level of 12 in February, slipped to   minus 4 in March and was minus 3 in April  The year-over-year index for new orders, however,   was actually 8 in April, up from 4 in March  So it’s a mixed bag but is not very encouraging     We have met with our Economic Advisory Council and some of our directors, and there   is a mixed tone in their reports, with some modest optimism but quite a bit of “let’s wait and   see”  There has been, of course, some further pickup in energy activity and some very modest   moderation in private-sector layoff announcements  Consumers are in a little better mood since   military operations in Iraq ended but remain basically cautious  Most businesses report that the   end of the war has not affected their plans, meaning that they are still in somewhat of a wait-and-  see mode  On the inflation front, wage and price pressures remain subdued, but firms are   increasingly worried about the impact of insurance costs on their profit margins     Let me turn to the national scene  The broad contours of our economic forecast have   changed very little since our last meeting  Like the Greenbook, we expect modest growth in the   second quarter followed by a rebound to trend growth in the second half and then greater than   trend growth next year  For all the reasons outlined by others and in the Greenbook—monetary   policy, fiscal policy, the strength in the financial system, falling oil prices, and so forth—demand   should pick up  But in that context I’m aware that the recent news, as others have indicated, has   been relatively disappointing  That’s partly the reason, which I understand, for taking the   position that we should move now for insurance  Also, while I don’t necessarily think that the   probabilities of deflation are as high as Dave outlined—depending on the model, one can get   much lower probabilities—the fact of the matter is that accelerating inflation is not a near-term   threat  I understand that also as one of the arguments for going ahead and easing now     May 6, 2003 44 of 115    Having thought about that, though, I am more of the view that we ought to wait and see   until June  A reason for that is spelled out in Part 2 of the Greenbook, in what I think is an   important statement  “   we cannot yet discern whether the uncertainty that may have been   restraining private spending has lifted”  We will know a little more about that in June  The   second reason that I would put forward for waiting until June is that if we ease now—though   depending on how much—I think the zero bound will move from an issue on which we get a   general question from time to time to one of significant debate and discussion publicly  The nay   sayers in various groups will be bringing that up because the funds rate would be that much   lower and the zero bound that much closer  Moreover, we have an important discussion coming   up in June on communication  Some of that will relate to the issue of the zero bound  So we   will be in a better position to have clearer thoughts on how we as a Committee should talk about   that going forward  I think there are legitimate questions as to how to discuss issues relating to   the zero bound  While it may be easy to communicate that we can buy assets up the yield curve,   there will be questions such as what we are targeting—reserves, an average rate, or whatever    I’d like to have a discussion of those issues by this Committee before we move to a more public   realm on them  So I think that waiting until June has very little downside and it may position us   well for a clearer view going forward from there  Thank you, Mr Chairman     Mr Chairman, I have a question for Vincent  I appreciate the dilemma   that you just defined for us  What is your reaction to in a sense abandoning the balance of risk   statement and expanding the press release statement to define our position?  Does that have   merit?  How would the market react to that in your opinion?       I agree with that, and I look forward to your comments     I support this statement  I would say, perhaps not unlike others, that if   we had taken an action today, I would have been a little squeamish  But certainly I understand   where the risks are and would have supported an easing  I think unbundling the risks is a very   May 6, 2003 89 of 115    good idea  In my view, the second paragraph isn’t necessarily cast in stone but does give us   some opportunity to be more communicative with the public as we move forward  So I’m very   supportive of this  One thing I would request is that we think about the agenda for the June   meeting sooner rather than later because in light of this statement and our discussion today that   will be a real opportunity for us to do some very important planning and discussion     As a request     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Having just heard you say that these aren’t   necessarily options we want to talk about, I still would like to get a reaction from the staff about   some of them—perhaps for the sake of discussion  Independent of what we may do tomorrow,   we are at historically low interest rates, and people are wondering how the Federal Open Market   Committee might conduct itself in the future  Given that situation, it gives me pause to think   about being asked a question and telling people that as one method we could target a rate out on   the yield curve  I’d feel much more comfortable saying that we can expand reserves regardless    June 24-25, 2003 22 of 211    I’d feel more comfortable doing that than talking about targeting long-term interest rates   because, with our banking industry in good shape, the expansion of reserves would cause some   mechanisms to kick in that would tend to stimulate the economy  How do you or other members   of the Committee feel with regard to our talking about these issues, given that the questions will   inevitably be asked?     I’m talking about now, Mr Chairman, depending on where we move the   funds rate  People are saying, even in these memos, that the effective zero rate is 50 basis points   or that the money market funds would be affected if the funds rate gets to 75 basis points or   lower  Therefore, questions are going to arise as to how we should conduct policy or how we   plan to conduct it     Right     Right     One thing you’re saying that I appreciate hearing—because I would feel   very uncomfortable talking about it—is to stay away from specific discussions about targeting   rates out the yield curve  I want to endorse that  I also understand the need for vagueness, given   that we can’t anticipate what the future will hold for us   June 24-25, 2003 24 of 211      Wouldn’t it be easier just to solve this problem?  [Laughter]   June 24-25, 2003 59 of 211      Mr Chairman, as others have said about their Districts, the Tenth   District economy has remained sluggish since our last meeting but there are some signs of a   turnaround and a little more optimism  Labor markets continue to be soft, manufacturing activity   has not picked up noticeably, and commercial real estate remains in a slump  State and local   governments are also cutting back, and in some cases they are trying to raise taxes or have raised   taxes in order to balance their budgets     On a more positive note, indicators of future activity have shown some improvement    While District firms are still cautious about new hiring, they announced far fewer job cuts in the   last month than in other recent months  Also, manufacturers’ plans for future capital spending   June 24-25, 2003 96 of 211    are higher than they were earlier this year  Commercial realtors are now expecting conditions to   improve somewhat in the coming months instead of continually getting worse  In other positive   signs, retail sales are holding up, housing activity is still strong, and energy activity continues to   expand  I’ll say a little more on those sectors in a moment   On the inflation front, goods prices have been basically flat since our last meeting  But   manufacturers have mentioned to us that they are seeing a bit of increase in the cost of goods    Let me say just a little more about the manufacturing sector  In our survey on capital spending,   of those firms that plan to increase capital spending over the next six months about half said that   they had already placed the orders  That reflected some improvement from prior surveys  I   would also note that several of our directors indicated that optimism was considerably higher   among small and medium-sized manufacturers than in some of our larger firms   As I noted, consumer spending has continued to rebound after the dip associated with the   Iraq war, and housing activity has remained strong  The energy sector is showing improvement   but interestingly hasn’t improved as much as one might have expected  Some individuals in our   region have told us that an important reason is that they’ve seen prices go up before, have   invested to produce more, and then had prices fall on them  They’re not anxious to go through   that experience again  The farm economy is showing improvement, as you’ve read elsewhere, so   I don’t see any need to comment further on that   Let me turn to the national outlook  I agree that economic forces are in place for a more   robust recovery, making a rebound to trend growth this year and to above-trend growth next year   more likely now than it seemed at our last meeting  Businesses remain cautious, however, in   their plans for capital spending and for new hires  That, of course, is a concern for the outlook,   and I would suggest that the Greenbook’s forecast probably is a bit optimistic, especially   June 24-25, 2003 97 of 211    compared with our own forecast  But the point is that our recent surveys of capital spending and   other factors are considerably more positive in terms of expectations  So I expect to see growth   pick up to about 3½ percent in the second half of this year  While below the Greenbook forecast,   that is still, I think, a very positive outcome   As for policy, I won’t talk about numbers, but I believe that the probabilities of   improvement going forward are much better than they were just a short time ago, at our previous   meeting  So I look at the possibility of taking an easing action today as insurance  I think it can   be presented in that way—in a very positive light, consistent with an improving economy and   economic outlook  In my view that’s a good way to think about it and to present it  Thank you     Mr Chairman, I support the recommendation, and let me explain my   reasons in the following way  I am scheduled to give a speech next week; and as I think about it,   the policy stance you’ve just described makes me comfortable that I will be able to give that   June 24-25, 2003 144 of 211    speech  In other words, I do think that the outlook is positive  I don’t know if it’s as positive as   the Greenbook or as positive as we hope, but I think it’s positive  However, I believe that the   cost of insurance is fairly low and a ¼ point cut in the funds rate target is to me a reasonable   insurance policy  If we went more than ¼ point, selling the idea that the economy is picking up   and that the outlook is favorable would be much harder; that would be very difficult to   communicate  So I support your recommendation strongly     I agree with that   June 24-25, 2003 160 of 211      Yes, we have a different projection now, a much stronger projection      I realize that     Thank you, Mr Chairman  The Tenth District economy has   strengthened since the last meeting  Although economic growth is certainly not robust, it is at   least showing some positive signs  The labor markets are still soft, but they do appear to be   improving slightly  Employment has slowly edged up since the end of the Iraqi war, moving   August 12, 2003 50 of 110    almost to year-ago levels  Layoff announcements did rise somewhat in July, but that was due   mainly to some anticipated job cuts at certain military bases     Manufacturing activity showed further signs of recovery in July  New orders were up    Our manufacturing index was 16 in July, up from 6 in June and minus 2 in May  That’s   consistent with other improvements, such as increases in capital spending and expectations of   future production that remain generally favorable  The negatives were that current production   did slip back to below year-ago levels and plans for future hiring and capital spending remained   unclear  There’s a certain sense of wanting to go forward but a hesitancy that still remains     Consumer spending has continued to rebound from the dip during the war  Retailers   contacted in mid-July said that their sales were up a little from previous months and at or above   year-ago levels in most locations in our region  Commercial real estate, though still weak, has   shown some signs of stabilizing  Office vacancy rates were unchanged in the second quarter,   and construction activity leveled off after trending down for the last year and a half  Housing   activity remained strong  The recent increase in mortgage rates has caused a fairly sharp   reduction in refinancings, but so far we’ve not heard any reports that it is curbing housing   demand itself  Energy activity remains an important source of strength  Drilling for natural gas   continues to expand, supported by high prices and the lifting of some environmental restrictions   recently in Wyoming   State and local budgets remain a drag on the District economy  Colorado, Nebraska, and   Oklahoma are planning to implement some further spending cuts  Also, legislators in Nebraska   and Kansas are talking about—and in fact are very close to—enacting some tax increases    Pricing trends are little changed since the last meeting  Retail prices have been stable  In   manufacturing, our contacts tell us that prices of materials have continued to rise while prices of   August 12, 2003 51 of 110    finished goods have continued to encounter downward pressure  The farm economy is   recovering  Those areas that have a crop have a very good crop  Some areas in western Kansas   and Nebraska still are experiencing a drought, and farmers there are relying on government   payments as they have in the past   Let me turn to the national economy  It appears, as others have noted, that the economic   forces are in place for sustainable recovery, making a rebound to trend growth this year possible   and to above-trend growth next year most likely  We have accommodative monetary policy and   fiscal policy, strong productivity, and a healthy financial system that can support the credit needs   of businesses as those needs materialize  Of course, as we’ve talked about today, the significant   increase in long-term interest rates is a topic receiving a lot of attention  While the rise in long-  term rates can be a negative, obviously, part of the increase reflects simply a rebound from the   dramatic declines in May and June  But I think those rates also have risen because investors are   more confident about the strength of the recovery  In addition to anticipating the strong   monetary and fiscal forces propelling the economy forward, we’re now beginning to see the   strength reflected in economic and financial data  Inflation-indexed Treasury yields suggest that   real interest rates are higher  In addition, the inflation premium has in fact increased   Putting this all together, my outlook for the economy continues to be for real GDP   growth of about 3½ percent in the second half of this year, which is below the Greenbook’s   4 percent  I think growth next year will be closer to 4 percent than the Greenbook forecast of 48   percent  Of course, if business becomes confident about the outlook and business fixed   investment increases to the 13 percent suggested in the Greenbook, then we could see growth in   the range of 4½ percent or better  So, while I see upside risk to growth, it is based on my   August 12, 2003 52 of 110    forecast of growth most likely being near 4 percent, not the 48 percent projected by the staff    Relative to that 48 percent, I think there’s probably some downside risk   Let me turn briefly to the inflation outlook  I expect core inflation to remain relatively   stable  While the output gap may put some downward pressure on inflation, I would be reluctant   to place too much weight on the output gap as a predictor of inflation going forward  More   significantly, financial markets and market economists seem to me to be expecting somewhat   higher inflation  In my view, the inflation risk for 2004 is about balanced  More generally,   given the outlook, I think the risk of unwelcome deflation or disinflation caused by a collapse in   aggregate demand is negligible, although I do recognize that continued strong productivity, along   with modest economic growth, could lead to some further disinflation  Thank you     I’m very comfortable with your recommendation on both counts, Mr   Chairman   August 12, 2003 76 of 110      On balance, I think it would be preferable to drop the last sentence   because it does change the statement, which gets attention, and then expectations change  If we   August 12, 2003 90 of 110    just repeat what we said before, we’re signaling to everyone that policy is on hold  In terms of   policy announcements or implications, I think that is the safer course, and we can have a full   discussion of these communication issues at the September meeting  I recognize that this last   sentence comes out of the semiannual monetary policy report, but if it becomes part of the   Committee’s statement, it will receive more emphasis     No, I’m not suggesting that you are  I’m just saying that having that   wording here does tend to bring out the point more forcefully        Mr Chairman, I have a question about something you said  I’ll ask for   Vincent’s interpretation of it so I can get this question on the table now  [Laughter]  You were   talking about wanting to inform the market about our outlook for the future  I think that’s what   you were saying in your opening comments       That’s what I want to clarify  Are we talking about the risks we see   today and how we interpret those risks?  Or are we talking about taking the statement further, as   we did last time, in terms of policy in the foreseeable future?  What is the intent?     Okay     I think it’s important to be clear what we mean when we talk about the   future  If we’re talking about the balance of risks we see today based on the information   September 15, 2003 16 of 78    currently available, that’s one thing  If we suggest that our assessment of the risks implies a   future action on our part, then I think we’ve gone beyond what we can reasonably do as far as   predicting the future     That’s helpful to me  Thank you     Right     Mr Chairman, I’m going to back off of Al’s point  I have some   sympathy for setting an inflation objective, but I think price stability is the objective  I’m more   or less following up on Bob Parry’s comments  Where I’m having difficulty with this whole   issue is that, to my mind at least, we are introducing a new ambiguity—I think it happened at the   last meeting—and that is this idea of market guidance  I feel very uneasy with it       Yes, or anything like that  We’ve moved further away from our   boilerplate language in trying to be more explanatory about our actions  As you started out   saying this evening, we can’t predict the future  None of us can predict the future  Another   factor is that the markets receive as much data as we do, and they can judge our actions or our   prospective actions based on those data and on our past actions  Over a long period of time, it is   September 15, 2003 39 of 78    the actions that really do speak better than the words  So that’s where I’m coming from    Moreover, it’s my experience—and I think others have found this to be the case as well—that   people hear what they want to hear  Sometimes, and maybe often, the markets hear what they   want to hear, so we cannot expect to convey conditional statements very successfully to the   markets  People simply don’t believe or accept statements as conditional in hindsight  Thus, we   find ourselves having to surprise the markets, in a sense, when we try to be too prescriptive or   forward-looking     So I would focus on the statement—I think it’s a good suggestion to bring the wording in   the Bluebook and the language of the press release together—and say that this is what our action   is today  We can talk about the risks we see today—the risks with regard to economic output   and inflation and leave it at that  That means more boilerplate  My view is that, if we try to do   any more than that, we will get into a very complicated pre-approval process on the press release   because we’d be saying more than the action itself says  I think that’s a very bad course to   follow  In my view, outlining our sense of the risks is about as much guidance as we can   provide  However, if we are going to try to use our press release to explain more—and I’ll end   with this—I have a very strong sympathy toward the Bank of England model  Vincent talked   about the possibility of errors occurring if we use that model, but frankly, I think there will be   fewer errors if we publish the minutes more quickly than if we try to write a press release that   represents twelve views in two paragraphs  With the latter approach I think we really open   ourselves up to errors and rough statements     It’s one I think we ought to consider very seriously if we start going   down the road of wanting to expand what we say in the press release rather than making it more   September 15, 2003 40 of 78    boilerplate  I have to tell you that I think focusing on those minutes and saying that they are an   accurate representation of our discussion would be very healthy for the market  With the release   of the minutes we are saying in effect “these are the facts”  The market can interpret our actions   and our outlook based on those facts     I would go back to announcing our action      With no comment, right     I’d release them as quickly as we can—two weeks after the meeting if   that’s reasonable—because they provide the explanation for our actions  The market can   decipher the minutes  Yes, people may occasionally misinterpret them, but the minutes are our   representation of the discussions that occurred at the meeting  And there’s no attribution, so   there is no risk to an individual member  I would prefer that to expanding the press statement    Now, if we go to a boilerplate statement—this is our action, and these are the risks, with the risks   clearly understood as those we see today and not anything that hints at our next move—I’m fine   with that  But absent that, I think we ought to get the minutes out more quickly and confine the   statement       Remember one thing I said  I said that I’d rather go through this   challenge with the minutes than opt to expand the press release  I think there’s more danger in   the press release if we’re going to get prescriptive with it            Thank you, Mr Chairman  To begin with the region, our Tenth District   economy actually has shown further improvement since our last meeting, although District firms   remain reluctant to hire strongly or to spend a lot of money on capital  At the same time,   manufacturing activity has expanded, retail sales were solid heading into the fall, and residential   construction and sales rose to new levels  I would also note that we’ve had reports that state and   local tax revenues are now starting to come in above projections     Layoff announcements for District firms are continuing to trend downward, although we   haven’t seen a pickup in employment, as I mentioned  While large firms we contacted indicated   that they are not planning much in the way of new hiring, it is interesting that a substantial   number of small to midsized manufacturers said that they do expect to add to payrolls in the   coming months  The picture for capital spending is similar; it’s sluggish overall but with a few   signs of a possible turnaround, especially among small and midsized firms  This includes a   pickup in nonresidential construction due to some plant expansions now being talked about    September 16, 2003 33 of 106    Also, there is some increased interest among manufacturers in the new investment tax incentives    As for inflation in our area, raw materials prices and benefits costs have continued to rise   significantly  Also, in keeping with the stronger economic picture, there has been less evidence   of price cuts on finished goods     Turning to the national picture, I agree with the staff’s assessment that the economic   forces are in place for a sustainable recovery, with growth above trend this year and next year the   most likely outcome  As has been noted, we have an accommodative monetary policy,   stimulative fiscal policy, strong productivity, and a healthy financial system that can support the   credit needs of businesses when those needs materialize  In addition, economic data released   since our June meeting have been consistent with stronger growth this year and next  More   specifically, I expect growth over the rest of this year to be at least at the 4½ percent mark  I   would note also that I know of more people now expecting growth to be north of 5 percent in the   third quarter and I’ve seen projections here and there of 6 percent growth   Of course, I am aware that there are downside risks to the outlook as well  Obviously I   remain concerned, as do others, about foreign economic growth  As the Greenbook notes, the   foreign outlook has been revised upward, but that’s primarily because the forecast for the US   economy has been revised upward  So to some extent we’re looking at one another and saying   that we each should get a better economic outcome, and I think we have to be sensitive to that    I’m also concerned that while CEO confidence is improving, it’s not taking off strongly  Though   we’ve seen some increase in capital spending, we do not yet have a clear “self-sustaining”   recovery, as they say, on the business fixed investment side  Without that, we all are concerned   about the continuation or the sustainability of the recovery itself  The largest question mark   remains the labor market  I realize that employment is a lagging indicator, but the lags seem to   September 16, 2003 34 of 106    be especially long this time  Strong productivity is affecting this situation, obviously    Nevertheless, I expect that we will be seeing an increase in employment, as the Greenbook   projects, by the end of the year if not before and then a decline in unemployment beginning next   year     Let me speak very briefly about the inflation outlook  I expect core inflation to remain   relatively stable at its current level, which I think is a good thing  While the output gap may put   some downward pressure on inflation, I am cautious about putting too much weight on the output   gap as a predictor of inflation trends  For one, there’s the issue of level and speed effects and so   forth, which I believe Dave mentioned also  In addition, market economists are expecting   somewhat higher inflation, not lower, and I think that’s because they also question the role of the   output gap or its change in determining the course of inflation  My own view is that the near-  term inflation risks are about balanced  Inflation may move higher or lower but probably not   much in either direction if it does move  Given the outlook, I think the risk of an unwelcome   decline in inflation—one caused by a collapse in aggregate demand—is in fact negligible  I do   recognize, as I noted, that with continued strong productivity growth we could get a reduction in   inflation  But I would be hesitant to call such a development an unwelcome event  Thank you     Mr Chairman, I agree with leaving the funds rate target unchanged at   this meeting  My own view is that we are in an environment where we’re close to price stability,   with low and stable inflation, and I think the risks are balanced  I will tell you that trying to   figure out what to say in this statement right now makes the early release of the minutes seem   more appealing to me than it did last night  In any event, I don’t think we can do much to   change this statement given the current circumstances, so I’m not going to argue any further  I’ll   live with this language, but I hope we do develop a very carefully crafted exit strategy fairly   soon  Thank you     Mr Chairman, listening to this discussion, I want to say that I very much   agree with those who say we should leave this wording absolutely the same as it was last time     Keeping it the same tells the market something right there  It means that   we don’t want to change anything, and market observers will begin to think about the fact that   we’ll be backing off in the future  I think that will take us a step forward in an exit strategy   September 16, 2003 93 of 106      Mr Chairman, I more or less share the view that President Guynn   expressed  One of the things I did in preparation for this discussion was to go back to the press   release that we used in January 2000  After some considerable thought, the Committee—rightly   or wrongly—put that wording together  It worked very well as far as I’m concerned  Then some   special circumstances came up, and we made changes in that wording  They served their   purpose but now we have some fallout from that  We ought to go back to the earlier language as   a starting point—not to the language we’re now using, which was put together ad hoc piece-by-  piece, but back to the base  Let’s think it through and see what we need to modify in that   language  If it makes sense, I’d keep the structure as close to that earlier version as possible and   then move forward  I would not try to figure out wording today or choose now among several   options  I don’t feel comfortable with any of them  I’d feel reasonably comfortable with what   we had before with some changes to reflect that we’re in a more stable price environment  So I   agree with Jack  Maybe circumstances are changing too quickly, and we can’t wait until   January  But we ought to wait at least until December, think this through more carefully, and   come up with some options or narrow our options at that point     David, looking at 2004, your estimates for consumption are strikingly   strong  It would be great if the figures came out that way  But you estimate consumption to be   as strong as it was in the late ’90s  You touched on your reasoning, but could you again give me   your rationale for that?  I ask because your forecast is an outlier; it’s at the upper limit of the   range of forecasts     Well, I question only the third reason relating to the wealth effects    When we had these kinds of growth rates in PCE previously, the wealth effects were much more   positive  So in my view the wealth effects returning to neutral—while granted they are no longer   a drag—won’t produce quite the boost that might be expected  I do agree with you on the labor   market, however; I certainly see that improving as we move forward  But the consumption   forecast seems a little strong to me     Mr Chairman, the Tenth District economy continues to improve, and our   business contacts have become somewhat more optimistic about the outlook  Let me talk a little   about the labor markets They remain soft but are showing some signs of firming  According to   some of the payroll data we’ve looked at, employment was flat for our District in September    However, layoff announcements are down from earlier in the year, and more firms say that they   are planning to hire or are thinking about hiring  I would note anecdotally that firms announcing   job increases in the last couple of months include several call centers, a major railroad, several   manufacturers in our area, and a number of high-tech firms in Colorado  To the relief of people   in both Kansas City and Tulsa, American Airlines decided not to lay off workers at its two large   maintenance facilities in those cities   On the manufacturing side, activity actually strengthened further  Production and new   orders both increased, and expectations for future production and orders remained relatively   high  Capital spending also improved somewhat  Although employment remained below year-  ago levels, the average workweek did rise noticeably  On the negative side, aircraft   manufacturing continued to struggle, with little improvement expected until 2005  I would note   that from August to September the year-over-year production index from our survey of   manufacturers rose from 8 to 17, the new orders index climbed from 22 to 31, and the capital   spending index improved from 0 to 12  Moreover, preliminary data received for October as late   as yesterday suggest that these trends persisted in October   Consumer spending continued to edge up despite the softer labor market that I   mentioned  Retailers contacted also said that they had had pretty good sales and their confidence   remained strong  Housing activity increased further, setting new records in most of the areas   except for Denver where it’s a little slower  Commercial real estate does remain weak in the   October 28, 2003 50 of 126    region, and energy activity is expanding but at a moderate pace  State and local budgets show   further signs of improvement, with some tax revenue increases in several of our states  But I   would caution that to some extent those numbers reflect tax increases  On the agricultural side,   forecasts for net income have moved up as much as 22 percent over last year  But I would   remind you that about $20 billion of federal farm payments are included in those numbers     Let me turn to the national outlook  The economic forces are in place for a relatively   robust recovery  That assessment is based on current monetary policy, fiscal policy,   productivity, and a good strong financial system that can support credit needs going forward    Overall, I expect growth through the end of next year to be above 4 percent, a little better than   the Blue Chip consensus but not quite as strong as the Greenbook forecast  As noted, a recovery   in capital spending and an increase in employment remain two risks to our achieving sustainable   economic growth  But I’m hearing about some increases in capital spending from the people we   talk to, and we see some evidence of it in the numbers  In my conversations with CEOs in the   District, there’s a clear sense of greater confidence and an indication that firms are more willing   to undertake planned expansions  So I’m optimistic about that  We also are beginning to see   some signs that labor markets are responding to the acceleration in growth over the past several   months  The evidence is very preliminary and tentative, I realize, but I think it bodes well for the   labor markets going forward     Turning to the inflation outlook, I would say that, in the near term, inflation is likely to   remain stable and that the risks going forward are about balanced  A continued decline in the   dollar could put upward pressure on inflation  Although the output gap may put some downward   pressure on inflation, I am reluctant to put a lot of weight on that gap as a predictor of inflation    October 28, 2003 51 of 126    Research here and elsewhere suggests that the predictive powers of the output gap on inflation   are difficult to find   Finally, on the topic of policy let me say that I clearly would be of the view that for now   we should maintain policy where it is  I think any change would actually be harmful in the   current environment  However, given recent data, I’m not convinced that we can define a period   within which we can keep rates this low  I also think it’s important that the public come to   realize, as President Parry suggested, that an accommodative policy refers to the level of the   funds rate and not to the direction of any change  Although I do not have a point estimate of the   long-run equilibrium for the funds rate, it probably is more likely in a range of 3 to 4 percent   than near 1 percent  Thank you     Mr Chairman, I support you completely  Since we’re into metaphors   today, here’s mine  With regard to the communication part of your recommendation, with the   second paragraph I think we have dug ourselves into a hole and we’re trying very hard to get out   October 28, 2003 83 of 126    of it but all we’re doing is getting in deeper  Let’s put the shovel down, think about it, and climb   out of this hole later  That’s why I’d say leave the paragraph exactly the same     I’m not quite sure what to say, Roger  I started out, as I’ve thought   about our communications in the last few months, thinking that the earlier release of the minutes   would provide us with an opportunity to cut back on the statement  You indicated in an earlier   memo to us that cutting back on the statement, even coupled with an earlier release of the   minutes, would be viewed as a step back in terms of the information we provide  That causes me   to think that the forecasts we submit twice a year in preparation for our semiannual reports on   monetary policy should be the focus of our communications about the outlook  I’d rather have   the forecasts we provide to the Congress in those reports—along with the relevant Committee   December 9, 2003 113 of 133    minutes—be the vehicle we use to put out that range of views rather than the risk statement,   which for me has been a very dissatisfying effort to communicate with the markets and   whomever else  So, since we’ve opened up the door to having more options to choose from here,   I would say that I really would like to pare back the press release  And I’d try to provide sooner   rather than later a greater sense of the variety of very valuable views among Committee members   and the differences that come through that ultimately lead to a consensus  So that’s my two cents   worth     David, in reading the Greenbook and listening to your comments this   morning, you’ve indicated that, as we go through the next several months and through 2005, the   economy will move back to its potential  Yet the associated real fed funds rate at the end of the   period is less than 1 percent  If one were to look at this option as a policy prescription, is the   idea that you want to ensure a move back toward potential as quickly as possible and then worry   about how far below equilibrium the short-term rate is?  Is that the suggestion rather than that we   should plan to move the funds rate up as the economy moves back toward potential?     I understand     Thanks     Mr Chairman, the Tenth District economy is similar to the District   economies others have described in that it continues to expand and has done so fairly clearly   since our last meeting  Businesses are showing some real confidence that the recovery now is   going to sustain itself     December 9, 2003 72 of 133    Let me talk just a minute about regional developments  Our labor markets have indeed   firmed since our last meeting  According to the payroll data, employment rose in October for the   second month in a row  Moreover, layoff announcements have subsided, and hiring   announcements have picked up, suggesting that job growth will continue to strengthen further in   the coming months  Manufacturing activity also has expanded  Production and new orders rose   strongly during the last two months, and expectations for future activity have moved higher    Employment is no longer falling, and for the first time since the slump began, firms in   manufacturing appear willing to hire additional workers to meet anticipated increases in demand    Capital spending also continues to improve, with considerably more firms planning to increase   than to reduce investment in the coming months  Consumer spending looks solid despite   reduced stimulus from the tax rebate and the slowdown in mortgage refinancing activity     Anecdotal reports suggest that the holiday season has gotten off to a good start in our   area, particularly in the east side of the region, with stores feeling less need to discount   merchandise this year than last year  Travel and tourism are also doing well, with convention   activity continuing strong and ski bookings in the western part of our District running quite high    Housing activity remains robust  And though commercial real estate is still in a slump, we’re   beginning to hear that the bottom has been reached, at least in the view of our local developers    Energy activity remains strong     With respect to inflation, wage pressures are still minimal, but price pressures have   increased slightly  Manufacturers not only expect substantial increases in raw materials prices in   the next few months but also anticipate having somewhat more success in passing the cost   increases on to the customer  That’s the anecdotal comments we’re receiving from them  In   agriculture, incomes are up  They were adjusted up another 6 percent in November  The only   December 9, 2003 73 of 133    fly in the ointment is some of the upsetting information relative to China  That has affected our   agricultural outlook to a small degree     Let me turn to the national economy  To repeat what many others have said, recent   indicators have been strong and more so than generally expected  As a result, many people have   revised upward their forecasts for growth in 2004  Overall, I expect growth to be in the 4¼ to   4½ percent range in 2004 and stronger than that—maybe 4¾ to 5 percent in 2005  Obviously my   forecast is lower than the Greenbook’s but somewhat higher than the December Blue Chip   numbers that came in at just under 4 percent  The reasons for the strong outlook are the same as   they have been for some time  accommodative monetary policy, stimulative financial   conditions, cumulative effects of fiscal policy, and strong productivity  In addition to these, I   would add strong forward momentum and improving business confidence as important factors    Moreover, employment is finally rising, and the unemployment rate is falling  We also are   seeing more signs of recovery in capital spending on a national level, as I’ve heard around the   table  The growth in profits and business fixed investment seen in the last quarter along with   strong orders and shipments of nondefense capital goods suggest that the recovery will continue   to improve as we move forward     While there are risks to the outlook, I think they are probably balanced now or on the   upside, depending on one’s definition of upside  At the last meeting I felt, as did others, that   there was a fair amount of uncertainty with regard to capital spending and employment  While   risks in those areas perhaps remain, they are clearly much smaller today than just a short time   ago at our last meeting  In addition, the upside surprises we have been seeing may continue as   the recovery gains momentum   December 9, 2003 74 of 133    Let me turn to the inflation outlook  I take the view that inflation will rise, but I agree   with those who say it is likely to increase only slightly, perhaps by ¼ point in 2004 and 2005  I   would add that, while I think the argument that the output gap will tend to hold inflation down is   a fair one, I believe the highly accommodative stance of monetary policy in an accelerating   economy balances out those deflationary risks  As it settles out for me, Mr Chairman, I would   suggest that at worst the output risks are balanced  I think the inflation risks are also balanced    In my view we really do need to reconsider the last sentence of our statement  I think we can   change the language—and perhaps at this meeting—in a way that moves us more toward neutral,   with balanced risk assessments, without necessarily upsetting the markets or the mainstream    Thank you        Mr Chairman, obviously I agree with your policy recommendation for   the funds rate  I don’t agree with the change in the statement  I think we have an opportunity   here to identify the risks as balanced and drop the “considerable period” statement  If we were to   remove that statement, I think the market might, as President Poole suggested, exhibit some   gyrations this afternoon, but I believe there’s a fair amount of expectation in the market that we   will drop that wording today  If we did, I think it would allow us more flexibility going forward    It would enable us at our January meeting to focus on more forward-looking issues relating to the   policy statement  I must admit that that would be my strong preference        I agree with those who have suggested that we put this on the shelf for   now  The original purpose is being dealt with in other ways, and the cost seems to be sizable for   this particular very narrow dimension  If we need to, we can bring it up at another time  I think   it’s better shelved for now     Given the suggested approach that you’ve just outlined, Mr Chairman,   I’ll confine my comments  On the risk statement, if that’s what we’re narrowly focusing on, I   January 27-28, 2004 21 of 238    don’t have any difference with you  But I’d start out by saying that I wish we could get rid of the   risk assessment in the statement  I’d like the statement merely to say this is the action we took    It’s the risk statement that always seems to hang us up and raise other issues     Well, that’s what I would prefer  But barring that, depending on how   this Committee discussion comes out, my second choice would be the gradual evolution option     I’ll stop there     I’ll combine a couple of things at this point  Let me start out by saying   that, if the consensus conforms with the view that you have just summarized, I can live with that    I originally was in favor of releasing the minutes earlier, and my thinking was that doing so   would allow us to get rid of the risk statement  I know there is the thought that we can’t move   back from a decision to accelerate the release of the minutes, but I think the quid pro quo of   eliminating the risk statement could be favorable  So that has some appeal to me  Plus the   minutes give the market a more complete reflection of the broad views of the Committee   members, and there is perhaps a benefit from that     I think that assessment still holds  However, I recognize your main point  I’ve been   down that road before You jump, and then you’ve done it, and you can’t back out  So I don’t   January 27-28, 2004 44 of 238    have a problem with approaching the decision slowly, with a lot of thought  But I think it is a   step worth considering and deliberating  As for some of the comments that arise in our   discussions, certainly if the minutes are not released for two or three weeks, what we say in   public statements during that period can be more complicated  But I think we live with that to an   important degree now  So I don’t see that as a very significant complicating factor  The news   event of the minutes could be an issue if somehow the minutes give a completely different view   of our assessment of the balance of risks than the statement did when we released it  So I think   the proposal to advance the publication of the minutes deserves continual thought if not   acceptance at this point   Finally, I’m just going to go ahead to the next item, the role of our individual projections    My thought was that, if eliminating the risk statement were viewed as a backing away, the   projections could be the substitute in terms of filling in for information that is forward-looking    That’s not as critical to me as the idea of releasing the minutes sooner to make public the general   views of the Committee  I’ll stop there     Thank you  Let me just say that the idea of using the projections came to   me perhaps more as a reflection of how much I disliked the risk statement than how much I   really liked the projections  So, given the almost brilliant discussion of the risk statement, I’m   not married at all to the projections  I understand all the issues and concerns, and I agree that   we’d have a very difficult time making that work going forward  But I suppose it did serve my   purpose in the sense that it illustrated my willingness to get rid of the risk statement  With that   I’m going to be quiet   January 27-28, 2004 73 of 238      Thank you, Mr Chairman  The Tenth District economy has actually   strengthened further since the last meeting, and business contacts are frankly relatively optimistic   about the year ahead  I attended a tech conference near Boulder about two and a half weeks ago    That conference is held each year at about the same time  Last year about 150 people attended    This year about 400 people were there, and they were all very much engaged with projects going   forward  So there is a clear improvement in attitudes in some of the technology areas  Also,   energy activity in the District continues to be strong, primarily in the natural gas area, and is very   positive generally speaking  Manufacturing activity actually continued to expand in December    Both production and new orders moved further above year-ago levels, with orders posting their   strongest growth in some years  Inventories also rose above year-ago levels for the first time in   three years   In our survey on capital spending we did see some improvement on net  Thirty-one   percent of the manufacturers said that they expected to increase expenditures in the next six to   twelve months, and that is a substantial improvement over the numbers for our region in the   previous survey last May  Many firms that are planning to increase spending cited the need to   replace primarily IT and some other equipment  Having said that, some respondents provided   specific comments indicating that they were going to hold onto their current equipment until it   January 27-28, 2004 135 of 238    actually fell apart on them before they would invest again They were absolutely committed to   not spending money at this time   Commercial real estate activity is still weak in our area  Vacancy rates actually edged up   in the fourth quarter, and we are not seeing a lot of construction activity in that sector of our   regional economy  Labor markets also remain soft, but the underlying trend of layoffs and new   hires was a little more favorable this time  Adjusting for some of the mad cow effects on meat   packing plant activity, we have seen more hires than layoffs based on our own surveys   In the agricultural economy, 2003 was a very strong year for our region and I think   nationally, primarily because of the decline in the dollar and the demand overseas  We actually   are going to have some of the highest earnings in several years in the agricultural sector  In fact,   agricultural income hasn’t been that high in the last seven years  So that is really positive  And   we now expect that the mad cow effect will be less severe than we had originally thought, based   on talks with various groups in our region where that threat is so important     Turning to the national outlook, I would agree with those who say that recent indicators   confirm a strengthening in the economy looking ahead  Our projection for GDP growth is not as   strong as the Greenbook’s; we have it more in the area of 4½ percent  But I think that the   differences are a matter of degree  The direction is the same, and some of the reasons for the   improvement are the same, including very accommodative monetary and fiscal policies and   favorable financial conditions  So I think we will see some improvement    One comment I did want to make is related to the point that President Poole mentioned   about looking at the output gap as an indicator  I, too, am a little uneasy about putting much   weight on the output gap because the estimates of its size are so varied  The same is true of   some other parameters such as the natural rate  The gap could be as little as ½ percent of GDP or   January 27-28, 2004 136 of 238    as much as 2 percent, and that is too wide a range on which to base judgments  So I think   President Santomero is right in asking what areas we are going to look at to help guide us in our   policy decisions in the future  That is a very important question   As for the inflation outlook, we think inflation is most likely to increase over the year by   perhaps as much as ½ percentage point, given the fact that we have a very accommodative   monetary policy and fiscal stimulus in the pipeline  I think that is an important consideration for   us as we look forward  I’ll stop at that     I support your recommendations, Mr Chairman  On the funds rate, I   absolutely agree with you  On the change in language, to the extent that it adds to our flexibility   I think it’s a good time to make the change  So I’m very supportive     Mr Chairman, the Tenth District has continued to expand since our last   meeting, and business contacts remain relatively optimistic about the rest of this year  Consumer   spending and tourism have remained solid through the ski season and into this period  Housing   activity has eased somewhat, as is true elsewhere, but it generally remains strong in our region    Manufacturing activity also continues to strengthen, as production, new orders, and employment   all have risen  In other positive news, manufacturing firms reported a further increase in capital   spending and in spending plans  And business leaders express optimism about economic growth   over the rest of this year throughout our region, with stronger feelings in the eastern part—in   Kansas City and that area—and a little less optimism in the Denver area   Commercial real estate has remained weak, and most firms continue to show less   enthusiasm for new hiring than for capital spending  There seems to be a sense that the cost of   capital is less than the cost of labor and that, therefore, it makes sense to go with the capital   spending  I’ll give you one piece of anecdotal data in support of that  Located in our region is a   major distributor of propane across the United States  They have used new technology—call   center, global positioning, and communications technology—to move their product from starting   point to distribution point  Using this technology, they are anticipating, to begin with, a   reduction of at least 10 percent of their drivers and, longer run, as much as 25 percent because of   the improvements in moving out their product  They came to the conclusion that investing in   this technology produced a much greater return on capital than continuing to operate in the old   way  I think that’s part of what we continue to see in the job market  Let me also mention that   we are hearing more anecdotal reports of delays in the ability to bring orders forward  When   firms order goods to be used in manufacturing, they are experiencing longer delays in receiving   March 16, 2004 49 of 107    those goods  So in that sense the environment is fairly strong in terms of our experience with   economic growth   At the national level, activity continues strong  Our projection in comparison to the   Greenbook forecast has no major differences  On average, for 2004-05 we’re in the same range   of about 4½ percent GDP growth  What I would say to you here—although I’m not advocating   any immediate change in our policy stance—is that I think conditions are developing that could   allow future price pressures to emerge  First of all, both monetary policy and fiscal policy, as   everyone knows, have been delivering quite a bit of stimulus  As one person said, “There’s a lot   of yeast in this dough, and it’s moving”   I would also say that the anecdotal reports suggest that we are going to see more delays in   deliveries—barring shocks, obviously  And there is more talk of passing on price increases; that   is becoming much more prevalent than it was just two or three months ago, or actually even a   month ago  So I’m wondering, in terms of positioning ourselves in the sense of our ability to   move rates up, if being tied to developments in the job market is really in our longer-run best   interest  We may have to be alert to this emerging situation as capital spending continues to   bring us greater productivity increases  Despite some views to the contrary, I think that   inflationary pressures may emerge before the job market turns around  Thank you     Mr Chairman, I’d prefer that we move to a balanced statement on the   inflation risks because I think the risks in fact are relatively balanced now  But I would not   choose to disagree with the stronger preferences that might be held by others around this table   March 16, 2004 82 of 107    who believe that we really should not be making a change at this time  That’s the more   important decision at this point, I think     Mr Chairman, the Tenth District economy has continued to improve   significantly since our last meeting, with most sectors showing considerably greater strength    Manufacturing activity accelerated in March and April  Production and new orders increased   sharply, causing backlogs at a substantial number of the firms we surveyed  Employment rose more   modestly, according to our monthly survey, but it has now been above year-ago levels for three   months in a row  Optimism about future activity also improved, boosting capital spending plans but   leaving hiring plans little changed    May 4, 2004 41 of 112       The year-over-year production index edged up to 31 in March and jumped to 46 in April in   our region  The year-over-year new orders index fell back to 29 in March and then rebounded   strongly to 54 in April  In other positive news, in Wichita aircraft manufacturers reported that   demand for business jets is finally picking up because of improved corporate profits and an aging   fleet among some of the corporate companies that use these jets  Consumer spending and housing   activity have strengthened since our last meeting  Much of the improvement in retail sales has been   in the mid-level department stores, which had been lagging behind the big discounters and luxury   stores  Similarly, we have seen an increase in demand for high-end goods and second homes in   several parts of our region  In our tourist sector, advanced bookings at summer resorts have been   very strong, although there is some uneasiness about the impact of higher gas prices on tourism as   we move through the summer  Energy activity has continued to expand in response to the high   prices for oil but particularly for gas, and there are shortages of workers, rigs, and materials in that   industry  Commercial real estate does remain in the doldrums; that’s the one exception to the   generally positive news  Labor markets are showing some signs of improvement; year-over-year   job growth in the District turned positive in March for the first time since 2001   On the inflation front, wage increases remain minimal, but surging raw materials prices have   led manufacturers to raise their output prices  Some firms said that strong demand has enabled them   to increase prices across a broad base  I’d also mention a point I found interesting  Firms began   their price increases by putting surcharges on steel, for example, or anything else they could, but   they are now moving such increases into their base prices  So they have had success in passing on   those increased costs and now are trying to institutionalize them into their base price programs    Bullish commodity markets, of course, are helping our agricultural sector across the board, and   there’s a lot of optimism in that sector as well   May 4, 2004 42 of 112       Turning to the national outlook, the economy is expanding at a solid pace; others have   highlighted the evidence supporting that  Certainly we could see GDP growth this year of between   4½ and 5 percent  I think there are strong indications that growth in that range is a possibility  With   that said, I’d like to talk a bit about developments on the pricing front  I think we are beginning to   see higher prices and expectations of further increases in prices  Expected inflation is now rising   among consumers and much of the business community in our region  For example, core inflation   measures have risen in the last few months, and recent increases reflect higher prices for more than   a few components  More troubling, though, are signs that inflation expectations are increasing    There was a one-page article in our local newspaper just this past weekend advising people on ways   to prepare for the oncoming inflationary surge  While longer-term inflation expectations may not   have changed on net since last fall, I think they are higher than they were during the first three   quarters of 2003  I’m not as inclined to say, as suggested in the Bluebook, that long-term inflation   expectations appear to be well anchored   Looking forward, while I do not expect a significant outbreak in inflation in the near term, I   think the upside risk to inflation is increasing noticeably  My concern stems from the currently   highly accommodative monetary policy in the context of a stronger real economy  The current real   funds rate is negative  The Bluebook shows that, for the first time since late 2001, it is below the   staff’s range of estimated equilibrium real rates  My concern also stems from the past depreciation   of the dollar and higher levels of energy, commodity, and various input prices—with steel being   only one of them  While I recognize that the direct effect of commodity-price increases and the   depreciating dollar on consumer price inflation is generally small, these factors may be influencing   the psychology of pricing and inflation expectations  And I don’t think that should be minimized    We are receiving an increasing number of reports that efforts to pass price increases up the chain—  May 4, 2004 43 of 112       as I mentioned in my anecdote earlier—are meeting with success, which may signal further inflation   pressures for the future  For these reasons, I expect core inflation to be higher than the Greenbook   suggests   I would add, too—and I know we have another discussion ahead of us—that I think we   should be very careful about how we describe the outlook in terms of future monetary policy actions   we might need to take  With that, I’ll stop for now  Thank you, Mr Chairman     Vincent, this may be more of a statement than a question also  But in my   experience on this Committee we’ve never acted in other than a measured way  And I can’t see our   doing otherwise as we go forward, depending on the data we get  In my view the only thing we   accomplish with this word specifically is to put a collar on ourselves and to tell the market that   we’re putting a collar on ourselves going forward  I think that’s what we’ve done in the past, with   the result that, anytime we want to make a change, we have to wait at least one more meeting to   prepare the market for the change—using the statement as the vehicle  That is the point Tony was   making earlier  We have an opportunity here to drop this language, and I think we should     Partly my concern is what will happen if the payroll numbers come out   better than 300,000 again and we have more inflation  Then what are we going to do next time?     What are we going to do?  We’ve already told the market if we say   “measured” today, what we’re going to do next time     Okay     I understand what you’re trying to do in terms of preparing for the next   meeting  My only concern is that, once we put this language in there, when the next meeting comes   and we have our policy discussion we’ll have to worry about the word “measured”—which I think   was President Santomero’s point     That makes me feel a whole lot less well       Mr Chairman, having expressed my opinion somewhat earlier and having   listened to all of this commentary, at this juncture I want to give you my measured response to the   conversation so far and that is that we have the direction right  I know where we stand in that we   need to be looking at the next meeting for some action  And I think that’s the most important thing   we’ve decided here today, so I support you in that  I think we would be better served not to have   this last sentence, line 8, in the statement  We could convey this message in speeches, as you   already have in some ways, over the coming period  The data coming out will decide a lot of this   for us and move us toward a June time frame anyway  But I think the more important element of   today’s decision is that we cannot move now and we should be thinking about June  In that sense, I   support your recommendation     Just a follow-up  The orderly and disorderly adjustment scenarios are   based on where we are today, if I understand correctly?     You’re saying that this can continue, though you don’t know for how   long, and as it does—      The consequences grow  And yet there is nothing we can do about it,   which is an interesting conclusion   June 29-30, 2004 28 of 203            But we know that at times it gives us a terrible headache     Thank you  I think the discussion of the inflation outlook has been helpful,   but it does raise some questions about the sense of optimism in the projection in terms of inflation   coming back down as quickly as it does  I’d just like to ask for your reaction because it has been   our experience, both when inflation comes down and when it goes up, that we underpredict the   change either way  It is on its way back up now, and we’re saying it’s not going to continue at a   very strong pace, and yet history tells us that we sometimes get behind the curve ourselves  Part of   the reason I worry about that is that the output gap is actually fairly small and closing rapidly, I   think; at least, that’s what some projections are showing  And the difference between the   unemployment rate and the NAIRU is fairly small; in fact, depending on what the NAIRU really is,   the difference could be zero  Looking at where policy is right now, the fed funds rate is so low   June 29-30, 2004 81 of 203          relative to where neutral most likely is, and we get to neutral so slowly in this projection, that I think   this inflation outlook is fairly optimistic—even with the error bands around it  I just have a sense   that we perhaps need to be less optimistic on this  My view is based upon the degree to which I   think the projections are overstating the difference between the NAIRU and the actual   unemployment rate and are not taking into account just how accommodative policy is right now and   will be in the near-term future  I guess I’m asking you to be somewhat defensive on this, but it   would be helpful for me if you could do that     Fair enough  Thank you     Thanks      Mr Chairman, the Tenth District economy has continued to expand at a   very solid pace since the last meeting  The labor market shows substantial signs of improvement    The District’s employment rose in May, and I think the numbers in June are also very strong, and   jobs are above year-ago levels in all seven of our states  Manufacturing activity rose in May, and   the preliminary numbers coming in for June are very solid  Production and new orders continue to   increase, and most plant managers that we talked with reported that their rates of capacity utilization   were back to pre-recession levels  Expectations are that activity during the second half of the year is   likely to cool somewhat but will still be at historical levels  Year-over-year production and new   June 29-30, 2004 104 of 203          orders indexes actually are setting new highs in our region as we move through June  Consumer   spending continues to rise at a moderate pace  Retailers report steady gains in sales, and we are   optimistic about the summer outlook  Housing activity also remains strong  So far, home sales and   homebuilding have shown little adverse effects from the increases in mortgage rates we’ve seen to   date  Energy activity has continued to expand in response to the high oil and gas prices, and   actually some drilling has been constrained because of the shortage of labor in that particular sector    Commercial real estate, as others have reported, remains our weak spot as well   On the inflation front, wage pressures remain constrained in the region, but manufacturers   are continuing to raise output prices in response to what they say are higher energy and raw   materials costs that they feel they need to pass on  Most manufacturers do expect these costs to   moderate; however, many of them are now telling us that the strong demand has made it easier for   them to increase prices and to have the increases hold   Turning to the national outlook, the economy obviously continues to expand at a solid pace   We expect that GDP growth will be around 4¾ percent this year and just slightly below 4 percent   next year  The important point, I think, is that the continued strong growth largely reflects the fact   that we have an accommodative monetary policy and a stimulative fiscal policy and that strong   growth around the world is facilitating growth in our GDP  The slowdown in growth that we’re   projecting for next year is related, of course, to some back-off in fiscal policy and a presumed   tightening in monetary policy   Let me talk a bit about inflation  Core inflation, as we all know, has increased  Although   we talk about important transitory elements to that increase, I still think that the core price indexes   now have embedded in them some inflationary updrift that is due to our earlier accommodative    monetary policy  And while fiscal policy may back off, it is still going to be stimulative, and we are   June 29-30, 2004 105 of 203          going to be in an accommodative policy stance for some time  So as I think about policy going   forward, I would join those who encourage us to have in mind moving back toward neutral at a   more deliberate pace and in a very systematic fashion  We should move to neutral more quickly   and avoid having to go above neutral later to contain inflation, which I think is now threatening in   light of our easy policies in the past  As far as the statement is concerned, I think we should be very   sparing with our words regarding our likely future policy course  I’d let the economy define what   our future policy will be and not our words today  Thank you     Mr Chairman, conditions in our District reflect much of what I’ve heard so   far around the table today, but I think a couple of developments are worth noting  Our labor   markets have shown further signs of improvement, actually  Employment rose in June for the   fourth straight month  Major hiring announcements stayed at a high level in June and July, and   local labor market surveys indicated an increase in hiring plans for the rest of this year  Layoff   announcements did turn up a little in July but remained lower than the hiring announcements and   were largely confined to our telecommunications firms, which are continuing to cut staff    Manufacturing activity in our region continued to grow solidly in July  Production and new orders   rose further, and employment and hiring continued to expand according to all our survey results    Firms remain highly optimistic about future activity and still plan moderate increases in hiring and   capital spending  Consumer spending is flat in our area, as others have noted for their regions    Energy activity continued to expand in response obviously to the price environment  As before,   August 10, 2004 35 of 103          though, some of the individuals we talked with on the producer side say that they are being   constrained to some degree by shortages of labor and equipment and difficulty in obtaining permits   for some of the drilling activities they would like to pursue   I would say that on the national level the question we are struggling with is whether this   recent news is a pause or a more systemic issue  I am unable to tell that for sure, but I’m inclined to   suggest that it’s a pause and not something fundamental  But given the uncertainties around energy,   I think continued high or rising energy prices pose some risks on that front  One thing that does   concern me is that, based on my conversations with some of our business people—even those in the   manufacturing sector—the news that has come out recently has surprised them as well  So they are   rethinking how they are looking at the situation going forward, and that is a bit of an issue for us    But I do believe that the economy is fundamentally strong, and I think our current monetary policy   stance is consistent with that moving forward, as is fiscal policy as well  So I think that the lull is   temporary and that we will see activity continue to increase through the remainder of this year    Thank you     Mr Chairman, I think we should move toward neutral, and I find the   rationale for doing so as stated here pretty good, so I’m fine with that  I would like to leave in the   sentence about energy prices because energy is the elephant in the room and I think we should   acknowledge it  And I don’t think we need to modify the statement any further than that  Thank   you     Just to your point on the exchange rate and why we may need to think   about this  It strikes me that, because of external demand and our own situation, we have a more   September 21, 2004 36 of 100          accommodative policy than we normally might because of trying to keep domestic demand up,   and the result is that it also keeps our demand for imports very high  That means that we as a   country accumulate more debt, and as we look down the road, we continue to see this already   very large current account deficit growing further  Therefore, we have a greater likelihood of a   crisis later as we try to maintain our own domestic demand, given that the rest of the world isn’t   helping us along  It may be time to think, as you are saying here, about the external side in terms   of the exchange rate We can’t predict the future; I recognize that  But all the indications are that   this problem is building and that the likelihood of this future crisis is building  Because of our   need to maintain strong domestic demand, we continue to put liquidity out there, and the world   continues to accumulate our debt  This future problem is building in part because of our policy   and the fact that we are dealing with one policy instrument right now      That’s why I’m saying, with regard to the Chairman’s point, that we may   have to look at the exchange rate side or at least think about it  I believe it is perhaps becoming   more critical that we do so     Mr Chairman, on the national outlook, our view is similar to the   Greenbook’s in that we think the expansion has regained some of its traction and will continue as   we move forward  Discussions with business contacts throughout our District tend to support   this notion as well  For example, most retailers that we’ve contacted in the last few weeks   reported that sales have improved in August over earlier in the summer  In addition, the chair of   our board, whose firm is in the manufacturing area on a worldwide basis, reported to us just last   week that capital spending budgets finally seem to have been, to use his word, “unleashed”    Another director noted that low interest rates and available capital have enabled firms to find   capital for acquisition and expansion fairly readily  In our most recent survey of all thirty of our   head office and branch directors, about two-thirds of those who expressed an opinion about the   next six months—and that was most of them—thought conditions would improve, while about a   third thought the economy would just, in their words, “muddle along”  Finally, District hirings   continue to exceed layoffs and by a fair margin now  The ratio of announced planned hirings to   September 21, 2004 59 of 100          planned layoffs was 2½ to 1 in the third quarter, greatly surpassing the previous high of 1¼ to 1   earlier in the year   Based on recent evidence like this and on forecasts by our staff, I believe the most likely   outcome is continued good growth in the 3½ to 4 percent range, as suggested by others  The   uncertainty seems to center on whether hiring will pick up, and I agree that the most likely   outcome is that it will strengthen as we move through the remainder of this year and into next   year  On the inflation outlook, it appears that the Committee and others were correct in that the   spring increases were temporary and price inflation has settled back to more-modest levels  In   that environment, my judgment is that what I would describe as our careful, systematic   movement toward a more neutral fed funds rate is serving us well  Thank you      I support the recommendation and the press release     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Let me first talk a little about the region, which   has continued to show expansion since our last meeting  Despite some tentativeness on the part of   businesses and consumers that I think was tied to the election, we’re seeing some rather positive   developments  Consumer spending edged up a bit during this recent period  Auto manufacturing,   as I’ve heard others say, was a little slow  That was driven very much by whether or not incentives   were being offered; as they were pulled off, sales have gone down  So I suspect sales incentives   will come back as we move through the rest of this year  Energy activity in our region has risen   November 10, 2004 39 of 107    rather briskly with the higher oil prices and especially the higher natural gas prices; we’ve seen a lot   of activity develop as a result of that   As I mentioned, many of our contacts said that the preoccupation with the election was   causing businesses and consumers both to do some postponing  With that behind us, they really do   expect some pickup in activity  I would also mention that on the manufacturing side we have seen   some pretty positive developments continue across our region, particularly in support of small   manufacturing  That was very encouraging to us  We’ve seen indications from a number of   businesses that they are more forward-looking than I’ve ever seen in terms of what they’re prepared   to do and their expectations for increased business  There is, I think, a change in attitude   developing that is worth noting   Looking at the national level going forward, we judge that the continued accommodative   stance of monetary policy and some of the easing of headwinds created by energy prices should   now contribute to a healthy pace of economic growth in 2005 and 2006  Specifically, it appears as   though growth will remain above trend, in the 3½ to 4 percent range, as others have noted  While I   do not want to make too much of one data release, I agree with the point others have made that the   payroll numbers do provide some evidence of a significantly more positive forecast than we might   otherwise have been thinking about  I would also note that, with this kind of growth continuing,   there are some indications that prices could move up maybe a tenth or two in the first part of next   year  We will see, of course   There are some upside as well as downside risks that I think we have to keep in mind  First   of all, on the upside, I think the removal of some of the uncertainty that has been in the market is a   very important factor going forward  As for the labor markets, I think their strength is evident in   more than just this last report  If we look at the revisions that were made to the data for previous   months, we’re now talking of average monthly increases of about 190,000 over the last four   November 10, 2004 40 of 107    months, and in my view that’s a pretty healthy pace  If it continues, that may point to a more   optimistic outlook for consumer spending as we move forward  Also, with the adjustments in the   dollar, we may see some reduction in our current account deficit, which will be less of a drag on the   GDP numbers  As for the downside risks, I think we may see some increase in personal saving  I   believe it will be very modest, but it may be a factor offsetting attitudes toward increased consumer   spending  Finally, while energy prices have been backing off, energy is always a wild card and   could be a player as we move forward  On balance, though, I think the outlook is favorable, which   in my view puts us in a position where we should continue to remove our policy accommodation   and move back toward the neutral stance of policy that we’d like to attain  Thank you     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I agree with your recommendation  I wanted to   say, notwithstanding your comments on productivity, with which I don’t disagree, that the fact is   that the real fed funds rate today is zero  I’d be more inclined to the view that we need to pause if   the real fed funds rate were in fact positive—or to put it another way if the nominal rate were in the   November 10, 2004 80 of 107    2½ to 3 percent range, which is what I think you may be suggesting  So as long as the rate is below   what I would consider a reasonable, neutral rate—and zero fits that criterion—then I don’t think we   should be pausing  That’s not to say that we should move every time we meet next year—I realize   that’s not the case—but I think the rate needs to be at a positive level, as you’re suggesting  In my   view, the discussion at our meeting in February of next year will be important, and I think changing   the language at that point will be important as well     I support early release of the minutes, Mr Chairman  I have for some time    I think it will give a better sense of the Committee’s views and the process of its thinking with   regard to policy, and I believe that will serve the market well     Mr Chairman, let me start briefly with my reaction to the national economy   where I think, as discussed in the Greenbook, growth remains above trend and, barring unexpected   events, is likely to remain above trend for the next couple of years  If this is correct, we will   gradually approach our long-run potential GDP  More specifically, we expect that growth will be   near but slightly below 4 percent this year and next  With trend growth of about 3¼ percent, we   estimate that we approach potential at the rate of about ¾ percentage point per year  This outlook is   similar, as I said, to the Greenbook and to the December Blue Chip consensus forecast as well     Several factors obviously contribute to this; they’ve been mentioned, and I’ll only touch on   them  They include our continued accommodative monetary policy, strong consumer spending that   seems to be continuing, and labor markets that are in better shape than we thought—  December 14, 2004 34 of 118           notwithstanding, as some have commented, the recent claims numbers  Moreover, wealth is higher,   as reflected in the stock market and housing prices  And, of course, oil prices have declined   I think the evidence from our District supports this outlook  Headed into Thanksgiving,   retailers were generally optimistic about the holiday shopping season  Almost all of the mall   managers we contacted just last week said the holiday season had gotten off to a good, though not   spectacular, start, with traffic and sales up several percentage points from a year ago  Travel and   tourism activity have also been very solid, and Rocky Mountain resort owners expect a big increase   in foreign ski visits this winter due to the lower dollar  In addition, manufacturing firms remain   quite optimistic about future activity and plan moderate increases in capital spending and   employment during the first half of next year   Let me briefly mention our agricultural economy, which will enjoy a record-breaking year   in 2004  Farm income is 25 percent above last year’s record high and 50 percent above previous   2004 estimates  With historically high livestock prices, the bulk of the income gains have come   from that sector  In addition, crop production for corn, soybeans, wheat, and so forth, was up 12 to   25 percent this year, with corn and soybean producers posting record years  Even with these large   supplies, prices remain well above their ten-year average  This record farm income has translated   into higher land values  In the Tenth District, ranch land values have soared 10 percent above levels   of a year ago  Non-irrigated cropland values are up 7 percent from a year ago, and irrigated   cropland values are up 5 percent  As a result, equipment sales are also surging  For example, in   October, sales of large equipment ranged anywhere from 25 to 50 percent above year-ago levels    Finally, analysts expect equipment sales to increase in December, as farmers and ranchers take   advantage of purchases to cut their tax bills   December 14, 2004 35 of 118           Turning to the inflation outlook, inflation remains modest, although there are some signs   that it may be rising, as others have noted  Core PCE inflation is 1½ percent over the most recent   twelve-month period, and core CPI inflation is 2 percent  We have seen some increases in core   inflation over the last couple of months  In addition, as others have noted, even though five- to ten-  year inflation compensation remains relatively stable, five-year inflation compensation has   increased  Finally, while oil prices have decreased—a positive—the dollar continues on balance to   depreciate  District manufacturers continue to expect upward pressure on producer prices  For the   twelfth month in a row, a net positive percentage of firms raised output prices; this follows three   straight years of constant or falling output prices  In addition, the future finished goods price index   rose to its second highest reading on record in November, trailing only the peak of April 2004    With sluggish employment growth and increased layoffs, wage pressures do remain slight     These results, on balance, suggest to me at least that we should continue steadily moving the   federal funds rate closer to what we might consider a long-run neutral level  In addition, I would   submit that the risk of higher inflation than in the Greenbook baseline is large enough that we   should be thinking about continuing to raise rates on a systematic basis—and by more than assumed   in the Greenbook  First, the Greenbook forecasts that the output gap will be eliminated by the end   of 2006 and that core PCE inflation will be 1½ percent or just under that, and yet the real fed funds   rate is only 185 percent  Since this is below the Board staff’s medium-run equilibrium fed funds   rate—what I’ll call neutral—we should expect higher inflation beginning in 2006  Second, we   know that all forecasts have error bands, and the Greenbook provides enough information that we   can calculate the probability that the output gap is eliminated in 2005 or early 2006  I would submit   that the probability is large enough that we should be concerned about higher inflation in these   years  And third, the federal funds rate remains below neutral for the entire forecast period  My   December 14, 2004 36 of 118           point is that the output gap is being eliminated and, when this occurs, the risk of inflation, of course,   rises     Therefore, I think we should be moving the federal funds rate at a fairly steady pace toward   the lower bound at least of estimates of neutral—barring any shocks, of course  Once we get close   to what most consider the lower bound of neutral, we can become more cautious at that point and   begin to speak of pauses  I’d submit, however, that we are not yet at that point and that we should   not become overly cautious at this time  Thank you     I support your recommendation    Thank you, Mr Chairman  First of all, I am a firm believer that low and   stable inflation is of paramount importance for an economy to have long-term health  I’ve held that   view for a long time, having experienced some of the effects in our region of an inflationary cycle   and the washout that comes with that   Let me say that I thought these papers on whether we should adopt an explicit price target   were good and very helpful As I read through them, I came to the conclusion that there wasn’t, as   you said, a lot of evidence suggesting that explicit price objectives have a negative effect and that   there was some perhaps weak evidence that they may have helped to anchor long-term inflation   expectations Based on that, I’d be inclined, depending on how the rest of today’s discussion goes,   to support using a range for consumer price inflation as an objective  Given its general acceptance   by the public, I would choose CPI inflation because it’s better known And I would have an   objective somewhere in the range of 1 to 2 percent or 1½ to 2½ percent  I also think the horizon   should be the medium term and that, therefore, the objective should be total CPI  If the horizon were   short, I would agree with Governor Bernanke that the objective should be stated in terms of the core   CPI While somewhat vague, I think a medium-term period would provide the information that   would be important for anchoring long-term inflation expectations  I would also monitor very   closely core inflation and use it to explain deviations of inflation from the target range  I think it can   be very helpful that way   I also agree with the point that an explicit inflation objective might be perceived as unduly   emphasizing one component of our dual mandate, and I think that’s a legitimate concern  I would   think we could avoid this perception by ensuring that we always talk about both objectives in   discussing monetary policy strategy and operations—although we can’t put a target on the growth   side That’s something we need to think about and work through  But I don’t think it should   necessarily inhibit us from going down this path           February 1-2, 2005 21 of 177  Finally, let me mention only briefly how we might go about introducing an explicit   numerical goal  I do not think we need congressional approval, but I’m not the expert on that  I   defer on that to someone who is an expert, but I’d prefer not to go that way   I could accept having the Committee vote each year on a medium-term inflation objective    That would allow us to take into account a changing environment, a changing economy, and   changing dynamics  While this would allow for the possibility that the objective could change,   depending on developments, I doubt that we would change it very significantly or often  I assume   that we’d probably reaffirm the previous year’s objective or modify it slightly based on changing   circumstances  And I think having such an objective would serve us well in terms of keeping us   focused on a primary goal of long-term price stability  I’ll stop with that, Mr Chairman  Thank   you    Thank you, Mr Chairman  For the economy, growth currently remains   above trend and, as we all know, is likely to remain above trend several quarters forward  As a   result, we are systematically approaching long-run potential GDP for the economy  I expect growth   will be near 4 percent this year—above trend There are obvious reasons for this monetary policy   remains accommodative, consumer spending on goods and housing is strong, and business   equipment spending is strong  While fourth-quarter growth was below expectations, final sales to   domestic purchasers were at a robust 43 percent pace  And I think the labor market continues to   improve   Evidence from our District is very much in line with this outlook  Most retailers we   contacted said that holiday sales were moderately higher than a year ago, and many said that sales   were above their plan In addition, many ski resorts in our region reported sharp increases in hotel   occupancy and a near-record volume of ski visits, many from foreigners  Job growth picked up in   December  Hiring announcements since the last FOMC meeting exceeded layoff announcements by   a margin of two to one, and a substantial fraction of small and midsized manufacturers said that they   plan to increase employment in the coming months  District manufacturing continues to expand at a   brisk pace; production, new orders, and employment all rose in December, and firms remained   upbeat about future activity Capital spending plans for 2005 are reported strong   We all know where the price indexes are right now but, looking to the future, I would expect   to see further increases in core inflation With the federal funds rate below the lower bound of most   estimates for the neutral rate, I remain alert to the greater or increasing risk of inflation  In addition,   there are several other reasons to think that this upside risk may be rising  First of all, as others have   said here today, we are hearing more about the return to pricing power  Further, a greater pass-  through of higher commodity prices seems to be occurring  The possibility of continued dollar   depreciation is strong, as is a greater pass-through of higher import prices  And slowing productivity   growth, leading to higher unit labor costs, is on the horizon                          February 1-2, 2005 101 of 177  Evidence from the District supports these observations  For example, the fraction of   businesses reporting labor shortages was 53 percent in January, up significantly from last quarter and   last year As a result, wage pressures in the District have also increased  About 26 percent of the   employers contacted in January said that they had to boost wages more than normal as compared to   17 percent last quarter and 11 percent a year ago In addition, our manufacturing survey showed   evidence of greater pricing power For example, among respondents reporting higher input prices,   the share who also reported higher output prices has risen markedly, from 40 percent in the fourth   quarter of 2003 to 60 percent in the fourth quarter of 2004, the same as before the recession    Similarly, among those who expect to pay higher input prices going forward, those who also expect   to charge higher output prices has risen markedly from 41 to 51 percent   In summary, the outlook for the nation and our region is certainly good  Growth is robust,   and we are hearing increasingly that there is a lot of money looking for opportunity  I would submit   that the risk of higher inflation, therefore, is now large enough that we should at least be thinking   about raising rates more aggressively toward neutral than we have in the past  Thank you    I support it    Mr Chairman, looking at the economy, we expect growth will be in line   with what others have said—in the 4 percent range this year and slightly above 3½ percent next   year With trend growth of about 3¼ percent, obviously the output gap and labor market slack are   diminishing  There are a whole host of reasons for that, which Dave already outlined, and I won’t   repeat them    I will say that from the Tenth District perspective, our information supports this more robust   outlook Most retailers we contacted said that sales were up from last year’s already solid levels  In                          March 22, 2005 28 of 116  addition, travel and tourism continued to improve, as the dollar has helped to increase ski visits and   hotel occupancy in the mountain states  Labor markets remain strong, with hiring announcements   exceeding layoffs by about a 1¼-to-1 ratio since our previous FOMC meeting  And, finally, District   manufacturing continues to expand strongly  Production, new orders, and employment all rose in   February Moreover, firms remain optimistic about future activity and plan moderate increases in   employment and capital spending going forward this year   I’ll make most of my comments on the inflation outlook, because I do have some concern   about that I was struck by David’s point that, as for inflation breaking out, he would put it in terms   of a “not yet” statement  But as I view the outlook, I expect, even with the fed funds rate rising as   we currently are projecting, that inflation will increase and perhaps could accelerate in 2005 and   2006   Here are some reasons for that  First, we have been in an accommodative mode of policy for   an extended period of time now—years, not quarters—with the fed funds rate below most estimates   of neutral over much of that period  Core inflation, by whatever measure you pick—core CPI or   PCE or the market-based core PCE—drifted higher last year  Not only did core inflation drift   higher, it was unexpectedly higher than earlier projections This unexpected increase is notable   because it occurred even though real GDP growth was as expected and the fed funds rate was being   increased If inflation could increase that much last year in the presence of sizable slack and a rising   fed funds rate, I am concerned that, with less slack in the economy this year, we will end up with yet   higher inflation   In addition, a number of indicators suggest continuing inflationary pressures  For example,   we have higher cost pressures resulting from higher commodity prices, which we mentioned, and   from oil prices and the lower dollar  As a result, we also are seeing high PPI inflation and increases                             March 22, 2005 29 of 116  in unit labor costs that may not be dramatic yet, but they are increasing  Wage pressures are   emerging in our District  About a quarter of the employers we contacted said that they’ve had to   raise wages more than normal, particularly for skilled workers   We are also seeing evidence of increased pricing power in the Tenth District, as firms have   more confidence in their ability to raise output prices even without an increase in input costs  For   example, we asked our survey participants a special question about whether their ability to raise   prices had improved since the beginning of just this year  Of 77 responses, more than half said   clearly yes   The final reason I see an upside risk for inflation is that monetary policy does, in fact, remain   accommodative  The federal funds rate is currently below most estimates of the neutral rate  Even   with the Greenbook’s assumptions of tighter policy, the fed funds rate will end the year below or at   the lower end of estimates of the medium-run neutral rate  This poses a significant upside risk to   inflation, because it is likely that much of the slack in the economy will have been eliminated by the   end of the year With output close to potential and core inflation elevated, I think we should aim to   be comfortably within the range of neutral by the end of the year, not at the lower end   Overall, with growth above trend, I am concerned that there is an upside risk to inflation   even with the funds rate path consistent with the projections we are seeing currently I believe we   should begin moving more aggressively to bring the fed funds rate closer to the long-run neutral rate   sooner I would submit that, as long as the funds rate remains significantly below neutral, the risk   that we will need to raise it 50 basis points can be managed  Now, I say that, but I also realize that a   50 basis point increase, while it could be justified, would surprise financial markets  So perhaps we   should begin to signal the market that a more aggressive return to neutral is at least possible  But   rather than tinker with the language in the press announcement, which makes me nervous, I would                                   March 22, 2005 30 of 116  prefer to shorten it and drop any reference to measured pace  After reading the minutes in three   weeks, markets will know that a more aggressive policy is possible  In other words, we don’t have   to provide a long explanation today And in fact, in testimony you gave earlier, I think you dropped   the “measured” language; therefore, I don’t think changing that part of the statement would surprise   the markets at all  Thanks    Mr Chairman, I’m okay with this  I do want to say, though, that your last   comment on the loss function is really a major concern of mine  To the extent that we are too slow   on moving back into the neutral zone, I think the danger is that later on we will have to go higher   faster and the impact on the economy will be more significant at that point  I think we’re at that   point, and that’s why at the May meeting it is so important that we make some hard choices  And I   am worried about that    Mr Chairman, I’ll start off by repeating the obvious  There have been a   couple of surprises since our last FOMC meeting  The economy has lost momentum after the end of   the first quarter, and core inflation has continued to rise The loss of momentum we saw in March in                                 May 3, 2005 47 of 116  the first quarter has led me to join others in marking down my forecast for growth this year to about   3½ percent I expect growth in the second half of this year to be about 3¾ percent and then slow   perhaps back to 3½ percent next year With trend growth of about 3¼ percent, the output gap and   labor market slack should continue to diminish, as we’ve said before     I would agree with those who attribute much of the slowdown to the persistence of higher   energy prices This is especially the case for consumer spending and confidence, as we see it    Higher energy costs have also reduced growth in other countries, and I think that probably has   contributed to some of the worsening in our trade balance   Obviously, we need a little more time and information to determine whether the recent   economic performance reflects temporary factors or is likely to be more permanent  If it is   temporary, then, as energy prices level off or perhaps decline somewhat, I would expect the   fundamental forces of growth to take over—those being monetary policy that, in my opinion,   remains accommodative and financial conditions that are, perhaps, highly accommodative   I’ll digress here by giving you just one anecdote I talked recently to an executive of one of   our major banks that lends across the nation in some of the hot markets  He described a   condominium deal, a fairly large one, where the construction cost was about $100 million  The   developers had $3 million of equity in the project  Those who lent $97 million lent those funds on a   pro forma sale price that finished out at $140 million  So there is a lot of speculation, I think, in   these markets  And that is something that we have to take into account    But I also see that the labor and capital markets that we talk about here are strengthening  So   overall I think the evidence is that the economy will improve  And I would say, from a regional   perspective, that the Tenth District mostly provides support for an improving outlook, though I   acknowledge that there are issues with respect to energy prices For example, consumer spending,                                 May 3, 2005 48 of 116  including travel and tourism, rose solidly in March and early April, and most retailers said sales   were up substantially from a year ago  In addition, housing activity turned up, following a pause in   late 2004 and early 2005 in our region Housing starts and permits rose solidly in March, and home   sales were strong in most of our District’s cities   Still, preliminary data from our manufacturing survey suggest some evidence of a slowdown    In fact, in April the production and shipments indexes both fell  More worrisome, though, was the   large decline in the six-month-ahead production, shipments, and new orders indexes  This bears   watching, since it may suggest a more permanent slowdown than we currently expect    In addition, a number of contacts expressed concerns to us about higher energy prices  For   example, in our April manufacturing survey, some firms said that they were delaying shipments in   order to assure full truckloads and thus save on fuel costs  A few firms also said that they expect to   cut back on production due to high energy costs In addition, some retailers were worried that higher   gasoline prices would eventually take a toll on their sales Of course, for our region, higher energy   prices are positive for some of our District’s states, particularly Oklahoma and Wyoming, where we   see nearly boom conditions   Turning to the inflation outlook, I do expect to see further increases in core inflation, with   core PCE inflation averaging almost 2 percent in 2005 and core CPI inflation averaging 2½ percent,   similar to the Greenbook forecast  However, unlike the Greenbook, I expect core inflation to remain   elevated in 2006 rather than to fall back I take note of the fact that energy price increases may be a   rock in the pond, but I think the substantially accommodative monetary policy we have had is more   like a boulder And it is carrying itself forward, which is what we need to be aware of and alert to   We continue to see increases in core inflation  Whether measured in 3-, 6-, or 12-month   periods, core CPI and core PCE inflation have generally been rising this year Moreover, core                                       May 3, 2005 49 of 116  inflation is now higher than at any time since the second half of 2001  In my opinion it is above   comfortable levels  Measured from six months ago, core CPI inflation is about 2½ percent and core   PCE inflation is above 2 percent Clearly, some of the increase represents temporary factors—such   as the energy prices we keep talking about and the prices of some commodities—and may be   reversed However, I would take note that the pass-through of energy prices to core inflation is   difficult to predict, as we talked about earlier, and may be greater than some suggest  I also believe   that there is more to the inflation story than energy prices  Even if we exclude the two largest   quarterly rates, core CPI inflation over the last four quarters was 2 percent, which is significantly   higher than core inflation over the previous four quarters   I believe some of the increase is the result of our continued accommodative policy  We’ve   seen inflation rise over the last year in the presence of sizable slack and a rising funds rate I’m   concerned that, with less slack in the economy, we will continue to see higher inflation going   forward In addition, maintaining an accommodative monetary policy poses an upside risk to   inflation, with the federal funds rate currently below many estimates of the lower bound of the   neutral rate If we are slow in removing this accommodation, I would be concerned that the increase   in core inflation also might be passed through to higher expected inflation   We’re also seeing some evidence of pricing power in the Tenth District, as manufacturers   continue to raise their output prices to cover what they’ve referred to as rising costs of energy and   other inputs In addition, the share of our Beige Book retail contacts who reported to us that they   were raising prices this time was the highest in the last five years   These are my concerns  The one other thing I would mention relates to our statement  I   would agree with those who would like to abbreviate our statement today  Since people are, in fact,   paying attention to the minutes, I’d rely on them as our communication method  Thank you                                 May 3, 2005 50 of 116   Well, I’m fine with where you’re going on this  I do agree that we ought to   talk about this at a future meeting  I’m more in favor of shortening the statement and just relying on   the minutes  Others have different views But with where we are today, with inertia, I think I’m fine   with your proposal     I may be asking your question over again, Mr Chairman, but I’m looking at   exhibit 6—at the PCE projections and the explanations for why core PCE is increasing  I guess   what you’re saying is that these are the reasons why  Then, going back to your discussion of labor   costs, there’s no discussion of productivity  So, are you more or less dismissing that as a factor in   terms of having a follow-through and pushing up core PCE?  Are you saying that labor is not that   significant a factor?  The issue of productivity coming down seems to me to be more relevant than   suggested here    Not compensation and not the possibility of productivity coming down and   being less able to absorb that factor in the future?     Part of what leaves me uneasy is that in the Greenbook the last several   times we have recognized that PCE inflation has been higher than we thought it would be and we   are projecting it to turn back down again  In this sense, there’s a continuation of the view that these   things are temporary and that they will back off at some point     Thank you, Mr Chairman  First of all, our view regarding the national   economy is basically similar to others I have heard here  We agree with the consensus of GDP   growth running about 3½ percent, slightly over our potential rate  And we see that going forward   through the rest of this year and into next year   I also would say that the anecdotal evidence coming from our region is very consistent with   this above-trend growth rate  Consumer spending continues to grow solidly, with retailers reporting   that sales were generally above plan and higher than a year ago through the first and second                     June 29-30, 2005 120 of 234  quarters  Tourism continues to expand briskly, boosting occupancy rates at hotels and resorts in our   region And energy activity remains high   One of the interesting anecdotes arose during a recent visit I made to the Cessna plant in   Wichita, which is booming right now  They have back orders for their jets—general aviation   aircraft—running well into 2007, with prices running from a mere $2½ million to a little better than   $20 million for their Citation 10, which flies at 08 mach  And the demand is incredible  So the   general economic environment reflected in these parts of our region really is consistent with a   strong growth rate going forward     On the national inflation outlook, I understand the arguments given today for why inflation   should continue to ease off  For that to occur, it is critical in my view that we continue to move   policy out of its current accommodative stance  If we don’t, I think we are stimulating demand—I   think it’s reflected in some of the other comments here and in some of the anecdotes that I’ve   pointed out—and I think we will have future upward adjustments in inflation as we move forward    So I think it is critical that we get ourselves closer to that neutral zone that we talk about, which no   one can pinpoint with certainty but which is probably somewhere between 3½ and 4½ percent  I’ll   leave it at that    Yes, I’m fine with your proposal    Yes, I have just a quick question  We’ve talked a great deal about the   intricacies of measuring the various price indexes—the PCE or whatever  I want to clarify,   though, that—regardless of which index one is looking at and adjusting—the trend line on   inflation is up over the last 12 to 18 months  Even with these adjustments, you still have a trend   line that is up, which I think is an important consideration    It’s higher than we thought, but not getting higher?     Mr Chairman, let me start with some thoughts on the national economy   I do expect growth in real GDP to average about 3¾ percent this year and 3½ percent next year    While this is somewhat slower than last year, it remains above trend  And the monetary policy   and financial conditions currently in place I think are poised to support continued above-trend   growth With growth above trend, the output gap and labor market slack will further diminish    In fact, the economy appears to be at or near full employment now, which is all the more reason   to have the federal funds rate above its current level    I’d like to turn for a bit to developments in our region, because the evidence from the   Tenth District is consistent with this strong outlook  For example, economic growth has   strengthened rather noticeably since our last meeting  Employment continued to expand, and in   the intermeeting period businesses announced substantially more new hires than layoffs in our   region Consumer spending also increased strongly, as retailers posted further gains, auto sales                                  August 9, 2005 58 of 110  rebounded, and tourist activity showed no effect that we could notice from higher gasoline   prices   In addition, energy held steady in terms of high levels of demand  Drilling has slowed in   the mature oil and gas fields of Oklahoma but has continued to grow strongly in newer fields in   the Rocky Mountain region Drilling in those areas continued to be constrained by a shortage of   equipment and labor  As a result—and I’ll repeat what Richard said—one Denver-based energy   company has ordered two Chinese rigs and rig crews for delivery this fall as well as several   additional rigs for the coming couple of years   While manufacturing activity expanded at a slower pace than in the spring, most firms   are optimistic about future sales and plan more hiring and investment to meet the increased   demand  A wide range of District businesses also reported sharply improved earnings due to   strong revenue growth systematically in our region  The only negative news on this level was   that commercial real estate markets continued to show only modest improvement and that   inventories of unsold homes were up noticeably in some of our cities   I think it is worth noting that a sizable area of extreme drought has developed throughout   the central Corn Belt states The drought affects much of Missouri and Illinois and parts of   Wisconsin and Indiana  Markets currently expect the nation’s corn crop to drop 10 percent and   the soybean crop to drop 4 percent As a result, corn and soybean prices have both risen about   13 percent since their planting  The USDA crop report that will come out later this week, on   August 12th, could trigger a further rally in prices if drought damage is greater than the market   currently expects   Turning to inflation, I think it is worth noting that core PCE inflation, as we discussed   quite extensively earlier, is now averaging about 2¼ percent this year and is expected to remain                                  August 9, 2005 59 of 110  at that pace next year While we continue to talk about this as being moderate, I think it is   important to recognize that it represents a continued upward adjustment of the inflation outlook   and is at the higher end of what most of us have indicated we are comfortable with  I also   remain concerned about the upward pressure on inflation  First, there is an upside risk from   higher energy prices and dollar depreciation  In addition, the real fed funds rate, using the core   PCE inflation, is only 12 percent  These factors, I think, pose an upside risk to inflation,   especially when combined with growth that remains above trend and an output gap that is small   and approaching zero   I believe we are now at a point where the upside risk to the economy is greater than the   downside risk  And while we appear committed to moving only 25 basis points today, and I   think the market would be surprised if we did otherwise, we ought to at least seriously consider   eliminating any reference to “measured pace” in our statement  To me it was noticeable in   listening to David today that, as we talk about the economy, potential is less than we expected,   demand is greater than expected, inflation is greater than we anticipated, and monetary policy is   probably 100 basis points below what most people think it should be  In my view, it’s time to   think about changing our statement  Thank you    Mr Chairman, I think we’re a little behind the curve  But I don’t see a   better solution in terms of going forward, so I support your recommendation    Thank you, Mr Chairman  There has been a lot of discussion on the   national economy and Katrina, and I don’t think I’ll repeat that  But I would say that I am in   agreement with the scenario the Greenbook has outlined here; we do expect a temporary   slowdown in the economy this year and then a pickup next year and beyond  And I think the   evidence from our region is consistent with that outlook                       September 20, 2005 66 of 117  Economic growth in the District remains strong, although businesses have expressed   some concern over the impact of Katrina on the regional economy  At the end of August,   though, employment was still growing solidly  Retailers reported further growth in sales; tourist   activity continued to show little effect from higher gasoline prices at that time; and   manufacturing activity had grown pretty solidly over the summer   In a special survey that we conducted following Katrina, a wide range of contacts said   that the disaster would have some negative effect on their businesses in terms of costs and the   availability of supplies  And a small percentage actually expected some positive effects from it   More specifically, a contact at a major railroad coming out of our District from Kansas City told   me that they were able to get their operations along the Gulf Coast back in order within just a   few days of Katrina and were back moving materials across that area at almost normal levels    So, there has been a fairly strong reaction in terms of bringing things back on line after Katrina   While the impacts of Katrina remain uncertain, I would say that analysts in the farm   sector are more optimistic than they were just a week ago, for example  The impact on the   transportation system, as I just mentioned, appears to be less than initially feared  Terminal   facilities are now reporting limited damage to physical infrastructure, and the unloading of   barges and loading of ocean-going vessels appear to be starting again  As a result, the   hurricane’s impact on agriculture will be primarily through higher fuel prices  Higher diesel and   natural gas prices have a large impact on crop production costs, as they boost the cost of   operating machinery, drying grain, fertilizers, and so forth  So overall I think activity in our   District will continue strong Katrina will have some impact on the region but not a major or   long-lasting one for the most part                           September 20, 2005 67 of 117  Turning to the inflation outlook, my concerns there have not changed since our last   meeting  Core inflation is higher than I would prefer, although it still is in the 2 percent plus   range Core CPI inflation, for example, is up 22 percent in August from a year ago, and other   measures of underlying CPI inflation are, in fact, higher and moving slowly up  In addition, I   believe the upside risks to inflation have increased, and I think we need to be aware of that and   sensitive to it   In my view, a pause now would in fact be more than a pause, because as others said—in   particular President Santomero—in this environment the data are going to come in weaker than   we would otherwise expect  So a pause now would be hard to reverse until sometime next year   The other point, which others also have noted, is that fundamentally monetary policy remains   accommodative for now  We have been removing accommodation but policy is still   accommodative, and I think we need to keep that in mind  Therefore, I think we should continue   on that path as we move forward from this point  I would agree, though, since we have been   removing accommodation for a while, that at some point here in the next few meetings we   should be talking about changing the language and about how close we are to neutral on the   funds rate I think that will be an important and interesting discussion for us  However, for the   time being, I think we should stay on our course and remove accommodation at the pace we have   been doing in recent months  Thank you    Mr Chairman, I support your recommendation  And having listened to   your comments, I would like to invoke the central banker’s prayer from Jackson Hole this year    It says, “Lord, if there be shocks, let them be varied and preferably moderate ones so that we can   stress test our systems”  [Laughter]     Mr Chairman, thank you  My views on the national outlook remain pretty   much unchanged from the last meeting  I think growth will be somewhat slower in the second half   of this year and then stronger next year due to the reconstruction activity  The rise in energy prices   will have a dampening effect on growth to some degree  Nonetheless, the resilience that the US   economy has so far experienced following the hurricanes suggests that real GDP will grow at above   trend, at least over the near-term forecast period  Several other factors are consistent with that    Financial conditions remain supportive; fiscal policy is stimulative; and as I’ve noted and many   have already mentioned here today, there is a momentum in the economy   Evidence from the Tenth District is consistent with this outlook  District manufacturing   activity continues to expand at a solid pace, and capital spending plans at District factories have   rebounded, after dipping slightly following the hurricanes  As a further sign of solid business   confidence, hiring announcements for District businesses have exceeded layoff announcements by a   wide margin since the last meeting   On the negative side, though, higher energy prices have eroded consumer confidence in our   region as well as nationally, leading to somewhat slower consumer spending  For example, retailers   contacted in the first half of October reported sales were generally unchanged from a year ago, a   marked change from the summer when many stores were reporting solid year-over-year growth in                                         November 1, 2005 53 of 114  sales Homes in some parts of our District have been taking a little longer to sell, causing some   builders to lower their prices or at least increase the incentives around the sales efforts   Turning to inflation, let me talk a little bit about evidence from our District, because we are   seeing further inflationary pressures  Wage pressures, while still modest, are beginning to show   through Manufacturers are reporting sharply higher costs for natural gas and petroleum-based raw   materials  Some of our manufacturers are also reporting increased costs of building materials, such   as steel and lumber, as a result of the reconstruction effort elsewhere  But adding to this, District   manufacturers are finding it somewhat easier, as others have noted, to pass their higher costs on to   customers  For example, in the special question we asked this month, 30 percent of the firms said   that their pricing power had increased over the last three months, but only 14 percent said their   pricing power had decreased  Retailers have also been showing somewhat greater determination to   raise prices to cover their higher costs, although the retail price increases have been mostly modest   so far   With this said, I want to tell Dave that I think today’s report on the Greenbook and the   discussion have been very, very helpful  It’s beginning to redirect the discussion from one of a clear   position of removing accommodation to a discussion of the correct range for the fed funds rate and   where it should fall if we are to maintain stable prices and sustainable growth   Obviously, I share with others here the view that inflation is currently the main concern    Energy is an obvious pressure, there is strong momentum in much of the economy, and there are   some signs of changing inflationary expectations  I think this is something we have to be alert to    But since our policy actions today have their final effects months in the future, I think it’s also   important that we begin to address inflation and whether the rise is transitory because of the energy   effect, or whether we are, in fact, seeing some inflationary pressures that will become embedded                                             November 1, 2005 54 of 114  going forward  If it is transitory, then the question is, I think legitimately, where should we stop?   What is the right range?  Is it near where we are now or should it go higher?   For now, my own views are that we should be moving the funds rate somewhat higher, as   others have suggested, and that this perhaps would be a reasonable place to stop  What exactly is   the appropriate area, I think, should be a continued focus of this Committee’s discussions in the   meetings ahead  I would also share the sentiment that we need to carefully rethink the FOMC   statement coming out of these meetings  I think it is becoming badly out of date and, as a result,   may lose credibility  So now is the time to start a serious discussion about changing it  I welcome   Janet’s comments and others here today Thank you     I agree with what you are proposing     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’d describe the outlook for the US economy as   solid, as the Greenbook has described it  Obviously, several factors contribute to this, including the   forward momentum that’s in the economy, the lagged effects of past monetary accommodation   (which we’ve talked about in the past), very supportive financial conditions, and stimulative fiscal   policy   I would say that the evidence from the Tenth District is consistent with this broader outlook as   well, but we also are seeing some slowing in certain areas  Energy activity in our area continues to   expand at a very substantial pace  There is still a shortage of workers to support some of the   expansion that’s being sought  Manufacturers remain upbeat about future activity and plan increases   in capital spending over the next six months  In addition, consumer spending, after dropping   following the hurricanes, has rebounded solidly in our region  However, there is the point that David   mentioned about housing activity, which does appear to be leveling off in our region  And while   manufacturing activity continues to expand, it is at a somewhat slower pace  I would make note of   the fact that we also are being affected by some of the GM issues, since GM is closing its plant in   Oklahoma City and that will idle about 2,400 workers   Turning to the inflation outlook, I expect core CPI inflation to be in the area of 23 percent   next year, as higher energy prices pass through to higher overall core inflation and as the effects of our   past accommodative policy show through  However, I expect that the increases may be temporary, as   productivity growth remains strong and as energy prices recede from where they have been, if that   continues Nevertheless, I still would expect the inflation number to be in the 2 percent or slightly   higher range                                   December 13, 2005 30 of 100  But that said, I think there continues to be a good case for further tightening at today’s   meeting  Beyond that, I would say it is less certain, as Michael said, and I think in our statement the   matter should be couched in the near term  And I’ll stop there as well  Thank you     Mr Chairman, I support your recommendation, and I guess I can go with the   language  The one thing that your comments raised in my mind relates to row 3, the rationale part of   the statement, where it talks about possible increases in resource utilization  I wonder if we shouldn’t   have a statement that talks about the carry-on effects of past accommodative policy because that’s   what you’re really talking about when you get into asset value issues  I’m not saying we have to do   that, but that came to my mind as I listened to your comments  Other than that, I’m fine with your   proposal     Right  I don’t disagree with you  That’s the only thing that occurred to me,   but I’m fine with your proposal  I think we need to keep going     Mr Chairman, in thinking about the status of the US economy and the   appropriate funds rate target at this meeting, I would start by suggesting that, in my judgment at   least, the current funds rate is probably within the neutral range  Therefore, we should be mindful   of not going too far, especially when it would appear that growth is slowing to trend  The most   compelling reason for considering the move now is the continued drift upward in core inflation, but   even in this case, I think we need to be especially aware of the past increases in the funds rate  We   have yet to see their full effects on inflation   The fourth-quarter growth was surprising; but at this point, as others have said, it does not   yet alter our long-term outlook  Like the staff, however, I revised upward my 2006 forecast   ¼ percentage point and now expect that growth will be about 3¾ percent in 2006, about   ½ percentage point above trend, and will return to trend in 2007  Turning to the inflation outlook, I   expect core CPI inflation to be about 2½ percent this year, as higher energy prices are passed   through to higher overall and core inflation  However, it is reasonable to expect that the increase   will be temporary, as others have said, with core inflation likely to fall back to 2¼ percent in 2007    The reasons for this pattern have a familiar ring  Greater-than-trend growth reflects the lagged   effects of past monetary accommodation and generally supportive financial conditions, whereas the   prospective slowing growth reflects the removal of monetary accommodation and, in this instance,   higher energy prices   Evidence from our District is consistent with an outlook of strong but slowing growth as   well  Manufacturing production and new orders rose solidly  Expectations for future production   remained high, and expectations for future orders actually surged  Hiring plans also rose strongly in   December and January  However, for the District as a whole, hiring announcements were only   January 31, 2006 49 of 106    slightly greater than layoff announcements  Finally, housing showed signs of leveling off, and   consumer spending was solid, though not spectacular, during the holiday season  In fact, a number   of our contacts said their holiday sales were below plan  Just quickly in the farm sector, there are   concerns being voiced for 2006 following a generally good year in 2005, and they were mostly that   drought may be reemerging in the District   Wage pressures in the District remain mostly subdued, and increases in raw material costs   actually slowed somewhat  However, manufacturers continued to raise output prices in response to   past increases in input costs, and a substantial number said they were raising wages more than   normal for certain types of workers in short supply  Reports of retail prices said that increases were   down somewhat from the last meeting but still higher than they were just last summer   Let me turn just briefly to the risks  I would submit that inflation risks are on the upside and   output risks have become more on the downside recently, not exactly the kinds of risk that are   friendly from a policy perspective  The outlook for core inflation is 2¼ to 2½ percent  This is   higher than I would prefer  Moreover, the potential for even higher energy prices makes core   inflation more likely to be higher rather than lower over the next several months  But at the same   time, the risks to output are on the downside  First, forward momentum has certainly diminished    For example, real GDP grew about 26 percent during the last half of 2005, decidedly below trend    In addition, while the fourth-quarter slowdown was probably temporary, it could also be signaling a   more fundamental slowdown  Finally, a possible increase in the term premium poses downside   risks to growth  You know the term premium is far below the historical average  If the decline   reverses faster than expected, both would be significantly weaker as shown by the Greenbook   alternative scenario  As I see things then falling out, the choices are obviously difficult, but I think   that the inflation risk for the time-being is the greater risk, and therefore I would be inclined to move   January 31, 2006 50 of 106    at this meeting  But we should have the odds no greater than 50-50 that more upward changes are   likely in the fed funds rate at the next meeting   And finally, Mr Chairman, although I have not served as long with you as some others   around this table, I have served among the longest with you, and I would like you to know it has   been a real privilege     Yes, Mr Chairman, I agree with your proposal  I’m very pleased with   taking the word “well” out just because I think the statement should be giving the market 50–50   odds rather than something greater than that as we look forward  And we are data dependent  So I   really prefer that  And I agree with postponing the discussion on procedure for the next meeting    There’s much to be done, and I think in the transition we need to wait until then
