  They are two separate presentations, but they are on the same topic      Yes     My presentation is entitled “Monetary Policy Inertia,” and I  will be referring to a handout that was distributed  Based on monetary policy rules  estimated from quarterly data, many economists hold the view that the Fed adjusts  monetary policy at a very sluggish pace, specifically, that it distributes desired   January 28-29, 2003 17 of 195    changes in the funds rate over several quarters—a behavior that is often termed  “monetary policy inertia”  I will argue, instead, that there is essentially no policy  inertia at a quarterly frequency and that, in fact, the funds rate typically is adjusted  fairly promptly to economic developments—within a single quarter anyway  In large  part, my argument is based on evidence of a very limited ability of financial markets  (for example, Eurodollar futures or fed funds futures) to forecast the next few  quarterly changes in the funds rate  Such evidence is informative about policy inertia  because any partial policy adjustment obviously means that there is some remaining  portion of the policy action that is postponed to the future and is thus predictable   Therefore, the absence of funds rate predictability implies the absence of significant  partial adjustment by the Fed     Before I flesh out this argument, however, let me start on page 1 of the handout   and delineate two types of monetary policy inertia  These two types of inertia are  often confused in the literature, with discussion of one type often mistakenly applied  to the other; however, the two types of policy inertia operate at very different  horizons  First, there is very short-term policy inertia or interest rate smoothing that I  think does exist, but I won’t be discussing it in detail today  This short-term or week- to-week partial adjustment of the funds rate involves, for example, cutting the funds  rate by two 25 basis point moves in fairly quick succession, rather than reducing the  funds rate just once by 50 basis points  This type of gradualism or interest rate  smoothing was more prevalent in the past, when intermeeting moves were more  frequent, though it still goes on to some extent—perhaps induced by concerns of  financial market fragility  In any case, this short-term policy inertia is essentially  unrelated to the quarterly policy inertia that is relevant for most macroeconomic  discussions—including my own     Quarterly policy inertia is defined as the slow partial adjustment of the federal   funds rate on a quarter-to-quarter basis  For example, if the Fed knew it wanted to  increase the funds rate by 1 percentage point, it actually would raise the rate only  about 20 or 25 basis points per quarter for the next few quarters  It is this type of  inertia that I find suspect  The apparent evidence supporting quarterly policy inertia  is summarized on the second page of my handout  This evidence is based on  estimates of monetary policy rules or reaction functions—that is, estimated equations  that attempt to model Fed behavior  These estimated equations usually take a  standard partial-adjustment form, where the current funds rate is set as a weighted  average of last quarter’s actual funds rate and the current quarter’s desired rate  This  partial adjustment form is displayed as the first equation on page 2  The parameter ρ  is the weight on last quarter’s funds rate, and 1-ρ is the weight on the current desired  level   A high ρ means that the funds rate will be adjusted very slowly to its desired  level  Based on quarterly data, estimates of ρ are typically around 75, which puts a  ¾ weight on the lagged rate and a ¼ weight on the desired rate  Thus, these empirical  rules imply a very slow speed of adjustment of the policy rate—specifically, the Fed  would change the funds rate only 25 percent each quarter toward its desired level   This sluggish adjustment of the funds rate over several quarters is widely interpreted  as evidence of “interest rate smoothing” or “monetary policy inertia”     January 28-29, 2003 18 of 195      For example, before each FOMC meeting, the financial indicators packet that is   distributed contains two estimated monetary policy rules  one with and one without  quarterly policy inertia  Both rules set the desired funds rate according to the Taylor  rule, which is displayed as the second equation  In the Taylor rule, the desired level  of the funds rate is based on current readings for the output gap and inflation rate   The α and β parameters calibrate the policy response to these determinants  The  funds rate recommendations from these two rules are shown in the chart at the bottom  of page 2  The solid line shows the actual path of the funds rate as a quarterly  average  The dashed line shows the estimated rule with no inertia—so ρ = 0  The  dotted line shows the rule with inertia—where ρ is estimated by the Board staff to  be 75  The Taylor rule without inertia (the dashed line) fits the actual funds rate  fairly well, but there are some large persistent deviations  Notable deviations include  1992 and 1993, when the actual rate was held below the rule; 1996, when the rate was  pushed above the rule; and 1999 and 2002, when again the funds rate fell below the  rule  The nature of these deviations is a key element in understanding the evidence  for policy inertia  The Taylor rule with inertia (the dotted line) largely eliminates  these deviations and matches the historical path of the funds rate much more closely   That is, the lagged funds rate in this estimated equation is statistically significant   Although this type of econometric evidence appears convincing, it is valid only if the  equation is specified correctly  If the desired funds rate also depends on persistent  factors other than the current output and inflation in the Taylor rule, then such a  misspecification could result in a spurious finding of partial adjustment   Accordingly, based only on these types of policy rule estimates, it is very difficult to  distinguish between whether the Fed’s adjustment is sluggish or whether the Fed  generally follows the Taylor rule with no policy inertia but sometimes deviates from  the rule for several quarters at a time in response to other factors     I will discuss the nature of these persistent deviations in a minute, but first—on   page 3—I want to provide some evidence against policy inertia from a different  source  This evidence is based on a key implication of policy inertia—namely, that  the presence of inertia should imply predictive information in financial markets about  the future path of the funds rate  Intuitively, if the funds rate typically is adjusted  25 percent toward its desired target in a given quarter, there’s a remaining 75 percent  of the adjustment that should be expected to occur in future quarters  In a wide  variety of settings, such delayed policy adjustment ensures forecastable future  variation in the funds rate  Assuming that financial markets understand the inertial  nature of policy, they should anticipate the future partial adjustment of the funds rate   In this case, a regression of actual changes in the funds rate on predicted changes  should yield a good explanatory fit and a fairly high R²  In fact, researchers have  found the opposite  They have estimated interest rate forecasting regressions and,  using financial market expectations, have found little predictive information beyond a  few months  For example, Eurodollar futures have essentially no ability to predict the  quarterly change in the funds rate three quarters ahead  The R² of such a regression is  zero       January 28-29, 2003 19 of 195    This lack of predictive ability is well illustrated by the most recent episode of  easing  The chart at the bottom of the page gives the actual funds rate target and  various expected funds rate paths as of the middle of each quarter based on fed funds  futures  Under quarterly policy inertia, the long sequence of target changes in the  same direction in 2001 would be viewed as a set of gradual partial adjustments to a  low desired rate However, although the funds rate gradually fell in 2001, market  participants actually anticipated few of these declines at a six-to-nine-month horizon,  as they would have if policy inertia were in place  Instead, markets assumed at each  point in time that the Fed had adjusted the funds rate down to just about where it  wanted the funds rate to remain based on current information available  Under this  interpretation, the long sequence of declines is the result of a series of fairly prompt  responses to new information that turned progressively more pessimistic  That is, the  presence of quarterly partial adjustment or policy inertia is contradicted by the lack of  the forecastability of changes in the funds rate     Turning to page 4, I will reconcile the evidence for and against quarterly policy   inertia  As I said, the persistent deviations of the actual rate from the Taylor rule  without inertia are key to understanding what is going on  Under policy inertia, these  persistent deviations are explained as sluggish responses to output and inflation, but  that interpretation is inconsistent with the lack of funds rate predictability  An  alternative explanation is that the Taylor rule is an incomplete description of Fed  policymaking and that the Fed responds to other persistent variables besides current  output and inflation  Under this interpretation, the Fed does not exhibit quarterly  policy inertia, but it responds promptly to a variety of developments that unfold over  time     What would cause such persistent deviations from the Taylor rule?  Well, in John   Taylor’s original analysis, he noted that occasional deviations from his rule were  appropriate responses to special circumstances  Two such special circumstances are  noted at the bottom of page 4  The deviations in 1992 and 1993 can be interpreted as  the Fed’s response to a disruption in the flow of credit, in which the funds rate was  kept lower than might be expected given the macroeconomic context because of  severe financial headwinds  The 1992-93 episode is better described as a persistent  “credit crunch” deviation from the Taylor rule than as a sluggish partial adjustment to  a known desired rate  In terms of the Taylor rule, the disruption of credit supply can  be treated as a temporary fall in the equilibrium real rate, to which the Fed responds  by lowering the funds rate (relative to readings on output and inflation)  Similarly, in  1998 and 1999, a worldwide financial crisis following the Russian default and  devaluation appeared to play a large role in lowering rates—again relative to what the  Taylor rule would have recommended  Expectations also can play an important role  in tempering the policy response to current readings on output and inflation  Indeed,  some have suggested that expectations of future inflation—and, in particular, inflation  scares in the bond market—are an important consideration for policy     Finally, on page 5, I highlight two questions that are in some sense two sides of   the same coin  The first question is, How should we think about analyzing or   January 28-29, 2003 20 of 195    modeling recent Fed behavior?  The second question is, To what extent should actual  Fed behavior conform to our models of optimal monetary policy?  Let me start with  the first question  In modeling the Fed’s decisionmaking process, I argue that the  Taylor rule is an incomplete description of Fed behavior  However, adding partial  adjustment to the policy rule is not a solution; instead, in my opinion, partial  adjustment adds another layer of misspecification that substitutes for a clearer  understanding of the policy process  Of course, more research is required to  characterize the full set of influences and determinants of policy beyond those  contained in the Taylor rule       A closely related question focuses on modeling the underlying motives of   policy—more specifically, what kind of loss function should represent Fed behavior?   Currently, the policymaker “perfect foresight” path in the Bluebook uses a loss  function that assumes the Fed would be equally displeased with any of the following  (1) an unemployment rate 1 percentage point above the natural rate; (2) an inflation  rate 1 percentage point above target; or (3) a 100 basis point decrease in the quarterly  average funds rate  These equal weights place an implausibly high penalty on funds  rate variability  However, without a substantial funds rate volatility penalty, the  constructed optimal policy path does not match the recent historical path of the funds  rate, and this is true across a variety of models  In my opinion, the high funds rate  volatility penalty may be another misspecification that is compensating for some  unknown flaw in our calculations of optimal policy  In essence, if policy over the  past two decades has been close to optimal, then an important element is missing  from the current specifications used by economists to construct optimal monetary  policy      An alternative possibility is that our economic models—without interest rate   smoothing in the loss function—are basically correct in finding that under an optimal  policy the Fed should be more aggressive in reacting to economic news than it has  been  This suggests a second question  Should the Fed deviate from its historical  behavior and become more aggressive in changing the funds rate?  The analysis  above suggests that the Fed has not been sluggish in reacting to economic  developments  It has likely set the funds rate equal to its desired rate in each quarter   However, questions remain about whether the desired rate should react more  forcefully to economic news  Indeed, researchers typically find that the parameters of  an optimal Taylor rule—that is, the α and β shown on page 2—are much larger than  the estimated parameters of a historical Taylor rule  Thus our models, even after  trying to take into account various types of uncertainty, recommend much more  vigorous policy responses  This raises the question, Has monetary policy been too  timid in its responses to economic developments?  I personally remain less than  convinced that our models capture all the important factors influencing policy       In terms of policy rule estimates, the view in the literature very   often is that there was a structural break in the 1980s  So policy rules in the 1970s are   considered—      The statistics generally indicate a break some time in the 1980s in   terms of the policy rule estimates  There appears to be a different behavior in the 1970s than in   the 1990s if you regress the funds rate on the output gap and inflation  For example, the   coefficients on inflation—that is, the response to inflation—don’t seem as large     I think the assumption is that there is a learning curve  Although   very often the other equations in the model appear stable, at least to a first approximation, the   interest rate equation—the equation that summarizes monetary policy or Fed behavior—appears   less stable over time  I believe the conventional view is that there was a learning curve and that   policy behavior did change       In terms of the economic modeling, two things about the 1970s   come to mind  One is the emergence of the natural rate hypothesis—that there is not a long-run   tradeoff between output and inflation  Also, the sacrifice ratio was considered at the time to be   very much higher than we imagine it is now     In terms of this picture, I actually didn’t look around that much at   other periods  This one seemed to work, so I stuck with it  But in terms of the underlying   analysis, even though this episode demonstrates the point, it does not provide the strongest test    A lot of people have looked for this type of interest rate predictability by running regressions of   actual changes in short-term interest rates on forecasted changes over longer periods  This   finding of limited predictability is true, really, over much of the postwar period  The particular   regressions that I used were from 1988, the start of the Eurodollar market in readily accessible   form, to 2000  So that’s the period on which my analysis focused     At any rate, other people have run these kinds of regressions a lot, and it’s remarkable   how financial markets often know what the Fed is going to do a month or two in advance  In   some episodes—1994, for example—there was even a bit more predictability  Nevertheless, I   January 28-29, 2003 27 of 195    think this recent episode is actually fairly typical in that, in the middle of this easing cycle, the   markets thought they might get the next 25 basis point move  But in fact, moving out beyond six   months, they actually have little predictive ability  That’s because, if the funds rate is being set   in terms of future movements in output and inflation and other factors, those factors are hard to   forecast, and the markets find them hard to forecast as well  But there’s no pent-up policy inertia   on a quarter-to-quarter basis that gives them a lot of predictive ability     You can see that in my handout in the chart at the bottom of   page 2  There is a Taylor rule without inertia—that is, there is no lagged funds rate in it—and a   Taylor rule with inertia  During 2001, those two rules both did fairly well     It doesn’t matter that much  The difference in the rules comes in   2002, when for the rule without inertia a persistent deviation emerges  I would argue that there’s   something other than strict Taylor rule determinants acting during this episode, perhaps some   reaction to a collapse of the tech bubble in stock prices or to geopolitical risks—something that’s   holding the actual funds rate below what a simple Taylor rule would say     January 28-29, 2003 28 of 195      Well, the expectations that are most informative are just a few   quarters ahead  In ten-year expectations, say, policy inertia doesn’t play as big a role Those   expectations aren’t able to clarify whether there is inertia or not  So it is term structure evidence,   but I’m just looking at the very short end—one year or less of the term structure maturities     But it is true that there is a link  In what is often called optimal monetary policy inertia, it   has been demonstrated in other presentations that, as you have more forward-looking   expectations, the monetary authority is able to stabilize the economy, not necessarily by taking   actions today but by promising to take actions in the future  Financial markets build that in, and   those expected future actions are able to affect the economy today  Those actions reflect inertia    Again, those inertial movements are assumed in optimal monetary policy  I don’t consider that   something we should be taking too seriously  I don’t think we have the empirical evidence of   monetary policy inertia, and I don’t think optimal monetary policy inertia is very convincing     I think of reversals as being perhaps a bit shorter run  Again, an   important point regarding optimal monetary policy the way economists usually construct it is   that it’s at a quarterly frequency; we use quarterly average rates  So, it’s not as if at one meeting   the rate is moved up 50 basis points and at the next meeting it goes down 50 basis points  The   reversals are not reflected in an up-and-down pattern meeting by meeting  We’re talking about   quarterly average rates  Therefore, from the point of view of economic analysis, as long as the   Fed follows a systematic rule quarter by quarter—however it hits that quarterly average—at the   broad level of the way macroeconomic economic models are constructed, that is sufficient  In   January 28-29, 2003 34 of 195    terms of reversals, this perhaps goes back to the Chairman’s point about implementing policy   changes in small steps, given that the Fed has to worry about financial fragility and testing the   system     I just want to stress again the difference between short-term policy   inertia and quarterly policy inertia  A lot of the concerns about financial market fragility would   refer just to short-term policy inertia and wouldn’t necessarily show up in our quarterly average   loss function  Very often in the past if you were going to change the direction of policy, you   would start off with a 25 basis point move  Even then—in 1994, for example—we saw large   repercussions with the Orange County situation  A lot of people had built up positions,   apparently on the assumption that monetary policy would never change, and those positions were   hard to unwind  So just a small move in the funds rate seemed to produce large repercussions    A 50 basis point move for that initial move would have been even more disastrous, I think     Right  But again, if you wanted to get to a total change of   100 basis points from the quarterly average of the first quarter to the quarterly average of the   second quarter, that could be done over a sequence of four meetings—with limited concern about   January 28-29, 2003 38 of 195    financial fragility  Financial fragility is something that operates on a week-to-week basis    Markets react appropriately given enough time  So I think that distinction has to be made     It depends, I think, on the structure of uncertainty  This is the   argument that Milton Friedman made  His point was that not knowing the model—not being   sure of the results—led him to argue against fine-tuning or, in this case, the aggressive policy   responses     Yes, although if you looked at those numbers, I think they would   actually strengthen my case  That’s because with quarterly policy inertia after you made a move,   to the extent that it was not completely anticipated and there was some policy surprise, it would   have implications about changes in future rates at a six-to-nine-month or six-to-twelve-month   January 28-29, 2003 45 of 195    horizon  The yield curve would not be moving parallel to the existing curve, but its slope would   be changing to some extent  In fact, that doesn’t appear to be the case       Again, those inertial movements don’t appear to be there because   they’re not showing up after the FOMC changes the target     My opinion would be that in the current situation, or even in   1998-99, what is of interest is that inertia is not operating at these quarterly frequencies  These   are situations—and one of them would be the repercussions from the Russian default—in which   the Committee sees some serially correlated influences that may persist for several quarters and   the Committee is responding to that promptly  Similarly, in the current situation there are   influences not well summarized by the Taylor rule determinants that the Committee is   responding to on a quarter-to-quarter basis  There is no feeling that we have to get somewhere   January 28-29, 2003 51 of 195    but we’re going to take our time to get there  Again, that’s a synopsis of my general impression   of the Committee’s behavior       I have one brief comment on that, which is how I would come out   on this issue  If the choice were whether the Fed should change its behavior to match the models   or whether we should change the models to have optimal monetary policy match historical Fed   behavior, I’d probably go for the latter  But it’s not clear to a lot of researchers exactly how to   incorporate this model uncertainty and what needs to—   January 28-29, 2003 56 of 195      For example, the policymaker perfect foresight path in the   Bluebook is perhaps interesting, but the psychology has to be taken as missing from that     I will review some general issues related to monetary  policy and asset prices  Let me start—at the top of page 1—by assuming that an  asset price can, in theory at least, be separated into a component determined by  underlying economic fundamentals and a non-fundamental or bubble component   An asset price may be in line with its fundamentals, so the bubble component is  zero, or bubbles could be positive or negative—perhaps representing irrational  euphoria or pessimism     Two types of monetary policy responses to movements in an asset price have  been proposed  I refer to the first type as “Standard Policy” because there is  widespread agreement that it represents the minimum appropriate policy response   The Standard Policy responds to an asset price to the extent it conveys information  to the central bank about the future path of output and inflation—the goal variables                                                       June 29-30, 2005 15 of 234  of monetary policy  For example, a booming stock market is usually followed by  higher demand and increased inflationary pressures, so tighter policy would be  needed to offset these consequences  Even for the Standard Policy response, it will  likely be useful to identify, if possible, the separate components of the asset price  In  particular, the bubble component may exhibit more volatile dynamics and be a  pernicious source of macroeconomic risk, so optimal policy would likely react more  to bubbles than to movements in the fundamental component     The second type of response, the “Bubble Policy,” follows the Standard Policy  as a base case, but, in certain circumstances, it also takes steps to contain or reduce  the asset price bubble  Proponents of a Bubble Policy argue that movements in the  bubble component can have serious adverse consequences for macroeconomic  performance that monetary policy cannot readily offset after the fact, so it is  preferable to try to eliminate this source of macroeconomic fluctuations directly   Furthermore, because bubbles often seem to display a self-reinforcing behavior, a  little preemption and prevention early on can avoid later excesses   A best-case scenario for these two policies is illustrated in the lower half of the  first page  Under ideal circumstances, the policymaker knows the fundamental and  bubble components, and as history unfolds, the Standard Policy would likely  recommend higher interest rates to offset any economic stimulus generated by the  bubble before the crash and lower rates afterward  A Bubble Policy would go  further and try to mitigate the fluctuations in the bubble and achieve an asset price  path like AP′t  This would likely require higher interest rates than the Standard  Policy before the crash and lower rates afterward, and it will likely trade off near- term deviations from the central bank’s macroeconomic goals for better overall  macroeconomic performance later on  The fundamental difference between the two  policies is that the Standard Policy takes the bubble component essentially as given  or exogenous, while the Bubble Policy takes into account the endogenous nature of  the bubble component—specifically, a linkage between the policy instrument and  the bubble    A decision tree for choosing between the Standard and Bubble Policies is  shown on page 2  In brief, it asks three questions (1) Can policymakers identify a  bubble?  (2) Will fallout from a bubble be significant and hard to rectify ex post?  and (3) Is monetary policy the right method to use to deflate the bubble?   The answer to the first question—can policymakers identify a bubble?—is “no”  if the particular asset price appears aligned with fundamentals  Some have argued  that this is nearly always the case because estimates of fundamentals are so  imprecise and because asset prices reflect the collective information and wisdom of  professional traders in organized markets  If policymakers cannot discern a bubble,  then the Standard Policy is the only feasible response   But suppose an asset price bubble is identified  Then the second hurdle is  whether bubble fluctuations have significant macroeconomic fallout that monetary                                                                  June 29-30, 2005 16 of 234  policy cannot readily offset after the fact  A negative answer to this question is  appropriate in two situations  First, if the bubble is in an asset market that is small in  domestic economic terms—for example, a localized real estate market—then a  central banker should avoid attempts at asset price realignment  Second, even when  there are significant macroeconomic consequences from an asset price bubble boom  and bust, if they occur with a sufficient lag so the policymaker can adopt a wait-and­ see attitude, then the Standard Policy is again appropriate  This second case seems  relevant if fluctuations in the bubble component have only conventional effects on  aggregate demand and supply through changes in wealth, the cost of capital, and  balance sheets  Then, to a first approximation, the lags involved in these channels  are about as long as the lags in the monetary transmission mechanism; therefore, the  Standard Policy should suffice  For example, fluctuations in equity prices will affect  wealth and consumer demand, but a nimble central banker can essentially offset  these consequences by changing interest rates in reaction to—that is, after—the  equity price movements   Now to the case where asset price movements have significant macroeconomic  consequences and those consequences are hard to clean up after the fact through  monetary policy The most often mentioned possibility is that a bursting asset price  bubble will lead to a broad financial crisis and credit crunch  Such financial  instability is likely to be transmitted to the economy much more quickly than can be  offset by interest rate policy  This may set the stage for invoking a Bubble Policy   Another example is when the asset price misalignment results in significant  misallocations of resources, which distort aggregate demand and supply across  sectors and over time and impede the achievement of the highest possible long-run  economic growth  For example, the dot-com bubble spurred overinvestment in fiber  optic cable and decimated the provision of venture capital for new technology  startups for years  Of course, after the fact, it is difficult to unwind these problems  with the blunt instrument of monetary policy, and, depending on the specifics, it is  possible to conceive of a situation in which reducing the bubble in advance is a  preferred policy strategy   The final hurdle before invoking a Bubble Policy involves assessing whether  monetary policy is the right way to deflate the asset price bubble  Ideally, for the  Bubble Policy, a moderate adjustment of interest rates could constrain the bubble  and greatly reduce the risk of severe future macroeconomic dislocations  However,  bubbles, even if identified, often do not appear influenced by monetary policy  actions in a predictable way  Furthermore, even if changing interest rates could alter  the bubble path, such a strategy may involve substantial costs, including near-term  deviations from the macroeconomic goals of the central bank as well as potential  political or moral hazard complications  Finally, even if monetary policy can affect  the bubble, alternative strategies to deflate it, such as changes in financial regulations  or supervision, may be more targeted and have a lower cost   This decision tree is a daunting triple jump, but not a total prohibition against  bubble reduction  Indeed, page 3 suggests different real-time answers to these three                                                           June 29-30, 2005 17 of 234  questions for two historical episodes  The first episode is the run-up in the stock  market during the late 1990s  In 1999 and 2000, one could have made the case that  there was an equity price bubble in the high-technology sector and perhaps in the  overall market as well  Also, during that time, the possible capital misallocation  from the run-up in prices and the possible financial instability that might have  followed a bursting of the bubble may have appeared difficult to rectify  However,  it was also unlikely that monetary policy could have deflated the equity price bubble  without substantial costs to the economy  In the event, of course, a Bubble Policy  was not followed, but arguably, the consequences from any bubble boom and bust  have been manageable    A different example is provided by the bond market collapse in 1994  One  could argue that this “inflation scare,” which pushed up yields on 30-year bonds by  over 2 percentage points, resulted in an asset price misalignment that was fairly  apparent to the FOMC during the second half of 1994  If this bond bubble had  persisted, the widespread propagation of the associated fears of higher inflation  could have had severe consequences that would have been costly to unwind with  monetary policy later on Finally, with regard to deflatability, it did appear likely  that monetary policy could guide bond prices back to fundamentals  Indeed, one  interpretation of the FOMC’s actions in 1994 is that it purposefully and successfully  contained a bond market bubble with sizable increases in the funds rate  It is an  open question which of these two episodes is the more relevant one today  That  concludes my remarks    That’s an interesting question  I think one of the points to be   considered is that those countries are all smaller than the United States, and typically their   residential property markets are centered in one or two cities—London or Sydney, for example  So   perhaps that’s a factor that just looms larger in the policy calculation  And that may be the reason   why the central bankers in those countries have been perhaps a little more proactive, although that   issue is still being worked out, I think  They have done a bit more jawboning, so to speak  But   Australia, in particular, has been a little more explicit about factoring in housing market   developments in the policy calculation  Again, they don’t target house prices, but they certainly   seem to take them into account a bit more than the Unites States does, in terms of setting monetary   policy    I think both Australia and the United Kingdom, to the extent they   have conducted this type of policy, have felt it was fairly successful  They have been able to temper   home price appreciation and restore some balance in the economy without any significant   macroeconomic fallout  They have had lower home price appreciation but, again, their situations   are perhaps very different from the situation for the United States                                            June 29-30, 2005 33 of 234    I guess I’d make a distinction there, in that I think the proponents are   talking not about setting asset prices in general but about trying perhaps to reduce the bubble   component  Clearly, if asset prices are set equal to the fundamentals, that’s going to lead to the   proper functioning of—    I’m sympathetic to that view  It seems as if there might be a   threshold  That is, policymakers might be more interested in certain asset markets or might be more   interested in prices in asset markets in general at certain times  But I think you’re alluding to the   moral hazard or political complications that could arise from this type of intervention or from trying   to use this bubble component as a monetary transmission mechanism    People also have made the argument that if policymakers are going to   clean up the mess after the fact, there may be other problems  If you let equity prices rise on the   upside but then essentially make some sort of insurance agreement on the downside, that again is a   distortion—though perhaps an asymmetric one—that may also have complications    Since you’re going to the British Embassy, I might note that in the   United Kingdom they used to allow loan-to-value at origination of 120 percent  You could buy   your property under water essentially by 20 percent  One of the recent restrictions they’ve imposed   is a limit of 110 percent  So this time around they feel much better in the UK about where they are   with just 110 percent loan-to-value at origination  But the monetary authority there doesn’t have   supervisory responsibility—    With regard to equity prices and bond prices, the reason I included   that comparison was to make a couple of points  For one, the comment is often made that we can’t   second-guess financial markets or financial market participants  It seems as if that may be true for   equity market participants but less true for bond market participants  There I take “inflation scare”   or “credibility gap” or “conundrum” all to be another term for a situation in which we have an idea   of where the fundamentals are and we’re not sure what bond market participants are thinking   Now, it’s true that there’s a difference in that you have a clear idea about the reaction   function or where monetary policy is going and presumably can guide bond market participants                                          June 29-30, 2005 56 of 234  with transparency regarding your notion of fundamentals  So there is a clear difference between the   markets  The housing market is different from both the bond and the equity markets, and the   question is Where can we draw the lessons?  The regional disparity is completely different from   both markets, and that’s just a separate issue   In any event, one reason behind the housing price appreciation, perhaps, is that we have very   low long rates  This is a bond rate conundrum  Perhaps the misalignment in bond prices is leading   to this misalignment in housing prices  So, one could perhaps make the argument that it’s the bond   price experience in 1994 that may be the relevant one for today  I think I’ll stop there and leave it at   that
