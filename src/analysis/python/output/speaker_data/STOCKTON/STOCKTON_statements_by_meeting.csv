533,1988-09-20," It appears that most of the upward revision of the fixed-weight index occurred in the service category That's an area where, in addition to using some information from the CPI, they also bring to bear additional information For instance, they use wage rates of hospital workers to help estimate the medical care costs and information they're getting from the banking industry to estimate banking margins So they do get some additional information in addition to the CPI "
727,1989-02-07, You get about 5 percent consumer price inflation as well as what's pushing down the overall growth in real disposable income 
917,1989-07-05, The data that we've seen to date--the retail sales and inventory data--are not suggesting a large revision in GNP But what we haven't seen is so much larger than what we have that it probably would be dangerous to make any firm statement at this time 
918,1989-07-05," No We're expecting that to take about 4 cents a gallon off gasoline prices by the September-October period So there's about a 4 percent decline just from that as well as some weakening in gasoline margins over and above that Once that's in place, we're expecting CPI prices to be [rising] 02 to 03 percent for the summer months of July, August, and September And for the PPI [we expect a] zero to 01 percent rise for a few months in late summer, early fall "
1164,1989-12-18," I think the point to remember, though, was not so much that the swing in the GNP growth was zero to minus 2 but the fact that the unemployment rate ran up to 10 percent and then came down quite slowly In addition, inflation in general in that period probably slowed a bit faster than the models might have expected but then it plateaued and didn't slow much [below that rate] beyond that point   So, the output losses in some sense should be measured from potential output--how much output do you actually give up relative to what you could have had, had you been operating at the time at potential, in order to bring inflation down It does raise an issue, which I don't think we were able to address very well, simply because there aren't that many episodes upon which to base it, and that is Would you get a more rapid bang for your buck out of a very deep downturn in overall economic activity and a very sharp rise in [un]employment than if you went through a long protracted period of smaller [declines in economic activity] but [more persistent] unemployment? The models that we looked at, the [Board] model in particular, don't distinguish between those kinds of events In fact, there may be some expectational effect--even though we're not going to be able to see it very well with this one episode--where, if the economy sinks and people expect you to keep the pressure on, you would in fact have a larger effect on overall expectations than you would    12/18-19/89  inching the unemployment rate up to 6 or 6-1/2 percent over 5 or 6 years   My own view is that it would be difficult to expect an immediate adjustment and a response to that If you look back at inflation expectations survey data, for example, in 1979 there wasn't an immediate reaction to the announcement of a change in    12/18-19/89  Federal Reserve operating procedures There was, however, after the effects of the implementation of that policy became clear It seems likely that it would be difficult to gauge what period of time it would take to establish that credibility or by what channels one would be able to do that But I guess one wouldn't want to bet on having a very large immediate initial effect from simply signing on to the Neal proposal; but that's [as] opposed to some other kind of commitment that might tie the hands of policymakers, etc   I would just add, on the basis of the work we've done to date, that we have done an experiment that is, I think,    12/18-19/89  exactly like you would wish us to do That is, taking ourselves personally out of this, we went into the published literature and pulled out three different published equations and paradigms We put them through a test using data as they exist and what people are actually using and did a series of stochastic simulations [and ran regressions] out of sample The results of those show what I guess you'd expect them to show All the models were misspecified to some degree or another That is, they all perform worse out of sample than they do in sample But the standard error on the equation that is quite similar to the one that is used in the quarterly model was by far the smallest for a 4-to-8-quarter-ahead forecast, a standard error on the order of 1-1/2 percent Now, that 1-1/2 percent is small in terms of econometrics and what you're actually able to do in real time forecasting But it's huge, I would imagine, from the perspective of the Committee in terms of the kind of errors that you can expect to see over a horizon as short as 4 to 8 quarters But I think that's about as much science as we can bring to bear on the issue at the moment   In the forward-looking model, individuals are assumed to look forward and see the increased tax liability that accompanies the increased spending today That is imposed in some sense in that model Most independent tests don't seem to find the offsetting private savings behavior with respect to [unintelligible] But it does not have the same kind of real interest rate effect as in the Board staff [model]   Theory actually says that if you were to announce something that you were going to do in terms of money growth reduction in the future and if you allowed people time to adjust to it, the cost would actually be lower But in essence, to follow that line of thought means that if we say we're going to do something two or three years from now, then the workers at Boeing, for instance, would reduce their wage demands in anticipation of what your [announced policy] was going to be So, in some sense, while [announcing] what your actions were going to be may work--or it's how the model works out in theory--it doesn't seem very sensible from a policy perspective to expect that In terms of getting to it early versus late, the issue really is that five years isn't a very long time, even in the case where you might have credibility, in terms of getting on a path whereby you don't end up the five-year period with some major disequilibrium or imbalance--like having the unemployment rate very high The P* model tells a very similar kind of story to the Board's quarterly model in that if you end up with a big price gap at the end it must mean either that velocity is very far from its equilibrium and/or that output is very far from its equilibrium In essence, the longer you have to get to this end point, the more adjustment can occur Within the five-year period you can reach both price stability and some general real output equilibrium much easier than you can if you try to do it quickly and you have to be pushing very hard on one particular level   No, not with a forward-looking model without the [unintelligible]  SPEAKER(?) I see; so you just push it   With this particular simulation, though, somewhat slower money and somewhat higher real interest rates were occurring relative to the Greenbook  SPEAKER(?) Somewhat slower GNP growth   Somewhat slower GNP growth, right We did not constrain ourselves to adhere directly to the Greenbook forecast with a starting off point that assumed, in essence, somewhat tighter monetary policy in 1990   There is some empirical evidence relative to that point that there is indeed a correlation between the variability of relative prices and the level of inflation Most of that correlation can be explained not by inflation causing relative prices to vary a lot, but by the fact that there have been episodes when relative prices have changed a lot and that has been associated with either accommodative policy to those shocks or just a significant and persistent effect on inflation for some short-run period of time But there is some evidence that there is causality from inflation to relative price variability as well So there's more noise in the prices the higher the rate of inflation There is also some weak evidence suggesting that the variance of the inflation rate is associated with the level of inflation, meaning that you have more variability to overall inflation rates at 4 percent than you would at zero But that evidence is weak, particularly if you [confine] yourself to industrial economies There have been some countries that have run relatively high rates of inflation but it hasn't been extremely variable and other countries that have had low rates of inflation but it has been somewhat more variable So I think there's some weak evidence in both those cases that that sort of variability and uncertainty is associated with inflation, but it's not strong "
1465,1990-08-21," Thank you [Statement--see Appendix]   I think we were going to estimate something roughly on the order of 1 or so higher price inflation both in 1991 and 1992 as well, if we had not made other changes to the outlook path to offset that The dollar obviously was going to be providing a little more boost to domestic prices And the downward revision I mentioned that we have made to our estimate of potential output, and part of that is a downward adjustment to trend productivity, also would have implied a bit more pressure on prices than we previously thought   This is a very imprecise calculation But the important point to remember about the downward revision to potential output is that we extended that downward revision to potential output all the way back to 1980 Therefore, the cumulative effect on the level of potential output by the time we get to 1990 is quite large Essentially, what we're trying to do is this Every year when we receive the GNP revisions we try to feel around to [determine] what sort of underlying trend productivity would best explain the course of activity over the entire business cycle In the absence of any particular reason for assuming that there had been a pronounced break in the growth rate of potential output just in the last two years, we essentially adjusted the entire path down extending all the way back to the previous peak So, in terms of the level of slack one ends up with, while it appears to you that we just have revised down 1/4 of a percentage point in the last two years when the real GNP figures were revised down much more, that might have implied that even then there would have been somewhat greater slack The cumulative effect of having revised that trend down over 10 years implies that [when] we get to the end the slack is not too much different, but we've--   It's not sensitive to that at all   For the fourth-quarter fixed-weight number? Well, the principal reason the fixed-weight deflator does not show as large an effect as the CPI is that, while obviously we consume more energy than we produce, the weights for energy are several percentage points different in the CPI and the GNP fixed-weight And that is the principal reason for the difference There may be some slight differences in what we assumed about the fourth quarter as well We have a very low increase from the federal sector in the fixed-weight deflator in the fourth quarter, which is helping to pull things down   I would say that's true, with the difference in weights between the energy share in the CPI and the energy share in the GNP being the biggest factor   Well, the first thing to mention is that, as Mike pointed out, we have not yet received benchmark revisions to the employment or hours data We'll receive those in September Typically, those [benchmark revisions] occur in May and June and by the time the revised compensation per hour figures would come out [the Commerce Department] would already have incorporated those revisions They had to And as a result, we really didn't even wish to discuss those figures in the Greenbook because we think at this point they are pretty meaningless   I guess my basic reaction, of course, is to agree with your statement that the process is considerably more complicated than just opening up slack and having inflation change in some mechanical way The labor markets are extremely complex phenomena, so it is going to be more complicated On the other hand, I would look at events of the last several years as more a confirmation of that basic underlying paradigm than a contradiction That is, wage inflation in particular had been on a downtrend through 1986 with the unemployment rate above 6 percent--really in some sense it was somewhere in the 7 to 6 percent range As the unemployment rate moved below that, wage inflation turned around And over the last year, we've had the unemployment rate at 5-1/4 percent and we've seen some mild acceleration We have yet really to create, at least on the labor market side in our view, any slack that would be sufficient to reduce those trends Now, another point that you made that I think is correct is that we have seen progress in moving [inflation] back down again on the manufacturing side as slack appears to have opened up in terms of capacity utilization So, I think the recent events have been relatively kind to that particular paradigm, recognizing that there are developments in the agricultural sector, the energy sector, and movements of the exchange rate that at times clearly influence the pattern of overall price developments But at this point I wouldn't see any compelling reason to abandon the basic paradigm while recognizing that the confidence [intervals] one can place around the estimates of what slack is or what any particular level of slack might actually lead to are quite wide    8/21/90   Some chartered airline flights as well   At this point we made the assumption that most but not all of the decline in real income is reflected in the consumption in the second half because we assumed that some households will be uncertain about the permanence or transitory nature [of the decline] and probably will be assessing and adjusting their consumption plans accordingly That is, some households clearly will think that this is transitory and others that it is permanent and that combination will result in only a partial reduction in consumption in response I should say that the reduction in the saving rate that we have as a consequence of this is pretty small; we have taken most of the reduction in real incomes out of consumption On the goods consumption side, things have been quite weak and we expect them to get weaker in the second half If you look at the past year and take that as the underlying trend relative to the second half--which shows the averages through the ups and downs of the automobile sector in the third and fourth quarters of last year as well as early this year--the place where we would expect to see a particularly sharp hit is in the automobile sales area in the second half of the year The only support that we really are getting in consumption is on the services side, where in our view it's a little harder in the short run for households to adjust consumption of housing services or medical services to fluctuations in income And that in essence provides somewhat of a base on the consumption side on which we get relatively meager increases--about a percentage point in the second half--in consumption growth   I guess that is clearly a risk in terms of the projection As we reported in yesterday's briefing [to the Board], we did receive some weekly information from the University of Michigan on consumer confidence That showed a very precipitous fall-off in the few days right after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and then some rebound throughout the course of the last couple of weeks to a level that is still below where it was prior to the invasion But it is not an astronomical fall-off at this point    8/21/90   Given the accuracy with which one can use those survey data to predict consumption--and the link is very, very weak--   61 or 62 The 10-day auto sales figures have the advantage of being very timely They have a disadvantage, of course, in that they can move around for reasons of seasonal adjustment problems or other reasons that make them a little difficult to interpret We did call around to auto dealers in the wake of the price increases and didn't pick up any major stories about a significant reduction in showroom traffic, so--   One of the reasons that we delayed the fall-off in auto sales in the projection is that we think, almost no matter what happens to automobile demand, that the auto makers at this point will make it through incentive programs [unintelligible] to clear out the 1990 models And that helps hold up sales a little in the near term; but by the fourth quarter we show a bigger fall-off   They don't have much in inventories and that [unintelligible) they won't have any buyers Our current assumption is that there isn't going to be a precipitous fall-off in sales in the near term that would require them even to have to go through some kind  -10-    8/21/90  of major increase in incentive programs But if that were to occur, it seems quite likely that they would use incentive programs to [work off] whatever inventories they needed to   We have not yet run through the model something as acute as a sequester of the size that could occur under current legislation The reason we have not yet done that is that the dislocation would be so enormous that at this point it's very difficult to imagine politically in the weeks before the election that either the Administration or the Congress would wish to have a sequester of $100 billion, which is about the size that we're talking about here, go into effect In fact, at the mid-session review Mr  -12-    8/21/90  Darman issued a report outlining all the things that would occur if this sequester were to go into place, including that 30 percent of the prison guards would be sent home and people would be let out of jail because there wouldn't be public defenders and they couldn't get access [to the courts] It just seems so extreme that I guess we feel fairly comfortable that something will occur in the time [before] the sequester to delay, if nothing else, our decisions until after the election   By October 1st they have to issue their sequester report and by the 15th, I think, the cuts actually have to be in place   It doesn't derail it; it simply allows Congress-- "
1466,1990-08-21," It isn't the case that our forecast is constrained by this particular feature of the model--that somehow the energy price run-up would naturally lead to offsetting price and output effects with unchanged nominal income As Don pointed out in his briefing, it is a function of the parameters of this specific model and not a theoretical feature of the economy or something that is anything other than a summary of past historical experience "
1525,1990-10-02," On the potential outlook question, I'd say that given our basic forecast, which is just sort of a continuation of a modest rise in the relative price of energy--abstracting from this temporary rise--that we're not expecting any significant scrapping of the capital stock And that is the principal way in which the potential output falls in the short run Obviously, if [energy] were to be maintained at that higher relative price, there would be greater scrapping of the capital stock and greater substitution away from energy that would [lead] to a reduction of potential output "
2343,1992-06-30," Basically 2 percent throughout the forecast horizon and 21 percent as time goes on Obviously, beyond the next three years what potential output will be is certainly open to much wider question But the evidence in the last few years at least makes us reasonably comfortable with something in the 2 percent range   It would go up a few tenths over the period   Well, part of the problem is that in the price stability case there is a timing difficulty It has to do with the lag [in] Okun's law relationship that relates real GDP to unemployment In the stable inflation case, you can see we're easing up growth a lot at the very end of the simulation in order to try to limit the potential overshooting In effect, if you carry out the price stability simulation a little further, the unemployment rate is going to be down to about the natural rate within a year from the end of that simulation So, that limits the discrepancy around 1997 The simulations use the identical Okun's law relationship so that there isn't any structural difference in those two simulations But there is in the quarterly model, with relatively long lags elsewhere for the unemployment [rate]   I certainly don't have any particularly wisdom to add on that point We did a similar exercise a couple of years ago for the Committee and we talked a great deal about the role that credibility might play I guess one could look at this current episode and, given the output losses we have already incurred to    6/30-7/1/92  achieve the disinflation that we have, feel that it's difficult to see in that any credibility effects so far The costs seem pretty much [as expected] If there were a dramatic break in the regime--in the way in which monetary policy was made--one certainly couldn't rule it out And one cannot rule out the fact that credibility even in financial markets and among wage and price setters may not come as smoothly as the models suggest It could very well be that at some point in the next year and a half or two years there will be a significant break in inflation expectations But I suspect that the effects on output costs and disinflation will have more to do with your actions rather than your pronouncements   That's correct, Mr Chairman We've made no adjustments here in terms of our expectations for future potential output or the effect of price stability itself Our research suggests that to the extent that correlation is there, it occurs at very long time intervals, probably perceptibly beyond the time interval that we're considering here   Well, the feedback from that to actual potential output would probably be very minimal within the time frame that we have here It's certainly the case that in the price stability example the short-run effects of pursuing that policy, which would require higher real interest rates for a period of time in order to bring inflation down, would be adverse for capital equipment investment But over the longer term in none of these cases is the sort of natural rate of interest being influenced by the course of monetary policy within this time frame Our estimates suggest that because there is an interaction in the long run between inflation through the tax system that is adverse [to] investment, the benefits to potential output growth over the long run would be positive from pursuing case 2 versus case 3 In the short run, though--for the time period that we're considering here--it's not clear that we see that It would be more [true] of a 10-year horizon   On the agricultural side, it's obviously too early to tell yet how this year's crop production will turn out Indeed, there has been a great deal of volatility in the markets in the past month and a half As you know, it looked as if the weather would be dry and then in the last few weeks the rains have come and the situation has looked considerably better We're not expecting to see any serious disruptions in terms of crop production this year But inventories are lean and if I had to say which side the risks might be on I'd say that if we did see a shortfall, there could be a potential price spike We're expecting meat production to pick back up this year and we think that is going to keep the lid on meat prices as well Basically, on the food price side, a really encouraging development was the significant break we saw last year [Previously, food price increases] had been running in a reasonably high 5 to 5-1/2 percent range And a big chunk of that [break] is attributable to the nonvolatile components It just looks as if underlying food price inflation and probably wage developments as well have settled down considerably   In terms of the price stability scenario and the interest rate assumptions that go along with that, we would look for the level of business fixed investment through the end of '96, let's say, to be roughly 5 percent lower than in case 1, the disinflation case, which is more of a middle ground type case But I don't think even in the longer term that that is a transitory reduction in investment; we don't really see that having significant negative effects for the overall rate of capital accumulation further down the road If anything, we think at some point that would turn around and, because the tax distortions would be less, that we'd actually see better and more productive investment further out "
2400,1992-08-18," On the unemployment rate--   There is probably some upside risk as we look at it   What I indicated was that the permits for single-family starts in July inched up a bit but were only at their second-quarter average   One wouldn't necessarily want to characterize them as--   The only other piece of anecdotal information that we have at this time is a preliminary August homebuilders survey which showed that their views about sales have moved back toward the levels of earlier in the year So, they have picked up a bit They didn't sag quite as sharply this spring as did starts and sales, but they moved back up a little   Well, that's very conditional on what is likely to occur with overall activity over the remainder of the year Eight percent, let's say, by the end of the year would require a pretty weak fourth quarter relative to where we are right now But if you were to ask me whether that is a standard deviation away from the forecast we have here, clearly the answer would be ""no""   Obviously, over the summer period we also have a bit of a difficult time, with the influx of teens in and out of the labor market, trying to pin down exactly where the unemployment rate is We face that same uncertainty again this summer So, in some sense there is a diffusion of estimates that always increases this time of the year and we are facing that as well But I don't think there are any unusual risks to the unemployment rate apart from the fact that, as I mentioned in the briefing, the data that we actually have in hand right now show no signs of improvement in the labor market and are not signaling a step-up in activity If you were to take that as a risk that we could be seeing just more of the same as we move through the second half of the year, I think there would be some risks that the unemployment could be higher   At this point our estimate of potential would be 2 percent with roughly 1 percent in trend productivity and a 1 percent increase in labor input That's a tad lower than where we were before we saw all the [unintelligible] revisions, which revised output growth down So, we're just a little below   On trend productivity? Yes, that's certainly a possibility, although currently when we're coming out of the business cycle trough--   -- it's difficult to pin down what the trend in fact is The good productivity performance that we've seen thus far in the recovery is not inconsistent with normal cyclical behavior if one were to assume a trend of 1 percent That is in some sense how we infer what the trend is But one could certainly say that at this stage we don't know how much of this restructuring is actually accomplishing some underlying improvement in trend productivity and how much of it is just simply using the existing work force more effectively as firms always do in a cyclical recovery So, there's certainly a possibility that it could be better, but I wouldn't bet on it at this point If one thinks back to where we were in the early '80s, coming out of that recession there was a tendency, I think, for many people to overestimate the improvement in productivity There was talk then that the trend had improved to maybe 2 percent or in excess of 2 percent and it turned out to be a disappointment that as we progressed through the decade we didn't see that kind of improvement So, I think it's always difficult when you see the good increases in productivity early on [in a recovery] to know exactly how much is trend and how much is cyclical   I guess we'd come down pretty strongly on the side that we would imagine that lower intermediate- and long-term interest rates would be beneficial for overall activity To be sure, lower interest rates always have an income effect in the household sector given that the household sector is a net creditor But as I tried to indicate in my remarks, I think we have seen signs that the interest-sensitive sectors have responded to lower interest rates and would do so with greater force if rates were lower I suppose a backup in long-term rates, assuming that the backup occurred for reasons other than purely inflation expectation reasons--   Correct, and I think you can see that in the way that the forecast has changed We have higher equipment spending in this forecast; we have some upward tilt now to net exports that we didn't have before and a little better consumer durables expenditures But that has been offset in part by a bleaker outlook for the state and local sector and, given that we think the starting point here is weaker in some sense, weaker consumption outside of durable goods "
3045,1993-12-21," [Statement--see Appendix]   On the work carried out here at the Board we've done some of those types of statistical causality tests and there does appear to be some indication that inflation causes productivity growth But the lion's share of the negative correlation between inflation and productivity growth occurs contemporaneously So the evidence, one would have to say, is that it is possible that there's some causal relationship but it certainly doesn't show through strongly in the data Most of the correlation appears to be contemporaneous, raising questions about that [relationship]   I think the answer to that is yes, they were significant running from inflation to productivity But the magnitude of that relationship looked relatively weak in terms of the lagged part You're absolutely right in terms of the contemporaneous relationship; it could in fact reflect causation running from inflation to productivity growth But a skeptic could look at that evidence and say But that doesn't prove, of course, that it isn't going in just the opposite direction as well There appears to be a tantalizing correlation in both these cross-country studies and in the time series data The difficulty is that in presenting that to a skeptical audience, I think whatever regression or result you put on the table you couldn't feel confident that somebody else wouldn't come along with another and demonstrate that that particular regression wasn't fragile to a variety of different minor modifications as best--   It's not refuted at that level, that's correct   That's correct   It's certainly the case that in our review of the literature that examines the effects of inflation on the pricing system and relative prices, the overwhelming majority of the studies come to the conclusion that in fact inflation does introduce distortions of price [signaling] And I think that is strong evidence that inflation has detrimental effects   No, that hasn't been done; and that was an issue raised at our conference as a flaw, in some sense, of the studies we've done to date relating inflation to growth in output That would be something on our research-- "
3116,1994-02-03, It's 4 percent for the total CPI 
3586,1995-01-31," Mr Chairman, I would like to come back for just a moment to try to provide a footnote to Mike's response to President Jordan One thing to remember is that a year ago when we were dealing with the changeover in the Current Population Survey, we were expecting that revision to add in excess of 1/2 percentage point to the unemployment rate We now think the addition is more like 2 percent So, that is part of the explanation for the difference last year, and the revision also is leading us to change the projected unemployment rate in comparison with what we were indicating earlier "
3696,1995-05-23," Just econometrically, Governor Blinder, the relationship between the unemployment rate and capacity utilization that we have in this forecast is well within the historical range that we have had in the past 20 or 30 years Indeed, capacity utilization is on the low side relative to the unemployment rate "
3814,1995-08-22, I'm not going to inaugurate the screens   I'm not sure the screens will enhance the quality of the forecast! 
3815,1995-08-22," Thank you, Mr Chairman [Statement--see Appendix]   The principal reason we have relatively flat rates over the next year or so is that our forecast is basically balanced We have the occurrence of fiscal restraint We also have additional demand crowding in on the net export side and relatively well maintained private domestic demand In our inflation forecast, the underlying picture is one of flatness, not one of moving lower So, the underlying view behind the interest rate forecast is our expectation of unchanged longer-term prospects for inflation   On the first part, we have been less puzzled with respect to the volatility in the participation rate, which has often been volatile in the past The real question has been the basic flatness that we have had in participation, even as labor markets appeared to improve considerably To be quite frank, I don't think we have very good stories at this point; one reason is that with the changeover in the CPS, it has been very difficult to interpret the aggregate movements in the participation rate I don't think we see any particular change in labor force behavior that would suggest that participation is going to absorb more of the fluctuations in demand and therefore leave the unemployment rate as a less important indicator of labor market slack at this point But one can't rule out that possibility   We have taken a look at trend productivity estimated by using the new Fisher ideal chain-weighted index, and that suggests that the trend in productivity has basically been constant since about 1980 What one sees as a pickup in trend productivity using 1987-based dollars appears to be a statistical artifact that arises from giving much greater weight in recent years to the growth of computers, and that tends to boost GDP growth rates We think a chain-weighted index is probably going to be a better measure for judging longer-run trends in the economy because it does not assume that the relative prices of computers today are a good reflection of what they were twenty years ago But it certainly does raise a question as to whether we have witnessed any improvement in trend    8/22/95  productivity On many occasions people have forecast or thought that trend productivity was in the process of improving only to be disappointed later This, in some sense, is just another measure that would suggest that perhaps we can't be as optimistic as we might have been on the basis of the fixed-weighted index   I am not sure that we have any particular political forecasting acumen that could predict how this fall's budget negotiations are going to unfold Obviously, our best estimate or highest probability estimate is that some agreement will be reached in the fourth quarter that will avoid the more dire fiscal scenarios that have been mentioned Clearly, there is a tremendous amount of uncertainty as to what actually will occur   Right I would say that we are still showing less fiscal restraint in our forecast than is embodied in the budget resolution passed in Congress Therefore, if we end up with almost exactly what that budget resolution shows, we probably would show slightly weaker activity next year than we currently are forecasting We are not doing that because typically, even when these budget plans have been put on the table, when everything is added up in the end, it usually comes out shy of what was thought when everybody signed the deal We felt comfortable doing that But I guess the probability of a tighter fiscal policy than our forecast is somewhat higher than the probability of a looser fiscal policy   To have an effect on the participation rate, these contingent workers would have to be moved in and out of the labor force That could actually be occurring; so that could be a factor in some of the additional volatility I think more typically folks are with some kind of temporary agency and would probably consider themselves to be in the labor market most of the time But on the margin, there are probably people who can more easily drop in and out of the labor force given the kinds of opportunites that are available We don't have any studies yet on whether this increasing use of contingent workers is fundamentally changing the dynamics of labor force participation But we are acquiring data to take a look at this issue of increasing use of contingent workers and temporary help agencies   Our staff has been working with yours   In my answer to President Forrestal, I was thinking more in terms of the kind of long-term inflation expectations that might be a factor in determining long-term interest rates rather than the quarterly pattern of our inflation forecast, which does have some deceleration The deceleration is from a bulge earlier this year that was, in our view, related to some special factors including significant increases in auto finance charges and airfares that are now receding; it also is related to the materials prices and import prices that were rising quite rapidly but now seem to be slowing down significantly I tried to convey in my remarks that, indeed, in some sense we have been surprised by how well labor costs have performed in a period when, by our assessment, labor markets were tight I think that has played an important role in our thinking about the prospects for inflation and has underpinned our optimism for the outlook over this particular horizon   It wasn't exactly by design that we did that We reached a point where the unemployment rate had dropped to the 5-1/2 to 5-3/4 percent level and we were expecting to see some pickup in compensation inflation It just has not occurred As we indicated in the Greenbook, we don't really see any reason yet for revising significantly lower our estimates of the natural rate in the face of that; in our view that would be giving too much weight in some sense to the recent performance But as this year has progressed, we have been impressed by the significant slowdown that we saw in health care benefits costs, particularly in the first quarter We thought perhaps that was just a flukey number and it was going to reverse itself or at least not be occurring with much strength in the second quarter; but, it occurred again The anecdotal evidence is that some employers really are making significant efforts to make this adjustment Now, maybe that could go on even longer than in our Greenbook forecast, in which case the inflation outlook beyond our forecast horizon would remain relatively benign But as we have the forecast now, we have enough slowdown in the economy and inching up of the unemployment rate to rescue us from the possibility of that rate running below the natural rate for a period of time and ever showing through into prices In some sense, it is like having a favorable supply shock right at the time when you need it the most That could be Then the question becomes Is it a permanent improvement in supply or is it temporary? In some sense our forecast doesn't really have to come down too firmly on that point because the forecast horizon is not long enough for the effect to show through   That is just one reason for being somewhat cautious in looking ahead and thinking that somehow the entire medical care problem has been licked There are still some significant issues about what is driving medical care prices and whether we are going through a transition period where employers are able to get a series of one-time improvements It looked for a time as if the health care inflation problems were behind us But given that we have not solved    8/22/95  the deeper problems there, one suspects that at some point those could come back again "
3816,1995-08-22, The total CPI has averaged about 2 a month for the last three months 
3876,1995-09-26," A very slow decay in the forecast   We've attempted to use other measures of labor market slack such as survey measures of jobs and employment, the help wanted index, and a variety of other things that do tend to show readings that would suggest somewhat more slack in the labor markets relative to the unemployment rate But none of those performed any better or any differently than does the unemployment rate "
3934,1995-11-15," My understanding, Mr Chairman, is that if the government shutdown extends beyond this week, they will not be in the field next week with the household survey This week is the reference week and next week they will be out in the field actually doing the survey "
3985,1995-12-19, The MPS model has both labor income and property income on the right-hand side 
4045,1996-01-30," There have been a few studies in addition to ours We found some minimal evidence that there was some downward nominal wage rigidity But the important empirical point we were attempting to make was that it did not appear to be quantitatively very significant Other researchers using the same data set and other data sets also have found some evidence of downward nominal wage rigidity Some people put different spins on it in terms of how much or how little, but I don't believe there have been any major breakthroughs The additional amounts of empirical evidence have been marginal There is, I think, evidence of some downward nominal wage rigidity The issue is how quantitatively significant ought that to be in the conduct of monetary policy In our study, we found that there was still significant downward nominal wage flexibility There was some evidence that at zero inflation there would be some downward nominal wage rigidity But the welfare loss of running a low or zero inflation policy that would be associated with that downward nominal wage rigidity was not quantitatively significant  -46-    1/30-31/96 "
4046,1996-01-30," [Statement--see Appendix]   Indeed it does in some sense   What I meant to imply was that just looking at the unadjusted help-wanted index, the black line, might have helped to solve the mystery One might have looked at that and concluded that there are many fewer vacancies at this point in time   Given our view that it probably has become a less reliable indicator, we made the adjustment for the increased use of personnel supply agencies But you are right; in some sense, the adjustment does not resolve the mystery The adjusted index is a little below the highs reached in the late 1980s, but not very much "
4092,1996-03-26," This does not answer the question either, but one of the reasons why the deflator is higher now than it was back in September is the shift to the updated base year That has the effect of tending to raise the deflator and to lower GDP growth That does not explain why nominal GDP is a percentage point higher than it was before, but it does explain why the deflator might be a bit higher "
4148,1996-05-21," Mr Chairman, our forecast shows an expectation of higher poultry prices showing through to the retail level more fully by the summer By late fall or early winter, we would expect to see the higher hog prices show up as increased pork prices in grocery stores Higher cattle prices would show up early next year   The model estimated with data from 20 years ago showed a 30 percent farm value in the CPI for food prices That value is about 17 percent now, so we have made some allowance in the model's coefficients for the decline in the weight of farm grain prices "
4216,1996-07-02," President Minehan, we have a long history of adjustments to the CPI; it goes back over the entire postwar period Improvements are continually being made, but I believe there will be a concentration of them in this 1996, 1997, and 1998 period In fact, we could see some discontinuities stemming from the improvements in methodology as well as changes in medical care estimates In 1998, another significant change could be an updating of the weighting scheme that could take another couple of tenths off the core CPI   It's not just an Okun's Law transformation It is a little more complicated in the way it is estimated But it is conceptually quite similar   It would show a slight excess demand at this point "
4373,1996-11-13," Consumer energy prices, in particular, rose quite rapidly this year and are expected to be flat next year The swing we get there acts to boost growth of disposable income   Yes Because we are a net importer of oil, declines in crude oil prices obviously are going to be one thing that helps push up disposable income    11/13/96   That is consistent with the historical evidence   At this point, President Moskow, I think what we have built into the forecast through 1998 is all that the BLS has officially announced in terms of planned changes If we pressed them, I am sure they would say that they have an ongoing program for improvement and there will be further changes down the road Thus far, we think the changes they have made have reduced the CPI by roughly 2 percentage point in 1996 relative to the 12-month change we would have looked at using the 1994 methodology So, we already have 2 percent built into the data to date, and we are expecting another 3 percent downward correction going forward between 1996 and 1998  In terms of how that affects our current estimates of the bias, according to a paper published earlier this year by my colleague, David Wilcox, the estimated bias is 6 to 15 percentage points That estimated bias incorporated a number of the improvements that we expected the BLS would be making What we had not anticipated was the change that the BLS will be making in January to the measurement of medical care prices, which we think is going to reduce the CPI by 1 percentage point I guess we would adjust that range of 6 to 15 percent by lowering it by 1 percentage point, but that is all So, we would say a range roughly of 1/2 to 1-1/2 percent is still a reasonable estimate for the measurement bias   We also try to take account of the distribu- tion of income For example, there is a much higher propensity to consume out of transfer payments than there is out of labor income   As you know, Governor Lindsey, there are not a lot of disaggregated time series data on consumption and saving "
4491,1997-02-04, It's 3-1/2 percent 
4537,1997-03-25," Mike is arriving for a just-in-time briefing, Mr Chairman  [Laughter] "
4644,1997-07-01," Thank you, Mr Chairman [Statement--see Appendix 3/] "
4645,1997-07-01," The Greenbook estimate for the fourth quarter of 1998 is 21  percent above potential   We have 8 percent above potential for the fourth quarter of 1996   Yes, but the reason is that you need to raise rates earlier in that  episode because you are trying to keep the unemployment rate constant If you did not do that,  the strength in demand actually would outweigh in some sense the increase in supply There is a  bigger effect in our models in terms of investment demand and consumer spending that actually  causes the net effect of this improvement in productivity to be expansionary for the economy  The improvement would tend to drive down the unemployment rate in the absence of a rise in  rates "
4789,1997-11-12," If it were to show up, it probably would be as an additional  increase in the statistical discrepancy There is no evidence that statistical discrepancies revise  back toward zero when the annual revisions are made So, you could not necessarily use the  revision to forecast more GDP, but it certainly is a logical possibility   Indeed I think they will undertake a more careful review of the  discrepancy between the income side data and the product side data, and to the extent that they  have some discretion, they might emphasize it that way    11/12/97 29 "
4890,1998-02-03," One can put nonfarm business productivity into a wage  equation and actually see whether or not productivity is an important factor explaining  nominal wage gains The statistical effect turns out to be marginally significant at best  We know that real wage aspirations, loosely based on productivity, ought to be an  important factor in conditioning wage demands, but businesses may not be willing to  grant the wage increases To the extent that fluctuations in productivity do not show up  in wages, the first round effects will show through to profit margins rather than nominal  compensation "
4942,1998-03-31," President Moskow, our model estimates suggest an effect of about  1/4 percentage point per year over the last couple of years on core CPI from the lower nonoil  import prices, simulating forward from 1995   Yes, there may be another quarter percentage point or so for 1998   As a statistical matter, President Jordan, there are a couple of  quirks in this minus 22 percent productivity number that we have for the first quarter One  relates to the fact that we think the 10- and 11 -day pay period seasonal adjustment problem has  led to an artificially large increase in hours worked in the first quarter The second is that, as you  may recall, we thought we were seeing significant declines in self-employed hours late last year  that were boosting productivity to well in excess of the 2 percent underlying number that you  were just talking about Some of that appears to be going away now "
4993,1998-05-19," The reality is that real inflation is lower now than the current  numbers are suggesting While the price measures are getting closer to actual price inflation, our    5/19/98  forecast indicates that there is some pickup in the real underlying rate of inflation, that is, between  where we think inflation is in the real world today and where we think it is going to be in 1999   The people at the Michigan Survey have tried to design the series  of questions that they ask very carefully in order to avoid getting biased responses In fact, Mr  Chairman, you are right that when people are asked in surveys what inflation has been in the past,  the results are similar to what you are suggesting In such surveys if the question is not asked  carefully, people give all sorts of bizarre answers In fact, the mean expected rate of inflation is  usually much higher than the current rates   The Conference Board truncates both the upper level and the  lower level responses They confine the answers to a 0 to 15 percent range, whereas the Michigan  Survey allows the full range of responses "
5060,1998-06-30," The upper panel of your next exhibit lays out the key components of the supply side of our projection We use a variety of approaches for estimating potential output The one displayed here is a growth accounting framework As may be seen on line 1, we are projecting    6/30-7/1/98  that growth of potential output, on a consistently measured basis, will be 2-1/2 percent per year during the 1995 to 1999 period This translates into a 2-3/4 percent increase by 1999 after allowing for the technical changes in the CPI The growth of potential output is more than 1/2 percentage point higher than the pace estimated to have prevaied over the first half of the 1990s Labor input--line 2--is projected to increase at a 1 percent annual rate, close to the average pace observed earlier this decade But we now estimate that trend growth in labor productivity--line 3--has picked up to a 1-1/2 percent pace per year As you know, we revised up this estimate by about 1/4 percentage point in the May Greenbook, and we expect that this faster pace will continue over the forecast period  The two principal elements behind this pickup in trend productivity are capital deepening and multifactor productivity As Mike noted earlier, the high level of business investment has boosted the growth of the capital stock, and with it capital services As shown on line 4, we estimate that the accompanying step-up in capital deepening has contributed a bit more than  1/2 percentage point to the acceleration of trend labor productivity Multifactor productivity--line 6--which captures the efficiency with which capital and labor inputs are utilized, is projected to be on an upward trend of about 1/3 percentage point per year, well above the average pace of the preceding 15 years  As we see it, there are risks on both sides of our projection of trend productivity On the downside, productivity is a sensitive cyclical variable and extracting the trend from the cycle in the midst of a strong upswing in activity is exceedingly difficult It's possible that the recent improvement in labor productivity will prove less durable when output slows than we are currently assuming On the upside, multifactor productivity in the past couple of years grew faster than the 1/3 percentage point per annum that we have pencilled in as the trend Moreover, the explosion of investment, especially in the high-tech area, suggests that businesses are anticipating ample rates of return that would be consistent with some greater increase in the marginal efficiency of investment  As you can see from the dashed extension of the black line in the middle panel, we are projecting that actual labor productivity will grow a bit more slowly than trend, on average, over the next six quarters In part, we anticipate that productivity will exhibit a fairly typical slowing when activity decelerates as, for a time, employers continue to fill outstanding vacancies We also have incorporated a minor dent in productivity growth--on the order of a tenth or two in 1998 and 1999--for the diversion of resources to addressing the Year 2000 problem  With regard to labor input, the abundance of job opportunities in this tight market has lifted the labor force participation rate--the lower left    6/30-7/1/98  panel--to a level above our estimated trend Going forward, we anticipate that, with jobs remaining readily available and real wages rising, the participation rate will hold roughly constant at 671 percent  The flat participation rate implies that the growth of the labor force--the first column in the lower right panel--should mirror the roughly one percentage point per year expansion in the working age population Employment growth--the second column--is projected to slow considerably, in lagged response to the downshift in activity To place this in some perspective, we are looking for payroll employment to slow from average increases of more than 250,000 per month over the past year to about 100,000 per month next year  Turning to the upper left panel of Chart 13, with the growth of employment dropping below that of the labor force, the unemployment rate is projected to rise gradually to a shade below 5 percent, relieving only some of the pressure on what is a very tight market Anecdotal reports continue to stress the difficulties that many employers are experiencing in finding and retaining workers--difficulties that are especially acute in hot fields such as information technology These perceptions appear to be shared by households As shown in the upper right panel, the proportion of respondents to the June Conference Board survey viewing jobs as plentiful outstripped those reporting jobs as hard to get by a wide margin, in a dramatic reversal of the situation that existed earlier this decade  The influence of taut markets on labor compensation is likely to be reinforced over the next year and a half by continued acceleration of health insurance costs A recent Peat Marwick survey of large firms found that health insurance premiums are expected to rise about 3-1/4 percent this year--a still modest increase but one that is, nonetheless, the highest in four years We are anticipating an extension of this uptrend next year--consistent with the reports of outsized increases that are scheduled to take effect or that are under negotiation  That said, not all of the influences on labor compensation are likely to be in the upward direction We are not anticipating a repeat of the minimum wage increases of the past two years Moreover, as we noted in the Greenbook, bonuses, commissions, and other forms of flexible compensation that are tied to business performance should level out or turn down next year, as activity slows and profits edge lower More broadly, most measures of inflation expectations have moved down over the past year The Michigan SRC results--plotted in the middle right--have moved up a bit recently but on net are still below the readings of the past few years Low past and prospective inflation should be a source of restraint on wage  determination over the next year    6/30-7/1/98  On balance, the growth of ECI compensation per hour--shown by the red line in the lower left panel--is projected to be about flat this year and next, near its recent 3-1/2 percent pace  Turning to the upper left panel of Chart 14, these nominal increases have translated into relatively rapid gains in real wages, especially measured in terms of product prices As may be seen, gains in real compensation per hour outstripped the growth in trend productivity last year, and the gap is expected to remain wide this year and next As a consequence, the markup of prices over trend unit labor costs--shown in the upper right panel--is expected to move down still further in coming quarters  One of the main factors behind this apparent restraint on the pricing power of businesses has been the rapid expansion of productive capacity Manufacturing capacity utilization, shown in the middle left panel, essentially has been moving sideways at a relatively neutral level for about two years Moreover, we anticipate that the weakening of activity in the factory sector will result in some reduction of utilization rates over the next year and a half Consistent with the view that there are few pressures on industrial capacity, purchasing managers' reports on vendor performance--the right panel--have been nearly balanced in recent months between those reporting slower deliveries and those reporting faster deliveries  In addition to ample domestic capacity, the spill-over from Asia has left a clear mark on global commodity markets and should provide some further damping of inflation pressures Non-oil commodity prices--the lower left panel--have plummeted over the past year, and we are not anticipating much if any recovery in these prices over the forecast interval A rather similar story has been apparent in oil markets Weakening world demand and excess inventories that built up over the warm winter have pushed prices sharply lower in recent months We are expecting efforts by OPEC and non-OPEC producers to result in only a limited rebound in the spot price of West Texas intermediate--the black line in the lower right panel--from its average level of about $1350 per barrel in June to about $1600 by early next year  The steep drop in oil prices that has occurred to date is expected to depress consumer energy prices--the black bars in the upper left panel of Chart 15--by about 51/2 percent this year And, next year, retail energy prices are anticipated to retrace only a small part of this year's decline With regard to the agricultural outlook, considerable uncertainty always attends our forecast at this point in the year But, in brief, we are not projecting any significant disruptions to production that would move food price inflation--the red bars in the panel--off the moderate pace of the past year or so    6/30-7/1/98  The decline of core non-oil import prices--the upper right panel--is projected to steepen to a 2-1/4 percent rate this year, after decreases of about 3/4 percent in each of the past two years Although we do not anticipate any sharp reversal, these prices are likely to turn up next year as the dollar retraces some of its recent gains and as prices on world commodity markets stabilize after their recent plunge  Slumping import prices and ample domestic capacity in the goods sector have resulted in somewhat greater disinflation among consumer commodities--the blue line in the middle panel--than among consumer services--the black line The 2-1/2 percentage point gap between goods and services inflation that has opened up recently is larger than the historical norm And, we are expecting the gap to remain relatively wide over the next six quarters  All told, we expect the total CPI--line 1 in the lower panel--to pick up from a 1 percent pace this year to a 2-1/4 percent rate in 1999, pushed up largely by less favorable price developments for energy and imports As you know, the stability that we are showing in our forecast of the core CPI--line 2--masks an underlying acceleration of these prices On a technically consistent basis--line 3--we expect a pickup in core CPI inflation of about 1/2 percentage point between 1997 and 1999  We present these technically consistent figures in the Greenbook in order to facilitate a comparison of our forecast with the historical published data But, that should not obscure the fact that we believe that changes being made to the CPI are making it more accurate over time Line 4 in the table--labeled ""actual"" CPI excluding food and energy--provides a somewhat different slant on this issue by adjusting the historical and projected core CPI for our estimate of the bias in each year Viewed from this perspective, the 1/2 percentage point acceleration that we are projecting boosts core CPI inflation from slightly above 1 percent in 1997 to a bit less than 1 percent in 1999 The final line in the table displays our forecast for total GDP prices adjusted for measurement bias On this basis, we project GDP prices to rise about 3/4 percent this year and a bit more than 1 percent next year  Chart 16 addresses two risks to the forecast First, in light of recent disappointing events in Asia, we consider a still more pessimistic scenario for that region that hinges on upcoming events in Japan Although there have been some signs recently that the Japanese government finally will act decisively to deal with its banking crisis, this is by no means a foregone conclusion An unfavorable outcome in the Upper House elections in two weeks or growing concern about the negative effects of the credit crunch could still result in policy inaction, leading to a sharp further decline in the yen; we have picked 175 yen per dollar as the bottom in this scenario,    6/30-7/1/98  though considerably weaker numbers have been bandied about in recent market commentary In this scenario, we assume that the Hong Kong and Chinese currency pegs would give way and that resulting financial market turmoil would drag Asian GDP down another 7 percent below baseline by the end of 1999 We also assume that the contagion would spread to Latin America and Eastern Europe, with reductions in growth there Finally, we assume that the US stock market would take a 20 percent hit In brief, this is not yet the black hole scenario, but it is taking a few steps closer to the edge Running this scenario through the staff's model with the federal funds rate held unchanged, and allowing for feedbacks to imports, we get a reduction in US real net exports, as shown by the gap between the red and black lines at the right, of about 1/2 percent of GDP by the end of 1999, roughly similar to the markdown in net exports since the January Greenbook shown by the blue line The effect of this shock on US exports is larger, eventually reaching 1 percent of GDP, but feedbacks that reduce imports also cut the decline in net exports In contrast, a good deal of the decline in net exports since January occurred because imports were stronger than expected  The second alternative scenario is a dollar depreciation If events in Asia turn out as our baseline forecast assumes, with markets beginning to dwell less on Asia's problems, two factors could begin to weigh heavily on the dollar One is events in Europe With jitters over the introduction of the euro out of the way and confidence brimming with robust growth in Euroland, there is a risk that the dollar's rise against European currencies over the past year and a half will be reversed Similarly, with conditions in Asia beginning to stabilize, the outsized US trade deficit and Asian trade surpluses will attract growing attention in the markets In this scenario, we have the dollar fully reversing its rise since 1996, with the mark/euro going to 140 and the yen to 120 by mid-1999 As indicated at the right, this 17 percent depreciation of the dollar generates an 8 percent increase in core import prices by the end of 1999  The implications of these scenarios for US GDP growth and inflation are shown in the bottom panel With the federal funds rate held unchanged, the pessimistic Asia scenario would reduce GDP growth to 13 percent in the second half of 1998 and to less than 1 percent in 1999 The drop in the stock market accounts for more than a third of the effect The dollar depreciation would raise GDP growth through stimulus to net exports As indicated in the last line of the table, it would also raise CPI inflation above 3 percent in 1999 and close to 4 percent in 2000 Mr Prell will now continue our presentation   It is deflated by the nonfarm business price index So, it is a  product price deflator "
5108,1998-08-18," One factor in thinking about the spending outlook is that it is  conceivable that as variable pay becomes more important, profits will become less variable and  labor income more variable That is, when there is a slowdown in the expansion, more of it will  show up in the form of a slowdown in labor income than in capital income Past estimates  typically have indicated higher marginal propensities to consume out of labor income than out of  capital income than had previously been the case If those propensities were to remain the same,  the implication would be that consumer spending could be more cyclically sensitive Arguing from  first principles, however, one might think that those marginal propensities to consume would  change if in fact people began to recognize that their labor income was indeed more variable now  than in the past In essence, the marginal propensity to consume out of labor income should shrink  somewhat as consumers perceive that any movements in their labor income may now be more  transitory than was the case earlier Those are just some conjectures about how changing  compensation practices could affect spending Consumer income might become more variable and  spending more sensitive to income changes if people continued to consume out of permanent  income as they have in the past That effect might be muted to the extent that their behavior  actually changes when they recognize that the sensitivity of their labor incomes to changing  economic conditions has increased    8/18/98   Right "
5174,1998-09-29," The changes in the international environment just sketched out by Ted Truman were important elements in the alterations that we made to the Greenbook forecast However, as you know, we also have had to contend with the noticeably more negative domestic financial conditions of the past month or so The stock market has dropped roughly 5 percent over the intermeeting period and, as Peter Fisher noted, volatility    9/29/98  has been high In fixed-income markets, yields on investment grade debt have only edged down, despite the sharp drop in rates on comparable Treasuries, and yields in the junk market have risen steeply Moreover, our special survey of senior loan officers revealed that large banks have shifted from a somewhat accommodative to a more restrictive posture for business loans in recent weeks Clearly, there has been a pulling back in financial markets that appears to be part of a reassessment of economic prospects and a repricing of risk  These developments seem likely to leave an imprint on economic activity in coming quarters, and they would have had a more pronounced effect on the top line of our forecast had we not altered our policy assumptions After your conference call last week, we decided to abandon our assumption of an unchanged federal funds rate in favor of a decline amounting to about 75 basis points by next spring--an assumption not far from market expectations By our reckoning, this path for the funds rate will help to limit the shortfall in activity next year and to restore growth to potential in the latter half of 2000, with the unemployment rate flattening out at about 5-1/2 percent--roughly our estimate of the NAIRU  With activity projected to drop from the 3 to 3-1/2 percent pace of the past couple of years to a rate of about 1 percent in the first half of next year, it's natural to ask, ""how do we get there from here?"" I should begin this discussion by admitting that there is little in the incoming nonfinancial data that is currently signaling the weakness that we expect to emerge by year-end Indeed, the information that we have received over the past month left the starting point for this forecast very similar to that of the August Greenbook--which is an economy that continues to show considerable forward momentum, led by strength in domestic final demands  In that regard, last week's reading on consumer spending for August confirmed our view that, but for a slump in outlays for motor vehicles in response to the GM strike and the end of the coupon incentive programs, the growth of real PCE this quarter would have nearly matched the phenomenal gains of the first half And by most reports, motor vehicle sales are rebounding smartly as supply constraints ease and manufacturers sweeten incentives Housing starts, though off a bit in August, remain at an exceptionally high level, with mortgage applications for home purchases and builder attitudes suggesting continued strength over the near term  In the business sector, the figures on shipments of capital equipment, which we received after the Greenbook was completed, were marginally weaker than we had incorporated in the projection But the underlying growth in new orders points to reasonably healthy gains in equipment spending in coming months--especially in the high-tech area And, given the low level of initial claims, businesses apparently are hiring at a brisk pace All in all, it's still a pretty strong picture    9/29/98  That said, there are a few straws in the wind that hint at some downshift in the pace of the expansion Increases in payroll employment in July and August, on net, fell below the gains of the first half, with pronounced weakness evident in the factory sector That weakness is consistent with industrial production which, excluding motor vehicles, has been flat since May Reports from purchasing managers, anecdotal information, and the slump in commodity prices seem to be pointing to a continued sluggish manufacturing performance--a view that receives support from the recent declines in weekly steel production The preliminary reading on consumer sentiment from the Michigan survey for September also slipped some, with households citing the stock market and foreign developments as contributing factors The Conference Board survey, released this morning, fell to its lowest level this year At this point, it's simply too early to tell whether these shreds of evidence are just statistical noise or the harbingers of slowing activity  Clearly, in our projection we see a number of the factors that boosted production earlier in the year acting to restrain activity later this year and in early 1999 One of these is nonauto inventory investment, where we think a further reduction in the pace of accumulation will be necessary to prevent imbalances from developing The reduced pace of stockbuilding is expected to lop off more than 3/4 percentage point from the growth of real GDP in the second half  But the real action in the forecast follows from the sharp slowdown that we are projecting for private domestic final demands That slowdown results not only from the waning of positive financial influences that propelled growth previously, but their partial reversal in many cases With corporate earnings expected to continue sagging in coming quarters, we anticipate that equity prices will decline still further High and rising equity values no doubt contributed importantly to the six percent annual rate gains in consumption in the first half of this year Over the next few months, this stimulus should dissipate, and the past and prospective decline in household net worth should begin to cut into spending Housing starts also received a boost from higher stock prices as well as from a strong job market and declining mortgage interest rates Although we expect mortgage rates to hover around their recent lows, the drop in stock prices and the slower income and employment growth that we are projecting should turn housing from the considerable plus observed in 1998 to a modest negative in the first half of next year  We do not anticipate business fixed investment to escape this period unscathed A less favorable external financing environment, a slowing in cash flow, and diminished sales expectations seem likely to leave a clear mark on investment plans as we move into next year These forces will be intense in the manufacturing sector, where continued declines in export demand and heightened import competition will slow the desired rate of    9/29/98  capacity expansion Financing difficulties are expected to be notable for office and other commercial construction projects Although these negatives result in a deceleration of fixed investment from the heady pace of recent years, capital outlays are still expected to outpace growth in real output Declining relative prices and associated rapid technological changes should continue to provide support for capital spending  Taken together with the continued drag from the external sector, we expect these influences to hold growth of real GDP to about 1 percent in the first half of next year Thereafter, the lagged effects of our assumed easing of monetary policy, the slight decline in the real exchange value of the dollar, and the gradual recovery in foreign economies combine to provide some lift to real activity Abstracting from a few highly speculative wrinkles that we have incorporated to account for possible Year 2000 effects, growth in real GDP increases from about 1-3/4 percent in the second half of next year to about 2-3/4 percent in late 2000  There are, as usual, substantial risks to this forecast We highlighted in the Greenbook the consequences of alternative scenarios for the stock market and for international developments, largely because we continue to see these areas as posing the greatest risks to the forecast This morning, I thought I would mention a couple of other risks to the outlook  On the upside, there simply may be more near-term momentum to the economy than is contemplated by our projection As I noted earlier, most of the incoming economic indicators have remained upbeat of late And while we expect the economic news over the next month or so to remain fairly bright, forward indicators will need to show a considerable softening before too long in order to be on track for our first-half slowdown Given the resilience that the US economy has exhibited in this expansion and, at least until recently, the basically sound fundamentals, household and business spending plans may prove more durable than we have projected This upside risk would be further amplified if the negative sentiment that has gripped financial markets in recent weeks were to be substantially alleviated by an easing of policy We don't see that as the best bet, but it is a possibility  On the downside, there are always risks associated with negotiating a slowdown in aggregate demand of the dimension included in our forecast Despite the sharp downshift in growth that we are projecting for the first half of next year, this forecast can still be characterized as one in which the economy achieves a ""soft landing"" By that I mean that in our projection firms, by and large, foresee the softening of demand and adjust production promptly, preventing the imbalances in inventories, in capital equipment, and in workers that have tipped slowdowns into recessions at times in the past    9/29/98  Finally, I don't have much to add to our Greenbook discussion of the outlook for wages and prices The inflation projection and its determinants have changed little since the last meeting, and we continue to be on the low side of the consensus Consumer prices are projected to pick up some next year After declining sharply this year, both oil and non-oil import prices turn up in 1999, and labor markets will be tight through the middle of 2000 Nevertheless, we believe that there will be some important factors limiting the deterioration in inflation Weak demand and ample capacity in the factory sector are expected to result in further declines in capacity utilization rates, and that should help keep a lid on goods prices  In addition, we expect that growth in hourly compensation will soon level out and then drift lower over the projection period We expect this restraint on nominal pay gains to come from both the supply and the demand sides of the labor market On the demand side, with profit margins under pressure and the climate inhospitable to price increases, firms are likely to resist outsized pay increases Moreover, some forms of flexible pay should decelerate Certainly, bonuses in the financial industry are not heading for a banner year On the supply side, even though unemployment remains low, a rising jobless rate may trim pay demands if latent worker insecurities resurface But perhaps most importantly, the drop in inflation this year and the attendant ebbing of inflation expectations are anticipated to help perpetuate the current low-inflation environment  Mr Chairman, that completes our presentation   There is some downside risk there I think the size of the stock  market correction we have in this forecast, taken by itself, would have been expected to boost the  saving rate by at least a couple of tenths I should point out that one of the things that keeps the  saving rate down is that we do have some offset coming from lower interest rates, and we do  have some offset coming through when income growth slows below its permanent rate That  helps to hold up consumption a little    9/29/98   But I think there is some downside risk there as you suggest "
5364,1999-02-02," Your next few charts focus on the aggregate  supply side of the economy, beginning with a question raised at a number  of recent meetings, “Just how low is inflation?” The upper left panel of  Chart 11 displays the four-quarter changes in two alternative measures of  consumer prices, the PCE chain price index--the black line--and the CPI-­ the red line Prior to 1995, these two indexes increased at roughly the  same pace, on average Since then, however, PCE inflation has been  running consistently below that of the CPI, with the difference last year  about ¾ percentage point For the measures excluding food and energy,  shown at the right, the gap was even larger last year--about 1¼ percentage  points   The middle left panel highlights the major differences between the  CPI and the PCE indexes One important difference is the aggregation  formulas The CPI uses fixed weights at both the detailed and more  aggregate levels, while the PCE index uses weights that vary with  spending patterns from period to period All told, these aggregation  differences account for about three-fourths of the gap between the reported  inflation rates over the past couple of years     2/2-3/99 31   A second difference is the scope of the two indexes The CPI covers  the out-of-pocket expenditures of urban workers, while the PCE measure  covers total consumer spending For example, PCE includes third-party  payments of medical costs by insurance companies and the government  The PCE index also includes services provided to individuals by nonprofit  institutions   A third difference is that, while the PCE index is mostly constructed  using components of the CPI, the BEA occasionally uses price data from  other sources Most prominently in recent years, they have been using a  measure of medical service prices that has increased considerably less than  the corresponding measure in the CPI   Finally, the weights used in the indexes are developed from different  source data; the CPI uses spending reported by households in the  Consumer Expenditure Survey, while the PCE weights are derived from  various economic censuses One notable difference is that the weight of  housing in the CPI is considerably larger than that in the PCE index  Because housing prices have been rising relatively rapidly, this has given  an added push to the CPI To get a sense of the importance of the  weighting and price differences, we recalculated the CPI using weights  derived from the PCE data and the PCE’s measure of medical service  prices As you can see by comparing the red and blue lines in the middle  right panel, this exercise suggests that about another ¼ percentage point of  the difference can be accounted for by these factors   The lower left panel lists some of the pros and cons of the PCE price  measure relative to the CPI Clearly, as a measure of the cost of living, the  chain formula of the PCE index is superior to the fixed-weight structure of  the CPI, because it avoids substitution bias In addition, the PCE program  has been more flexible in introducing new measurement techniques, and  the index can be revised to incorporate new source data For example,  unlike the PCE index, the historical CPI data will never be revised to  incorporate the geometric mean weighting that will be introduced this  year That said, the PCE price index does have one significant  shortcoming and that is its reliance on imputed measures of service prices  for some major components These imputations, about 3½ percent of the  total index, are not actual measures of market prices, but rather are BEA  constructions, most using input cost information of questionable  reliability   These imputed prices have had a pronounced effect on the pattern of  PCE inflation of late The deceleration in core PCE over the past year is  almost entirely attributable to the slowdown in imputed service prices     2/2-3/99 32   As shown in the lower right panel, excluding these prices, the increase in  core PCE was 1¼ percent last year, the same as in 1997 The bottom line  of our analysis is that consumer price inflation almost certainly has been  running below the rates suggested by the CPI, but the extent of the  slowing suggested by core PCE is considerably less certain   Of course, we think that even these low rates of measured PCE  inflation are still biased upward; PCE prices suffer from many of the same  deficiencies of quality adjustment that afflict the CPI The shaded band in  the upper left-hand panel of Chart 12 shows a one percentage point wide  confidence interval around our estimate of the upward bias in the PCE  price index, which we put at about ½ percentage point per year By this  assessment, we may well have been at price stability last year   As may be seen, our projection anticipates some turnaround in  inflation over the next two years By 2000, total PCE inflation picks up  about one percentage point and the change in core PCE increases by about  ½ percentage point Some of the acceleration reflects our expectation that  imputed service prices will rebound from the unusually low increases of  the past year More important, we are anticipating some reversal of the  favorable influences that have been helping to hold down inflation over  the past couple of years Food prices--the black bars in the middle left  panel--are expected to be a neutral influence But, retail energy prices-­ the red bars in the middle left panel--are projected to post modest  increases over the next two years, after plunging in 1998 Moreover, core  non-oil import prices--the middle right panel--are expected to register their  first increases since 1995   As Mike noted earlier, indicators of tautness in product and labor  markets, as measured by capacity utilization and the unemployment rate,  continue to diverge As shown in the lower two panels, that difference  does not appear to be a statistical artifact Business reports on vendor  delivery performance, the left panel, reveal few if any signs of production  bottlenecks In contrast, the percent of households that perceive jobs as  plentiful--the black line on the right--exceed those reporting that jobs are  hard to get--the red line--by a very wide margin   Turning to the upper panel of Chart 13, tight labor markets have been  an important factor driving an acceleration of real wages, measured here  as ECI compensation per hour deflated by the nonfarm business price  index However, owing to low price inflation, hefty real wage gains have  required only a modest acceleration in nominal compensation over the past  couple of years To be sure, favorable price shocks provided an extra boost  to real wage growth that we are expecting to recede as these influences are  partly reversed in coming quarters But more fundamentally, we expect     2/2-3/99 33   the legacy of the recent low inflation to put a lid on inflation expectations,  and thus nominal wage demands, despite the tightness of labor markets   The simulations presented in the middle panel highlight some risks  surrounding this outlook A model in which wages are a function of,  among other variables, past consumer price inflation and the  unemployment rate--the dashed blue line--projects increases in ECI  compensation per hour that are even lower than the staff projection   The picture is quite different, however, if wages are determined not  by past price inflation or inflation expectations, but rather by the past  momentum in wage increases A model with these characteristics--the red  line--projects a substantial acceleration in compensation per hour over the  next two years Barring a further increase in productivity growth, a step- up in labor costs of this dimension likely could not be absorbed entirely in  business profit margins and would result in more serious upward pressure  on price inflation than is envisioned in our forecast   As you can see, the staff projection--the black line--is shaded toward  the wage-price model We read the statistical evidence as favoring this  specification, but our projection is above this model because we are  skeptical that inflation expectations have fallen as much as suggested by  this model’s straight reading of lagged prices And, we remain impressed  by the anecdotal reports that wages are under upward pressure   In the lower panel, the staff projection for core PCE is compared with  two reduced-form models in which price inflation depends on lagged  prices and alternative measures of resource utilization The staff price  projection--the black dashed line in the lower panel--is a bit higher than a  reduced-form model using the unemployment rate--the red line--largely  because we do not believe some of the special factors that have held down  core PCE, most notably the imputed services, will carry forward An  identical model that uses manufacturing capacity utilization as the  measure of resource utilization, the blue line, suggests a more serious  departure from the staff projection Over the longer haul, the empirical  evidence provides a slight edge to the unemployment rate formulation,  though in the past couple of years the capacity utilization model has been  closer to the mark Taken together, the model results suggest that, while  there may be some upside risk to our wage projection that could well feed  through to prices, the low expected rate of factory utilization implies that  the inflation risks are not one-sided   Your next chart reviews the productivity projection As you know,  last spring we revised up our estimate of trend productivity growth--line 3  in the upper panel--to 18 percent at an annual rate As may be seen on  line 4, the investment boom of recent years has lifted considerably the     2/2-3/99 34   pace of capital deepening--that is, the increase in capital per worker And,  the available data hint at some step-up in the growth of multifactor  productivity--line 6   The recent behavior of labor productivity appears to have conformed  reasonably well with our estimate that some acceleration has occurred in  the underlying trend The middle panel shows our estimate of trend  productivity (the thin black line), actual productivity (the thick black line),  and a simulation of a productivity model that attempts to capture cyclical  variation around that trend (the red line) As can be seen, simulated  productivity closely matched actual last year   The recent behavior of the unemployment rate also provides some  support for our productivity assumption The lower panel shows the  actual unemployment rate--the black line--and a simulation of Okun’s law  starting in 1990--the red line As you can see, the simulation using our  estimate of potential output growth of 21 percent in the first half of the  1990s and 28 percent since then has tracked the unemployment rate  closely in recent years   While the recent data have been kinder to this aspect of our projection  than many others, it’s far too soon to feel confident It should come as no  surprise that putting additional breaks in our estimate of trend productivity  improves the fit of these equations, and it is certainly possible that after we  complete this business cycle our upward adjustment of the trend will have  proven too optimistic On the other hand, if we are in the midst of an  ongoing improvement in the pace of technological advance or  organizational efficiency, further upside surprises could be at hand The  greater productivity implied by last Friday’s GDP release, if it should hold  up through revisions, would provide some support to that view   In assembling this Chart Show, we briefly contemplated dispensing  with a discussion of our baseline Greenbook forecast in favor of  presenting only alternatives, given that the experience of the past year  might suggest that this Greenbook’s alternative will be next Greenbook’s  baseline [Laughter] In the end, we decided not to take that approach, but  your next chart is offered in that spirit Perhaps one of the largest risks  surrounding the performance of the domestic economy is associated with  the course of the stock market In this chart, I consider the consequences  of both a continued boom and of an abrupt bust in the market   In the boom scenario, we have assumed that the gains in the stock  market continue apace, with a decline in the equity premium sufficient to  boost the stock market--the blue line in the upper left panel--by 20 percent  in each of the next two years, all else equal Monetary policy is assumed  to respond to this shock according to the Taylor rule In contrast to our     2/2-3/99 35   baseline assumption of no change in the federal funds rate through the end  of 2000--shown as the black line in the upper right panel--the stronger  activity prompted by the booming stock market results in a 100 basis point  increase in the funds rate by the end of next year This tightening of  policy leans against the strengthening of activity, but it is not prompt  enough or large enough to prevent the unemployment rate--the lower left  panel--from falling below 4 percent  Despite that, the inflation rate--the  lower right panel--remains about unchanged from that in the baseline; in  the model’s view, the increase in interest rates would boost the exchange  value of the dollar enough to offset the inflationary effects of tighter labor  markets   In the bust scenario--shown as the red line in all four panels--we have  assumed an increase in the equity premium that would, all else equal,  produce a 40 percent decline in the stock market by the third quarter of  this year In this simulation, the Taylor rule calls for a cut in the funds rate  of 125 basis points by the end of next year The unemployment rate rises  to 4¾ percent by the end of next year Again, the inflation rate is little  changed from the baseline path   In constructing these scenarios, I have deliberately kept the  alternatives simple In neither case have I allowed for any special  disruptions to financial markets or to the real economy not already  accounted for by the structure of the model   However, if either scenario were to materialize, it is not difficult to  envision a considerably more challenging policy environment For  example, a continuing boom could, at some point, spill over more  noticeably into other asset markets--adding extra stimulus to activity and  inflation On the other hand, a steep decline in the stock market could  have more adverse consequences for the behavior of capital markets and  for credit provision than is embodied in these simulations Moreover, if  such a decline were to trigger an abrupt shift in the economic outlook of  businesses or households, the risks of a sharp cyclical downturn would  increase markedly   The final chart presents your economic projections for 1999 The  central tendency of your forecasts shows expected growth of nominal  GDP of 4 to 4½ percent this year This is accompanied by growth of real  GDP between 2½ and 3 percent, leaving the unemployment rate in the 4¼  to 4½ percent range The increase in the CPI is projected to be in the  neighborhood of 2 to 2½ percent Mr Chairman, that concludes our  presentation    Yes, it was    It would have taken a couple of tenths off the forecast Our   price is just a dollar or so higher than the market’s, so the effect would be a tenth or two   If one wanted to assume that oil prices stay flat going forward, that would take another     2/2-3/99 38   couple of tenths off, roughly speaking The assumptions we have made on both the   import price side and on the oil price are critical factors in explaining the upturn we have   forecast in inflation    We are doing the full accounting On PCE price inflation,   flat oil prices and, let’s say, 1 percent slower non-oil import price inflation would take   about 02 off the forecast we are showing in 1999 and 04 off in 2000, including all of the   feedback effects    I would say it works principally because the manufacturing   sector is the most cyclical component of the entire economy and therefore involves     2/2-3/99 40   enough variation to pick up some correlation with what is going on in product markets   more generally It certainly amplifies, in some sense, what is happening in product   markets more generally But your basic observation that this is focused on a very narrow   portion of the economy is precisely what makes us hesitant to go the full distance toward   this model We know that in the current circumstances, given what is happening to our   trade accounts, there should be special stress in the manufacturing sector and that,   therefore, it might not be as reliable an indicator of overall economic conditions as it has   been in the past when we have not seen such disparate behavior between the goods sector   and the rest of the economy    The outcome is quite close to the unemployment equation   results    It does that except one has to remember that the way we   construct the GDP gap is basically a version of Okun’s law It is a little more   complicated than that, but it does not bring much additional information to bear relative   to what is already incorporated in Okun’s law    Right    Over this two-year period that is exactly in line with the basic   rules of thumb, yes It is certainly true that there is enormous uncertainty in all these   estimates Indeed, in terms of the capacity utilization type equations, we are in essence   below the model’s estimate for the natural rate of capacity utilization It might even   suggest, as this simulation indicates, that there could be some further downward pressure   on inflation if that in fact were the measure of overall resource utilization    I think the clearest area where the PCE has that kind of   problem is that it includes prices associated with nonprofit institutions such as religious   organizations and other charitable organizations If prices in those areas are changing     2/2-3/99 43   because the statisticians are imputing prices for labor costs and so forth, I don’t think that   affects anybody’s expectation very much Clearly, one might argue that the nonmarket   price portion of the PCE is not so relevant   On the other hand, I think that most people probably are not looking only at their   out-of-pocket expenditures in considering what is happening with the overall price   situation For example, in the area of insurance costs they might very well care about   third party payments or the part that the government is picking up I view the weighting   structure in the PCE as clearly superior and probably closer to what most people   perceive It does not involve a fixed market basket of goods that people were consuming   five or six years ago but is more a period-to-period type of weighting structure that   probably is much closer to what people perceive is happening    The PCE weighting is probably more appropriate and closer   to most people’s thinking than the fixed-weight structure of the CPI    I would add just one comment on that Part of the difference   in reporting in the consumer expenditure survey that is used for the CPI is probably   deliberate It is not necessarily a misconception The fact is that consumers significantly     2/2-3/99 44   underreport their consumption of alcoholic beverages and tobacco Now, it could very   well be that they just don’t remember [Laughter]  "
5679,1999-11-16," President Jordan, based on our model, $5 a barrel more on oil   prices over the forecast horizon would add roughly ¼ percentage point to consumer price   inflation in the next two years     11/16/99 14  "
5741,1999-12-21," The most important change in the model, relative to where it   was a few years ago, is the reaction of the economy and the agents in the economy when we   don’t tighten in a period when the economy is strong In that case, people think we have   revised up our inflation target, whereas in the past our model basically assumed that all   agents were backward-looking People just looked at where inflation had been; and the way   that monetary policy influenced the inflation outlook going forward was simply through its   effect on aggregate demand Now there is some independent effect through forward-looking   expectations that leads to a more rapid adjustment of inflation expectations I think that is   the principal difference In looking at the response of the economy to changes in the funds     12/21/99 14   rate, we were unable to convince ourselves that there had been a significant change in either   the economic structure or the model’s response to monetary policy at some deeper level   But I think the way the model is now constructed does make it more sensitive to the conduct   of monetary policy It wasn’t even a question that arose in our old MPS model    One other area where over time there has been some structural   change in the economy that has tended to increase the sensitivity of output to interest rates   has been through the increasing openness of the economy and the exchange rate mechanism    If you enter both the Michigan Survey’s forward-looking   expectations and lagged prices into a wage equation, typically both will have some   explanatory power Whether you really and truly have identified those two separate effects,   given their co-linearities, would be a tough call    There is one piece of evidence, though, suggesting that our   estimated wealth effect is not too far off base And that is that the decline in the saving rate   we have seen has been roughly consistent with what the consumption equation uses--that is,   what a 3 to 4 cents on the dollar wealth effect would suggest should be the case You are   absolutely right that the hard part in estimating these effects is that we know we are   estimating ultimately the consumption effect from changes in stock prices Those are very   noisy What people are really reacting to, in essence, is their perception of the persistence of     12/21/99 17   those stock prices And what the distributed lag picks up is the fact that because the data are   noisy we do not see an immediate response to every movement in stock prices That’s   because many people, in making their decisions, are trying to determine how much of that   movement in stock prices is, in fact, going to persist and how much is transitory So the   distributed lag would pick up smaller coefficients, let’s say, of the effect of the stock price   change in the first quarter simply because many people are uncertain as to whether or not   that change will be permanent or transitory If they knew for sure, the lagged coefficient   would be biased down because they would, in fact, respond more strongly to that movement   in stock prices   In terms of the disaggregated data, we have a lot of work yet to do We have a   variety of different data sets and projects that we are pursuing to try to pin down better the   size of this wealth effect I would feel more comfortable if I saw micro level evidence that   supported our hypothesis that we are actually experiencing a wealth effect of the size that   the time series evidence is purporting to pick up I say that because, as our colleagues in   New York have pointed out, there is uncertainty in these estimates for sure    I’ve asked our consumption experts that question They claim   that there has not been much success thus far in their effort to work the volatility in stock   prices into those consumption functions It may be a function of the fact that, when we are   using the aggregate time series data, we are asking far too much from those data and more   than they are going to be able to return The micro level evidence may provide some better   fix on that  "
5802,2000-02-01,"  The upper panel of the next chart displays our   inflation projection  As depicted by the black line, consumer prices,  measured by the PCE chain-weight index, accelerated a percentage point  last year to 2 percent--a pace we expect to hold this year and next  That  relative stability masks what we anticipate will be some deterioration in the  underlying inflation picture  After remaining nearly unchanged at about a   1-1/2 percent pace since 1996, core PCE inflation--the red line--is projected  to drift up gradually to a bit above 2 percent over the next two years     Food prices, the middle left panel, are not expected to exert much   influence on headline inflation  Improving export demand and rising labor  costs result in an increase in these prices that is just a bit faster than core   By contrast, retail energy prices--the right panel--were the principal reason  for last year’s acceleration of overall PCE prices and their deceleration this  year and next contributes to the relative stability of overall PCE prices going  forward     The slowdown of energy prices provides an offset to a variety of   influences on inflation that already have begun to turn less favorable  Core  non-oil import prices--the lower left panel--moved up last year following  three years of decline  And we anticipate continued--albeit modest--upward  pressure on import prices over the projection period     Prices of domestically manufactured intermediate materials--the black   line in the lower right panel--also picked up last year  The rebound has been          26  driven by the strengthening of industrial activity that has accompanied the  recovery abroad, as well as by the indirect effects of higher oil prices  This  morning’s reading from the purchasing managers’ survey for January on  prices paid--the red line--suggests that upward pressures have continued  early this year     Developments in labor markets, the subject of your next chart, also are   expected to provide some impetus to inflation over the next two years  As  shown in the upper left panel, employer costs for health insurance continued  to accelerate last year after a period of virtual stability in the mid-1990s   Our forecast is roughly consistent with the available private surveys, which  suggest these pressures have not yet diminished and may well be  intensifying     We also are anticipating the enactment of a one dollar increase in the   minimum wage, split evenly between October of this year and October  2001  As shown in the panel to the right, we expect these increases to exert  a relatively small effect on compensation costs over the next two years and  to be an even smaller influence on prices     The middle two panels highlight what we believe are likely to be the   more fundamental influences on inflation over the next two years--the  tightness of labor markets and some deterioration of inflation expectations   As indicated in the left panel, households perceive a very strong job market   The gap between households reporting that jobs are plentiful and those  reporting that jobs are hard to get is now extremely large  With regard to  inflation expectations, the right panel, both direct survey readings and  econometric proxies for the influence of price inflation on wage setting have  become less helpful over the past year  Median one-year-ahead inflation  expectations in the Michigan survey--the black line--have moved up about  1/2 percentage point over the past year  And, distributed lags of past  consumer prices, constructed using either PCE prices or the CPI, turned up  last year and are poised to increase further in coming quarters     The bottom line is that we are anticipating some resumption of the   uptrend in labor costs  As we have noted in recent Greenbooks, there are  serious flaws in both major measures of compensation change  The  employment cost index--the red line--excludes many types of hiring and  retention bonuses, misses the use of promotions as a means of raising  wages, and excludes stock options  Given the increasing prevalence of these  and other alternative forms of compensation, the ECI likely has  underestimated compensation costs in recent years  The nonfarm business  compensation measure--the black line--does capture “promotion creep” and  includes stock options  However, it measures stock options at their value  when exercised rather than the grant value when issued, and thus may          27  overstate the cost and distort the timing of firms’ payments for labor  services  Moreover, the nonfarm business measure is estimated with  information on benefits that is less timely than that in the ECI     These uncertainties have made it more difficult to interpret formal   models of price determination that rely on wage data  As a consequence, we  have found ourselves leaning more heavily on models that do not involve an  explicit link to labor costs  One such model is shown in the upper panel of  chart 13  This simple reduced-form model makes core PCE a function of its  own lags; food, energy, and import prices; and the unemployment rate  The  model forecasts a step-up in core PCE inflation over the next two years,  reflecting both the tightness of labor markets and the upturn in import and  energy prices last year  The Greenbook projection also calls for some  acceleration, but not so much as projected by this model  In part, we have  shaded down our forecast on the thought that, with capacity utilization rates  still below historical averages, price pressures may remain more subdued  than suggested by the unemployment rate     As a reminder that science--such as it is--only gets us so far in   narrowing the range of possible outcomes, I have included a 70 percent  confidence interval for the forecast of this model--the blue shaded area  It’s  constructed from stochastic simulations that account for the uncertainty  surrounding the estimates of all of the parameters of this model  As can be  seen, that interval ranges between an outcome with no acceleration in core  PCE to an acceleration that breaches 3 percent by 2001  And, even this  exercise understates the uncertainty you face by failing to account for the  uncertainty surrounding the model’s basic specification of the inflation  process     The lower panels dispense with an analytical framework--save,   perhaps, for a crude version of supply and demand--and simply resort to  counting the frequency with which a very broad measure of prices--the GDP  price index--has accelerated on a year-over-year basis in various ranges of  resource utilization  For example, as shown in the middle left panel, when  the unemployment rate has been in the range of 6 to 7 percent, GDP prices  have accelerated 43 percent of the time  As the unemployment rate  declines, the frequency of price acceleration generally increases  The bar at  the far left shows that prices have accelerated every year in the sample when  the unemployment rate was less than or equal to 4 percent  With our  projection anticipating the unemployment rate to hover near 4 percent over  the next two years, we have clearly entered a danger zone when judged by  the historical performance of inflation     But even this story is a bit murky  We’re expecting capacity   utilization to move up over the next two years, but to remain in the 80 to 82          28  percent interval  As indicated by the corresponding bar in the lower left  panel, that range has been associated more often than not with a pickup in  GDP prices  But the frequency of acceleration in that range--about two- thirds of the time--is not nearly so high as that suggested by our forecast of  the unemployment rate  Of course, as the warning goes, past performance is  no guarantee of future outcomes  Indeed, in the second half of the 1990s--at  least through 1998--we beat the odds suggested by both the models and this  simple summary of historical behavior   By our reckoning, one of the key factors behind the favorable  performance of recent years has been the pickup in potential output and  productivity growth--the subject of your next chart  As shown on line 1 in  the upper panel--we are expecting an acceleration of potential output to a 4  percent rate over 2000 and 2001, reflecting a larger contribution from  capital deepening--line 4  Given our investment projection, the growth of  capital services--the middle left panel--is projected to trend still higher over  the projection interval  Multifactor productivity--at the right--is expected to  continue to increase near the 1 percent pace observed in the past several  years     The 3 percent annual rate increase that we are now projecting for   structural productivity is nearly double the pace averaged over the 1980s  and early 1990s  As has been noted around this table, it is impossible to  know just how far along we are in the process of implementing new  technologies and, consequently, what the scope is for even faster growth of  productivity  The lower panel of the exhibit plots the acceleration of  productivity--that is the change in productivity growth--measured here over  two-year intervals  As can be seen, productivity in the nonfarm business  sector, measured from either the product or the income side, has been  accelerating in recent years  In our projection, we expect actual productivity  to remain close both to the 3 percent pace observed over the past couple of  years and to our estimate of structural gains in productivity  But a further  acceleration certainly cannot be ruled out     Your next chart updates a simulation that we have presented   previously to lay out the sensitivity of our projection to alternative  trajectories for structural productivity  As shown in the upper left panel, the  first scenario--the red line--considers the consequences of a further  acceleration of structural productivity to 4 percent by the end of 2001  In  the remaining panels, I display the economic consequences of that  acceleration using a simulation of the Board staff’s large-scale econometric  model  For purposes of this exercise, I have assumed that the federal funds  rate is held to the baseline path     The growth of real GDP--the upper right panel--is much faster under   the more optimistic productivity assumption  Firms and households boost          29  spending on equipment, structures, and durable goods in response to the  improved future prospects  As we have noted in the past, in our model, the  boost provided to aggregate demand exceeds productivity-augmented supply  in the near term, and, in the simulation, the unemployment rate--the middle  left panel--declines to well below 4 percent  Because wages respond  sluggishly to both the tighter labor markets and the improvement in  productivity, compensation inflation--at the right--is only marginally higher  over the next two years than in the Greenbook  That sluggish behavior of  wages in the face of accelerating productivity leads to an increase in the  profit share--the lower left panel--which provides a boost to equity prices  and feeds back to stronger aggregate demand  Faster productivity growth  and the competitive pressures that follow fatter profit margins also help to  keep a lid on price inflation--the right panel  Core PCE price inflation is  projected to level out at just under 2 percent in the faster productivity  scenario     Of course, it is possible that we have gotten carried away by the stellar   performance of productivity in the past few years  Any reliable separation  of structural from transient increases in productivity is difficult in the midst  of an ongoing expansion  The second scenario shown in the upper left panel  considers a gradual deceleration in structural productivity to about 2 percent  by the end of the forecast interval, well below the pace we believe has  prevailed in recent years but still more rapid than the 1974 to 1995 average   Obviously, the economic outcome would be considerably less favorable  than in the Greenbook  There would be a pronounced slowing in the growth  of real GDP and a clear upturn in the unemployment rate  With productivity  slowing more rapidly than wage inflation, the profit share would drop   Firms would raise prices more quickly in order to restore profit margins that  are squeezed by rising unit labor costs, and core PCE inflation would move  up toward 2-1/2 percent     Mike will now complete our presentation      In fact the underlying assumption here is that monetary policy   accommodates this step-up in nominal GDP  There would be an increase in money growth to go   along with that  Obviously, this is a short-run scenario  I think the simulations that are presented   in the Bluebook tried to give a flavor of the case where we are in the midst of an acceleration in   productivity and the equilibrium real funds rate has to go up along with that  This in effect says   that you could hold on for another two years and experience a period where the unemployment   rate declines even further and the inflation rate basically stays where it has been  Now, at the   end of that two years, you are not where you need to be ultimately  In some sense the funds rate   and the entire structure of interest rates will have to move higher over the longer term in order to   sustain that low inflation     In the constant federal funds rate scenario, there is a very small   increase in the real federal funds rate just because of the slightly lower inflation rate  But your   point is exactly correct     I am not sure I would characterize scenario 1 in quite the same   way you have characterized it  In fact, one could argue--and I think this may be what President   Jordan was arguing--that in scenario 1 you fall further behind the curve in the sense that even   though inflation is not picking up, the unemployment rate is falling even further below its   equilibrium  Indeed, the real federal funds rate is falling even further below its long-run   equilibrium  In that scenario we are enjoying another period of sustained, strong economic   growth and low inflation  But there is still a fair amount of work to be done in scenario 1 in   terms of adjusting policy at some point down the road in order to bring the funds rate back into   equilibrium  Now, you will inherit a lower rate of inflation after going through that process,   which is certainly something that benefits you  But while it is good news for this two-year   period, there is still policy tightening to be done further down the road  That, in fact, is what   some of the longer-run Bluebook simulations are showing     Now, in terms of the probabilities, if one were to judge the probability of scenario 1 by   the staff forecast errors of recent years, one might say that it is not entirely implausible   [Laughter]  Obviously, we think we have a relatively balanced set of risks in our forecast  But as   seen in Chart 14, the most recent observation shows that productivity is still accelerating  So, it   is not entirely clear that the probabilities are split right down the middle between scenario 1 and   scenario 2     That is true  But in this particular scenario, that faster   productivity growth is generated in part through the more rapid multifactor productivity growth   that we’ve had  And there’s some addition to that from the capital deepening  So both of those   factors are working here  "
5902,2000-05-16,"  We got over a percentage point in the first quarter and then, in   our forecast, it slips down considerably in the second quarter  So, we have a little over 1/2   percentage point effect on the PCE growth in the first half, which trails off to about roughly   down 01 or 02 percentage point in the second half  Part of the reason, too, is that the stock   market actually has, on balance, flattened out now  It has had its ups and downs, but the   Wilshire 5000 has not been rising as rapidly as the NASDAQ obviously was earlier  So with   that lag distribution, we are starting to see the positive wealth effect really peter out, even   though we do have considerable lags in that model that are important  "
5955,2000-06-27,"  I think we will!  I, along with Karen Johnson and Larry Slifman,   will be referring to the materials labeled “Staff Presentation on the Economic Outlook” 2    Your first chart provides a brief overview of our outlook  for the US economy over the next year and a half  As you know  from reading the Greenbook, we lowered our projection for the  growth of real GDP a bit, in response to our perception that the  pace of activity may be slowing a touch faster than we had  forecasted in May  But the basic contours of the projection have  changed little  We continue to anticipate that past and prospective  increases in the federal funds rate will lead to a substantial  deceleration in the pace of real domestic spending--the red line in  the upper panel of your first chart  Domestic spending, which has  been rising at more than a 5-1/2 percent pace over the past two  years, is expected to increase just 3-1/2 percent in 2001                                                               2 A copy of the materials used by Mr Stockton, Ms Johnson, and Mr Slifman is appended to this transcript         (Appendix 2)           9  Continuing improvement in real activity abroad and our  projected depreciation of the dollar combine to direct more  demand here and abroad toward US producers  This mutes some  of the effect that slowing domestic demands might otherwise have  had on the growth of output  As a result, growth of real GDP  slows only about a percentage point to 3-1/2 percent next year     Pressures in labor markets are expected to remain   relatively intense over the next year and a half  With some lag,  our projection of below trend growth results in an upward drift in  the unemployment rate next year, but only to a little more than 4  percent     Tight resource utilization and some continued acceleration   in non-oil import prices provide a further boost to core PCE price  inflation--the red line in the lower panel--over the projection  interval  However, the effect of that gradual pickup on the  headline price measure--the black line--is swamped by the sharp  swings that we are projecting for energy prices this year and next   The increase in total PCE prices steps up to a 2-1/2 percent pace  this year and drops back to a 2 percent rate in 2001     The financial assumptions underlying our projection are   the subject of your next chart  We continue to believe that a  further tightening of financial conditions will be necessary to  begin to relieve some of the inflationary pressures that appear to  be building in the economy  The additional 75 basis points of  tightening that we have assumed would push up the real federal  funds rate a bit above the upper end of the range observed over  the past decade  But given the upward influence of faster  productivity growth on “equilibrium” real interest rates, our  assumption on the funds rate implies less monetary restraint than  it would have five years ago     The degree of additional tightening that we have assumed   would come as a surprise to market participants, and we would  expect real rates on corporate bonds--the middle left panel--to  resume the upward trajectory that has been apparent over the past  year and a half  Thus far, that rise has done little to damp  enthusiasm in equity markets  But, going forward, further  increases in interest rates, coupled with a slowing in the growth of  corporate profits, are expected to hold equity prices flat at about  the level they have averaged thus far this year     In the lower panel, I have attempted to summarize some of   the financial crosscurrents at work in our projection with the aid           10  of a model simulation  The most notable of these crosscurrents  has been the strength of the stock market in the face of the  considerable increase in interest rates that has occurred over the  past year The red bars in the chart plot the depressing effects on  the growth of real GDP that would be expected by the model to  accompany the actual and projected increase in the real federal  funds rate since last June  These effects are calculated assuming  that the stock market, long-term interest rates, and the exchange  rate evolve according to the model’s expectations  As you can  see, some effect on growth would have been evident in the first  half of this year, with the restraint mounting noticeably in the  second half of 2000 and in 2001     Of course, financial developments are not unfolding in the   manner predicted by the model  In particular, stock prices have  risen more than 12 percent over the past year and are projected to  remain flat going forward  By contrast, the model expected a  drop of 13 percent over the past year and projects a further decline  in coming quarters  The offsets provided by this surprising  behavior are shown by the blue bars in the chart  As can be seen,  the resilience of the stock market damps considerably the  restraining effects that normally would be expected to accompany  a substantial run-up in the funds rate  The total net effect of these  influences is shown by the black bars     Focusing on the black bars, this analysis suggests that, on   average in the first half of 2000, there is little reason to have  expected much restraining effect yet from the change in financial  conditions over the past year  But moving forward--given both  the lags in response to past rate increases and our assumption of  some further tightening--the restraining influence of financial  conditions should begin to show through more noticeably, with  the effect turning negative in the second half of this year and  becoming more so in 2001  In a nutshell, that’s the basic rationale  for our forecast of a significant, but not precipitous, slowing in  activity over the next year and a half     The transmission of this restraint to household spending is   the subject of your next chart  As we noted in the Greenbook, the  buoyancy of consumer sentiment--shown in the upper left panel-- has led us to discount the recent weakness in the retail sales figures  as signaling the start of a more abrupt down-shift in spending   That said, we do see the underlying determinants as pointing to  decidedly slower growth in consumer outlays  Although there  have been some big ups and downs in the stock market thus far this  year, for the most part prices have moved sideways--a trend, as I           11  noted, that we are projecting will continue  As a consequence, the  household wealth-to-income ratio--the black line in the upper right  panel--is expected to fall back and the personal saving rate--the red  line--to drift up  That manifests itself in our projection as a fairly  steady deceleration of consumer spending this year and next--the  red bars in the middle left panel      Housing appears to be the area where higher interest rates   are leaving the clearest mark on demand  As depicted by the red  line in the middle right panel, there has been a significant  deterioration in consumer perceptions of home buying conditions   Builders’ ratings of new home sales--the black line--also have  become less favorable  As can be seen in the lower left panel,  rising interest rates and higher home prices have lifted monthly  payments relative to personal income over the past year  And,  given our projection of higher rates, this burden is likely to  increase further in coming quarters  When combined with slower  income and employment growth and a diminishing impetus from  rising wealth, we are projecting total housing starts to slide from  167 million units in 1999 to about a 15 million unit pace by the  end of next year     In contrast to the reasonably clear signs of slowing in   residential investment, the recent indicators of capital spending by  businesses have remained very strong  As seen in the upper left  panel of chart 4, new orders for nondefense capital goods moved  up in recent months and have remained above shipments  The  accumulating backlog of orders should provide considerable  support for equipment spending in coming months      Total real E&S--shown on the right--is expected to slow   only a little from its recent rapid pace  Information technology is  expected to continue to contribute the lion’s share of the growth  in real E&S--the red shaded area in the panel--while outlays for  other equipment--the gray area--are expected to slow appreciably     A sharply declining relative price for IT equipment--  shown in the middle left panel--should provide ample incentive  for continued strong growth of investment in the tech area  The  deceleration of business output that we are projecting, plotted at  the right, is likely to leave a small mark on investment in  information technology, but to be a more noticeable drag on other  types of capital outlays     Another area of spending that seems likely to respond to   the slowdown in output growth is nonresidential construction,           12  shown in the lower left panel  The recent boom in activity in this  sector appears at odds with the slowdown in price appreciation  and rents that we have observed, especially for office buildings  and retail structures  In an environment of rising interest rates,  somewhat less ample provision of credit, and slower growth of  output, we are anticipating a considerable drop back in the growth  of activity in this sector      The enormous strength we have witnessed in business and   household demand in recent quarters has coincided with a steep  drop in the inventory-sales ratio, plotted at the right  However,  there are few reports that businesses have felt uncomfortable with  these low levels of stocks, and we expect this ratio to drift down  further, on net, over the forecast interval, and for inventories to be  an essentially neutral influence on the growth of real GDP      Karen will now continue our presentation          In Chart 15, I offer a few shreds of   evidence on the question raised at the last meeting about whether  we might be in the process of overdoing this period of tightening  to an extent that could result in a hard landing for the economy            22  The upper panel dusts off a statistical technique developed by my  colleague Glenn Rudebusch at the San Francisco Fed when he  was on staff here at the Board  In brief, the technique analyzes  the index of leading economic indicators and assesses whether its  recent behavior conforms with patterns observed in periods  immediately prior to or during a recession  I have plotted here  this model’s estimate of the probability that the economy is in or  will be in a recession within six months  By this measure, that  probability is less than one percent       A somewhat different approach is employed in the middle   panel  In this exercise, we use our large-scale econometric model  to produce a one-year-ahead forecast starting in each quarter since  1973  Then, using stochastic simulation, we estimate how  vulnerable the economy was in each of those periods to random  shocks  Specifically, we calculate the frequency with which  random shocks are able to produce two consecutive quarters of  negative GDP growth during the one-year forecast period  That  estimated probability is plotted here  As can be seen, this  measure tends to rise prior to economic downturns  For the  second quarter of this year, the probability of encountering two  consecutive quarters of GDP decline in the next year is about 7- 1/2 percent  Although the probability has drifted up over the past  year, it is well below levels preceding past downturns, and even  below the probabilities that were estimated for the 1994  tightening period     While I hate to end our presentation on what might be   considered somewhat of a downer for the staff, the lower two  panels are intended to provide some perspective on how much  comfort you should take from the upper two panels  I went back  and looked at the Greenbooks that were prepared six months prior  to the business cycle peaks of 1981 and 1990  In the lower panels  I have plotted the projections for real GNP growth taken from  those Greenbooks--the black lines--and actual outcomes as  reported in the Survey of Current Business shortly after those  periods--the red lines     In January 1981, the staff was projecting considerable   weakness for that year and for 1982  However, we did not foresee  the onset of the largest recession of the postwar period, which  began in the summer of 1981 and gathered force that autumn     In the January 1990 Greenbook, we correctly projected a   continued step-down in the growth of real GNP, but missed  calling for a peak in activity that summer and the contraction of           23  output that began in the fall  To be sure, no one was expecting the  invasion of Kuwait and the accompanying spike in oil prices  But  that’s part of the point  It’s difficult to foresee the shocks that can  knock an economy off track, and neither we nor other forecasters  have been very successful at that endeavor in the past  So there is  probably some justification for the sweaty palms that a number of  you admitted to at the last meeting     But in the end, we do not see the likelihood as high that   the economy is in danger of overshooting on the down side  And,  we remain comfortable with our projection of a steady slowing in  growth this year and next  Moreover, I would not want this  analysis to leave the impression that we see the risks as  asymmetric  This economy has demonstrated much greater  resilience than most forecasters had anticipated, and, with total  and core measures of inflation having moved up over the past  year, clear inflation risks are present     The final chart presents your forecasts for 2000 and for   2001  The central tendency of your forecasts anticipates some  slowing in the growth of real GDP between this year and next,  with the unemployment rate remaining near or slightly above its  current level  Inflation, as measured by the PCE price index, is  expected to edge down next year           Right  We use the data as they are currently published and the   probabilities per se as they are calculated by reestimating the model on those data  Though that   index looks reasonably good, it clearly did not do very well, even on these reestimated data, in   that 1990 episode  Even when we were in a recession, the index was still suggesting that the   probability of being in a recession was only 50 percent  So that was a relatively weak indicator    And I think to some degree the same criticism could be leveled at the middle panel, which           24  probably overstates the ability of that model and technique to signal oncoming recessions   because that also reflects the structure of the model as it currently exists, estimated on current   data  So I think both probably overstate the probabilities     In the Bluebook I think there is a simulation that has a NAIRU   that’s basically the current unemployment rate     I guess the first thing I would say is that within the context of the   Greenbook forecast, in an economy with no additional tightening we would see the   unemployment rate drifting down a bit further from where it is currently  So even if one were   to take as the NAIRU the 4 to 4-1/4 percent unemployment rates that have prevailed over the   past year or so, our expectation would be that we could be running below that level  So, unless   one wanted to argue that the NAIRU may be moving down even further, there would still be--     Let me make a couple of comments  One, I would not want to   overstate how well this paradigm has worked in the past either  It's not as if this “fit like a   glove” previously and suddenly something has gone so far off track that we can clearly see           27  evidence of considerable structural change  Two, to answer your question about how confident   I am, I would refer you to Chart 4 in the Bluebook, which presents confidence intervals around   these forecasts that are based, in essence, on our econometric model, not necessarily judgmental   forecasts  As you can see, those confidence intervals are really rather considerable, but I think   that chart probably is a pretty reasonable representation of the kind of uncertainty we think you   are confronted with in making policy  A 70 percent confidence interval on the extension of the   Greenbook forecast could imply stable inflation  Even with an unemployment rate below the   NAIRU, an inflation rate that runs at just 2 percent, which is essentially where it has been   running, is within those confidence intervals under the structure of this model     Yes, in the sense that these are full confidence intervals       It is measuring all of the above--the uncertainty about the model,   based on how it has performed in the past, as well as the uncertainty about what goes into that   model     Yes, pretty much  I suspect this does not include the coefficient   uncertainty about the parameters on variables; it has a coefficient uncertainty in terms of the   intercepts in the models  But as you can see, that confidence interval widens out to over 2           28  percentage points on price inflation, so there is considerable uncertainty  Obviously, the staff   forecast is a forecast of what we think will happen under a given path of the funds rate  It is not   a prescription for policy or for how policy should be conducted when faced with uncertainty   about the structure of the model  In fact, I would interpret the Committee’s behavior in recent   years as having responded to the widening uncertainty about the structure of the model and the   economy by reacting less forcefully to incoming economic developments than you might have   had you had full confidence in the structure of the model  I think it is important to remember   that about the forecast--that it is not a prescription, but a forecast  And that forecast has   considerable uncertainty in a number of dimensions  You have mentioned a couple in terms of   the structure of the wage/price sector  But the model has been off considerably in many other   areas that are also important for your considerations--for example, the behavior of equity   markets and how they might respond to further changes in the federal funds rate  It all adds up   to a lot of uncertainties and some pretty big confidence spans; and I would imagine it suggests   caution on your part in interpreting the forecast that we provide you     In a model in which the NAIRU in essence was last period's   unemployment rate, I think you would still be able to pin down inflation  Monetary policy will   ultimately determine the rate of price inflation even in a model with that specification of   wage/price behavior  I'm not sure if there is a mechanism--     We do have inflation expectations       You can always produce a series of shocks     You can still produce a series of shocks for that model that cause   the unemployment rate to change and to create in essence a series of temporary gaps, which I   think could move the inflation rate       I would just say the reason for that in part is that we see the   growth of structural productivity as requiring some increase in interest rates eventually  That is   not obviated by a low NAIRU  That is still there producing potential inflation if the funds rate   is held at its current level     Which is usually the monetary authority     I don't know whether David Reifschneider would know the   answer, but I'm sure he could produce an answer for us  Take a wage equation, Dave, in which   in essence there is complete hysteresis that says last period's unemployment rate is this period's   natural rate  Is there a determinate inflation rate in the model?     That is absolutely true     You have recast the question, but it involves a gross correlation   in the data that Larry was pointing to--the GDP gap and the unemployment rate and the   acceleration of prices  I would argue that our downward revision to the natural rate of   unemployment--from the 5-3/4 percent or so that we had a number of years ago to 5-1/4 percent   now--reflects our belief that some of the forces you just described are indeed at work in the   labor market  That is, we can operate now with a thinner margin of excess capacity, in some   sense, that reflects this churning because of more efficient job search techniques, more use of   temporary help, and a variety of other factors that in fact have made the labor market more   efficient  At a macro level, all we are really asking, in terms of this pool of labor, is whether in           35  the past a certain pool has been associated with an acceleration of wage and price inflation    And that's all these NAIRU estimates are really about  Or we can recast the question in terms of   a slightly more comprehensive measure of labor market slack  The uncertainties that we show   in those confidence intervals are just another reflection of the fact that there is a lot of looseness   in that relationship, which probably reflects some of the effects that you are talking about--some   of which may prove temporary and some of which may prove permanent  We have made our   best assessment as to how much of that we think is likely to be permanent and how much has   been temporary  But, obviously, there is room both for disagreement and considerable room for   uncertainty     Roughly speaking, depending on the particular model that we   look at, we think between 03 and 04 of the acceleration over the past year could be attributed   to the indirect effects of accelerating energy prices  Then, in 2001 when those prices retrace, we   get some of that back, which is part of the reason why in our forecast we see a more pronounced   acceleration in core inflation this year and not much further acceleration next year, despite the   fact that the unemployment rate moves up     The acceleration is a much steadier upward process than one sees   in our forecast, which might give a slight impression that things are topping out a bit in 2001     Our current point estimate is about 5-1/4 percent  As I indicated   earlier, that is down from the 5 3/4 percent to 6 percent range we had before  We do see upside   and downside risks to that estimate  In the paper by Flint Brayton and David Reifschneider   circulated to the Committee through Don Kohn a few weeks ago, I think they reported a   reestimate of their wage and price equations Their work suggests a NAIRU of 5-3/4 percent   even with the current set of data they’ve been looking at  They provided in the paper a variety   of reasons for why we might have experienced this particular combination of low   unemployment and low inflation  Now, we have other judgmental models that produce lower   NAIRUs  And we feel relatively comfortable with a number of the stories that, as I indicated   earlier, probably have helped to lower the natural rate  But the risks are not one-sided either  "
6002,2000-08-22,"  In putting together this forecast, we had to address  two central questions First, is the economy really slowing?  And second,  how much does it need to slow in order to prevent inflation pressures from       19  building?  To jump right to the bottom line, our answer to the first question  is, yes  And our answer to the second question is, not by as much as we  previously thought     Let me turn first to the question of the extent of the slowing in   economic growth in recent months  At the time of the last forecast, there  were only tentative signs of the deceleration in activity that we were  projecting  Since then, the evidence of slowing has accumulated  Indeed, if  anything, we have been surprised more often than not on the down side  It  still would be premature to declare with confidence that a durable step down  in the growth of output has arrived, but the odds of that event are looking  considerably higher than they were a couple of months ago     For one, the job market appears to have cooled noticeably since last   winter  To be sure, some of the slowing of private payroll employment  growth probably just reflected a shift in the seasonal timing of hiring  induced by warm winter weather and strong overall activity  And, no doubt,  there have been more than a few instances in which hiring has been held  back by a lack of qualified workers  But given the breadth of the slowdown  and the absence of any apparent upward pressure on the workweek that  might be expected to accompany widespread worker shortages, we believe  that a slowing in labor demand has been the more important factor  underlying the recent drop-off in the pace of hiring     On the spending side, tighter monetary policy appears to be leaving its   clearest mark on housing activity  Starts of single-family homes have  trended down since the beginning of the year, and the permits data give us  little reason to discount this decline  Combined with a drop-off in sales of  new homes and weaker prices and production of construction materials and  supplies, the data paint a reasonably consistent picture of softer demand in  this sector     Much the same can be said for motor vehicles  After the astounding   pace registered earlier this year, car and truck sales have slowed  considerably--albeit to merely a very strong pace--and inventory overhangs  have developed for a few models  At present, the automakers are dealing  with these spotty problems by raising incentives and moving quickly to trim  production where necessary  Indeed, a drop in assemblies contributes  importantly to our projected second-half deceleration of real GDP     Outside of the auto sector, real PCE slowed sharply in the second   quarter, and, although we are forecasting a larger gain in the current quarter,  the projected increase in spending remains well below that seen late last  year and early this year  But here I’d have to admit that, with consumer  confidence remaining elevated and with only one month of data in hand, this       20  key element in our outlook remains more forecast than fact  Given our view  that the impetus to spending from wealth should be waning after about 8  months of relatively flat equity prices, we are comfortable with the  underpinnings of our consumption forecast  But the more subdued pace of  spending that we are projecting is far from baked in the cake     In contrast to the signs of slowing in household spending, business   outlays for capital equipment have continued to surge ahead One of the  most notable aspects of the recent annual revision to the national accounts  was that the investment boom of recent years is now estimated to have been  even stronger than previously thought Moreover, there are few signs, if any,  that higher real long-term interest rates have put an appreciable dent in the  demand for equipment and software  It just doesn’t look like this boom is  about to dissipate any time soon      This brings me to the second question Does the economy need to   slow?  We still think the 6 percent pace of the past four quarters is not  sustainable  But because of our supply-side revisions, that pace is not as far  above potential growth as before  With the revised data showing a higher  level of investment and with the near-term indicators pointing to continued  strong growth in capital outlays going forward, we found ourselves  forecasting an economy in which the growth of capital services will be high  and increasing  Moreover, the annual revisions portray a pattern of greater  acceleration of actual labor productivity, with the annual increase through  the second quarter of this year in excess of 5 percent  There are a number of  reasons for discounting the extent of the recent pickup in the nonfarm  business figures, but any way we look at it, the performance of productivity  has been phenomenal     Taken together, these observations motivated our upward revisions to   the growth of structural productivity and potential output  Indeed, given  both the mounting contribution from capital deepening implied by our  investment forecast and some further improvement in the growth of  multifactor productivity, we are projecting a modest ongoing acceleration of  structural productivity--3-1/2 percent this year and 3-3/4 percent in 2001, up  about 1/2 percentage point from our last forecast     The revision to structural productivity not only affects potential GDP,   it also has important implications for the demand side of our forecast  In  particular, it boosts the growth of real incomes and spending and is the chief  reason that we have adjusted up our real GDP growth forecast by a half  percentage point in 2001 to 4 percent     This outcome might seem somewhat surprising in light of many of the   simulations we have shown you in recent years  In those simulations, faster       21  trend productivity growth typically caused growth in demand to outstrip that  of the productivity-enhanced growth of supply, at least for a time  As you  will recall, an important channel for that effect came through the influence  of faster productivity growth on asset values and, consequently, on  consumption and investment  But our interpretation of recent events is that  while we hapless economists have been only slowly marking up our  forecasts for productivity growth, the markets and private-sector agents had  already been anticipating this improvement  Thus, we are not looking for  any additional increment to spending from a further productivity-driven rise  in the stock market     On net, our revisions to the demand and supply sides of the forecast   were nearly a wash for resource utilization  In this projection, we anticipate  the unemployment rate to rise to about 4-1/4 percent by the end of next year,  just a bit above our June forecast  By our assessment, this remains too low  to prevent a further gradual deterioration in inflation  For this reason, our  forecast assumes some further tightening of monetary policy next year, as  core inflation drifts higher      Of course, major question marks continue to surround this element of   our forecast  But we read the incoming wage data as suggesting that labor  markets remain extremely tight  Virtually all of the data on hourly  compensation have come in to the high side of our June forecast--decidedly  so in the case of the ECI, which outstripped our second-quarter forecast by  nearly a percentage point at an annual rate  Although we have carried only a  bit of that surprise forward in our projection, we expect to see continued  upward pressures on compensation     That said, these upward innovations to our wage forecast have been   more than offset by our faster estimated structural productivity growth,  which has acted to damp the rise in unit labor costs  As a result, the uptrend  in price inflation is more gradual than we were previously projecting  We  now anticipate that core PCE price inflation will move above 2 percent by  the end of next year, a couple of tenths below our previous forecast, though  still nearly ½ percentage point higher than its current pace     Obviously, a wide range of uncertainty attaches to many important   elements of our forecast  But the changes that we have made to this  projection bring into sharper focus the risks associated with our investment  forecast  We are projecting some slowing in equipment spending from its  recent pace in response to rising interest rates and some deceleration of final  sales and profits   If the slower growth of earnings that we are expecting to  accompany a period of below trend economic growth came as a significant  disappointment to businesses, there could be a sharper retrenchment in  capital spending than we are forecasting       22    The largest and most immediate effect of that retrenchment would   come on the demand side of the economy, especially as multiplier- accelerator effects amplified any slowing of capital spending  Reduced  investment would also attenuate the productivity-enhancing effects of  capital deepening on the supply side of the economy  All in all, any serious  scaling back of investment would risk some unwinding of the virtuous cycle  of investment, productivity, and price restraint from which we benefited in  recent years     With the return to capital having been well maintained despite an   investment boom that has lasted more than five years and with no signs that  business demand for new equipment is letting up, we are reasonably  comfortable with our forecast of continued strong investment spending  But  clearly, this is an area that will bear close scrutiny in the period ahead     There are also upside risks to demand associated with our outlook for   the supply side of the economy  As I noted earlier, we have assumed that  much of the good news on the supply side already has been discounted by  the markets  If we are wrong, and the enthusiasm of investors is rekindled  by the pace of productivity growth envisioned in this forecast, a Fed  perceived to be on hold, and no marked near-term deterioration of inflation,  then a snapback in equity markets, with the accompanying consequences for  faster growth of private spending and higher resource utilization, could  present a more difficult environment in which to make policy     Karen will now complete our presentation      Just to follow up on that  I indicated in my remarks that we hapless   economists are slowly writing up our forecasts for productivity growth  I think the Blue Chip       25  forecasters may be even more hapless than we are  Those forecasts suggest considerably lower   potential output growth than we have  That just doesn’t seem consistent with what one hears         No, but it doesn’t seem entirely consistent with the earnings   expectations that one hears in financial markets     As both Karen and I indicated in our remarks, we certainly upped the   risk in that regard  We made the assumption that it has been largely discounted, but we’re not totally   sure about that     We think we have taken account of that  It is still the case, obviously,   that mortgage rates are up considerably from their lows and that ARM rates also are significantly   higher than they have been  This is an area of the forecast where I think we have been somewhat   surprised on the down side in terms of the extent of the weakening  Actually, in the next few   months, we don’t have further declines from where we are  We have housing activity basically       26  holding at current levels on the thought that the tip down in mortgage rates is probably going to   provide, at least temporarily, some support for the current levels  But all of the advance indicators   still suggest that activity in that sector is likely to be weak in the period ahead  There is certainly   some risk to that forecast, especially because we could get a temporary bounceback if people   perceive this as an opportunity to get into the market and they rush to do the buying they had put off   when rates were rising more rapidly       I think there are upside and downside risks there as well  "
6054,2000-10-03,"  On the whole, the data we have received over the past six  weeks have not materially changed our view that the economy is easing onto a  path of below-trend growth  Indeed, we have made relatively few changes to  either our trajectory for overall real GDP or to the underlying components of  demand  With respect to inflation, the figures have contained few surprises  aside from the further strengthening of oil prices     Perhaps the most convincing evidence of a cooling in activity can be found  in labor markets  Monthly gains in private payrolls, which had averaged nearly  200,000 in the twelve months preceding March, have dropped off to an average  of about 150,000 per month since then  Moreover, the workweek has slipped a  bit since the spring and aggregate hours worked have been about flat  In that  regard, it is striking that the entire 3 percent gain in real GDP that we have  projected for the third quarter is expected to come from increased productivity      The growth of manufacturing activity also appears to have ratcheted down  from the rapid pace of late last year and early this year  For the most part, the  signs of slowing appear to reflect the identifiable macroeconomic influences  that might be expected to follow a tightening of monetary policy  Auto  production is being trimmed in response to some settling back of retail demand,  the production of construction supplies has weakened perceptibly, and some  materials production--most notably steel--has taken a hit from softening  domestic demand and heightened import competition  Production in the high- tech sector continues to advance briskly, but there does appear to have been  some moderation here as well after the stunning gains we saw earlier this year       Spending for high-tech equipment also appears to have slowed some in the   third quarter, especially for communications equipment  Coupled with the hit  that many high-tech companies have taken in the equity markets of late, some  reports of slowing demand have raised concerns about whether this is an area  poised for some retrenchment  To be sure, there are risks here, but we do not  yet see the case for abandoning our relatively upbeat outlook  In our forecast,  high-tech investment participates in the moderation of investment demand that  we expect to accompany the downshift in the pace of final sales  But with the  relative price of this equipment still declining at a steady clip, the backlog of  unfilled orders high, and considerable unexploited opportunities apparently  available, we continue to expect high-tech investment spending to expand quite  rapidly  Other capital spending also has slowed of late, and we are projecting      25  the growth in these outlays to remain more subdued going forward owing to the  slower pace of business sales and the less favorable financing environment that  we are expecting over the next two years     In addition to somewhat less ebullient business outlays, our projection  depends importantly on a sustained slowdown in household spending  Here, the  recent data certainly could give one pause about our story  Over the past two  months, activity in housing markets has experienced a bit of a resurgence  No  doubt, the drop in mortgage rates has provided a lift to construction--more so  than we had anticipated  But, even with the recent upturn in starts, residential  investment is likely to post a sizable negative for the third quarter  I should  note that new single-family home sales--released this morning--were revised  down about 2-1/2 percent in July, and they dropped 3 percent in August     The consumer spending figures also have picked up noticeably of late, but  we had largely anticipated this bounce back from the sub-par second-quarter  gain  Moreover, with the exception of that small second-quarter increase, our  projected growth of 4-3/4 percent in real PCE in the third quarter would be the  slowest in a year and a half     Looking ahead, with mortgage rates still up nearly 75 basis points from the   middle of last year, with income gains having moderated considerably, and with  the stock market having moved sideways this year, we believe that there are  solid underpinnings to our forecast that household spending is likely to remain  more subdued for the remainder of the year     A continuation of below-trend growth in GDP seems the most likely   outcome as we move into 2001  The lagged effects of your previous tightenings  should still be playing out over the next year or so  By 2002, those effects  begin to wane, and along with a bit more stimulative discretionary fiscal policy,  more rapid growth of exports, and our projected acceleration in structural  productivity, there is a more noticeable quickening in the pace of real GDP  growth  That pickup is largely held in check by the further increases in the  funds rate that we have assumed for late next year and early 2002  With the  growth of GDP continuing to run below that of potential output over the  forecast interval, we expect to see the unemployment rate rise to 4-1/2 percent  by the end of 2002     Although the increase in the jobless rate and our projected gradual decline  in oil prices relieve some pressures on business costs and prices, we expect core  inflation to extend the updrift that has occurred over the past year or so  As you  know, that very modest deterioration in our outlook for inflation balances what  we view as two key influences about which there are considerable uncertainties  --the tightness of resource utilization and the pace of structural productivity  growth        26  In recognition of those uncertainties, we gave a bit more emphasis in the  Greenbook to the longer-term forecast than is customary for us when adding a  year to the projection  I trust that you will not confuse that greater emphasis on  the longer term with any greater conviction on our part about our abilitiy to  predict how the economy will evolve two years hence  But we thought it might  be useful to illustrate just how sensitive our forecast is to our assumptions as we  extend our projection into 2002     I won’t go into the details of the myriad simulations we included, but I   thought two scenarios are worth special note  First, what if changes in the  structure of our labor and product markets have made it possible for the  economy to sustain in equilibrium a 4 percent rate of unemployment--or at least  allow us to sustain it to the end of 2002?  In our simulation of a 4 percent  NAIRU, core price inflation slows gradually, rather than increases gradually as  in the baseline  Under these circumstances, the need for any further tightening  is clearly eliminated, and some easing might be called for  On the surface, this  scenario seems consistent with what might be built into current financial market  expectations     The second simulation I want to mention is the one that examines the   sensitivity of our outlook to the continued acceleration we are forecasting for  structural productivity, from a pace of 3-1/4 percent in 1999 to 3-3/4 percent in  2002  We contrast our forecast to one in which the pace of structural  productivity has improved, but only to about 3 percent, where it remains over  the next two years  This latter assumption appears to be closer to the consensus  forecast of outside economists  If that consensus turns out to be closer to the  mark, the simulations we present suggest that the performance of the economy  will not be nearly as rosy as we are expecting  The growth of real output will  be slower, the unemployment rate will be higher, and inflation will be  increasing noticeably     For the reasons discussed in the Greenbook, we are comfortable with the  choices we have made about these key elements in the forecast, but there  certainly is considerable scope for reasonable men and women to come to  different conclusions     One final important risk in the outlook worth mentioning relates to   developments in world oil markets  In this forecast, we have yet again raised  our projected path of crude oil prices  This has resulted in slightly higher  headline inflation figures, especially in the second half of this year  Those  higher prices depress disposable incomes a bit, and tend to weaken our  projection for consumer spending     In putting together this forecast, we asked ourselves whether our inherent   “incrementalist” approach could be leading us to miss the bigger picture  The  cumulative revision in our oil price forecast since January has been about $9 per      27  barrel this year and has been about $8 per barrel in 2001  Could the total effects  of a shift in prices of this magnitude be larger than the sum of the smaller  changes we have made to the forecast?  With one exception that I will mention  shortly, we answered no to this question, at least for now  But there are reasons  to be concerned     On the spending side, we have assumed that households have responded to   the negative real income effects of higher energy prices both by reducing  spending and by dipping into saving  Consequently, to the extent that  households have viewed the runup as partly transitory, the spending effects  have likely been muted  But if at some point there is a more pronounced  reevaluation of the likely permanence to the rise in oil prices, there is a risk of a  more abrupt downshift in consumer spending     In financial markets, small changes in oil prices produce some winners and  losers, but probably don’t have significant net effects  By contrast, large and  volatile changes in oil prices could add appreciably to uncertainty about the  outlook and result in some pulling back from the markets--with consequences  for valuations and, ultimately, spending     There are risks, as well, on the inflation side  Firms may have absorbed   some of the higher energy prices in profit margins, in the hopes that these prices  would soon recede to earlier levels  At some point, businesses may be forced to  throw in the towel and raise prices more aggressively  Workers, too, may have  absorbed the direct effects of higher energy prices in lower real wages  But a  higher and more persistent level of prices could eventually encourage attempts  to restore some of the lost real wages through higher nominal wage demands     To date, we think all of these factors have been at work in small ways, but  not in the more abrupt, self-reinforcing, and nonlinear manner that could pose  more significant risks to the outlook  Consumer confidence has remained high,  equity markets have not softened appreciably, and inflation expectations appear  to be well contained  But we will be watching these developments closely in  coming weeks     The one area where we made a discrete change was productivity  The rise  in oil prices has now been large enough and is expected to persist long enough  that we think there could be some minor adverse effects on multifactor  productivity  The need to economize on energy inputs in production and the  effects on the profitability of the existing capital stock of the higher relative  price of energy have led us to chip a bit off the growth of multifactor  productivity over the next couple of years  Nevertheless, the change is not large  enough to prevent some further acceleration in structural productivity     Karen will now discuss how some of these risks could play out in the rest   of the world      28      Well, I’ll start with the first question on the technology sector  We   have not heard uniformly the same kind of reports on weakness in sales that some of the   manufacturers have reported  Dell, for example, and Compaq have reported that demand has held up   quite well  So at this stage we’re nervous but we’re not yet willing to concede that there has been      32  some sea change going on in the tech sector  As I indicated, the orders picture still looks quite good   in the aggregate  And we’re just reading this as part of the noise associated with many of these   companies  For example Intel’s stock price, which has taken such an enormous hit, is still back only   to where it was at the turn of the year, after having run up steeply  So we’re paying careful attention   but we don’t think this is necessarily the beginning of some significant softening  Obviously, if it   were, it would be troubling because an important part not just of our aggregate demand forecast but   our aggregate supply forecast relies on sustaining relatively good performance on the investment   side  So it is a concern   On the issue of refining capacity, things are tight domestically  I don’t know about the   rest of the world  We do think, however, that there’s probably a bit more elasticity in terms of the   ability to raise production--for example, of heating fuel going into the winter--than just looking at   the overall level of capacity utilization might suggest  Now, that means, I think, that we will be   more vulnerable to any shocks that could occur over the next few months, weather being the most   obvious one  But judging from the prices of both the heating fuel and crude oil, we’re not seeing   something that would suggest the anticipation of exceptionally higher refining margins going into   the winter--just normal seasonally high type margins     I’m not sure I would say that in the aggregate I see the downside risks   as larger than the upside risks to this forecast  There are a couple of areas that I wanted to highlight    One relates to the developments in the technology sector  Second, while our simulations suggest   that the oil price increases should have a relatively modest effect on overall output, I think there are   risks in that regard as well  On the confidence side, we haven’t seen much effect yet  Nevertheless,   one could easily imagine if we got not just a price spike but a true supply disruption comparable to   what was apparent in Europe this fall, there could be a more pronounced negative effect on overall   sentiment  On the other hand, there are a couple of areas where we could envision some upside   risks  One I cited was the housing area  While we think that is likely to be short lived, we were   surprised by the vigor of the recent rebound  And while consumer spending has turned out pretty   much as we had anticipated, on the whole there has probably been a firmer tone to what has occurred   in that sector  So I think we see a bit of upside and downside risks there  I think in a period of   slowing it’s natural to be more concerned about the downside risks one is identifying because often   developments occur that tend to reinforce that downward momentum       With respect to the productivity forecast I’d say two things  One is   that we have had occasions where multifactor productivity has risen at this pace for an extended   period of time  So this wouldn’t be something that is unprecedented historically  Secondly,   however, if we were doing a 10- or 15-year forecast, I don’t think we would necessarily project   either the growth of multifactor productivity or the pace of capital deepening to be sustained at the   kind of increases we are seeing now  In some sense the approach that we have shifted to here, which      36  endogenizes these supply side factors, means that we are also going to be sensitive to future business   cycles where a period of slowing in overall activity could feed back into investment and therefore--      Yes, in the sense that we’re only forecasting out through 2002  Over   a long-term horizon I’d certainly hate to be pinned down in forecasting developments in an area   where we have not exactly covered ourselves in glory even over the short term  But I would caution   that if I were a budget analyst, I wouldn’t necessarily take that 2002 figure and extend it out for the   next 10, 15 years     As the Chairman has noted many times, we’re not sure where we are   in this technological diffusion process  That knowledge really is so important in terms of getting to   the crux of this matter  And it is just terribly difficult to know  Thus far the overall return to capital   has not shown any signs of tipping down, though one might expect it to do so  If we were really   pushing capital deepening in a sense beyond where it ought to be, we would expect to see a   significant weakness  Now I would quickly want to--     Yes, that’s true; there has been just a tad  The downturn is pretty   much within the noise of those data at this point  But I would also caution that what we are really   observing there is the average return to capital, not the marginal return to capital  If one were   concerned about the tech sector, for example, it’s possible that the most recent investments aren’t   going to reach the same rates of return that investors either are looking for or have experienced in the   recent past  So I think there are some risks there as well  We just don’t know where we are in that      37  technology-spreading process at this point  Nevertheless, at this stage we don’t see any reason to   think that it’s going to be on a slowing trend in terms of multifactor productivity   With respect to the feedback effects, in the case where we show a lower growth of   structural productivity, those effects are quite potent in the model for the reasons that we discussed   earlier this year on the up side  In that simulation there are going to be some significant   disappointments in the growth of output and the growth in profits  Those disappointments would   lead to some retrenchment in overall equity markets, as well as some downshift in people’s desire to   add to the capital stock of housing and automobiles and other consumer durables That in turn leads   that simulation to produce a significant weakening in overall activity from its recent pace  But even   with that weakening, that lower productivity assumption is potent enough that we could still get   some increase in overall inflation  So it’s the worst of all possible worlds  "
6098,2000-11-15,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  We have received a  considerable slug of data since we published the Greenbook last week  For  the most part, those readings have had little effect on our outlook  We still  estimate that real GDP rose about 2-1/2 percent at an annual rate in the third  quarter and will rise about 3-1/2 percent in the current quarter       12    Retail sales, released yesterday, rose 01 percent in October, held down   by weak sales of motor vehicles  Excluding auto dealers and building  materials supply stores, sales rose a relatively modest 03 percent last month  after jumping 09 percent in September--both about in line with our  expectations  As you know, auto sales fell about a million units at an annual  rate in October, to a 167 million unit pace  There has been some real  weakening here, and the carmakers have been holding up sales only with  relatively generous incentives  Taken together, these few fragments of data  leave us comfortable with our projected increase in real PCE of 3-1/2 percent  in Q4     In a bit of ancient history, data on retail inventories for September were   released this morning  Retail stocks excluding those at auto dealers were  about unchanged for the month--close to the assumption made by the BEA   For the most part, stock-to-sales ratios remain low at retailers  However,  inventory overhangs have cropped up in some areas of late, most notably in  the motor vehicle sector  Assemblies have been trimmed considerably in  order to limit any further rise in day’s supply, and these cutbacks are taking  about 1/2 percentage point off GDP growth in the second half of this year  In  addition, inventory problems in steel, construction materials, paper, and  textiles appear to be prompting some production adjustments       Indeed, we have seen a perceptible slowing in factory output in recent   months  Total industrial production, which we published this morning, is  estimated to have been unchanged in October  Outside of motor vehicles,  factory output rose 1/2 percent last month  Although high-tech production  picked up a bit in October, activity in this sector has cooled since the Y2K- related surge earlier this year     Investment spending for high-tech equipment, on net, has also slowed   some of late  While outlays for computers and software have remained very  strong, there has been a drop-off in spending for communications equipment   Order backlogs, though, continue to build, suggesting that the outright  decline registered by communications equipment for the third quarter is  likely to be short lived  The data we now have in hand for the tech sector are  more consistent with a moderation than a slump  Elsewhere, growth of E&S  spending has slowed, but only modestly and along with the growth of final  sales     In contrast to equipment spending, nonresidential construction activity   appears to have picked up recently  Low vacancy rates and rising rents  appear to be providing support to this sector                13     Despite some zigs and zags, activity in housing markets has basically  moved sideways or down from the levels seen earlier in the year  Only sales  of new homes, which soared in September, are signaling any serious  rebound  But in the spirit of the times, I refuse to concede defeat here, and I  shall await the results of a recount, which will come in the form of revised  sales figures later this month  [Laughter]     Summing up the near term, growth of real GDP appears to have slowed   considerably in the second half of the year, but only by a bit more than we  had expected at the time of the last meeting     Looking further ahead, these incoming data alone would not have   warranted any more than a small adjustment to the outlook for 2001 and  2002  However, financial conditions have tightened noticeably over the  intermeeting period, and we expect this to persist and perhaps to intensify a  bit over the projection interval  Interest rates have risen especially sharply  for below-investment-grade borrowers  But even those at the lower end of  the investment-grade spectrum have seen widening spreads and a less  receptive market for new bond issues     In equity markets, companies’ stock prices have been hammered for   failing to meet earnings expectations, with the tech sector especially hard hit   In response, we have knocked almost 4 percent off the level of stock prices  going forward in this Greenbook  Moreover, banks have further tightened  terms and standards on loans to business customers  Taken together, these  developments have led us to mark down our forecast for the growth of real  GDP by a bit more than 1/4 percentage point in each of the next two years      While we have trimmed a bit from our consumption forecast, reflecting   the hit to wealth, the most significant downward adjustment was to our  forecast of equipment spending, especially communications equipment  Both  capital markets and banks appear to have become more concerned about this  sector’s ability to generate the previously expected returns  But the  tightening of financial conditions in recent weeks has extended beyond the  communications sector, and we have lowered our projection for more  traditional capital equipment as well     I should emphasize that these adjustments are as much judgment as   science  As you probably know, standard econometric models have  difficulty identifying significant interest rate effects on investment spending,  let alone differential effects by the quality of the borrowers  That said, we  are bowing in the direction of economic principles and are forecasting that  capital spending will be squeezed by higher interest rates and tighter lending  standards in the period ahead             14       The revisions we have made to our outlook for investment also have   implications for the supply side of our forecast  Because investment  spending has been lowered, so too has the pace of capital deepening  This, in  turn, reduces the growth of structural labor productivity and potential output   Consequently, even though we have marked down our forecast for the  growth of real GDP, we are showing only a slightly higher unemployment  rate and virtually no change in our inflation outlook     Obviously, we see our forecast as the most likely outcome for the next   two years  But I think it is fair to say that the downside risks to the  projection were easier for us to envision than the upside risks  In particular,  the cyclical weakening in corporate earnings that we are projecting to occur  over the next two years could prompt a more negative reaction in financial  markets than we have allowed for in this forecast  If that is the case, there  could be a more pronounced retrenchment of investment outlays and, through  the wealth effect, consumer spending     We examined in the Greenbook a couple of variants of a tech-led   weakening of investment spending  One of the messages of those  simulations was that, although the growth of real output was weaker and the  unemployment rate higher, inflation would be little changed to a bit above  that in our baseline forecast  The reason, of course, is that slower growth of  investment leads to less rapid gains in structural productivity and more  pressure on unit labor costs  In essence, we experience the mirror image of  the past few years, when faster productivity growth was accompanied by  lower unemployment without accelerating prices     I won’t repeat any further the details of the simulations presented in the   Greenbook  Instead, I thought I might take up the somewhat more  challenging assignment of arguing the upside risks to the projection     Let me start with fiscal policy  A more evenly divided Congress could   result in gridlock, calling into question even the modest stimulus in fiscal  year 2002 that we have built into the projection  But it seems every bit as  likely that the large on-budget surpluses that we have projected could serve  as a powerful lubricant to overcome the partisan frictions that otherwise  could prevent movement  This autumn’s scramble to spend might well be a  precursor to more aggressive fiscal ease next year, and it demonstrates how  rapidly the surplus could be dissipated by many small actions     A second risk is that we may be overreacting to the recent tightening of   financial conditions  The economy weathered what seemed to be a bigger  threat in 1998  To be sure, our policy actions provided considerable             15     reassurance, but the uncertainties about the global economy were  undoubtedly much greater then than now  At that time, we also saw a  weakening in our industrial sector  But on the whole, the expansion barely  skipped a beat     Moreover, in the present circumstances, the upside risks to inflation   that would accompany a reacceleration of activity are probably greater than a  couple of years ago  Most broad measures of inflation--headline and core-- bottomed out in 1998 or 1999 and have moved up since then  While the  uncertainties remain very large, we have seen little in the recent wage and  price data to contradict our view that the economy is operating beyond its  potential     Of course, if a reacceleration of activity were to occur, our ability to   absorb it without added inflation pressures would be influenced importantly  by productivity developments  And that brings me to a final upside risk to  our projection of activity  I recognize that some of you view our outlook for  productivity and potential output as near the outside edge of plausibility  But  we view the risks here as two-sided  A further sharp acceleration of  productivity, such as we have experienced, could provide considerable  support for corporate earnings and stock prices  This would likely be  accompanied by an easing of the credit quality concerns that now appear to  be weighing so heavily on lenders and investors  The faster productivity  growth could help to limit or even reverse, at least for a time, any further  upward movement in inflation  While it’s not our best guess, one would not  need to stare too long at our forecast errors in recent years to recognize that  this scenario is not without plausibility     With that, I’ll turn the floor over to Vince Reinhart      I don’t know whether that’s a leading question or not!  [Laughter]   Actually, as we have said in the past, I believe it would be a mistake to rely on any single index    So, what we have tried to do in our analyses is to present some of the pros and cons of the   various indexes for you, as policymakers, to consider in order to reach some kind of a judgment    My judgment would be that there has been a pickup in underlying core inflation  But the core   PCE has probably understated that pickup because of these imputed prices, which are more   statistical constructions than actual measurements  It’s quite conceivable that the CPI has   overstated that acceleration in part because, as we have noted, we have some doubts about the   weighting structure of the CPI  Another source of discrepancy between the PCE and the CPI   over the last year has been that the CPI is showing a much sharper acceleration in medical   services prices than the PCE, which uses a PPI measure rather than the measure used in the   consumer price index  I think there are some questions about the quality of the medical care   prices as measured in the CPI  So if I can weave my way to an answer, I’d say that a rate   somewhere in between those two measurements probably captures the right sense of what has   been going on               19        And there is no doubt that, in some sense in our forecast, the   increased costs associated with higher medical care insurance premiums being paid by employers   do feed back through on the cost side of the equation into prices  Whether or not it’s prices or   quantity--     Yes, through compensation     I’d say we’ve given more thought than hard-core analysis to this   question  Obviously, one could imagine that we would see a greater cyclical weakening in   productivity in tight labor markets, as firms perhaps would be very reluctant to shed workers   given how hard it was to get these people on their payrolls  So that would be one argument for   an even sharper deceleration of cyclical productivity, perhaps, than we are showing in this   forecast  That could, then, have consequences as well for corporate profits  On the other hand,   we don’t know very much about how the cyclical behavior of the labor market might have   changed in recent years as a result of structural changes in the labor force  Another factor is the   ability of firms, in essence, not to pay the high fixed cost of workers by using more temporary   workers to provide a cushion, making it easier for them to implement hours adjustments in   response to a slowdown than they have in the past  It could very well be this time around that   firms would just be calling up the temporary help agencies and saying, in effect, “Don’t send us   as many workers this week as you gave us last week”  In that case, there would be less of a   cyclical response  Now, what makes this so difficult to estimate at any aggregate level is that the               21      last time we had a cyclical occurrence was 10 years ago  And the previous cyclical occurrence   was 10 years prior to that  In essence we have two observations since 1980 on this issue, a   period in which there has been a lot of structural change  So we have very little confidence that   we really have a good handle on this  We’re just trying to feel our way through as we watch   what is happening  So, I think there’s a wide band of uncertainty, but you’re hitting on an   important element in the forecast going forward from here     Yes, indeed     In terms of our forecast for November payrolls, we’re looking for   private payroll employment gains of about 130,000 and no gain at all in the manufacturing   sector  Now, we think the spike we saw last week in initial claims for unemployment insurance   was probably in substantial part a reflection of these temporary layoffs in the automotive sector    So we’re expecting that to show through   In terms of the discrepancy between our forecast assumption for the fed funds rate and   the markets’ forecast, obviously they’re looking for some combination of either greater   economic weakness than we are expecting going forward or a more rapid response by the   Committee  In essence, we are not trying to forecast what the Committee will do  We just try to   lay out a useful baseline for your discussions  By our assessment, we need to hold the real   federal funds rate at about its current level in order to cap inflation at roughly 2-1/4 percent for   core PCE  Obviously, there’s a huge amount of guesswork involved in making an assessment   like that  But in our forecast we still see considerable support for overall activity going forward,   in part because we have an upbeat view as to what is going on with productivity  Moreover, I   think we have made an important assumption that, as I indicated in my remarks, is certainly open   to some question  And that assumption is that through a period in which there are likely to be   some disappointments in terms of corporate earnings, investment is going to be relatively well               23      maintained  We think people are going to be looking further down the road, viewing this more   as a cyclical slowing in earnings rather than a reflection of a more negative longer-term outlook   for overall productivity and corporate earnings  And by our judgment we’ll have basically a   stronger underlying economy  The risk that I tried to point to is that there could, in fact, be less   patience in that regard, or more concern as the earnings growth slows about the underlying health   of the economy, which could have feedback effects through financial markets  And that would   depress activity more than we are currently forecasting     We haven’t  That would be relatively straightforward to do    Obviously, what that would show, taking off from our baseline forecast, is a lot more growth and   more inflation     In some sense clearly it is not       The answer to that is yes, and my colleague Steve Oliner has   undertaken such a calculation in terms of trying to weight where the various financing is taking   place by the quality of the borrower     But as you know, in the economic literature on how these various   credit channels affect spending, it’s still pretty murky even after the earlier 1990 episode and the   one in 1998  There is considerable debate as to how much credit supply conditions actually   impinge on spending  We think they do, and we have tried to make some allowance for that    But as I’ve indicated, it really is more a seat-of-the-pants type of judgment than one might   normally feel comfortable doing               28     "
6099,2000-11-15,"  Yes, Mr Chairman  It was an oversight on my part, in responding   to President Poole’s question about the difference between the policy outlook of the staff and the   markets, not to have noted that it's quite conceivable that the markets are viewing 4 percent   unemployment as sustainable  If we were to take that assumption on board in our forecast, we   would have unemployment rising above the natural rate and inflation moving down over the   forecast projection  And both those factors would clearly push in the direction of lower nominal   federal funds rates than we’re showing in our forecast  "
6147,2000-12-19,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I thought that  perhaps I could make a useful contribution to the meeting this morning  by dispensing with my usual briefing and moving straight to the question  and answer period  And, as a holiday offering to you, I propose to pose  the questions, as well as answer them     In my view, there would appear to be three principal questions   surrounding the changes that we have made to the Greenbook forecast   First, has the staff overreacted to the accumulating signs of a slowing  economy, many anecdotal, by marking down substantially our near-term  forecast?  In that regard, we revised down our outlook significantly in  1995 and 1998 when signs of slowing emerged, only to discover a few  months later that the expansion had lost little or no momentum  Second-- and conversely--is the staff ignoring some powerful signals that the  economy is moving through a cyclical turning point and that a cumulative  contraction in activity may already be under way?  After all, as I noted in  the July chart show, the staff--and for that matter virtually all economic  forecasters--fail to reliably predict recessions  And finally, is it possible  that the staff’s projection of slowing growth and an attendant easing of  resource pressures--without recession--could be correct?     Let me begin by answering the final question, both because it is the   simplest to answer and because it provides my implicit response to the  first two questions  I think I can safely say, with probability  approaching one, that the staff forecast will not be correct  Exactly how  we will be wrong, of course, is not clear  But I do think a reasonable  case can be made that what we are currently experiencing is a sharp  slowing of aggregate production, rather than either a temporary dip in  growth or an outright broad-based decline in activity     There can be little doubt that the signs of a significant and   widespread slowing in real output have continued to multiply since the  last meeting  As a consequence, we have knocked about 1 to 1-1/2  percentage points off of our projection of real GDP growth this quarter  and next, and we have made somewhat smaller downward adjustments  to our forecast beyond the near term     The most dramatic developments have occurred in the motor   vehicle sector, which accounts for roughly half of the near-term  downward revision that we have made to the forecast  Sales of light  vehicles have declined in recent months, and we are expecting a further  noticeable drop-off in the pace of sales into the first quarter  Faced with      12  clear evidence of a more persistent slowdown in sales, it now looks as if  the automakers are poised to move more aggressively to rein in  burgeoning inventories  Rather than prop up sales through a further  sweetening of incentives, the manufacturers are cutting production  schedules  Moreover, we are expecting that these already-reduced plans  will be marked down further and that some currently scheduled holiday  shutdowns will be extended into January  Even with the prompt and  sizable production cuts we have envisioned, the inventory situation is  not likely to be cleared up until the spring     Neither sales nor production of light vehicles as yet have exhibited  a fall of cyclical dimensions  The same cannot be said of heavy trucks-- a sector where the term “recession” can be applied fairly  By the first  quarter of next year, we expect production of medium and heavy trucks  to be only about one half the level of a year ago  Moreover, with order  backlogs severely depressed, we are not expecting a perceptible  recovery any time soon             The weakness we are seeing in factory activity, however, extends  beyond the motor vehicle manufacturers  To be sure, some of the  apparent softness reflects the indirect effects on upstream suppliers to  the motor vehicle industry--for example, fabricated metals, textiles, and  semiconductors  But evidence of inventory overhangs and of  accompanying production adjustments has become apparent over the  past couple of months in a broad range of industries  The production of  appliances, machinery, steel, paper, and lumber has declined over the  past month or so  Heightened competition from imports also has  weighed heavily on some of these industries, especially steel and  lumber  Adding to these difficulties, there has been a marked slowing in  the production of computers and microprocessors     All told, we are now projecting manufacturing output to decline in  the first quarter before turning up in the spring  We are anticipating that,  going forward, manufacturers will move reasonably promptly to work  off undesired inventories and to adjust to a slower pace of final sales  growth     In that regard, we think that the growth of private demands has   slowed over the course of this year and that the slowdown will intensify  in coming months  In addition to the falloff in sales of motor vehicles,  other consumer spending has slowed--though by just a bit more than we  had been anticipating  But given the recent deterioration of consumer  sentiment and our projection of a further slowing in job gains, we have  lowered our forecast for the growth of real PCE noticeably in the near  term to about 3 percent  That’s still not shabby, but it’s a far cry from  the 5 percent plus pace of the past few years      13    The downward adjustment that we have made to our forecast for   equipment and software spending over the next few quarters, I’d have to  admit, is a bit more speculative  Indeed, the data on orders and  shipments of capital goods actually came in a bit stronger than we had  projected in the November Greenbook; so our revisions here are more  forecast than fact  That said, the tightening of financial conditions this  fall and the apparent slowdown in the growth of output and final sales  seems very likely to take a toll on capital spending in coming months     In addition, we have marked down further our projection for high-  tech equipment spending  There has been a gradual evolution in the  stories that have been told about this sector over the past four or five  months  The initial signs of weakness were attributed to firm-specific  problems of market share  Then, the difficulties were ascribed to the  weakness of the euro and the associated softness in profits earned  abroad  Now, with most firms and nearly every market segment  experiencing sales and earnings disappointments, there is more troubling  talk of a global slowdown in demand     Accordingly, we have reduced our forecast of business spending on   computers, software, and communications equipment, with the largest  revisions occurring over the first three quarters of next year  Our  projection of spending on high-tech equipment has more of a cycle now,  with the coming year being one of comparative weakness followed by  some recovery in 2002  We continue to believe that a rapid pace of  technical progress will create profitable opportunities for investment in  this equipment over the longer haul  Moreover, to the extent that there  has been over-investment in these goods, the situation should prove  relatively short-lived  In contrast to the situation with respect to office  buildings in the late 1980s, the pace of technical progress is rapid  enough in the tech sector that a firm can probably carry a quarter of its  IT equipment out to the dumpster every year--an action that is a bit more  difficult to take with an office building     Taken together, we see a confluence of factors combining to   produce a period of very subdued growth and rising unemployment over  the next several quarters  But we are not yet forecasting recession     There certainly have been several developments in recent weeks that could   be read as signaling the onset of a cyclical downturn  These include, most  notably, the steep rise in initial claims for unemployment insurance, the plunge  in consumer sentiment in December, the declines in industrial production in  October and November, and the widening scope of downward revisions in  expectations of corporate earnings  This is a configuration that could be  consistent with a cyclical turning point      14    The problem is that these same developments are also consistent   with a sharp slowing in activity, not just outright declines  We would  expect further increases in initial claims, if payroll employment growth  slows to the 30,000 to 40,000 monthly pace that we are expecting this  winter  Consumer sentiment also should be expected to deteriorate  further if our macro outlook comes to pass  Industrial production has  declined outside of recession periods in the past  And, a flattening out of  corporate earnings should be expected to accompany a cyclical slowing  of productivity and an updrift in labor compensation in an economy  where there are some restraints on pricing power     We are acutely aware that this interpretation of recent events could   be analogous to that of the proverbial man who jumps off the roof of the  building and reports as he passes the third-floor window, “So far, so  good”   And we cannot rule out that the economy, like the man, will  experience a hard and painful landing  But, we think the odds favor a  continuation of positive growth, and we still do not yet see enough  evidence to persuade us that we have entered, or are about to enter,  recession     If the economy manages a downshift in growth while escaping an   abrupt contraction in activity, there are forces that should be working to  support aggregate demand next year and into 2002  Oil prices already  have retraced some of the spike observed this fall, and futures markets  and our forecast anticipate further declines in the quarters ahead, giving  a boost to domestic incomes  The dollar has come off its recent peaks,  and a further projected decline should support faster growth of exports  later next year  While considerable uncertainty surrounds the fiscal  outlook, it is difficult to imagine any greater restraint going forward and  not far-fetched to imagine much greater ease  And, finally, despite some  minor downward adjustments of late, we remain optimistic about  underlying productivity developments, and we expect longer-term  income trends to be favorable     Because we are projecting a more substantial slowdown in activity   next year than in the last Greenbook, labor market pressures abate more  quickly in this forecast  Indeed, those pressures are now about fully  offset by the indirect effects of declining oil prices on business costs and  on nominal compensation  As a consequence, we are essentially  projecting no further acceleration in price inflation, with core PCE and  core CPI inflation leveling off at a 2 and 2-1/2 percent pace,  respectively, over the forecast period         15  All in all, I guess I’m not bringing you tidings of great joy  On the  other hand, it's not yet a big sack of coal  With that, I’ll turn the floor  over to Karen       I think your description is pretty close to the one that I would give as   well  There has been some backing up in inventory levels  If we went back four or five months, we   would have been hard pressed, outside of maybe some hints in automobiles, to see much in the way   of inventory problems developing  But in recent months we have seen some heaviness of   inventories in a variety of areas  Obviously, the automotive sector is one where they have built up   quite a bit  Steel is another  I gave a list of areas where we’re seeing a buildup  But it doesn’t yet   look like a recession-type scenario in terms of the magnitude of the rise in inventory/sales ratios    And in our forecast we are assuming a quite prompt adjustment in production--we think we’re   already seeing it--that is going to prevent such a situation from developing and then lead to the kind   of normal cyclical turn that one might expect  Obviously, that’s predicated on our underlying view   about final sales not falling out of bed either  If there really were a significant contraction of sales   over the next months, what doesn’t now appear to be a terribly troubling inventory problem could   become one relatively quickly  So we see us getting through this with a production adjustment and a   period of some decline in industrial production, but not one that spills over to a business cycle   adjustment  Nevertheless, we’re nervous about that situation     Several years ago           I think that's a very interesting question  It's one that we’ve been   kicking around, but I'm not sure we have a complete answer to it  It's obvious in some sense that      23  with higher underlying potential output growth, a 2 percent shortfall would still give us growth of   around 2 to 2-1/4 percent whereas when potential output was 2-1/4 percent growth could be near 0    However, as to whether or not you should be thinking about it entirely differently, the one caution I   would provide is that I think there are still likely to be cyclical events  Those could be sharp,   nonlinear type events that would drive a growth rate from 4 percent to 2 percent simply because   there is a rather abrupt change in expectations--a significant shift that would produce a situation that   would look like a recession  It wouldn't just be a slowing in growth from 4 percent to 1 or 2 percent    It would have the look and feel of a recession even if the numbers were a little higher than in the   recessions we have experienced in the past, with very rapidly increasing unemployment and   cutbacks in consumer spending that would be related to shifts in consumer sentiment  So in that   regard I think the way you approach some of the risks to the economy still ought to involve thinking   that there is the potential for highly nonlinear events to occur  And your response in that sense ought   to be the same as you thought about it in the past     Yes, I agree  That is absolutely correct  "
6207,2001-01-30,"  As Larry has just noted, our expectation   that the growth of structural labor productivity will be well  maintained over the next few years is a key element supporting  aggregate demand during the projection period, while at the same  time also helping to limit inflation pressures  The upper panel of  your next chart lays out the details of the supply side of our  projection  As can be seen on line 1, we expect growth of potential  GDP to remain above 4 percent over the projection period  The  slight downward tilt to the growth of potential results from a  somewhat diminished contribution from the pace of capital  deepening between 2000 and 2002--line 4     The weakness that we are projecting for investment spending   in coming quarters does cause the growth of capital services, shown  in the middle left panel, to tail off a bit from its recent rate of  increase  But with the level of investment having reached such lofty  heights in recent years, we continue to anticipate that the growth of  capital services will remain elevated over the next two years     We also expect the growth of structural multifactor   productivity to remain at a 1-1/2 percent annual pace over the next  couple of years  As can be seen in the middle right panel, there has  been a dramatic improvement in the growth of structural MFP over  the past decade--an acceleration of more than 1 percentage point  At  first blush, it may appear ambitious to project that all of this recent  pickup can be sustained going forward  But as can be seen by the  red line, the acceleration of the past decade has lifted the growth of  multifactor productivity to a pace only just a little above the average  of the past one hundred years  Consequently, we don’t view our  productivity forecast as being an especially long stretch        1/30-31/01 104  Our relatively optimistic outlook received support from the  performance of output per hour in the second half of last year  The  lower left panel plots the growth in nonfarm business output  decomposed into the growth of hours--the red shaded area--and the  growth of output per hour--the gray shaded area  The speed and  magnitude of the adjustment of hours growth is quite noteworthy,  and it resulted in productivity gains being well maintained in the  second half despite the sharp slowing of output growth  This  certainly doesn’t settle the issue of how much of the gain in  productivity that we have seen in recent years is cyclical and how  much is structural  But it is the first shred of evidence on the point  and bolsters the case for structural improvement  As shown to the  right, we don’t think labor productivity will escape entirely  unscathed from the sharp slowdown that we are projecting for  activity  We anticipate growth of productivity to slip below 1  percent in the first half of the year, before rebounding to around  trend over the remainder of the projection period     Turning to your next chart, the upper left panel depicts the   GDP gap  With the growth of potential output remaining relatively  robust, the slowdown in real GDP that occurred over the second half  of last year and that is projected to intensify in the first half of this  year leads output to dip below potential in 2001  The unemployment  rate--shown at the right--is expected to rise sharply in coming  months, reaching 4-3/4 percent by midyear and 5-1/4 percent by the  fourth quarter     The middle left panel places this projected rise in the jobless   rate in a cyclical context, an issue that was raised at the last meeting   In the chart I have plotted the maximum and minimum rise in the  unemployment rate around postwar cyclical low points in the series   I have also included our forecast--the black dashed line--using the  fourth quarter of last year as the reference point  Although we are  not projecting what would conventionally be classified as a recession  when viewed in terms of real GDP growth, the expected slowdown  in activity produces an increase in the unemployment rate that is  similar to a mild recession  In our forecast, both the level and the  change in labor market tightness hold down nominal wage demands  as the year progresses     Moreover, there is little evidence that changes in inflation   expectations, shown to the right, will be exerting any pressure on  wage demands  Both the Michigan survey and the Philadelphia Fed  survey showed some pickup between 1999 and 2000 but most  recently have been moving sideways  All told, we are projecting  that hourly labor compensation--measured by both the ECI, the black     1/30-31/01 105  line in the lower left panel, and nonfarm business compensation, the  red line--should decelerate from the pace seen last year     The increase in actual unit labor costs, shown in the first   column of the lower right panel, is expected to move up this year  owing to the cyclical slowing in productivity that I mentioned  earlier  But adjusting for that cyclical slowdown in productivity,  trend unit labor costs--the measure we have found to have the most  predictive content for prices--should slow gradually over the  projection period     In addition to subdued labor cost pressures going forward,   there are a few other factors--highlighted in your next exhibit--that  eventually should help restrain price inflation  As can be seen in the  upper left panel, core intermediate materials prices--the black line-- already have softened in response to the drop in capacity utilization  that has accompanied the slowdown in the industrial sector  And we  anticipate very small increases in materials prices going forward      As you know, energy prices have dominated movements in   headline inflation over the past year, and we see some considerable  further upward pressure early this year  But as Larry noted, we  expect energy prices to decline later in the year, in line with the  expectations registered in futures markets  With respect to  petroleum-based products--the upper right panel--we are expecting a  resumption of declines in gasoline and fuel oil prices by early spring   By contrast, the upward trajectory for the retail price of natural gas is  expected to steepen further over the next few months before  retreating later this year  Aside from a near-term jump in consumer  electricity prices associated with the rate increase that went into  effect in California this month, we don’t expect a great deal of price  action here, at least relative to the other sectors of the energy market     The middle right panel summarizes these influences in terms of   their direct effects on PCE price inflation--the black bars--and an  estimate of their indirect effects on PCE inflation--the red bars-- through the prices of energy-consuming goods and services  Taken  together, we expect the direct effects of energy prices to subtract  about 1/4 percentage point from total PCE price inflation this year,  after a large positive contribution last year  Owing to lags in pass- through, the indirect effects remain a small, though diminishing,  upward influence on inflation this year  By next year, both the direct  and indirect effects should help to hold down overall price inflation     Largely reflecting these energy developments, we are   expecting both total PCE price inflation and total CPI inflation--     1/30-31/01 106  shown in the table at the lower left--to be headed down this year   Because energy prices have a larger weight in the CPI than in the  PCE price measure, the deceleration is more pronounced for the CPI     In general, we are expecting core consumer prices to move a   bit lower over the projection period  As we have noted on a number  of occasions, we believe that the core PCE--shown as the black line  in the lower right panel--has probably understated the pickup in  inflation over the past couple of years because of its inclusion of  imputed service charges, which are statistical constructions of the  BEA rather than measured prices  Those imputed prices have risen  at an unusually slow pace recently, and in our forecast we project the  increases in those prices to return closer to historical norms this year   If this comes to pass, then an uptick in core PCE inflation could  obscure for a time the downward trend that we expect to become  apparent in the market-based measure--the red line--and for that  matter in the core CPI     Your next two charts focus on some implications of the   productivity risks in our projection--risks that we discussed in the  Greenbook and Bluebook  Both the buoyancy of aggregate demand  and the relatively subdued performance of inflation in our forecast  depend importantly on our analysis of structural productivity  As we  considered those influences on the economy that could lead the  current slowdown to become a much more protracted period of poor  economic performance, disappointments on productivity seemed to  hold the greatest potential for damage     There have been a few straws in the wind that could make one   nervous  As seen in the upper left panel, computer prices fell last  year at about half the rate of the 1995 to 1999 period  We think most  of that slower decline was associated with the strong demand and  capacity problems for components that existed early in the year   More recently prices again have begun dropping more rapidly, at a  pace consistent with our forecast  But we can not rule out some  diminution in the pace of technical progress here  Long-term  earnings expectations, another indirect indicator--shown in the upper  right panel--have tipped down over the past few months  But as you  can see, there have been a few declines in that series amidst the  general upward trend of the past six years  Finally, the return to  capital--the middle panel--has leveled out of late, and we are  forecasting some decline over the next two years     For the reasons that I outlined earlier, we do not believe that   these indicators are yet pointing to a significant inflection point in  productivity growth  We project growth in labor productivity over     1/30-31/01 107  the next five years--the black line in the lower panel--to remain near  3 percent  But recognizing this as a risk to our projection, we  considered the consequences of growth in labor productivity  returning to the 1-1/2 percent pace of the two decades prior to 1995   Under this scenario, one could view the recent technological wave as  having played out  In effect, we may have reached the top of the S-  curve, which with a healthy dose of imagination you can see in the  lower panel as the shallower extension of productivity shown in red     The consequences of such a productivity disappointment are   compared to the Greenbook baseline in your next chart  In order to  show something approaching a worst-case scenario, we have  assumed in the simulation that economic agents recognize the full  extent of their misjudgment about productivity early this year  This  precipitates a sharp 30 percent drop in the stock market  The growth  of real GDP under the assumption of an unchanged real federal  funds rate--the red line in the chart to the right--is considerably  lower than in the baseline--the black line  With the demand-side  effects weighing heavily on the economy when the real interest rate  is held constant, the meager gains in real GDP fall short of even the  reduced growth of potential, and there is a steady rise in the  unemployment rate--the middle left panel  Despite the higher  unemployment rate, for the next four years there is no favorable  feedback to price inflation--shown at the right--because of the boost  to unit labor costs implied by the slower productivity growth    Profits--the lower left panel--are hammered by that pickup in labor  costs     In these circumstances, the Taylor rule calls for a steady   reduction in the nominal federal funds rate  Most of this decline  reflects the drop in the equilibrium federal funds rate that follows  from the slower growth of productivity  This is, in essence, the  mirror image of the rise in the equilibrium rate in recent years that  occurred as productivity accelerated  Returning to the blue lines in  the upper panels, the gradual reduction in the funds rate cushions the  drop in the stock market and provides some boost to the growth of  real GDP  As a result, the unemployment rate--the middle left--is  lower than when the real funds rate is held unchanged  However,  that lower path for the unemployment rate is accompanied by higher  price inflation than occurs when the real funds rate is held constant   Relative to the baseline projection, the economy experiences both  higher unemployment and higher price inflation  All in all, these  would be unpleasant and difficult circumstances for monetary  policy        1/30-31/01 108  I should hasten to add that these simulations can only sketch  the broad forces that would be operating on the economy should  productivity fall short of expectations  The model can not determine  how long it would actually take private agents to learn about the  slowdown and whether the process would be abrupt, as assumed in  this scenario, or more gradual  The model also can not address the  consequences of these developments for consumer and business  confidence, which could play a central role in determining the depth  and duration of any accompanying downturn in activity  Nor does it  capture any special psychological effects on foreign investors that  might arise should our recent stellar performance fade      We certainly do not see such an outcome as likely  Indeed,   there is a reasonable chance that the acceleration in productivity will  continue rather than level out as in our forecast  But these exercises  point to some issues that will warrant close scrutiny in the coming  months and suggest the continuing importance of supply-side  developments to your conduct of policy in the period ahead     Karen will now continue our presentation      Given the length of our presentation, you   may be wondering whether this is a briefing or a hostage taking!   [Laughter]  So I’ll try to be mercifully brief     The final chart presents your projections for 2001  Since July,   your forecasts for nominal and real GDP have been revised down, as  has your forecast for PCE price inflation  The unemployment rate  projected for the fourth quarter of this year has been adjusted up a  bit  Relative to the staff projection, the central tendencies of your  projections show stronger growth of real GDP and somewhat higher  price inflation        1/30-31/01 114  Mr Chairman, that does complete our presentation       It must have been just an oversight on my part! [Laughter]      President Jordan, I’d also note that our GDP forecast in   some sense takes account of what we see happening to industrial production, which is   domestic production  We saw such a sharp contraction in manufacturing activity in   December--and in part just on the basis of what we know about autos--that we would   expect another significant contraction in January  So we believe the domestic side   production data are already leading us off to a very weak start to the quarter     I’d say it’s a serious concern because we have   consumption slowing down rather dramatically but not declining, and one could look at   those consumer surveys and certainly be more pessimistic  A couple of small factors   held us back from being even more pessimistic about the near-term consumption outlook    One was that we were hearing from the auto makers that auto sales through the first 20   days of January, while suggesting no underlying improvement from the December figure   once an allowance was made for a bump-up in fleet sales, were not continuing to fall off   steeply  Another was the admittedly shaky weekly indicators that we see on consumer     1/30-31/01 120  spending in the Mitsubishi index and the Johnson Red Book, which also were tending to   tell something of a stabilization story, at least through the first half of January       Yes, it was still up 2-1/4 percent for the first three weeks   of January over December  But I’d say there are very significant risks in this area  The   charts we’ve shown you on consumer sentiment certainly are disturbing     Well, the series that Larry has plotted in his charts, which   is the Michigan expectations index, is actually a part of the leading indicators  So there is   some evidence in that index that expectations tend to lead overall activity  In terms of the   predictive content of the confidence measures for consumption, they tend to be more   coincident than leading, but there’s still a bit of predictive content for the month ahead     Sure  We don’t call that the “full Poole” simulation  It’s   the “partial Poole” simulation, if I may put it that way  In that simulation the only   additional financial market variable that we put into the model was the path for the funds   rate taken from fed funds futures and Eurodollar futures  We allowed the model then to   take that on board in terms of forecasting long-term interest rates  Those rates come   down in that simulation and provide some stimulus to the interest-sensitive components   of spending and in addition have a little effect on the exchange rate as well  So, in   essence, this doesn’t fully incorporate the market-based variables that you had suggested   we at least take a look at  We plan to do that at some point  We’re still working on it     We don’t have a formal process of a forecast-pooling   comparison across the System  I do like to think that we are in touch with the staff at the   Reserve Banks, especially at the Banks that prepare formal forecasts, and compare notes    Certainly the research program of the System is intended to address those issues, though   with a considerable lag  So at this point I guess I’d have to say that we do so only very   informally  Obviously, we are always engaged in the process of evaluating our forecast   and trying to understand what went wrong  Hopefully we learn something from that but   the increments are small  "
6208,2001-01-30,  They are due out at 1000 am  
6252,2001-03-20,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  If you simply  picked up the March Greenbook and perused the forecast sheets, I  could understand how you might conclude that the staff must have  been on an extended vacation--either literally or figuratively--over  the past two months  How could all of the events and turmoil of  recent weeks have left so few marks on the economic projection?   The forecast may leave the impression that we’ve done nothing  during the intermeeting period  Well, let me assure you that it took  endless meetings, hours of debate, and reams of computer output to  do nothing--an outcome that might support the views of some about  productivity in the government sector!  But in fact, I would like to  make the case this morning that, despite many surprises in the  economic and financial data, there were some good reasons for  ending up fairly close to where we started out      Let me begin with the near-term developments, where we have   had a considerable quantity of data to digest  On net, those data  have painted a stronger picture of the economy in early 2001 than  we had anticipated at the time of the January meeting, and we have  revised up our forecast of first-quarter real GDP growth from a  small negative to a small positive  Among the surprises, hiring  averaged nearly 130,000 in January and February, in contrast to our  expectation that private payrolls would be about flat over the first  two months of the year  Sales of new cars and trucks were running  at an annual rate of about 17 million units over that same period,  and reports from the automakers suggest that the pace slackened  only a bit this month  As a result, light motor vehicle sales for the  quarter are likely to exceed our earlier forecast by about one million  units  Likewise, starts and sales of single-family homes have been  running at higher levels than we expected  And, outside of the  residential sector, construction activity is estimated to have soared  in January  Even new orders for capital goods, where the anecdotal  news has been so bad, rose sharply in January to a level well above  what we had been looking for  Finally, the level of inventory  investment in the fourth quarter of last year came in about $20  billion below our earlier forecast, resulting in a downward revision  to our estimate of GDP growth that quarter, but also pointing to less  of a drag from inventory investment in the current quarter     On the basis of the reasonably upbeat readings from the labor   market and the firmness of some of the spending indicators, a case  could be made that we are continuing to underestimate the current  strength of the economy  We included such a scenario in the  Greenbook, not for purposes of aesthetic symmetry, but because we  see some credible upside risks to our forecast        3/20/01 9  In the end, however, we were not persuaded that the incoming  information has painted a fundamentally stronger picture of the  underlying economy  We still view the data, taken together, as  suggesting that we are experiencing a sharp slowing in final  demands and that the implications of that slowing for production  are being amplified by efforts to correct inventory overhangs  As a  consequence, we anticipate that manufacturing output outside of  motor vehicles will fall nearly 3-1/2 percent at an annual rate this  quarter and fall at a 1 percent pace in the second quarter  The size  of these declines in factory output point to an offsetting downside  risk to our near-term outlook     Inventory dynamics are likely to play a significant role in   shaping the contours of activity in coming months  In the motor  vehicle sector, which has figured so prominently to date in the  weakness we have seen in manufacturing, some real headway has  been made  Through a combination of production cuts, sweetened  incentives, and fleet sales, stocks of light motor vehicles have been  worked down over the past few months  Of course, fleet sales and,  to a lesser extent, the use of increased incentives may just be  delaying the full extent of the necessary adjustments  In that regard,  we continue to view the automakers’ production schedules as too  optimistic, and we expect some shortfalls from current plans  But,  there is no doubt that the inventory situation in this industry is in  better shape than a couple of months ago     Elsewhere, inventory-sales ratios remain high in a number of   industries--most notably machinery, semiconductors, lumber,  metals, chemicals, and textiles  As in our last projection, we see the  ongoing efforts to achieve a better alignment of stocks to sales as  weighing heavily on activity through the middle of this year,  knocking 3/4 percentage point off of GDP growth this quarter and  1/2 percentage point off the second quarter     If the recent spending indicators are indeed signaling greater   strength in final demands, that adjustment could proceed more  quickly than we are currently forecasting  But I’d have to say that  we are not optimistic on that score  As I noted earlier, there are  reasons for thinking that some part of the recent strength in motor  vehicle sales is transitory, and with consumer confidence and  household balance sheets having deteriorated so markedly in recent  months, we think consumer spending is likely to be very sluggish in  the period ahead  And while new bookings for capital equipment  jumped in January, those data are noisy, subject to substantial  revision, and appear to contradict widespread reports of weak  equipment demand  Moreover, the near-term weakness in the     3/20/01 10  economy is likely having effects on current incomes, earnings, and  sales that should feed back into slower growth of household and  business spending into the second half of the year     All told, we are projecting the economy to limp along at a 1   percent annual rate through the second quarter--a pace that by the  summer will have prevailed for three-quarters of a year and will  likely have been accompanied by a noticeable rise in the  unemployment rate     We then project a gradual reacceleration of activity that is very   similar to that traced out in the January Greenbook  As in our last  forecast, the cessation of the inventory correction results in  somewhat stronger growth of production  Moreover, we continue  to expect fiscal policy to provide a modest boost to demand, and on  our assumption that a small portion of the projected tax cut will be  made retroactive this year, that boost comes a bit earlier than we  had previously assumed  As before, declining energy prices also  are expected to help bolster real income growth and corporate  balance sheets     As you know, we have made considerably larger adjustments to   our assumed path for the federal funds rate  The baseline path in  the March forecast is 75 basis points below that in our previous  projection  Despite this substantial change, the growth of real GDP,  the unemployment rate, and inflation are not much different than in  the January forecast  In our view, a number of powerful forces  have been working to offset the stimulative effects of lower short- term interest rates and, in essence, to lower the equilibrium real  federal funds rate  To be sure, long rates have come down  considerably, and we have seen some of the effects of those lower  rates on spending, especially in the construction sector  But other  aspects of the financial environment have turned more restrictive     The largest single factor has been the stock market, which has   fallen to nearly 10 percent below our previous projection  I won’t  pretend to know where the stock market is headed but, taking our  forecast for structural productivity growth as a given, the implicit  equity premium in this forecast moves up into the vicinity of  historical norms  On currency markets, the dollar has moved up  even as the funds rate has fallen, and its trajectory is projected to be  higher than in our previous forecast  Combined with our downward  revision to foreign activity, these changes in our external outlook  also have acted to attenuate the effect of policy actions  Factoring  in all of these developments, the projected level of real GDP in  2002 is just a touch below our January forecast     3/20/01 11    We also saw little reason to change our inflation forecast  The   incoming data have generally been on the high side of our  expectations, especially for core CPI and PCE  Both of these  measures are now showing about 1/2 percentage point acceleration  from the same period a year ago  We gave only a small weight to  the recent upside surprise in consumer prices, basically leaving our  2001 price forecast unchanged at this early point in the year  With  noticeable slack developing in labor and product markets, pressures  on wages and prices should begin to diminish later this year  And,  with the indirect effects of declining energy prices also relieving  inflation pressures, we are expecting core inflation to tail off in  2002     It is obviously a significant understatement to say that the   economy faces some very large risks in the period ahead, some of  which are highlighted by the strong crosscurrents in the data  The  declines in consumer confidence, for example, appear at odds with  the still strong levels of auto and home sales  In our forecast, we  have taken the middle ground between these indicators  But we  highlighted in the Greenbook the consequences for the economy of  a sharp rise in the personal saving rate, such as might result from an  increase in precautionary saving accompanying a drop in  confidence All else equal, a 1 percentage point rise in the saving  rate could add about 1 percentage point to the unemployment rate  by the end of 2002     We also are uncertain about the extent of any capital stock   overhang that may have developed in the business sector  Different  models and different periods of comparison tell quite different  stories  Our forecast is consistent with some overhang having  developed that will depress equipment investment, especially high- tech investment, below the levels suggested by the fundamentals as  summarized by our models  But our forecast does not assume that  the overhang is large, and growth of investment spending gets back  on track by early next year  Again, we tried to give a sense of the  magnitude of these risks with a couple of alternative simulations in  which high-tech investment weakens to an extent only seen during  recessions  Of course, tech investment could weaken even more  than this--sometimes the unprecedented does happen--but this  seemed like a reasonable starting point  Taken by itself, a high-tech  recession causes the economy to grow more slowly than in the  already weak baseline  But if that high-tech retrenchment were to  be combined with a widely recognized slowing in the pace of  technical progress, the accompanying drop in the stock market and     3/20/01 12  slump in investment spending would be sufficient to create an  outright recession     I think these simulations are useful in gauging the dimensions   of the economic consequences of various shocks  But I will readily  admit that they also have some serious shortcomings  As I  reviewed this set of simulations again over the weekend, I had a  nagging feeling that this analysis fails to capture the full range of  the risks that confront you  Borrowing a lesson from the risk  management literature, I would note that in considering the  uncertainties in the economic outlook, it’s likely that the unforeseen  covariances will create the problems  The interplay between  confidence, the stock market, investment, and policy could well be  more powerful than the sum of any of these influences taken in  isolation     In the past couple of weeks, we have seen the interrelationship   of risks begin to extend beyond the domestic economy and  encompass more noticeably economic and financial developments  abroad  On that observation, I’ll turn the floor over to Karen who,  by virtue of her responsibilities for following the rest of the world’s  economies, probably knows a thing or two about the complications  of covariances       On your first question about the easier monetary policy   scenario in the Greenbook, as you know, even in that scenario the unemployment rate   still rises to nearly 5-1/4 percent by year-end and to just a little below 5-1/2 percent by   the end of 2002  We don’t see much disinflation benefit from that rise in the   unemployment rate because according to the model--which as we’ve already discussed is   a little weak in this particular area--the depreciation of the exchange rate that   accompanies the more aggressive easing of monetary policy offsets the disinflation   benefit somewhat  But beyond the 2002 period, unemployment would still be a bit above   our estimate of the sustainable rate, and we’d probably see some very mild downward   pressures on inflation in 2003   In our forecast, we have a slight upward tilt to our natural   rate assumption because without any further acceleration of productivity there’s a     3/20/01 23  tendency for the natural rate to rise  So we wouldn’t get a lot of disinflation beyond that   projected but we wouldn’t see inflation pressures either   Now, in terms of the more aggressive easing scenario and its potential to create   some overbuilding in the real estate sector, that certainly is a possibility  It’s very   difficult for me to forecast the errors that banks might make, but they certainly have   traditionally made those kinds of errors in previous long periods of economic strength    Moreover, real estate prices have been quite firm and construction activity has remained   very strong despite the weakening we’ve seen in the stock market and the slowing we’ve   had in output growth  So, with further easing, I think there would certainly be risks on   the real estate side     There would be a significant disinflation built into the   system  Even with that easier monetary policy, you would have to ease even more   aggressively  We took that simulation out this time, not because we thought it was any   less important than it has been in the past but because we were concerned about   presenting too many simulations here  But that scenario basically suggested that at least   another 100 basis points of ease would be necessary just to get the economy on the right   track  That simulation would still show inflation running a little above 1 percent on our   baseline funds rate assumption by the end of 2002     Well, it depends on what you mean by historical norms  If   productivity growth were to return, let’s say, to the 1 to 1-1/2 percent rate that we   experienced for a significant period of time, that would be associated with a very   substantial decline in the stock market and a more substantial rise in the saving rate  The   saving rate could perhaps move closer to historical norms than we’re assuming in our   forecast  When I said in my briefing that we had the equity premium in this forecast   moving back toward historical norms, I said “given our assumption for structural   productivity growth”--or words to that effect--which is significantly above the norm of   the last 20 years     Yes, but we’ve seen changes in the longer-term trends in   some components of income  For example, transfer income, which involves a much   higher propensity to consume, is a larger share of income now than it was in the 1960s  It   can explain some of that longer-term decline in the saving rate  It’s clear that the saving   rate could still have a fair ways to go on the up side  One other point I would make is to   caution you not necessarily to take seriously the current published level of the saving   rate  That often is revised by a significant amount at times of annual revisions  We   revised down the level of the saving rate in this forecast in large measure because we     3/20/01 28  think BEA is using numbers for taxes this year that ultimately are likely to be revised   down  They’re more optimistic about--      Yes, indeed  We’re talking about $15 billion or so here     The change is behavioral     Yes, it’s behavioral  Also, we don’t have the wealth-  income ratio going back to the levels where it had been earlier  So, even within the   simple framework that we used, there would be reason for the saving rate to remain   below its historical norms  That is just another factor  The saving rate has fallen more in   recent years than can be explained by the factors that we think drive it  So there is still a   potential--which I assume is your point--for some upside risk associated with the saving   rate and the levels that we’re projecting if whatever caused that saving rate to decline   reverses itself going forward     3/20/01 30 "
6297,2001-05-15,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  In reading our discussion  in the Greenbook of the multiple sources of revisions to our projection this  round, you might have sensed a desire on our part for you, as policymakers, to  share our pain, as economic forecasters  We did, indeed, have to cope with  many significant developments of consequence for our projection  a heavy  flow of data releases, crosscurrents in financial markets, changes in monetary  and fiscal policy settings, and new information bearing on our estimate of  structural productivity growth  Rather than inflict that discussion on you  again, I thought I would simplify and focus my remarks this morning on two  principal messages  First, we believe that the economy, at present, is very  weak--not in recession, but not far from it either  And second, in both current     5/15/01     11   economic developments and policy actions, we see the seeds from which an  economic rebound could emerge later this year or in 2002        As has been the case since last fall, the most intense weakness remains   centered in the factory sector  Yesterday, we published IP, which showed  another 1/4 percent fall in manufacturing output in April  That drop comes on  the heels of some hefty downward revisions to previous months that now  show output as having declined 7-3/4 percent at an annual rate in the first  quarter  Despite sizable reductions in production and, in some cases, outright  liquidations of inventories, many manufacturers still find themselves with  stocks that are too high relative to the recent pace of sales  Even the  automakers, who had managed to make substantial progress in bringing stocks  into better alignment with sales, seem to be backsliding a bit, especially with  respect to light trucks  In the technology sector, producers of computers,  communications equipment, and semiconductors have been slashing  production, but soft demand and excessive inventories continue to be a  problem  Whereas we had earlier anticipated that the production adjustment  in manufacturing would be complete by midyear, our current projection does  not anticipate an upturn until the fall        While the weakness may be centered in manufacturing, there are now   signs in the labor market that we may be seeing some spillover to the broader  economy  The drop in private payroll employment of 261,000 in April was  still heavily concentrated in goods-related sectors  However, the services  industry also experienced a drop last month, even abstracting from the decline  in temporary-help employment, much of which is supplied to the factory  sector  As the growth of real output shifted down after the middle of last year,  employers moved quickly to curtail hours by cutting workweeks  With the  period of sub-par performance proving to be more persistent than many  initially thought, firms now appear more willing to shed workers        To be sure, we think the April figure overstates the degree of weakness   in labor markets  Seasonal adjustment difficulties, especially in construction,  may have been a factor  But most of the labor market indicators that we look  at have softened appreciably in recent months  Survey measures indicate that  households perceive a deterioration in labor market conditions, and employers  report fewer difficulties finding qualified workers  In addition, help-wanted  advertising has plunged in recent months  Our most timely indicator, initial  claims, has averaged more than 400,000 in recent weeks, a level that we  estimate would be consistent with ongoing declines in payroll employment   The unemployment rate, at 45 percent, already has moved up more than 1/2  percentage point, and unless the economy reaccelerates much more rapidly  than we, or virtually anyone else anticipates, it is difficult to envision how the  jobless rate will not move higher in coming months        5/15/01     12      With labor income weakening, consumer sentiment still down  noticeably, and, by our estimates, the wealth effect likely to be exerting  considerable restraint, we are projecting only a meager gain in consumer  spending this quarter  We were not impressed by last Friday’s report on retail  sales  The 07 percent gain in the retail control category was likely inflated by  a steep rise in gasoline prices, and there were some large downward revisions  to the estimates of previous months  All told, real spending in this category in  April was a bit below the first-quarter average and consistent with our  projection  Moreover, after last quarter’s surge, motor vehicle sales softened  in April and early May  Even services consumption has slowed of late, and  we expect only small gains, on average, over the next few months        The biggest surprise to us on the spending side over the intermeeting   period was the weakness in capital spending  The “high-tech recession” that  we had highlighted as a risk in our March projection is now our baseline  forecast  Orders for nondefense capital goods fell virtually across the board in  February and March, and shipments of these goods were also down, on net,  over the two months  As a result, we now expect real E&S spending to  decline again this quarter  The bulk of the markdown in our forecast was in  high-tech spending, but we also deepened and extended the declines we are  expecting for spending on other types of capital equipment  These series are  so volatile that even two months of data form a shaky basis for a significant  revision in the forecast  But other readings on investment demand paint a  similar picture  The purchasing managers in their semiannual survey reported  a substantial downward revision in planned investment spending by  manufacturers, and anecdotes on capital spending, especially for high-tech  equipment, remain downbeat  In the end, we believe the downward revision  that we have made to investment spending better balances the risks to the  projection        Putting all of the pieces together, we now anticipate that the current   period of weakness will extend through the third quarter  However, there are  several reasons for anticipating a pickup in the pace of activity later this year        For one, inventory dynamics are likely to support an acceleration of   production at some point in the next few quarters  While many industries are  struggling with bloated inventories, the evidence suggests that production cuts  have been large enough to produce an outright liquidation of stocks in recent  months  Inventory liquidations are self-limiting, and at some point, the level  of output will move back closer to that of sales, providing a lift to production  and employment with further positive feedback to sales  We expect this  dynamic to be shifting in a favorable direction in the second half of the year,  though that pattern is a bit difficult to discern in our projection because of the  drawdown of inventories that we projected to accompany a tax-induced surge  of sales in the fourth quarter        5/15/01     13      And that brings me to our fiscal outlook--another positive for growth   I’m not sure I can recall an element of our forecast going off track as quickly  as the fiscal policy assumptions that we incorporated in this Greenbook   Recognizing the uncertainties, we waited as long as we could in the process  and then took our best shot  Unfortunately, our elegantly constructed fiscal  program had a half life of about 36 hours  As you know from reading the  Greenbook, we coupled a more generous permanent tax cut than we had  previously assumed with the introduction of a sizable tax rebate to be  delivered later this year; such a package is consistent with the budget  resolution       Although the uncertainty is still far from resolved, developments   immediately subsequent to the Greenbook suggest that political sentiment  may be shifting toward a larger permanent tax cut and no temporary rebate  If  something like the plan introduced by Senators Grassley and Baucus last week  were implemented, instead of a program that employs tax rebates, the  consequences for our projection would be more one of timing than magnitude   We would likely trim growth of real GDP a bit in 2001 and boost it by a  similar amount in 2002  But the point to be stressed is that, regardless of  which approach is finally adopted, fiscal policy is likely to be more  stimulative than we had incorporated in our March forecast, and it almost  certainly will provide a noticeable boost to activity going forward        The same is true for monetary policy  To be sure, the strength of the   dollar and the weakness in stock prices have likely acted to offset some of the  stimulus that you might have expected from your actions this year  Of course,  it is precisely these kinds of developments that cause policy lags to be long  and variable  While one needs to be cautious about interpreting the  calculations of the equilibrium real interest rate that were displayed in the  Bluebook, I think it’s fair to say that with the additional ease we have  assumed, the funds rate is likely to be in territory that implies a considerable  stimulus to economic activity over time  One already can identify some of the  channels through which easier policy is setting the stage for a pickup in  activity  Businesses and households, for example, are taking advantage of  lower rates to shore up balance sheets, and any softening in construction and  spending on durable goods has been limited by the drop in interest rates  As  overhangs of inventories and capital goods are worked off, a favorable cost of  capital can be expected to encourage a rebound in these forms of capital  spending      The magnitude of the reacceleration in real GDP will depend   importantly on the course of technical progress and structural productivity  In  that regard, we are still anticipating that ongoing improvements in structural  productivity will support a return to more vigorous growth in household and  business demands  That said, we have reduced our forecast for structural  productivity this round  In part, we were responding to the smaller     5/15/01     14   contribution from capital deepening implicit in our lower trajectory for  business investment  But we also took on board the smaller gains in  multifactor productivity apparent in the recently published data for 1996 to  1999  This supply-side revision to our forecast affects aggregate demand  relatively promptly through a reduction in expected growth of household and  business incomes        The reduced pace of structural productivity also underlies the   upward revision that we have made to our inflation forecast  In essence,  the increases in nominal compensation that we are projecting imply  more price pressure than we had previously forecast  In that regard, the  incoming data on wages and prices have just about uniformly been to the  high side of our expectations  The quarterly figures can be noisy, and  we have not read these data as signaling a marked deterioration in the  performance of inflation  But the recent data suggest some upside risks  to the inflation projection  We still expect that inflation will slow  between this year and next, as resource utilization loosens up and energy  prices retreat  But the level of inflation is a bit higher throughout the  projection period than in our previous forecast        The risks around our baseline projection remain large, but they   seem to us to be reasonably well balanced  We highlighted a number of  these risks in the Greenbook; I’d just like to mention two  On the up  side, final demands may not be as weak as we are projecting  If that is  the case, then more significant progress is being made on the inventory  front, and the positive inventory dynamics that I laid out before could  lead to a sharper snapback in activity not that far in the future  Coupled  with the stimulus we are expecting to show through from monetary and  fiscal policy, a more rapid recovery of demand could provide quite a  kick to activity next year  This type of outlook would seem to be  consistent with market expectations of substantial tightening of policy  over the course of 2002          On the down side, if the substantial near-term cuts in payroll   employment and the accompanying rise in the unemployment rate come  to pass, consumers may finally throw in the towel  The “delicate  balance,” as we called it in the Greenbook, may not hold  A significant  retrenchment in household spending would feed back to an already weak  business sector and could significantly prolong the period of below-trend  growth or possibly push the economy into recession        While the risks remain considerable, I would like to conclude with a   pitch for the general thrust of the Greenbook--that is, a period of small  increases in real output without a true cyclical downturn  The economy  has already absorbed several blows over the past year that have not yet  triggered recession, among them a large downturn in the stock market, a     5/15/01     15   run-up in energy prices, a pronounced inventory correction in the  manufacturing sector, and a severe slump in the technology sector   Of  course, these shocks have not fully played out, and the recent softening  in the labor market will add further strain  Still, the resilience of the  economy over the past year in the face of some pretty big negatives has  been impressive, and we remain cautiously optimistic that it will  continue     Karen will now continue our presentation      Well, the continued strength of those data has been a bit of a   puzzle  As you point out, some of it is explainable by the surge in drilling and mining activity   that has accompanied the run-up in oil and gas prices  We are not expecting that current pace to   continue going forward  We anticipate a rather significant slowdown in nonresidential   construction activity, and a lot of that slowing occurs in the office sector where some tentative   signs give us a sense that that market is beginning to top out  However, it is still the case that in   general the overall health of the construction sector in the nonresidential area has been   reasonably good and we’re not expecting declines going forward  But I think it’s a risk     Gee, I was going to say that, Mr Chairman!  I would caution that   in some sense we can make the model produce a recession  That is, we can give it a large   enough shock to push the economy into recession  But, in fact, I think it is a feature of most   linear models of the economy that they do not capture the kinds of processes that occur as the   economy goes into a true recession  One can take a look at the pattern of forecast errors around   recessions, and it is almost always the case that the recessions are steeper than models can     5/15/01     19   explain  So, the recession often occurs because there is a collapse of confidence that   accompanies them  Part of what I was trying to convey in my remarks was that one thing that   might push us into recession would be that, as the unemployment rate rises, we start to see a   period of more significant layoffs and payroll employment declines  That tends to trigger a real   pull-back in consumption  It is more than might be suggested just by the lagged effects of past   income growth or a pull-back in investment spending in the face of uncertainty  It is greater than   would be expected on the basis of output growth or the cost of capital  So I see those risks as   being genuine and I see our model as probably not being able to capture those risks adequately     Yes  And that, combined probably with some retrenchment in   business spending and some more significant cutbacks in production, could lead to something   that is a genuine cyclical downturn     Confidence, one way or another  It could be business confidence    Another possibility is that the high-tech “meltdown”-- we’re going to have to start inventing new   names for these phenomena as we revise down our forecast more and more--does not produce a   recession, but leads to a shift in business confidence  And that in turn could lead to a more   significant retrenchment in investment spending than the model suggests  So it could be either   consumer or business confidence  I did want to highlight the fact that we’re entering a somewhat   new period here in the forecast with payroll employment declining  We’ve had a rise in the   unemployment rate so far that has been associated with a slowdown in employment growth  We     5/15/01     20   think that over the next few months we will see outright declines in employment and a continued   rise in the unemployment rate  And that at least raises the possibility of a more significant   negative effect on consumer confidence  That’s not our projection  In fact, we think consumer   confidence has fallen so much already that it looks consistent with this period of payroll   employment declines  But there does seem to be a real risk that confidence could deteriorate       Well, that would certainly be one reason why a recession is very   difficult to forecast  We really think of each recession as being only one data point, and there   aren’t that many recessions in the postwar period to begin with  Another factor just may be the   types of quantitative models that we’re dealing with  Our models, at least, are not able to fully   capture the psychological effects and confidence-type effects that seem to play an important role   in business cycles  That’s not to say that we couldn’t discover data sources or ways of   measuring that going forward  But I don’t know how we would do that currently     It could also be, as the economy has eroded so much, that the   prospect of getting back to a more moderate growth path starts to look more reasonable, just   because one would expect some rebound given how far production has already fallen  It’s   certainly possible that we’re looking in the rear-view mirror--looking at developments in terms   of where the economy has been--and maybe other economic forecasters are, too  Perhaps we are   focusing on how we’ve been revising down our projection and viewing that in some sense as a   sign of impending weakness, and maybe the markets are looking forward and seeing a much   stronger rebound    I could not in the end convince myself, given the recent data, that the best forecast is a   more vigorous rebound in activity than we are currently anticipating because, for one, we are   seeing still very significant cutbacks in the manufacturing sector  And we have seen more   troubling signs that less progress has been made in getting inventories into better alignment with   sales  Inventory-sales ratios have been hanging up more than we thought  In addition to that,   with the rise over the intermeeting period in initial claims for unemployment insurance and other   signs that the labor market is weakening, we came to the conclusion that the economy is   currently in a very weak and somewhat vulnerable state  And as I indicated earlier, given that   we can see these trends going on for a few more months, those vulnerabilities will continue to be   there  We see a significant rebound coming, though in our forecast the economy still will be   running below potential through most of the projection period  Another possibility is that we     5/15/01     24   have marked our productivity forecast down too much  It could very well be that many market   participants are still seeing signs of strong productivity growth that are going to give even more   impetus to a reacceleration of activity and earnings potential going forward  So, I see a variety   of risks  There certainly are tensions between our view and the way that both the equity and   bond markets have behaved in the intermeeting period  But we are still reasonably comfortable   with our forecast of fairly weak growth, for at least the near-term period, followed by some   recovery       Roughly they would be a little better than a percentage point in   each quarter  And we are expecting a 3 percent increase in the second quarter     I think that would be about 2 percent instead of 3 percent  So it   would be a smoother pattern; obviously the data series was affected significantly by the very   sharp swings in the reported hours of self-employed workers  Nevertheless, looking at the past   four quarters, we’ve had 2-3/4 percent growth in nonfarm productivity in a period when three of   those four quarters were quite weak in terms of overall activity  So, again, that is leading us to   be on the relatively optimistic side about productivity going forward  "
6358,2001-06-26," Mr Chairman, may I make one comment about Jeff’s picture as   well?  What Jeff hinted at in his remarks, but it doesn’t actually show in the chart, is that the   techniques that he used--and indeed that we used ourselves before last summer--were techniques   that in a period of improving productivity are going to result in a series of persistent one-sided   errors That is in fact what we were observing in our own forecasts for a considerable period of   time  So it didn’t seem to us to be a reasonable approach to take as a baseline, given that it   almost certainly would result in that kind of pattern  We recognized, as Sandy said, when we   shifted to our current approach, that by tying our potential output forecast much more closely to   our investment forecast we were going to create a series that would move around a great deal  I   don’t take the up and down movement in our estimates that we’ve seen thus far over the last year   necessarily as a defeat of the basic approach  While proving more variable, like our forecast, it     6/26-27/01 25   may turn out to be less biased than an approach that looks simply at a linear filter of productivity   performance  So I think the jury is still out    Obviously, we felt in some sense that it was very difficult to present a forecast to the   FOMC time after time in which an investment forecast implied something about the pace of   capital deepening but we then divorced that forecast from our estimates of structural productivity    That was the concern that led us in the direction of trying to tie those concepts closer together    What has happened, obviously, is that our investment forecast has been off by a ton over the past   year We moved to this technique probably just at the time of our peak forecast of investment   and have been revising it down since then So I think Jeff is entirely fair to present this chart   because it indeed reflects our record  On the other hand, I don’t think it necessarily requires us to   put an “eyes only” over it and never show it to anybody  In fact, I feel quite comfortable   explaining it and defending this pattern of errors to the Committee or to people outside the   Committee as well      I think we recognize that    Also, the kinds of questions one might want to address with these   various analyses are different I remember President Minehan asking early on in this process   about whether we would use this for a 10-year forecast  We indicated “no,” because we’re   thinking in some sense about a higher frequency notion of what is structural  We tried to adjust   our language to reflect that by using different terminology--talking not about our view of trend   productivity but our view of structural productivity  And in the longer-term simulations that we   present to the Committee, that estimate of structural productivity varies over time, depending on   the longer-term outlook for capital investment or the relative price of capital equipment    I think that is a very good suggestion  One would want to know   not only the standard error of the invested capital accumulation but its covariance with the   multifactor productivity as well    Let me add just one comment to that  With our more variable   estimate, we think that some downward adjustment to structural productivity growth probably   has occurred over the past year and that that has had an effect of lowering the equilibrium real   federal funds rate For all the reasons that Jeff laid out about our uncertainties and the confidence   intervals around many of these estimates, I certainly don't want to lean too heavily on that reed    But it is a piece of our analysis    But we are also getting capital income  If you are Intel and your   production facility is located in Taiwan, there is a reflow of income from that capital  "
6359,2001-06-26," Thank you, Mr Chairman  If the Vice Chairman found the  last presentation a refreshing admission of ignorance, wait until he hears this Chart  Show!3  [Laughter]   As you know from reading the Greenbook, we continue to believe that the  economy is barely growing at present  Real GDP--the black line in the upper left  panel of your first chart--has decelerated sharply from its rapid pace of early 2000   That slowdown has been amplified by a substantial inventory correction, but the  growth of real final sales--the red line--also has moved down markedly, on net, in  recent quarters  We have received two important pieces of information since the  forecast was completed last Wednesday--international trade figures for April and,  this morning, a reading on new orders and shipments of capital goods in May; the  implications of these data for our forecast are shown at the right  Revisions in the  trade data point to even weaker growth of real GDP in the first quarter--about 08  percent at an annual rate instead of the 12 percent we showed in the Greenbook   This morning’s figures on orders and shipments were in line with our expectations  and leave our estimate of growth in the current quarter at about 2 percent  For the  year as whole, we now expect real GDP to increase 14 percent, just a touch lower  than in the Greenbook forecast   3 Copies of the Chart Show materials are appended to this transcript  (Appendix 3)     6/26-27/01 52   With the growth of real output projected to run well below the growth of  potential into next year, the unemployment rate is expected to rise from its current  level of 4-1/2 percent to about 5-1/2 percent next year   Overall PCE inflation, the black line at the right, is expected to drop from the  2-1/4 percent rate posted last year to about 1-3/4 percent in 2002 That deceleration  largely reflects our anticipation that consumer energy prices will be falling  noticeably in coming quarters  Core price inflation, the red line, basically moves  sideways at just under a 2 percent rate  The deceleration of structural productivity  in the staff projection, discussed by Sandy and Dan, is a source of upward pressure  on price inflation over the projection interval  But the indirect effects of falling  energy prices and the emergence of slack in labor and product markets are expected  to keep a lid on core inflation through 2002   Clearly, the extent of the weakness in the economy has come as a surprise to  most forecasters  As seen at the lower left, the Blue Chip panel has marked down  its forecast for real GDP growth in 2001 by about a percentage point since January,  while making only a marginal adjustment to their outlook for 2002  Our forecast-­ the lower right panel--already was well below the consensus in January, but we too  have revised down a bit further our projection for growth of real output this year   Like the Blue Chip, we have revised up our forecast for inflation this year, but have  not changed our outlook for 2002   Your next exhibit highlights the two related influences that have most shaped  the very rocky economic performance that we have experienced since late last year-­ inventories and capital goods Earlier this year, we had expected the sharp cutbacks  in production that began last fall to have largely eliminated most inventory  overhangs by early summer  As you can see in the upper two panels, that has not  happened Inventory-sales ratios for high-technology products--the left panel--have  soared in recent months, and those in the non-tech sector--the right panel--have, on  net, edged up further Firms in the aggregate have been liquidating stocks since  about the turn of the year But virtually all of that liquidation has come in the non- tech sector For tech products, inventory accumulation appears to have crested this  spring, but the bulk of the liquidation phase for that sector still lies ahead   The collapse in investment has certainly weighed on final demand and  contributed to inventory problems  As seen in the middle left panel, orders and  shipments of computers and communications equipment have plummeted in recent  months And the outlook for investment in other equipment--shown to the right-­ has deteriorated as well Revised data now indicate that orders have been running  well below shipments since the turn of the year, implying order backlogs have been  drawn down All in all, it’s a very weak picture   As a result, we now anticipate that industrial production will fall sharply  through the third quarter, and recovery will only take hold early next year as     6/26-27/01 53   inventories are cleared out and demand begins to firm  In the technology equipment  sector--the lower left panel--production is expected to decline into the autumn   Computers and semiconductors should turn up before the end of this year, but  communications equipment is not expected to post any gains until 2002  Outside of  technology and motor vehicles, we are expecting deep cuts in production to continue  through the summer before output reaches bottom toward year-end  The subsequent  recovery that we are projecting for next year is a weak one by historical standards   Your next chart highlights a few sectors that have, thus far, prevented the  weakness in capital spending and industrial production from tipping us into outright  recession Light vehicle sales, shown in the upper left panel, have held up very  well And reports for early June suggest that the sales pace has not yet slackened  appreciably To some extent, automakers have been holding up sales through the  use of more generous incentives  Even with some further sweetening of incentives,  we expect the deceleration of income and the weakening of household wealth to  result in some drop-off in coming quarters  As seen to the right, prompt and  aggressive cuts in production succeeded earlier this year in curbing motor vehicle  inventories, but if our sales forecast is correct, further cuts will be necessary in the  second half   Housing starts--the middle left panel--also have been well maintained this year   Low mortgage interest rates have largely offset negative income and wealth effects,  and we are projecting residential construction activity to be little changed over the  remainder of the year   Consumer spending, shown in the panel at the right, has surprised us to the  upside Still, after a jump early in the year, real spending has been on a shallower  trajectory than was the case over the past few years  Moreover, we think that the  slower pace of spending would have been even more noticeable by the second half  of the year absent the effect of the tax cuts--the blue line in the chart   While I hate to throw cold water on even these few warm spots in the economy,  it is worth pointing out that these sectors are not likely to provide much upward  momentum to activity in coming quarters  We think motor vehicle production will  be a slight negative, housing will be roughly flat, and consumer spending will be  restrained by fundamentals that are only being offset by the tax cut   The risks surrounding that outlook are likely to be further tested by the  softening under way in labor markets  As seen in the lower left panel, a four-week  moving average of initial claims for unemployment insurance has marched steadily  higher thus far this year Accompanying that deterioration has been a sharp slowing  in private payrolls As seen by the black line at the right, manufacturers and related  firms in wholesale trade and help supply have been shedding workers at a  progressively faster rate since last year  And in recent months, we have seen  evidence that employment increases in private service-producing industries have  stepped down considerably  All told, we anticipate total private payrolls to shrink     6/26-27/01 54   by about 100,000 per month this summer, with a pickup in employment only  occurring early next year   From this current position of weakness, it looks like a long way to get to the 3­ 1/2 percent growth that we have projected for 2002  And, indeed, we expect the  period immediately ahead to be touch and go with respect to whether the economy  can avoid outright declines in aggregate output  Assuming it does, the eventual  cessation of inventory liquidation should provide a boost to production,  employment, and incomes  Moreover, we see two other considerable pluses for the  economy--the stimulus from monetary policy and fiscal policy--the subjects of your  next two charts   As shown in the upper panel of chart 4, the recent easing of monetary policy  has restored an upward tilt to the yield curve, after last year’s inversion  The  considerable decline over the past year in both long-term and short-term interest  rates should help buoy activity by easing balance sheet strains and lowering the cost  of capital to businesses and households  But other elements of the financial  configuration are not so supportive as interest rates  In equity markets, the price- earnings ratio, shown in the middle left panel, has generally moved lower over the  past year, even as real interest rates have come down  Moreover, the real exchange  value of the dollar, shown at the right, moved still higher over this period   The lower left panel reproduces the Bluebook chart that summarizes these  various factors in the form of an estimated range for the equilibrium real federal  funds rate--the shaded area The actual real funds rate has now fallen below its  historical average and below our estimates of the equilibrium real rate  Of course,  while the actual real funds rate has fallen, so too has the equilibrium rate, suggesting  somewhat less stimulus from the current setting of policy than might be judged from  movements in the funds rate alone  In the panel to the right, we use the FRB/US  model to parse out its estimated 120 basis point decline in the equilibrium funds rate  since the middle of last year  About half the decline reflects increases in the equity  premium and the exchange rate  The other half of the decline largely reflects the  drop in estimated structural productivity growth  While the range of uncertainty  surrounding any of these estimates is large, we do think the analysis suggests that  monetary policy will be a source of stimulus to activity going forward   The same can be said for fiscal policy, the subject of your next chart  The tax  plan signed by the President was similar in its elements to the one we incorporated  in the May Greenbook, though a bit less generous in the near term and more  generous next year The key elements are described in the upper left panel  A tax  rebate of $38 billion will be paid out between July and September  A permanent tax  reduction of $3 billion will take place this fiscal year and a $71 billion cut is  scheduled for fiscal 2002   As I am sure you can appreciate, we had to engage in a process that was as  much art as science as we built into our projection the effects of these cuts in taxes     6/26-27/01 55   on private spending and production  As noted to the right, we made a number of  key assumptions each of which is a gross simplification of a complex reality  We  assumed that for some households consumption tracks cash flow closely, and they  are assumed to spend tax rebates and permanent tax cuts reasonably fully over  several quarters Other households will spend only a small fraction of their rebate  checks and will adjust spending slowly to their increases in after-tax incomes   Finally, some of the initial effect of the boost to spending will be absorbed by a  drawdown of inventories   The effects of the empirical implementation of these assumptions on the level  of real GDP are depicted in the graph at the middle left  The black solid line shows  the effects of the tax cut on inventory investment; the red shaded area shows the  estimated spending effect; and the red solid line shows the total effect on the level of  real GDP As can be seen, we expect the initial jump in spending stimulated by the  tax cuts to be partly met in the second half of the year by a drawdown of  inventories Moving into 2002, the next installment of the permanent cut maintains  the stimulus to spending, and businesses should, all else equal, move to replenish  inventories Taken together, these influences push up the level of real GDP through  much of next year The panel to the right simply converts the level effects on GDP  shown at the left into growth rate contributions  As you can see, the effects on the  growth of real GDP are largest in the second half of this year, but they remain  positive through most of 2002   Government spending also boosts activity over our projection period  Real  federal purchases--the red bars in the lower left panel--are projected to accelerate  this year to a 3 percent annual pace and to increase about 3-1/2 percent in 2002   Purchases by state and local governments--the dark bars--are expected to be  reasonably well maintained over the projection period  Many of these governments  are now experiencing some revenue shortfalls associated with the slowdown in  activity However, assuming that there is a pickup in spending and incomes next  year, overall fiscal positions remain strong enough to tide these governments over  during this period without a sharp curtailment of current spending plans   At this point, we no longer see further substantial fiscal stimulus as a major risk  to our projection The federal budget surplus is expected to be $185 billion in fiscal  year 2001 and $214 billion in fiscal 2002 But the on-budget portion has dwindled  to between $20 and $40 billion this year and next, and if you take out the Medicare  Hospital Insurance trust fund, the surplus available for spending or tax cuts is just  about gone   With that, I’ll turn the presentation over to David Wilcox    It's hard to know exactly how closely connected it is to the capital   overhang per se Obviously, what we are trying to communicate in that particular simulation is     6/26-27/01 67   that we do see some possibility of considerable tension in our outlook for profits, which is   weaker than market analysts are currently reporting  Now, that could be resolved in a number of   ways One, earnings could turn out to be weaker than the analysts think Maybe that is already   discounted in the markets, which is part of what you are asking  Two, investors in essence could   be more patient in this period of weak earnings if they really foresaw a snapback in activity, even   if it's going to be a bit delayed  Three, as in the simulation that we presented in the Greenbook,   there could be some considerable downside risk to stock prices going forward  Or four, as in the   simulation that we presented in the Bluebook, we could be wrong about productivity; maybe   developments on the productivity front will turn out to be better than we are currently   anticipating and we’ll get a bit better earnings growth than is envisioned in the Greenbook   forecast So, I think there is a wide range of possibilities here, but we do see some tension   currently in the financial settings relative to our economic forecast    I'm not sure exactly You're citing, I suppose, the monthly   Treasury statement figures  And if those figures are right, that’s exactly what our forecast would        6/26-27/01 68   be anticipating We have also heard from the Treasury that receipts are coming in weaker than   had been expected, and we’ve tried to factor that in  But there could be some downside risks   even to the receipts forecast going forward as well      Probably yes, though I'm not quite sure  To gauge the overall   effects on the economy one would want to look at the monthly flow of spending and receipts  So   I would be more comfortable looking at a more aggregated level  Another factor that is affecting   the pattern of these figures somewhat is a shifting of corporate tax receipts out of the end of this   fiscal year into next fiscal year That was a part of the budget deal in the tax cut proposal in order   to give some room to do a little more spending in fiscal 2002  The basic point we want to make   is that in recent Greenbooks we have been arguing that there were perhaps more upside risks on   the fiscal policy side than we had built into the forecast because we could see these unused, on-  budget surpluses out there And by our current estimates the tail of the distribution in terms of   risks for stimulative fiscal policy going forward has been considerably shortened    We don't yet because we have not yet extended our forecast out to   2003, but we will be doing that in the next few months    There is no doubt that many manufacturing firms also have been   under intense pressure from competition abroad, given the strength of the dollar  We saw that by   the declines in a variety of areas outside of the tech area as well  We do think that was also an   important element in promulgating this weakness    Yes, you can see it in the upper right panel of David’s chart  If   those estimates are to be believed, we have had a gap for a decade  We had growth of investment   over that period as well It's always tempting, when we're in a period of extremely slow growth   or even a downturn in activity, to wonder how we will ever get back to positive growth again  As   David mentioned we see policy, both monetary and fiscal, supporting that  We also see support   from just the simple inventory dynamics that we are going through right now where production is     6/26-27/01 73   well below sales and we have inventory liquidations  When that process ends, we do get a   pickup in employment and incomes and that begins to feed sales and sales expectations  So we   don't think it's unreasonable to expect that by the middle of next year we'll be returning to more   robust growth in investment spending But in keeping with Governor Ferguson’s edict, we would   readily admit that there is enormous uncertainty about that    In some sense, Governor Kelley, as we showed in the charts, we   do think that in the near-term fiscal policy is going to be providing a boost to an already weak   economy    As we move through the second half of the year, we are looking   for some impetus on the consumer spending side and through the eventual cessation of the   inventory correction  We think monetary policy will be providing some support as we go   through the year and into next year in helping to maintain the reasonably high level of auto sales   and housing starts we have had Also we expect monetary policy to be providing an environment   in which businesses can pump up their balance sheets and then be prepared to take advantage of     6/26-27/01 78   the opportunities on the investment side that we think are going to be there from the trend   productivity we’re projecting So when that underbrush gets cleared away, there will be an   environment in which both consumer spending and business investment are back, in terms of   providing important support to growth For the near term it’s consumption though; we don’t   really see much in capital spending until next year     Next year will be fairly balanced  We are still getting some   depressing effect on consumption from the wealth effect  It's not pushing growth further down,   but it is a factor keeping the growth of consumption running below the growth of income  But   yes, by the middle of next year we think growth will look more balanced than it does currently  "
6453,2001-10-02," Well, that fits in perfectly with my introductory remarks     If I were to scale the length of my remarks  this morning to be in proportion to my knowledge about the current  state of the economy, then I think it would be fair to say that I have  already spoken too long The terrible events of September 11 have  altered the political and economic landscape along so many dimensions  that interpreting the data and putting together this forecast presented us  with unusually daunting challenges In particular, we were required to  take strong stands on questions of psychology and politics-­ considerations that are always present in constructing the forecast, but  rarely with the prominence that they have achieved in the current  circumstances  For that reason, I thought I could be helpful by laying  out as clearly as possible how we handled some of these issues in  addition to describing how we have reacted to the broader  macroeconomic forces operating on the economy   Our efforts were organized around four principal questions  How  was information about economic developments prior to September 11  changing our view about the baseline forecast?  How large were the  economic disruptions directly associated with the attacks?  To what  extent and for how long would consumer and business confidence be  damaged in the aftermath of these events?  And, importantly, how were  changes in the stock market, interest rates, and fiscal policy shaping the  outlook for output and prices over the next two years?   With regard to the first question, the sharp drop in aggregate hours  worked in August and the ongoing steep declines in manufacturing  output suggested to us that real GDP was, at best, eking out a meager  gain in the third quarter prior to the attacks  Moreover, the composition  of activity was remarkably similar to that which we have observed since  the spring moderate advances in consumption and government spending  offset by continued declines in equipment outlays and a further runoff of  inventories Based on developments prior to September 11, I suspect  that we would have been coming back to the Committee this time with a  forecast of essentially no change in real GDP, on net, in the second half  of the year and a slow acceleration of activity next year   That assessment forms the backdrop against which we had to  evaluate the economic consequences of the terrorist attacks  In collecting  information about the disruption of production and sales that occurred  immediately following the attacks, we relied heavily on our business  contacts as well as the extraordinary efforts made by research  departments at the Reserve Banks to gather intelligence on activity in  their Districts Taken together, the evidence suggested that while the  disruptions were pervasive and profound for business in New York,  elsewhere the largest problems were concentrated in a few major sectors   Air travel was virtually shut down for several days, and many sporting     10/2/01 16   and entertainment events were cancelled or postponed  Auto production  was disrupted by parts supply problems associated with the interruption  of air cargo flights and by a backup of trucks on the Canadian and  Mexican borders Retailing also appears to have been seriously  disrupted, though it is important to bear in mind that much of any  shortfall in sales likely resulted in a buildup of retail inventories rather  than an immediate curtailment of production   Some of these effects likely were alleviated later in September,  and others could well be reversed in the next couple of months  Our  very rough stab at the magnitude of these effects suggests that direct  disruptions are likely to have reduced growth in third-quarter GDP by  about 1/2 percentage point at an annual rate, with those effects largely  expected to be reversed this quarter   As we enter the fourth quarter, the bigger question surrounds the  extent to which recent events will weigh on consumer and business  confidence Readings on auto sales provided by the vehicle makers,  news reports, and common sense suggest to us that consumers are likely  to pull back on spending With little to go on, we have assumed that  consumer sentiment will drop considerably below levels implied by  current macroeconomic circumstances--not quite so large over the next  year as occurred in the aftermath of the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, but  still a significant drop by historical standards  Last Friday’s report on  consumer confidence from the Michigan survey points to a decline in  sentiment in the final week of the month that is roughly consistent with  our expected pattern   We also examined how large shocks to sentiment play out over  time and how they are correlated with other components of spending,  and we adjusted our forecast accordingly  Going forward, we have the  effects of this shock reducing the growth of real GDP by about 1-1/4  percentage points at an annual rate in the fourth quarter and by about    3/4 percentage point, on average, in 2002  Because there simply has  been no other episode that closely matches the present one, it is very  difficult for us to gauge the reasonableness of our assumption  Given  that uncertainty, we considered a deeper shock to sentiment--one that  roughly equals in size that which occurred after the invasion of Kuwait   A shock of that magnitude produces something resembling a more  typical recession  But to be perfectly frank, there is no compelling  reason to think that the shock couldn’t be twice the size of the one  associated with the invasion of Kuwait, or for that matter, something  considerably smaller than we have assumed  Moreover, we can’t  predict how political, military, or terrorist actions could unfold in  coming months or their potential influence on confidence and economic  behavior Obviously, we had to make some big assumptions on skimpy     10/2/01 17   evidence, and those assumptions have had important implications for  the forecast   Not all of the developments that have occurred since the last  meeting are immune to more conventional economic analysis  With all  of the understandable focus on the recent tragic events, one could be  forgiven for overlooking some significant shifts that have occurred in  monetary and fiscal policy  In our forecast, the federal funds rate is 125  basis points lower over the next year than was incorporated in our  August projection Taken by itself, a change in short-term rates of that  dimension could be expected to generate considerable impetus to  aggregate demand down the road  But, of course, this change cannot be  taken by itself The sharp drop in the stock market and the widening of  risk spreads in the bond market to date have substantially blunted the  stimulus from lower short-term rates  Indeed, as you know from  reading the Bluebook, some estimates of the equilibrium funds rate  have fallen almost as much as the actual funds rate  We still view the  funds rate as having fallen below its equilibrium, and thus see the  current setting of policy as capable of restoring a period of above-trend  growth over time  But the near-term shock implies that the adjustment  will take longer and start with a greater shortfall of activity from  potential than we had previously projected   I should hasten to add that it is important not to view these  changes in financial developments in isolation  No doubt, some of the  firmness in long-term rates in recent weeks reflects an expectation of a  substantially more expansionary fiscal policy, which is poised to add  more impetus to activity over the next year than we projected in  August We have incorporated in this forecast about $52 billion of  policy initiatives for fiscal 2002 and $76 billion of initiatives in fiscal  2003, relative to a current services baseline  The figure for fiscal 2002  is roughly $30 billion more than in our August forecast  In addition to  the emergency supplemental and airline assistance packages already  passed by Congress, we have assumed nearly $20 billion more in  spending on education and FEMA, an extension of unemployment  insurance benefits that costs about $10 billion, and a fiscal stimulus  package that ramps up to about $22 billion by fiscal 2003  To put the  size of the total package in a cyclical context, the fiscal stimulus  delivered over the next eight quarters is only exceeded, and just a bit,  by the combination of tax cuts and increases in defense spending that  occurred early in the Reagan administration   Still, on our assumptions, the unified budget surplus is $70 billion  in fiscal 2002 and nearly $40 billion in fiscal 2003  With money left on  the table and an emerging bipartisan consensus for greater stimulus, we  believe that the balance of risks to our fiscal assumptions is on the     10/2/01 18   upside For that reason, we included in the Greenbook a simulation  having enough additional stimulus to virtually eliminate the unified  surplus over the next two years Such actions would likely produce a  faster turnaround in the growth of activity and trim the rise in the  unemployment rate; an adverse reaction of the bond market would  damp, but not eliminate, those effects   While we view fiscal policy as an upside risk to our forecast,  there also are some very prominent downside risks that are likely to be  especially acute in the next couple of quarters  An event such as  occurred on September 11 could act as a clear focal point that causes  already skittish consumers and businesses to pull back simultaneously  on spending plans Those actions and their feedback on the economy  would raise significantly the probability of a sharp reduction in  aggregate activity I would also note that even if we do not see  immediate signs that such a contraction is under way, that risk will not  have receded completely  Iraq invaded Kuwait in early August, but the  steep cutbacks in aggregate output did not really commence until  October   If I had to net the various risks to real activity in this forecast, I  would focus more on the downside risks in the near term and the upside  risks farther out The near-term forces of contraction could be  substantial, but so too could be the medium-term stimulus from  monetary and fiscal policy   Let me conclude with a few words about inflation  In an  environment of increasing slack in labor and product markets and  declining energy prices, we expect measures of both total and core  consumer price inflation to decline over the next two years  It might  appear surprising that the disinflation in this forecast is as modest as it  is, given the degree of slack expected to emerge in coming months  But  in our view, there are a few reasons for being cautious in marking down  the outlook for prices We have built in a sharp deceleration in wages;  our forecast of the increase in ECI wages drops from about 4 percent  this year to 2-3/4 percent in 2003 However, because there are few  signs of any slowing of health insurance costs, the deceleration in  overall benefit costs is likely to be noticeably less than that of wages   Although benefit costs may well be offset by reduced wage gains in the  long run, the frequency with which business people complain about  health insurance costs suggests that this shifting is not likely to be  immediate or painless   The effects of the slowing in compensation costs also show  through to a lesser extent on prices because of the slower pace of  structural productivity growth that we are expecting over the next        10/2/01 19   couple of years Moreover, with business margins having been eroded  in recent years, there is less scope for firms to absorb cost pressures in  margins  All in all, these considerations lead us to expect less  disinflation over the next two years than might be inferred from our  forecast of resource utilization alone   Karen Johnson will now continue our presentation    I hope I made clear that I didn’t think the probabilities of   our assumptions were significantly higher than the probabilities of a lot of others that   could be made  Obviously, we thought long and hard about exactly how much of a   sentiment effect to build in  I think the reason we ended up going with something less   than what occurred after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait was that that shock was also   accompanied by a very distinct economic shock through much, much higher oil prices    And if one thinks back to that time, there were certainly enormous fears about how long   and deep a military commitment we might be making in the Middle East  It’s easy in   retrospect to look back and recall that the military action went very well and was over so   quickly It’s a little hard to put oneself back in the perspective at the time, when the   initial thinking was that a lot of ground troops might be needed and that it might involve   a very bloody and protracted military effort before the United States could disengage  So   we decided not to put in as much sentiment effect at this point and to react to the   evidence as it flows in, making adjustments up or down to what we have built into the     10/2/01 23   forecast Obviously another characteristic that is different between this event and the   Iraqi invasion episode is that there was a very distinct end to the latter  And we had a   very sharp recovery in sentiment once it became quite clear in February that the military   engagement was going to be a relatively short and victorious effort  We have the shock   fading out more slowly this time  Even though it’s not as deep, it fades out more slowly   than what occurred after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait  The pattern we have in our   forecast is more typical of large negative shocks to sentiment  These shocks rarely have,   as the Kuwait period did, such a clear ending and such a sharp recovery  So, as I said   yesterday at the Board meeting, the forecast involves a very thin veneer of science   applied to a whole lot of judgment  All I can say is that you as policymakers and we as   forecasters are just going to have to roll with the information as it comes in and make   appropriate adjustments from there     Basically, if we were to increase the multifactor   productivity portion, which is the portion that would provide all the impetus that you   were talking about, we would get stronger growth in activity brought about probably by a   stronger stock market than we have in the baseline forecast  That stronger growth would   probably be accompanied by very little additional inflation  In essence we’d see an   unwinding or a backing off of exactly the kinds of revisions that we think have occurred   over the past year, as productivity came in weaker than we and others had anticipated, the   stock market weakened, and demand softened significantly  As I think you’ve noted on a   number of occasions, one sometimes needs to look through the snapshots of structural   productivity that we have in this forecast Indeed, even with this 1 percent growth in   multifactor productivity, we would expect, moving beyond this period of cyclical   weakness in investment spending, to see some reacceleration of underlying productivity    But that occurs beyond the horizon that we currently are forecasting  Of course, we’ve   made big mistakes in both directions in recent years, so it certainly could be the case that   things will turn out even better in the near term  Businesses may be moving more   aggressively on the cost-cutting side and may in essence get us back closer to the   production possibilities frontier than we have assumed here  And that would produce a     10/2/01 28   stronger economy  But because of less cost pressures, it probably would be accompanied   by less upward pressure on inflation as well    Yes, working it the way that we have told the story and the   way the model sees it, we would get stronger near-term demand effects than supply   effects and that would produce somewhat lower unemployment  "
6454,2001-10-02," It’s a little easier for me to answer this question because in   some sense I would look at the line on Chart 4 labeled “FRB/US model, based on   historical data and the staff forecast” as something that would approximate our best guess   as to what the equilibrium rate is  Therefore, I’d have to say monetary policy provides a   small to moderate amount of stimulus  I would hate to depress you further about this   analysis, however, by pointing out that each one of these estimates has a significant   confidence interval! The bottom edge of that shaded area is not the full confidence range   that one could have    I’m going to stop right there  "
6498,2001-11-06," Thank you, Mr Chairman  In my remarks at the last    meeting, I said that if we were pressed to net the various risks to our projection   of real activity, we saw greater downside risks in the near term and greater   upside risks further out The data we have received over the past month seem to   have supported that view We are now showing a much sharper contraction in   real GDP into early next year than was incorporated in our previous projection    But, by the spring, we anticipate a stronger recovery  Partly on the thought that   the more pronounced near-term weakness in the economy will spur additional   action by Congress, we have built a more stimulative fiscal policy into this   projection That added stimulus, along with stronger equity prices and a slightly   lower assumed federal funds rate, underlie the upward adjustment to our longer-  term forecast    So, how weak is the economy likely to be over the near term?  As we   noted in the Greenbook supplement on Friday, the October labor market report   led us to mark down further the projected contraction in real GDP in the current  quarter from about 2-1/2 percent at an annual rate to 3 percent  And with output   and incomes weaker now, there will likely be some spillover in the form of   further declines in demand early next year, leading us to revise down our first-  quarter drop in real GDP to about 1/2 percentage point     Even before receiving the October employment figures, we had been   impressed by the exceptional weakness of the manufacturing sector; sharp   inventory liquidations appear to be continuing this quarter, and the contraction in   capital spending is intensifying  Moreover, reports have suggested that the   service sector is softening noticeably    The concerns raised by those developments were certainly reinforced   by last Friday’s employment report  Private payroll employment dropped nearly   440,000 last month, aggregate production worker hours fell 07 percent, and the   unemployment rate rose 1/2 percentage point to 54 percent--all weaker readings   than we had expected To be sure, some of our miss on employment was in   industries that have been directly affected by the events of September 11--for   example, airlines, travel, and hospitality  We had cutbacks in these areas spread   out over the next few months, and we may have just gotten those cuts sooner   than we had anticipated But the declines were deep enough and widespread      11/6/01 10   enough to make us reluctant to offset any of that larger drop in coming months   The bottom line is that we see the labor market report as signaling a greater near- term contraction in activity   That certainly seems to be the case in the manufacturing sector, where  the sharp drop in factory hours and the reduction in temporary help jobs--many  of which are supplied to the goods-producing sector--indicate that the rate of  decline in industrial production is steepening this quarter  October IP could be  off around 1-1/2 percent for the month, setting up a possible double-digit annual  rate of decline for the fourth quarter   Those cutbacks in production are in large part a reflection of the  ongoing efforts of businesses to pare inventories  As a result of those actions, as  well as the surge in auto sales, we are projecting a substantial inventory  liquidation of $80 billion at an annual rate in the fourth quarter  Still, not much  progress has yet been evident in reducing inventory-sales ratios   The reason, of course, has been that final demand also has been  weakening, especially the demand for investment goods  The falloff in new  orders for capital equipment in September was stunning  As with all of the  statistical reports for September, there may be less signal than usual in these  data But it is difficult for us to see how these readings could be pointing to  anything other than a very steep drop in equipment spending in coming months   Indeed, the revision that we have made to investment spending accounts for a  large fraction of the downward adjustment to our current-quarter forecast   As you know, we incorporated a substantial hit to business and  consumer confidence in our September projection--a feature that we have  maintained in this forecast  Thus far, we feel quite comfortable with that  assumption for the business sector  The cutbacks in employment, production,  and capital spending have been swift and sizable  And our business contacts,  who have been gloomy most of the year, have turned decidedly more so this fall   However, I think it would be fair to say that there is still a large  question mark about our assumption of a considerable sustained deterioration of  consumer confidence  To begin with the obvious, at the same time that payrolls  were being slashed by more than at any time in the past twenty years, sales of  new motor vehicles soared to near-record levels  In our view, that surge has  been induced by temporary incentives, and a payback is in store late this year  and early next year--an outlook that largely appears to be shared by the  automakers  But these developments could give one pause about our story   Moreover, while we have seen significant deterioration in measures of  consumer sentiment, the declines have not been as large as we had been  expecting For now, we are sticking with our assumption that recent events have  shaken consumer confidence and that there will be an unusual degree of restraint     11/6/01 11   on household spending over the next few quarters  But that outcome is far from  a sure bet   We have now come to that familiar part of my presentation, where I  recite for you the catechism of recovery  It should sound familiar because  neither the questions nor the answers have changed all that much since last  March What ends this period of pronounced weakness and what will restore the  economy to a more vigorous growth track?  If it’s any comfort to you, I did have  our crack research staff examine the historical record, and they confirmed for me  that there have been no instances, at least in the United States, of recessions that  never ended [Laughter] So, I am reasonably confident that, with your  indulgence, if we stick with this story long enough, it should eventually come to  pass However, when is another matter  In our view, the basic elements appear  to be in place for an upturn in activity by the spring   The inventory liquidation will end, and even its abatement will  provide support to production and incomes; in our projection, the runoff  proceeds throughout much of next year, but it becomes a progressively smaller  drag on real output Much the same can be said for the capital spending  adjustment  We do not expect an upturn in spending before the second half of  2002, but the significant negatives from this sector diminish as businesses better  align actual and desired capital stocks and as sales prospects begin to improve   The risks to this aspect of our projection remain considerable  As we  noted in our report to the Committee in June, econometric models of investment  spending leave a great deal to be desired  Consequently, it is difficult to use  these equations with confidence to gauge where we are in the adjustment  process We do, however, have pretty good company here  The businesses that  purchase and produce capital goods have failed to foresee the extent of the  weakness in capital spending that has emerged this year  If excessive optimism  lifted capital spending above the fundamentals in recent years, it seems possible  for excessive pessimism to depress spending below the fundamentals for a time   We have built a bit of that effect into our forecast through an assumed weakening  of business confidence, but the retrenchment in spending could continue to be  more pronounced and more persistent than we have allowed for   While the risks remain large, our best guess is that the inventory and  investment adjustments will largely play out over the first half of next year, and  will do so in an environment that receives considerable support from  macroeconomic policies  By our estimates, the real federal funds rate is  noticeably below its equilibrium value, suggesting to us that monetary policy is  calibrated to produce above-trend growth once the transitory drags on spending  wane   Fiscal policy, too, is an important part of the story  We have  substantially increased the size of the fiscal stimulus package assumed in our     11/6/01 12   forecast, and that added stimulus shows through to the top line of our projection   Two salient questions are  Will it happen, and will it be as potent as we are  anticipating?  I recognize that reading the newspapers in recent weeks might  raise serious doubts about the likelihood of passing a sizable stimulus package,  and gridlock is certainly within the realm of possibility  But, we believe that,  with the full dimensions of the downturn becoming increasingly apparent, efforts  will resume to reach a compromise   The precise composition of any package is very uncertain, and we  make no claim of special insight into how the political process will unfold  We  took a stab by combining elements that have appeared palatable to both sides in  the debate We assume another round of tax rebates will be paid in the first  quarter to those that did not fully participate in the last round  We built in  additional spending for extended unemployment insurance and increased  subsidies for health insurance for the unemployed  We also are assuming  increased spending for infrastructure and security  Finally, we incorporated a  three-year temporary tax incentive for investment that allows an immediate 30  percent expensing of qualified equipment and software expenditures; this is the  provision incorporated in the House stimulus bill   All told, our revised fiscal package adds nearly a percentage point to  growth of real GDP in 2002 and about 1/2 percentage point to growth in 2003   Tax rebates are paid out early next year and are assumed to be largely spent in  the first half  By the middle of 2002, we expect the expensing provision to  provide an appreciable lift to equipment spending  As we noted in the  Greenbook, because the provision is temporary, we expect the effect on  investment outlays to be larger than if it were permanent  One reason is that the  budgetary cost is lower, and there should be less offset through higher interest  rates Moreover, the temporary nature of the incentive will cause businesses to  pull forward purchases that would have been made after the provision’s  expiration   We have heard the argument that investment incentives, such as the  one we have incorporated into the projection, will not be effective in a period  when the demand for capital goods has been so weak  Quite frankly, we do not  find this argument very convincing  To be sure, for some firms, tax incentives  will not forestall further cuts in their capital budgets  But even with the steep  declines that have occurred in capital spending over the past year, businesses  have still purchased nearly $1 trillion of equipment  So there must be many  firms that are on the margin for some categories of capital outlays and for which  the expensing provision will induce additional spending   There are, however, plenty of other good reasons for second-guessing  the staff forecast on this issue  In building the effect of the tax provision into our  forecast of E&S spending, we have assumed only a muted effect in the first half  of next year In our view, there will be only a small penalty to be paid for     11/6/01 13   waiting to take advantage of the provision until a bit more clarity develops in the  economic outlook  In our forecast, clearer signs of improvement should be  apparent by next spring, at which point we project the stimulus from the  expensing provision to mount This timing was largely a judgment call, and  either a quicker or a more delayed response seems possible   One small side effect of demand stimulus that occurs through an  investment incentive--such as is incorporated in this forecast--is that it raises  capital deepening and productivity growth for a time, with consequences for the  inflation outlook Along with a somewhat higher projected value of the dollar,  these positive supply influences offset a slightly lower path for the  unemployment rate, leaving measures of core price inflation on a modest but  more noticeable downtrend by 2003   In sum, the risks surrounding our economic forecast remain wide, but,  in our view, are two-sided Rising equity prices, a steep yield curve, and soaring  motor vehicle sales might be pointing to a fundamentally sounder economic  outlook than we presented in the Greenbook  On the other hand, last Friday’s  employment data capped a long string of very weak reports on the economy and  could be signaling that businesses are prepared to act aggressively to cut  production and shed workers In these circumstances, households will be  vulnerable to a bout of deepening pessimism and significant spending restraint in  coming months   On that cheery thought, I’ll turn you over to Karen Johnson    Certainly  In our baseline forecast, we have assumed a significant hit   to consumer confidence, one that is by our estimates sufficient to subtract roughly 3/4 of a   percentage point from real GDP growth in 2002  So in the baseline scenario we are already   expecting some additional weakness--an exogenous hit--beyond the weakening in consumer   confidence one would expect as the economy weakens  We have that also influencing business   spending in ways that we tried to calibrate, a spillover effect to other forms of spending as in other   periods when there have been outsized movements in consumer confidence     In our alternative simulations, version one removes that consumer confidence effect from   the forecast so that you can get a sense of what it implies  In essence the stronger growth in that   simulation is sufficient with unchanged policy to bring the unemployment rate back down to 5   percent or so by the end of the forecast horizon     The second version, which is the even more pessimistic version, assumes a further   percentage point rise in the personal saving rate--again, an exogenous further change--and again with   consequences and fallout for the rest of the economy  That produces a much weaker economy and a     11/6/01 17   much higher unemployment rate  In that scenario, with an unchanged policy the unemployment rate   moves up to 7-1/4 percent by the end of the forecast horizon   I think there are two important and related risks in this projection  One, in the baseline   projection, we have some weakness in consumer confidence but we don’t really have a complete   collapse in the consumer sector  And with some turnaround in activity by the middle of next year,   we get through this period of economic weakness without a really large decline in GDP  One of the   risks we’ve been highlighting for some time is that we’re not highly confident that consumers will be   able to withstand the kind of weakness we are currently projecting in the near term  That could   obviously lead to a bigger fall in confidence that will feed back on the economy with fallout that   extends into late 2002 and into 2003  As I noted in my remarks, certainly the data that we have   received since the last Greenbook haven't been especially weak for the consumer side  Yes, we did   see a very significant drop in retail sales in September and we expect some of that to be offset  But   even that drop in sales and the decline we’ve seen in consumer confidence have not been so large as   to make us think that we are already in the process of a confidence contraction  Whatever one   makes of 21 million units of motor vehicle sales--and as I said, we have pretty much written that off   as a signal of stronger consumer spending--it does at least pose in our minds some question about   whether we have that story right  I think we will begin to see in the next couple of months whether   our forecast is correct  A significant payback in the auto sector will confirm our view that there is   going to be weakness in consumer spending  But right now that’s still a forecast    That’s a very good point The answer is more stable  We have not   built in escalating terrorist activities in the United States that would either significantly affect     11/6/01 18   consumer confidence or add significantly further to business costs  I wouldn’t even know how to   begin to produce such a forecast  But certainly there are some significant risks  Just as anthrax has   been a concern in the past month, it could be smallpox the next month and something even worse the   following month I don’t think our forecast begins to capture the potential consequences of that for   consumer and business confidence  Nor does it capture the hit we might take to the productivity and   business cost structure      We certainly did look at it at a disaggregated level  Perhaps my   colleague, David Wilcox, can talk about the underlying theory of how we embedded this in the   forecast in terms of its potential implications for different kinds of capital spending, in particular on   shorter-lived versus longer-lived assets  Obviously this provision has a larger effect on the cost of   capital for longer-lived assets than for shorter-lived assets  If you consider, for example, the   computer area where prices are declining by 30 percent a year, the advantage of the expensing   provision may not be quite so significant in terms of moving up any spending  So, we have looked     11/6/01 19   at it by industry but we certainly haven’t gone through a very detailed disaggregated analysis  But   maybe David wants to talk a little about how we actually worked with the models that we used to   incorporate this effect    I should have been clearer about that  My remark in the briefing was   really referring to the revisions that we have made in the forecast, which involved a downward   revision in our price forecast at the same time that we’re showing a lower unemployment rate  A   piece of that story was the slightly faster capital deepening in 2003 that has been stimulated by the   faster investment in late 2002 and 2003  You’re absolutely right  As we noted in the Greenbook,   you could look at the very sharp deceleration that we are projecting in wage inflation and, if you   were so inclined, wonder why that is not showing through more forcefully into our price inflation   forecast The reason is that even with the improvement in structural productivity that we expect to   see by 2003, the gains are still well below where they had been earlier  And we see this on net as a   factor limiting the extent of the disinflation that we are likely to see over the next two years as   businesses respond to that and attempt to rebuild margins that have become compressed significantly   in the last year or so     I agree with that  We’re not showing very much disinflation in the   course of 2002 in part because of the unwinding of the positive productivity shock that we saw on   the other side    I’d note a couple of points  One is that our projected falloff in single   family starts is not dramatic; it’s certainly not dramatic if one thought we were witnessing a typical   recession    We believe our starts forecast is reasonably aligned with the decline   in permits that we saw and with what we think will be some depressing effect from the weakening in   income growth  And we built in some additional weakness because of the assumptions we’ve made   about consumer sentiment  So that is one of the places where the confidence effect shows up  We   also noted that homebuilders have reported a noticeable falloff in both traffic and home sales   recently  Again, none of this is suggestive of a major weakening in that sector; by my view what we   built in is actually fairly mild  Certainly the percentage change at an annual rate looks fairly large   because, as you noted, it is a relatively small sector  But that would be one of the upside risks that I   think we were talking about in terms of how things have held up in the household sector  I think one     11/6/01 22   would have to say that housing also is an area where we have not seen the extent of weakness one   might have anticipated  So that would be a part of the upside risk that we see associated with our   assumptions about extra weakness in the household sector coming from confidence effects    Well, there is a bit in the residential investment forecast because the   falloff in construction put in place has been greater for homes at the high end than at the low end  So   the cost per start has been falling as well and that certainly adds to that weakness        But we do still have a falloff in single-family home starts in the   quarter to 12 million units  That is a noticeable drop    We certainly could have and we debated that  In the end, as I noted,   more judgment than science was applied to how we spread it out I would sound one note of caution   about assuming that a provision like this won’t be important by the middle of next year  When the   economy starts to improve, there is a fair amount of tinder that can be accumulated in terms of   stimulus from both federal tax and spending provisions, from monetary policy, and so forth  While     11/6/01 23   we’re sitting here now in the midst of a significant contraction in output, it’s obviously difficult to   envision why businesses would be very excited about using an expensing provision  But coming on   the heels of a year-and-a-half of significant contraction in capital spending, there could be a rush to   take advantage of this incentive as sales prospects begin to improve  I wouldn’t rule out even an   upside risk to how we built this in; I think there are risks on both sides  Firms may wait until they   are absolutely certain that the economy is on a path of trend or above-trend growth before they are   induced by this provision to raise spending On the other hand, there could be some reasons as well   for them to want to take advantage of it early on, especially while prices in the capital goods markets   are on the low side I can’t say that we offer much science here and, as I indicated, this is an area   where we feel quite comfortable with your second-guessing us  But I think you could second-guess   us in either direction     Another risk, too, is that the provision could be smaller than now   anticipated This is not a very large temporary investment incentive  If the window were made   shorter, we might see a more immediate effect  Or if the amount that can be expensed were less--  along the lines of the 10 or 15 percent people have talked about as a compromise--the effects could   be even more muted than we have in this forecast  So there is a lot of uncertainty  In the end we felt   uncomfortable coming to you with a baseline projection that completely ignored what we thought   were cumulating signs of additional fiscal stimulus  We had a very modest amount of fiscal stimulus   in our last projection and our best guess of the mode is more along the lines of what we’re showing   now But as I indicated, it’s certainly possible that gridlock will reassert itself and nothing will   happen     11/6/01 24    All I know is what I read in the newspapers, and that has not been   terribly encouraging Yet this would be the time when we might in fact not expect to hear much   encouraging news, as parties on both sides position themselves for the hard negotiations that, at least   in our view, will probably need to take place in the next month or so    Yes, and I think even in October we reach the front edge of a pickup   in seasonal hiring Obviously that seems less likely and is part of the reason why we would expect   ongoing substantial weakness in the employment data     Yes We are expecting payroll employment to continue to contract at   more than 200,000 a month over the next few months and to contract rather sharply in the first   quarter of next year as well    Sure I’d say two things One, we do think that the longer-run budget   outlook and the accompanying fiscal policy that underlie that outlook have been factors influencing   long-term interest rates  When I look at that implied one-year forward rate, it currently is showing   those rates rising above levels that were prevailing in January--though you’re right, not by a huge   amount  However, the other news that we have received since January--this enormous contraction in   capital spending--would have been a factor working to depress the view about where equilibrium   real interest rates might be going in that period  So, in our view, we have seen some effect of the   fiscal policy on the structure of interest rates and that certainly is a factor in interpreting what has   happened It’s quite clear in our models--and we think there’s some reasonably sound economic   theory for this view--that equilibrium long-term real interest rates would be related to the long-run   thrust of fiscal policy So that’s our interpretation  "
6549,2001-12-11," Thank you, Mr Chairman  The data that we have   received over the past month presented the usual ups and downs for us to   contend with But before I discuss the details of our interpretation of that news,   I thought I would take this rare opportunity to make the case that, at least in   broad terms, events are unfolding just about as we had anticipated  In labor   markets, employment has been falling at a rapid clip in recent months, and the   unemployment rate is on a steep upward trajectory  As we had expected, the   manufacturing sector is bearing the brunt of these cutbacks in jobs, and factory   output has continued to drop  Overall activity appears likely to have contracted   at a moderate pace in the fourth quarter, led once again by a sizable liquidation   of inventories and ongoing declines in capital spending  These were all   important features of our November projection    In writing down our near-term forecast, we were influenced importantly by   readings on the labor market and by the available production indicators  For the   second consecutive meeting, we received a monthly labor report only two days   after we published the Greenbook  For having devised that meeting schedule,   Mr Kohn, your good Secretary, will not be receiving a holiday gift from the   Research Division this year! [Laughter]  To be sure, Don was, as usual,   attentive to the needs of the Committee by enabling your access to these   important data before the meeting  But the schedule also virtually ensures   maximum embarrassment to those of us on the forecasting staff      12/11/01 9    In the event, the surprises in last Friday’s report were less embarrassing  than those of a month ago  The unemployment rate rose to 57 percent last  month, a steeper rise than we had anticipated  And, after declining nearly  490,000 in October, private payrolls tumbled an additional 325,000 in  November  We had been expecting a drop of about 250,000 But the report  presented some positives for us as well  The workweek rose, and total  production worker hours did not drop as much as we had been looking for  All  in all, it was a weak report But it probably was not as weak as some of the  headline figures would suggest and, on balance, it was not materially different  from our expectations   The events of September 11 continued to cast a shadow on the labor  market  Job losses were once again sizable in the airline industry, and levels of  employment in areas such as hotels and amusement remained depressed  Not  surprisingly, the hiring of security guards has been brisk, but this provides only  a small counterweight to losses elsewhere  Health care is the only major sector  in which job growth appears to have been unaffected by the economic downturn  this fall   The most prominent feature of November’s labor market report was the  continued extraordinary weakness in manufacturing and related industries   Manufacturers shed more than 160,000 workers last month, while help-supply  jobs dropped nearly 90,000 and wholesale trade employment declined 25,000   Although the falloff in employment and hours might suggest another very large  drop in industrial production in November, we are expecting only a modest  decline--perhaps down about 1/4 percent for the month  The reason is that, in a  number of areas where hours declined significantly, we have more reliable  measures of physical product that show greater strength  Still, assuming  another moderate drop in December, IP will be off at nearly a 9 percent annual  rate in the fourth quarter, very close to the weak performance that we had  anticipated at the time of the last meeting   This concludes the self-congratulatory portion of my remarks, and I shall  now return to a more familiar motif characterized by a combination of  confessions and excuses There have been some developments in the incoming  data that have had important implications for our forecast going forward  While  production and labor market indicators have been coming in close to our  expectations over the past month, we have been consistently surprised by the  strength of the readings on final demand  Sales of new motor vehicles remained  much stronger in November than we had anticipated, even making allowance  for the extension of the recent incentive programs  Retail sales outside of autos  bounced back more sharply in October than expected, as did the consumption of  services New home construction and sales have also exhibited greater  resilience than we had expected  In the business sector, shipments of capital     12/11/01 10   goods moved up on balance in October, and the rebound in new orders was  even more pronounced   These readings have presented us with an especially challenging signal  extraction problem  In almost every case, the rebound in October followed a  sharp drop in the preceding month that was, at least in part, related to the events  of September 11  In most of these areas, we had anticipated some  improvement, but one that was stretched out over a few months  The October  increases might just indicate that we had the timing wrong  Alternatively, the  data could be signaling that underlying final demand is stronger than we had  been thinking True to form, our econometric and statistical filtering models  suggest that the best interpretation is probably a little of both--a quicker  snapback and stronger underlying demand  And, for the most part, that is how  we have constructed the near-term forecast; we have revised up the growth of  final sales in the current quarter, but not by the full extent of the October  surprise in the spending data   The incoming data have led us to alter one other important aspect of our  forecast We no longer expect an appreciable further hit to consumer  confidence stemming from the events of September 11  As I noted last month,  the extraordinary strength in car sales had given us pause about this element of  our projection, and that concern intensified over the past few weeks  Both the  continued firmness of the available measures of consumer confidence and the  actual strength we have observed in household spending led us to remove most  of the restraint we had imposed on our consumption forecast in anticipation of a  serious retrenchment in confidence   Taken together, these changes have led us to mark up our projection of  final sales to show a 2 percent annual rate of increase in the fourth quarter  rather than the 1-1/2 percent rate of decline that we had projected a month ago   Because we don’t see corresponding strength in production, we have revised up  our forecast for the growth of real GDP only a bit--from a drop of 24 percent in  the last Greenbook to a decline of 21 percent in our current forecast   Obviously, this forecast requires a much sharper liquidation of inventories to  reconcile the disparate revisions we have made to the near-term outlook for  spending and for production In the case of motor vehicles, we have some hard  evidence suggesting that this is, in fact, occurring  But outside of motor  vehicles, our projection of a $75 billion annual rate runoff of inventories in the  fourth quarter is still largely forecast, not fact   These revisions also have implications for the dynamics of the economy as  we move into next year  The combination of more upward momentum in final  sales and deeper inventory liquidation suggests the likelihood of greater impetus  to production in the coming months  That added impetus is obscured a bit in  our forecast because we pushed back by a couple of months the second round of  tax rebates assumed in our fiscal package  But we would characterize our     12/11/01 11    forecast as one in which the economy will be entering 2002 on a stronger note  than we thought likely a month ago   In that regard, there are some notable upside risks to this outlook  A  significant further positive surprise to sales could cause firms to revise up their  plans for production both quickly and sharply to meet higher sales and to  rebuild depleted buffer stocks Signs that materials prices could be firming-- such as have been apparent in commodity markets in recent weeks--would  provide further incentive for these actions  With the stance of monetary policy  remaining quite accommodative, faster sales growth might also lead firms to  retrieve capital spending plans that had earlier been shelved  Add in some  knock-on multiplier-accelerator effects, and the economy could pick up a  stronger head of steam next year than we have anticipated   Clearly, participants in financial markets appear to be expecting a more  ebullient outcome than is incorporated in the staff forecast  The increase in  rates implied by fed funds futures, the declining risk spreads, and the rise in the  stock market over the past few weeks suggest that a considerable shift in  sentiment about the economy has occurred over the past month or so  I’ll admit  that my jaw has dropped on a couple of occasions at the extent to which rates  have moved all along the yield curve in apparent response to data that we do not  see as having especially high information content  The non-manufacturing  Purchasing Managers’ report and the preliminary Michigan survey certainly  come to mind  But, I don’t think the signals from the financial markets should  be ignored entirely either   We made an attempt in the Greenbook to gauge how large a revision in the  economic outlook would have been required to generate the shift in the path of  the expected funds rate that we have observed between FOMC meetings   Needless to say, that exercise should be taken with an ample grain of salt  The  results suggest that financial market participants have likely revised up their  outlook significantly, but the size of that revision does not seem implausible   So why haven’t we shared fully the market’s enthusiasm for incoming  information about the economy?  I have already noted that we are a bit leery  about reading too much into what must be considered still very tentative  improvements in the spending data  Moreover, we still see considerable drags  on activity going forward  Even allowing for the recent improvement in the  stock market, the deterioration that has occurred in household net worth over  the past year and a half seems likely to restrain household spending and keep  the saving rate on an uptrend over the next year or so  In addition, our earnings  forecast does not provide much encouragement for further strong gains in the  stock market  And, while we can’t rule out a faster recovery in investment  spending, we are hearing few reports yet of a significant change in business  sentiment regarding capital spending  Finally, we do not expect the rest of the  world to provide much stimulus to activity in the United States     12/11/01 12    Indeed, we see a few conspicuous downside risks to our projection  The  stock market is one  The equity premium implicit in recent stock valuations has  again gotten mighty low  It is not difficult to imagine a disappointment similar  to that which occurred last summer if the recovery is weaker next year and  earnings fail to rebound with the vigor currently anticipated in the markets  We  remain worried about the possible fragility of consumer spending in coming  months With the labor market continuing to weaken, consumers may at some  point pull in spending plans more sharply than we have now allowed for   Perhaps we have thrown in the towel too soon on our story of deteriorating  consumer confidence  Moreover, if household spending were to sour  appreciably, it is hard to see how we would get the upturn we are projecting in  capital outlays next year   A final downside risk to the projection concerns our fiscal policy  assumptions  Aside from the earlier-noted modification to the timing of the tax  rebate, we have not changed our package for this forecast  But it is clear that  the probability of gridlock has risen significantly over the past month   Moreover, the possibility that a package will be enacted that is larger than the  one we have assumed also appears to have gone down  The risks to this portion  of our forecast would appear to be skewed to the downside   With respect to our inflation projection, we have made another small  downward adjustment to our forecast for core PCE prices  The indirect effects  of lower projected energy prices, continued favorable news on inflation  expectations, and a small upward revision to structural productivity led us to  mark down our forecast of core PCE inflation by 1/4 percentage point in both  2002 and 2003 We now expect core prices to decelerate from about a 1-1/2  percent pace this year to a bit above 1 percent in 2003   Dave Howard will now continue our presentation    That argument certainly makes sense  It is actually an issue that we   have struggled with and in some sense we revised up our forecast a bit in the face of both the response   to the strength in auto sales and what we can see happening with motor vehicle production going   forward In our view, however, that would not imply that there won’t be any adjustment on the   production side We think that may mute the production adjustment, and in our forecast we have   production falling in both the fourth quarter and the first quarter before leveling out in the second   quarter of next year In part we have followed what we are hearing from the automakers themselves,   which is that they are going to be extending downtime during the Christmas holiday period, and that   some of these production cuts are actually going to occur  But, when push comes to shove early next   year, it’s unclear whether or not they will decide to extend the incentives for an even greater period of   time  I think it is certainly a possibility and it’s an upside risk to the projection both of auto sales and   auto production that we’ve built into this forecast     12/11/01 15     I think that is exactly what is implicit in this forecast  As I believe we   noted at the time of the October meeting, we just didn’t know how to cope with such an event in the   forecast other than to make the assumption that it won’t occur or that if it does, it won’t have a big   effect But that clearly looms out there as an enormous uncertainty  We just didn’t see any way in   which we could sensibly provide any value added by trying to build in such an event into the forecast    Where I might differ with your presumption of how these developments   could unfold is with respect to long-term interest rates  We think a couple of things are going on   there One is that we would expect, if the Committee were not raising interest rates as much as the   markets currently expect--or as the markets began to realize that the outcome was not going to be as   strong as they currently anticipate--that there would be some subsidence in long-term interest rates    The way in which we thought about our policy assumptions was that, through 2003, we saw an   economy that was still running with a considerable degree of slack in resource utilization and one in   which inflation was still headed lower Therefore, the imperative to raise rates would not be so clear   that we were going to build it into our forecast by the second half of 2002  As you know, we do have   rates on an uptrend in 2003 as the economy gathers even more strength and as the unemployment rate   begins to turn down Even then, the environment is still one in which we would expect to see some   deceleration in overall measures of inflation     12/11/01 17     Yes, indeed But I don’t think the Blue Chip forecast or our forecast is   consistent with what is currently built into fed funds futures  In some sense the experiment that we   tried to construct in the Greenbook was to ask how much of an upward revision would the markets   have had to make in their outlook  Now, that wasn’t designed to tell you what the markets’ forecast is    I don’t really know for sure what it is But my guess is that it would have to be stronger than the one   we’re showing to justify the markets’ expectation of a more aggressive tightening action by the Fed as   early as they see it  So that would say that the consensus private forecast is probably closer to the   Greenbook than what appears to be embedded in financial markets now    I don’t think there are very significant longer-term costs in the package   we have designed We have designed a package that we thought was sensible--and we still do think   it’s quite sensible from an economic perspective  Whether it makes any sense politically is a different   matter  It was designed to provide stimulus for the economy over the next two years without imposing   long-term budgetary costs  Most of the items that we have built in--the temporary investment   incentive, which has a big effect, and the one-time sets of tax rebates--obviously would go away  So     12/11/01 18    we don’t really see those as necessarily having longer-term budgetary consequences  Now, one could   certainly imagine that something might be labeled a short-term stimulus for the economy that really   would impose longer-term budgetary costs  Obviously, any kind of permanent change in either   spending or taxes would feed forward and would produce bigger effects on long-term interest rates,   more crowding out of private investment, and therefore less capital deepening going forward  But   that’s not what’s in our forecast     Yes    The suboptimal part I’d say would be of a second order  Certainly in   the longer run, because that package goes away, the cost of capital is not affected  You’d still have the   same capital-output ratio over the longer haul and the same level of productivity at some point     Certainly to the extent that temporary tax policy is used to provide the   stimulus, private decisions are distorted in the short run, and we would have a suboptimal capital   stock But I think that would be a pretty small effect    Well, since the proposal of some kind of temporary tax incentive was   put forward, we’ve been working hard to develop the analytical apparatus  Obviously we have a     12/11/01 19    couple of problems in doing that  One is that there just aren’t enough observations in the data to   justify thinking that we’re going to be able to estimate this very precisely  So what we did was to use   several different analytical models, parameterized to replicate some of the key features of the   economy, and then we tried to examine how sensitive the outcomes that we get are to the assumptions   that we have made  What we put in the forecast I’d say would be consistent basically with both   “putty-putty” types of models of investment and the “putty-clay” models of investment  But there can   be big differences, depending upon the cost of capital adjustment  This relates to some of the issues   that we talked about in the productivity presentation at your meeting last June; some of those   parameters can make an important difference in the size of this effect  We don’t have any research   papers on this currently available but it’s something that we will have to continue to work on    With respect to the financial markets’ assumptions, to the extent that   some of the factors that Dino cited have been at work, one wouldn’t necessarily expect those to persist   over the next two years    And in some sense we have not level-adjusted our forecast for all of the   recent upward movement in long-term interest rates on the assumption that some of that will fade   away over the course of the first half of the year, as the situation becomes clear  So that volatility goes   down   On the stock market portion of it, I don’t want to pretend for a moment that our baseline   assumption was any better than the other two that we put into the Greenbook as alternatives  We   certainly have had five years of experience with forecasting either flat or declining stock markets only   to be consistently surprised to the upside Could that happen again?  Could that be the process that   we’re starting to see, or are equity market participants just looking beyond the near term?  Maybe they   are just better able to look through this near-term disappointment in profits that we see occurring and   are willing to anticipate a stronger rebound in both activity and earnings down the road  I think that’s   a real possibility  I also think, given how low the equity premiums have gotten, that there is still   downside risk in that portion of our forecast         12/11/01 21    With respect to inflation, we see the environment on the pricing side as one in which core   measures are more likely to be going down than up  We’re already seeing what we think is the front   edge of some deceleration in compensation  We think both structural and actual productivity are   likely to improve somewhat over the forecast period  We made a small nod in the direction of some of   the good news that we’ve received on inflation expectations  And the energy markets also suggest that   the indirect cost pressures coming from energy are likely to subside some  So when we put that   together, despite the fact that there is some reacceleration of activity, it looks to us as if there will still   be little upward pressure--and more likely downward pressure--on inflation going forward      Far enough that I don’t care to comment!  [Laughter] I don’t see any   immediate prospect     Well, we’d still think those longer-term rates would be strongly linked   to saving and investment flows in the economy  That would be important I will anxiously await     12/11/01 23    Dino’s further research on this correlation between the option-adjusted duration and the 10-year   Treasury I wouldn’t want to ignore an important piece of forecasting information here    Well, certainly, the point we were trying to make in our briefing was   that we also find this very interesting We pretty much wrote those data off when they dropped those   first two months, thinking that it was completely outside historical experience  We were inclined to   think it was a fluke The longer the decline persisted the more we felt that we needed to at least   consider the possibility that it was giving us some information about a drop in inflation expectations    Well, maybe Don will want to comment as well  But I certainly don’t   think that there has been a 2-1/2 percentage point rise in real short-term interest rates as perceived by   anyone involved in spending decisions at this point  However, the survey results might be, on the     12/11/01 24    margin, a reading that you would want to take on board in assessing the stance of policy--just a piece   of an inflation forecast that should not be completely ignored from the perspective of the current   setting of policy    It could be, except that in the same survey from which those inflation   expectations are drawn the unemployment expectations haven’t really deteriorated as much    They have deteriorated some but nowhere near as much as one might   have imagined if the outlook for inflation were the primary motivation  It could just be that people are   thinking that 2002 will be an excellent year in terms of low consumer prices  Obviously, people could   be hearing about zero percent financing for autos, great deals on airfares, and lots of discounts in the   stores I think it’s perhaps more a reflection of that than of some enormous shift in their views about   the economy going forward, which have been relatively firm    "
6550,2001-12-11," This experiment requires in essence the specification of the   policymaker’s preference function  If you’re telling us that you really don’t care about fluctuations in   interest rates, then this isn’t the optimal or perfect foresight policy for you  The reason that in some   sense the constraint is in there for this particular exercise is that one could infer from the data and your   past behavior some preference for limiting movements in interest rates  And this is a policy that is   predicated upon not just a constraint on movements in interest rates but also on some notion of what   your distaste is for output and inflation gaps  "
6610,2002-01-29," I would recommend, Mr Chairman, that Marvin complete his   presentation and then we can address questions  "
6611,2002-01-29," I agree with Larry We did not hear any reports of actual   anticipatory ordering on the basis of the possible enactment of that expensing provision  So   while that’s certainly a possibility, as you note, I don’t think I would give much weight to that as   being a factor    With the Chairman’s permission?    I’d say a couple of things about this morning’s GDP release  First of   all, in broad terms the story is very similar to the one that we had in the Greenbook, which was   that there was very strong growth in final sales in the fourth quarter and that was substantially   met by a very significant liquidation of inventories  So in that sense, I see nothing either in the   top line or in the composition that suggests any major discrepancies     Now, splitting the hairs, the GDP figure was stronger than we had projected  As David   and Larry indicated yesterday, we already had moved our forecast up close to zero on the basis   of the shipments and orders figures that we’d seen, so part of that we had already incorporated    But final sales in the GDP release were just a bit weaker than what we had projected, and the   inventory drawdown was not quite so large as we had forecasted  That by itself might imply less   upward momentum in the first quarter  But as David and Larry noted yesterday, the orders   figures that we got for December were strong enough to make us think that we’d probably be   revising up our investment forecast in the first quarter, so I’d say on net this does very little to   change our outlook              January 29-30, 2002 Page 64 of 194  One other interesting piece of information in this release is that the implications of these   data for fourth-quarter productivity are that nonfarm business output per hour probably rose   31 percent  We had already incorporated a strong productivity figure in the forecast, but that’s   even stronger than our projection  So that piece of the forecast, too, certainly looks firmly in   place, and if anything—if this number holds up in subsequent revisions—is even better than we   had been expecting     Yes, that’s right    Indeed And I would say that at least a part of the discrepancy on the   inventory side is attributable to a different assumption for December; we had somewhat more   runoff built into our forecast than BEA has  There are not just missing data but, of course,   revisions to earlier figures as well  The retail sales number stands out as an important one that is   subject to substantial revision and that could have an effect on these figures    As you know, through the fall we highlighted the consumer sector as   an area where we thought there were some potential risks, especially as the unemployment rate   rose sharply and the labor market deteriorated  At least according to this preliminary estimate, it   looks as if consumer spending rose 54 percent at a time when the economy lost nearly a million   nonfarm payroll jobs  Consumer sentiment has remained firmer than we had been anticipating   earlier Auto sales—where again we had at first discounted very heavily the increase in motor   vehicle sales, figuring the payback would be both prompt and significant—have remained much   more resilient than we had anticipated  So I see the near-term downside risks, while still very   large, as having diminished somewhat  But over the forecast period we do see consumers having   to swim upstream in some sense against the deterioration in their overall net worth and balance   sheet positions, which leads us to think that there should be some underlying uptrend in the   saving rate Something could happen to trigger a more rapid upward adjustment in the saving   rate; I don’t know what that would be, but it certainly looms out there as some risk     The other risk outside the consumer sector—and one we have tried to highlight in a   number of alternative simulations and some of our briefings, including David’s yesterday—is   that our profits outlook is definitely weaker than what equity analysts are currently expecting    That’s true, even making some adjustment for the normal bias that they have in their forecasts         January 29-30, 2002 Page 66 of 194  Our view is that the stock market will remain rather flat through the first half of this year and   only then begin to trend up So there is still some tension, if you will, in our forecast between   relatively meager profits performance and what the markets currently seem to be anticipating    That would be another downside risk associated with the forecast, if earnings disappointments   were to show through more significantly into lower share prices going forward  Now, that is   balanced off by the fact that a number of small errors in our projection could make the profits   outlook considerably better  If we got just a little more deceleration in compensation per hour, a   little better productivity performance as we have been seeing in recent quarters, and a little   firmer prices—maybe a little less disinflation than we are forecasting—profits could be higher    And that could go a long way toward resolving what appears to be a tension in the current   forecast   On the upside, an issue that President Poole mentioned yesterday is that we at least have   to be aware of the fact that we could see a sharper snapback on the inventory investment side    This liquidation was enormous in the fourth quarter and in our view firms still want to bring   down inventory-sales ratios So the environment will be one in which, if we’re right about   relatively sluggish growth in final sales going forward, there isn’t any pressing imperative to   restock quickly or to end that liquidation rapidly  But just as we see inventories pile up in ways   that we can’t anticipate, one could imagine getting a sharper impetus from the end of the   inventory liquidation and that could feed on itself and provide considerable upward momentum   to output going forward So the risks to the forecast seem to me reasonably balanced  But I   think we’re still confronting a fair amount of uncertainty on both sides of that projection    I don’t know the answer to that but let me see if I can look it up   quickly It was 08 percent on the total price index, and the core was 28 percent    The core was 28, but that was again, as the Chairman is indicating, a   reversal of an insurance effect, which had held down prices significantly in the third quarter    "
6671,2002-03-19," Thank you I noted with some considerable relief the   Chairman’s remarks at Larry Meyer’s going-away dinner in January in which he   equated the making of mistakes with the learning experience  While I don’t think I   would classify the revisions we have made to our forecast as correcting mistakes, I   can safely report to the Committee that the staff did have several major learning   experiences over the intermeeting period  I thought that perhaps I could review this                    March 19, 2002 Page 26 of 117  morning what it is we think we learned and the implications of those lessons for our  forecast going forward   Lesson 1 Ask the right question  You may recall that in December, in defense of  our forecast of an upturn in activity this spring, I reported asking the research staff  whether there had been any instances of recessions that had failed to end  I now  realize that I should have asked the admittedly somewhat more metaphysical  question  Are there any examples of recessions that failed to begin?  [Laughter] In  understanding how things have turned out so much better than our earlier  expectations, there is an important question about what kind of cycle we have  experienced  One reasonably reliable characteristic of business cycle downturns is  that many things tend to go bad simultaneously  In the context of our models, this  shows through as a correlation in the errors across spending equations during periods  of recession—many categories of spending fall short of the fundamentals for a time   It is precisely this synchronicity of errors that leads to the nonlinearities we associate  with recessions As you know, we had built that feature into our forecast—to a small  degree through much of last year and in a more significant manner last fall  In the  event, those correlations have largely been absent   To be sure, the pronounced downturn in spending and profits in the business  sector led to weaker growth of employment and income  Spending in the household  sector slowed in response to these developments but no more than would have been  suggested by the fundamentals  If anything, there appear to have been small positive  surprises in our consumption equations over the past few months  Purchases of light  motor vehicles remain at elevated levels, even though they have retraced some of the  extraordinary spike seen last year  And real PCE outside of motor vehicles advanced  at a 2¼ percent annual rate in the fourth quarter, when unemployment was rising  sharply, and appears poised to increase at a pace of nearly 5½ percent this quarter   Similarly, housing construction only edged down last fall and has moved up smartly  early this year, only in part because of favorable weather  This surprising strength in  the household sector has combined with an earlier end to declining equipment  investment and a tapering-off of inventory liquidation to produce a greater pickup in  activity than we had earlier anticipated  We have revised up our forecast for the  growth of real output in the first half of this year from a 2 percent pace in our January  forecast to a rate of more than 3½ percent in the current projection   Lesson 2 When it comes to forecasting productivity, use your imagination not  your models  Starting late last year and into early this year, we were almost  continually surprised by the strength in domestic spending  But given the  extraordinary weakness in employment and hours worked, we significantly tempered  the effect of those stronger spending data on our forecast of GDP  With readings on  inventories and international trade yet to come, we thought strong domestic demand  was probably being supplied out of inventories or from rising imports, rather than  from increased domestic production  In fact, we viewed our January forecast of  2¾ percent at an annual rate for the growth in output per hour in the fourth quarter to  be a bold one for a period of purported recession  Obviously, we showed a                 March 19, 2002 Page 27 of 117  significant lack of imagination  Productivity is now estimated to have risen at an  annual rate of about 5¼ percent in the final quarter of 2001  And with the latest  available data evidencing a similar pattern of strong expenditures and weak hours, our  current-quarter projection of growth in real GDP of about 4 percent implies a still  stronger increase in productivity of about 5¾ percent   So what do we make of these readings on productivity?  No doubt, there is a  significant amount of statistical noise, as there always is, and thus ample reason to  discount these figures However, there also may be some economic reasons why  productivity has turned in such a strong performance of late  For one, we weren’t the  only ones surprised by the strength of final demand over the past four months   Businesses responded swiftly and aggressively to the events of September 11 by  cutting payrolls on the expectation that a slump in demand would soon follow  But,  with a few exceptions, a sharp pullback in spending never materialized  In order to  meet better-than-expected demand, firms appear simply to have squeezed more out of  their existing workforces Caution on the part of businesses still appears to be in  evidence The pace of hiring has remained subdued, and many business people  continue to express concern about the outlook  If our interpretation is correct, firms  should begin to hire more vigorously as they gain confidence in the staying power  and strength of the expansion We think that process will be gradual, but in the  months ahead we expect businesses to increase hours worked more rapidly by  lengthening workweeks and adding workers  As hiring catches up over the next  couple of quarters to the improvement in production, growth in labor productivity is  projected to drop back noticeably   We also believe, however, that there has been some signal about underlying  productivity in the recent data  We boosted our estimate of the growth of structural  labor productivity 01 percentage point this year and 03 percentage point next year  reflecting both these recent readings and the improved outlook for capital spending   Given the enormous increases we have seen, there is certainly some risk that we have  underreacted to the news about productivity, much as we did during the second half  of the 1990s As we illustrated in a Greenbook simulation, if productivity were to  turn out stronger than in our forecast, growth of real GDP would be higher as would  corporate profits, and inflation would come in lower  Faster productivity growth  probably helps to explain some of the strength in demand over the past year; the  fundamentals were better than we had recognized  Going forward, more-rapid  growth of productivity provides a lift to expected income gains, with consequences  for current spending, especially on durable goods and housing  Thus, these favorable  supply-side developments provided another reason for revising up our forecast this  round   Lesson 3 With regard to fiscal policy, quit while you’re ahead Over the past  thirty years, economists have typically cautioned against the use of activist fiscal  policy as a countercyclical tool The principal shortcoming cited is that it often  comes too late and ends up being procyclical rather than countercyclical  The tax  cuts enacted last year, however, provided a nice counter-example  We believe the                       March 19, 2002 Page 28 of 117  boost to disposable incomes from the rebates and the cuts in marginal tax rates  provided important support to household spending in the second half of the year   Moreover, we expected already enacted legislation—both the second installment of  tax reductions and a further step-up in spending—to provide another boost to activity  this year   As you no doubt recall, we had built a fiscal stimulus package into our forecast  last fall when employment was collapsing and unemployment was rising steeply   Two key features of that package were extended unemployment insurance benefits  and a partial-expensing provision for investment  We then significantly scaled back  that package in January, most notably removing the investment incentive, when the  economy was showing more convincing signs of a rebound and political gridlock  appeared to set in Well, as our luck would have it, the recently enacted stimulus  package was very similar to that which we had incorporated in our forecast last fall   Given the uncertainty that still surrounds the durability and strength of the upturn,  reasonable people could come to different conclusions about the advisability of  enacting a stimulus package at this point  But viewed from the perspective of our  baseline forecast, this package provides a modest positive shove to an economy that  would otherwise already have been growing somewhat above trend   Lesson 4 Monetary policy still works with long and variable lags  As you know,  we have argued quite strongly over the past year that monetary policy has been and  will be effective  By our assessment, easier monetary policy was leaning against  substantial drags from the collapse of investment, the weaker stock market, and the  stronger dollar With real interest rates well below estimated equilibrium rates, we  thought monetary policy was positioned to encourage a rebound in activity  That now  appears to have occurred sooner and with greater vigor than we had projected  As a  consequence, we are assuming a steeper upward trajectory for the federal funds rate  in this projection than in our previous one  We have penciled in an increase in the  funds rate to 4 percent by the end of 2003—100 basis points above our January  forecast This upward adjustment reflects two factors  First, stronger underlying  demand and faster growth of structural productivity have boosted our estimate of the  equilibrium real rate  Second, with a smaller output gap and a higher path for  inflation, the cyclical component of monetary policy does not need to be as  accommodative as in our previous forecast  Under our baseline, some additional  tightening would probably be required in 2004 to prevent the economy from  overshooting   Lesson 5 As the education experts often remind us, learning is a lifetime process  There is little reason to expect that our learning experiences are behind us  As a  consequence, it is probably useful to consider where we could be going wrong  We  see significant risks on both sides of this projection  One immediate upside risk  concerns the behavior of inventories  We have only one month of inventory data for  the first quarter, and the figures for that month were stronger than we expected  Even  after this morning’s trade data, which Karen will be discussing shortly, we’ll need to  see much greater liquidation outside the auto sector in coming months to get our                   March 19, 2002 Page 29 of 117  forecast of 4 percent GDP growth  The recent upturn in commodity prices could be a  reflection of a drop-off in the pace of liquidation or even some re-stocking  That  firmness in prices, by lowering the carrying cost of inventories, could also provide  some incentive for a more rapid turnaround in the inventory cycle  This would, in  turn, provide greater upward impetus to activity, with knock-on effects on production,  sales, and spending that could give the economy an even greater head of steam, at  least for a time    There are some clear downside risks as well  We have made a large change to  our projection on the basis of just seven weeks of data  And business attitudes don’t  seem to have improved as much as the economic statistics  Business people  apparently don’t see the substantial turnaround in corporate profits expected by equity  analysts  Even assuming that those rosier profits come to pass, equity valuations still  look rich by any historical standard other than that of recent years  The upturn in  capital spending isn’t a sure thing yet either  The improvement in computer outlays  looks to be on reasonably firm ground at this point, but spending for some other types  of capital equipment is just now bottoming out and, in a few cases, outlays are still  heading lower  Finally, if the recent strength in productivity is all noise and no  signal, we have marked up our GDP forecast too much  All in all, the uncertainties in  the outlook remain very large  But they now appear to be centered on outcomes that,  for the most part, are much better than we could have hoped for not all that long ago   Karen    We don’t, Mr Chairman  You’re right that one natural place to look   because we actually get timely information on industry data would be in industrial production    But since a significant chunk of that index takes labor input and makes an assumption about   labor productivity, that wouldn’t be a very fruitful way of going about answering your question    For the rest of the economy, we get annual information in the gross product originating data—   which would allow us to look at that—only with a considerable lag  Now, one thing we have   noticed over the last six months or so is that productivity in areas where we have physical   product data has been a little better than we initially estimated based on assumed labor   productivity So there’s a little evidence  We do not get those data with high frequency, and   they don’t explain the fourth and first quarters  But I think they perhaps suggest that something   has been going on over the last year that has been better than we expected    I think it would be too early to say because so far the initial claims   have been running more in the 385,000 area than the 400,000 area    I think the mid to high 380s was where our seasonals were   suggesting that claims were lined up reasonably well with the payroll employment growth  For   our forecast of payroll employment, which shows a gradual acceleration to about 200,000 a              March 19, 2002 Page 33 of 117  month by midyear, we have a decline in initial claims to around 350,000 within the next few   months    We have a positive 3 for total IP  For manufacturing it’s 1, and that   is being held down by a falloff in assemblies    Actually, this is an issue that Vincent will be covering shortly in his   remarks  But looking out beyond the Greenbook forecast interval—again, I caution you to take   these figures with an enormous grain of salt and maybe an entire salt mine—we would expect   close to another 100 basis points of tightening to be necessary in 2004  Combined with the   tightening we’re now assuming in 2003, that additional tightening in 2004 brings growth roughly   in line with potential, stabilizes the unemployment rate at just a little above 5 percent, and holds   the core PCE inflation rate at roughly 1½ percent  So the design of this forecast was that it was   possible for you to achieve that particular equilibrium going out beyond the Greenbook forecast   period with the amount of tightening we built in here  Obviously, there are associated strategic   questions about tightening earlier versus later, and Vincent will be talking about some of those   issues in his presentation    Well, so far—really up until the current quarter—our consumption   functions that include both disposable income and wealth in them were tracking reasonably well    One of the points I was making in my remarks was that we actually have been assuming that   there would be some shortfall in consumption behavior relative to those fundamentals, given the   sharp rise in unemployment and the deterioration we saw at least for a time last fall in consumer   sentiment  That had been a reasonably reliable feature of past business cycle downturns  Again,   up through the fourth quarter of last year, it looked as if consumption was moving along   reasonably close to what the fundamentals would suggest  It will be more difficult for us to tell   that story if consumer spending continues to increase at the pace that is apparent thus far in the   first quarter It seems to be moving above what the fundamentals would suggest  Now, that   could mean that we’re wrong about the fundamentals  That’s certainly a possibility  Either the   productivity growth could be stronger, or the overall underlying aggregate demand in the   economy could be stronger than we think  And that may be what that consumption behavior is   reflecting But it’s also possible that we’re going to get a bit of a payback for some of this   current strength going forward  In essence, we’ve assumed that in this forecast  We think   consumption is getting a little ahead of the fundamentals in the first quarter, and we expect a bit     March 19, 2002 Page 37 of 117  of retrenchment, which allows some upward movement in the saving rate from its current level   to about 2½ percent over the course of our projection     Personally, I think the risks in our consumption forecast are now fairly evenly balanced    I could see how it could continue to come in stronger than we’re forecasting, but I’m still a little   nervous that some of the strength in consumption that we’ve seen has been temporary  It may   reflect some relief that this recession isn’t going to intensify and people are doing a little more   spending Or the substantial price discounting that we’ve seen may have encouraged spending   that is not likely to persist So I could see some downside risk as well      "
6672,2002-03-19," May I make just one follow-up comment on that?  It’s important to   remember, though, that you don’t get to choose what the NAIRU is  [Laughter]    We don’t know what it is, but we don’t get to choose it either    However, by virtue of the fact that we have to write down a forecast, in some sense a NAIRU is   embedded in there  But ultimately, as Vince’s middle panel of exhibit 3 shows, to stabilize   inflation you’re going to be driven back to whatever is the equilibrium unemployment rate  "
6715,2002-05-07," Thank you, Mr Chairman  If you’ve been reading the  business press, watching television, or perusing market newsletters over the past  seven weeks, you probably have been subjected to a fairly steady stream of downbeat  news Capital goods orders moved lower, sales of new and existing homes declined,  and consumer confidence dipped again  Even positive developments seemed to be  viewed as containing seeds of doubt about the strength and durability of the economic  expansion It was widely noted that, while real GDP advanced at a 5¾ percent annual  rate in the first quarter, more than 3 percentage points of the increase reflected less  rapid liquidation of inventories  Corporate earnings roughly met expectations, but the  guidance about profits for the remainder of the year was seen as disappointing  In  reaction, the broader stock market was off 8 percent over the intermeeting period, and  the tech-heavy Nasdaq dropped an even larger 16 percent   You could be forgiven then if, upon opening the May Greenbook, you suffered  some cognitive dissonance The staff projection for real GDP this year is about  unchanged, and our forecast for next year was strengthened a bit  Moreover, the  projected growth of final sales was raised both this year and next  We boosted again  the growth of labor productivity and lowered our forecast for inflation  More growth  and less inflation would look like a pretty favorable combination from the perspective  of the central bank So how do we reconcile the market’s apparent reaction to the  incoming information and ours?   In brief, we believe that there has been a considerable convergence in economic  outlooks, with, at least in this case, the markets having moved a long way toward our  view about the near-term economy  At the time of the March meeting, markets  apparently read economic developments as likely to require a much more substantial  tightening of monetary policy than we had assumed  The recent news has led them to  remove a substantial fraction of that tightening  And, while fed funds futures  continue to price in more tightening than we have assumed, the gap between us has  narrowed considerably over the past seven weeks                     May 7, 2002 10 of 81  Lest you interpret these remarks as signaling some new-found confidence on our  part that events are unfolding exactly as expected, I should quickly turn to the  5¾ percent annual rate increase in real GDP now estimated for the first quarter  That  figure is about 2 percentage points stronger than we had anticipated in March, with  most of the surprise accounted for by the more rapid tapering off of inventory  liquidation that I mentioned earlier  In broad terms, the recent readings on industrial  production support the view that the inventory correction under way for more than a  year is winding down Last week’s labor market report and available physical  product data point to an increase in IP of about ¼ percentage point in April  After a  year and a half of nearly steady decline, output has increased every month this year,  and readings on new orders from purchasing managers and reports from our business  contacts all seem consistent with a recovery of modest dimensions in the  manufacturing sector  But our upward surprise on first-quarter GDP was not limited  to inventory investment; final demand increased 2½ percent at an annual rate, about  ½ percentage point faster than we had anticipated  Stronger growth of consumer  outlays and residential construction more than offset somewhat weaker business  investment     Despite these generally positive developments, we believe there are reasons for  anticipating a sharp slowing in real GDP growth in the current quarter  With firms  having apparently moved production into closer alignment with sales already, we see  less upward impetus to activity from inventory investment going forward  Moreover,  some of the strength we have seen in final sales most likely was borrowed from the  future Warm and dry weather allowed some homebuilding to be shifted into the  winter, and we expect housing starts to slip somewhat during the spring  A similar  weather-related shift probably occurred in state and local construction  Lastly,  defense spending was ramped up sharply in the first quarter—about 20 percent at an  annual rate—and while we don’t expect that to be reversed, we are not looking for  such large increases to be repeated  All told, we expect growth of real GDP to drop  back to a 2 percent annual pace in the current quarter   Perhaps the biggest news for our forecast was not the spending data themselves  but their implications for the recent performance of productivity  My one small  consolation for the errors that we have made of late is that, if we had come to you last  fall with a forecast that labor productivity would increase at annual rates of  5½ percent and 8½ percent, respectively, in the fourth and first quarters, you likely  would not have allowed me and my colleagues to keep our jobs long enough to see  these recent figures  Of course, now that these increases have come to pass, I  recognize that our job security may rest on an ability to explain them  [Laughter] To  give you a hint about my view of our success in this endeavor, I can report that  neither I nor my colleagues have undertaken any substantial financial commitments in  recent months!     Let me frame the discussion by considering two possible alternatives  One  explanation for the jump in productivity is that surprise at the strength of demand and  lingering caution concerning the durability of the expansion have led businesses to be                     May 7, 2002 11 of 81  reluctant to boost payrolls As a consequence, they have responded to the recent  strength in demand by squeezing more out of their existing workforces—temporarily  boosting productivity well above its sustainable level  According to this story, there  are limits to how long firms can sustain these demands on their existing workforces  without suffering a deterioration in morale, a reduction in the quality of output, or  slippage in normal maintenance activities  At some point, firms will need to add to  payrolls An alternative hypothesis is that all of the recent surge represents an  improvement in structural productivity, if not in growth rate terms at least in level  terms  Perhaps even if firms were at first surprised by the strength of demand, they  now may have found that they can do more with less, without experiencing some of  the drawbacks I just mentioned  Accordingly, there will be no necessary catch-up of  hiring down the road   Unfortunately, the available evidence simply isn’t clear on these hypotheses  On  the first proposition, a survey conducted by the National Association of Business  Economists reports that businesses were indeed surprised by the recent strength of  demand and they responded by extracting more productivity from their existing  workforces rather than raising employment  However, the results of a similar  quizzing of Beige Book contacts can be read as considerably more ambiguous on this  proposition, and neither of these reports sheds much light on the sustainability of the  recent gains in productivity  With respect to the second hypothesis, while a statistical  examination of the recent behavior of productivity finds evidence in favor of an  improvement in structural productivity, it views the probability as exceedingly low  that all of the increase in actual productivity in the past two quarters has been  structural Indeed, such a two-quarter increase in structural productivity would be  unprecedented according to the model   As you know from reading the Greenbook, we once again took the middle  ground We have interpreted the surprising performance as signaling that growth in  structural labor productivity has been and will be stronger than we had assumed  earlier But we did not revise up our estimates to the full extent suggested by a  mechanical read of our statistical models, in large measure because we think the  recent readings on productivity need to be viewed with some caution until they have  been through an annual revision or two As a consequence, even with the upward  revisions that we have made, actual labor productivity is estimated to have risen  above its structural level, implying that, if our output forecast is correct, businesses  will need to do some hiring in the period ahead   Last Friday’s employment report for April provides tentative evidence that an  improvement in labor market conditions has been under way  Private payrolls  increased 41,000 in April, and declines in the preceding months were much smaller  than occurred last fall In addition, more industries added workers than cut them last  month for the first time in over a year  Help-supply employment rose sharply for a  second month, and job losses in manufacturing have tapered off considerably  Still,  despite those favorable developments, aggregate hours worked came in a bit below  our expectations Because we would be inclined at this point to hold to our 2 percent                        May 7, 2002 12 of 81  GDP forecast for the current quarter, those weaker hours will show through yet again  to faster productivity growth Our updated estimate calls for an increase of about  1½ percent at an annual rate—about 1 percentage point more than in the Greenbook   Looking ahead, our forecast of the growth in real GDP for the second half of the  year is about unchanged at 3½ percent, and we have raised projected growth to  4¼ percent in 2003—¼ percentage point more than in our previous forecast  Taken  alone, the revisions that we made to structural productivity suggested an even larger  upward adjustment to real GDP  But there were some important offsets  A lower  trajectory for the stock market—about 8 percent across the board —implies greater  saving and less consumption, all else being equal  In addition, we have read the  incoming data and industry reports as suggesting that the recovery in capital spending  for high-tech equipment will take slightly longer to develop than we had earlier  anticipated And higher vacancy rates and softer rents imply that nonresidential  building faces an even greater retrenchment this year   With the upward revisions we have made to the supply side of our forecast  exceeding those made to the demand side, we estimate that the economy has had and  will have a larger margin of excess capacity than previously projected  As a  consequence, we have revised down a bit our forecast for inflation over the next year  and a half Core PCE prices are expected to increase 1¼ percent both this year and  next Virtually all of the major measures of total and core inflation have moved lower  over the past year And with structural productivity improving and hourly labor  compensation decelerating, we see few signs of any notable inflation pressures  developing during the forecast period   Lower inflation and a larger output gap in this forecast led us to push off and  nudge down our path for the federal funds rate  But our basic story hasn’t changed  much With real rates set at very accommodative levels and with another dose of  fiscal stimulus being applied to the economy this year, we continue to expect that the  recent inventory-led strengthening of activity will give way to a perceptible  strengthening of final sales by the fourth quarter of this year  We still project that a  gradual tightening of monetary policy will be necessary at that point to prevent the  economy from overshooting and thus preserve low inflation beyond the forecast  horizon   Qualitatively, the downside risks to the projection seem much the same as they  have been for over a year  Will the consumer continue to spend, and will corporate  profits pick up enough to make businesses comfortable with expanding their capital  spending?  With respect to households, there are no signs that consumers are about to  give out Sentiment remains high, and consumers continue to spend on new vehicles,  many other types of durable goods, and homes  The job picture is beginning to  improve, and by our forecast the unemployment rate is near a peak  So, while this is  a concern and warrants monitoring, the household sector seems less vulnerable than it  was four or five months ago  Larger concerns remain about the condition of the  business sector Profits have turned up, and capital spending appears to have                             May 7, 2002 13 of 81  stabilized, but whether they will improve to the extent that we have projected is still  an open question Even the modest rebound we have projected for corporate profits  could be seen as a disappointment to markets and to firms, with negative feedback for  household and business spending   But there are upside risks, too Business sentiment has not been a very  informative leading indicator over the past couple of years  Businesses failed to  anticipate the sharp slowing of activity that took place over the past year and a half,  finding themselves caught with excess inventories and an overhang of capital  And  after the attacks of September 11, they slashed employment and production in  anticipation of a slowdown in demand that never occurred  It seems possible that,  with the current level of profits remaining so depressed, they are looking back more  than forward Investment often lags in a recovery, and its recent lackluster  performance is not atypical  Stimulative macro policies and the natural tendency of  the economy to restore its equilibrium may provide more of a kick to activity than  either we or business people currently recognize  I’ll now turn the floor over to  Karen to continue our presentation    That could be one interpretation of how we got to the higher   productivity level that we’re showing in this forecast  What I was really referring to was an   argument about whether or not the current levels of productivity that businesses have reached are   sustainable just by dint of firms continuing to push their existing workforce as hard as they are   doing currently At least in some firms where significant layoffs have occurred over the last   year, people have picked up the work of the person who had been sitting in the cubicle next to   them but disappeared in the layoffs  It’s conceivable that this is sustainable, as I indicated  But   it’s also conceivable that there could be adverse effects on morale over time  And in the case of   retail establishments, for example, it could very well mean fewer cashiers and longer checkout   lines A store might get away with doing that for a while, but over time the quality of the service   being provided might go down  Or in some cases, when firms push productivity higher they   might also be putting off some kinds of maintenance activities that they might normally   undertake They can do that for a while, but they also can’t necessarily sustain that     Actually, there was an article in Business Week last week on exactly   that issue There were some anecdotes in that article indicating that this was going on  Larry   Slifman pointed out to me yesterday that in the Beige Book there was a report from our   colleagues in Atlanta, using Home Depot as an example, that the firm had been surprised by the   consequences of their workforce reductions They had really cut back on the number of workers               May 7, 2002 20 of 81  they had going into the winter season and then suffered in the sense that they thought they were   losing business because checkout lines had increased significantly  So there are shreds of   evidence     I agree  But what we’re struggling with at this point is, as I said, that   it’s very difficult to hypothesize that all of this increase in productivity we have seen has been   structural    That would be a very significant increase  So what we’ve done in   the forecast is to assume that underlying productivity has been better over the past several years   and will continue to be better over the forecast period than we had previously expected  But   even with that upward shift in the level and the trend of productivity, we still can’t get around the   fact that the actual level of productivity appears to be exceeding even that more optimistic trend    We think that means that there is going to be a slow improvement in overall labor market   conditions—some modest pickup in hiring  And I believe we’ve actually seen that over the last   six or seven months We’ve gone from very steep declines in payroll employment to a situation   now that looks like stabilization, with a few leading indicators suggesting that conditions might   be improving going forward  But even there, the evidence is very slim  The current level of   initial claims for unemployment insurance would be consistent with at best very small positive   increases in payroll employment  So unless we see some improvement there, that would cast   further doubt upon the story of how quickly the labor market might begin to improve    I would note that in addition to that we also have measures of output   from the product side, from the income side, and from industrial production      No matter how we put those data together, in whatever combination   we look at them we see a significant acceleration in productivity over the last couple of quarters    Yes, roughly speaking It was a small revision, but still a downward   revision    Well, as you know, over time we have struggled with what a neutral   assumption means for the stock market  At times when we were more confident in our view that   the market was overvalued, we just projected a flat nominal rate  With the equity premium   having moved back up some distance and with forward price-earnings ratios—at least in our   forecast—having come down some, we were in the territory where we thought a neutral   assumption at this point would be more in line with the risk-adjusted return on equities equal to   that on bonds We calculate that increase in equity prices to be about 7 percent  It may be, say, a   5¼ percent ten-year bond rate and a 3¼ percent equity premium built into this forecast  Take off   about 1½ percentage point from that for the dividend yield, and that now gives us an equity price   increase of roughly 7 percent We’re just putting that down as a kind of neutral assumption, and   obviously we’ve had surprises on both sides of our stock market forecasts over the last several   forecasts—some up and now some down  So, I feel comfortable with that  If we were to show   something like a flat stock market in this forecast rather than the gradual increase that we have,   we’d probably be knocking about ¼ of a percentage point off of GDP growth next year, which   would be another tenth on the unemployment rate    I don’t, and we haven’t incorporated it in this forecast  So obviously   that’s something we’ll want to take a look at    This wouldn’t necessarily be a top line GDP figure  It may be   something that Karen would need to take account of in her import forecast     Yes  "
6772,2002-06-25," May I make just one point here about Art’s work?  I’m very   sympathetic to President Moskow’s point about not discarding this basic underlying structure    But at the same time I’m certainly willing to concede Art’s point that in the last fifteen years the   unemployment rate has not had as much predictive power for future inflation as it did previously    I don’t view the enterprise of the Greenbook forecast as an effort to go out and, in some sense,   find the most parsimonious structure upon which to forecast the economy  In fact, I’m not sure   our big 120 stochastic equation model could do much better than a 4 or 5 equation vector   autoregression  And I will admit that there are probably a number of people on our staff who   would be quite thrilled to write the Art Rolnick Greenbook  It would be one page and two   sentences and would say something like, “PCE inflation was 13 percent in 2001  And we   project PCE inflation to be 13 percent in 2002” [Laughter] But I don’t think that approach   would necessarily provide you as policymakers with the kind of information that you need to   grapple with the admittedly huge uncertainty you face about the economy  Art said he’d like you   folks to have 95 percent confidence before you talk to the Congress about the economic outlook    If you could get to 70 percent confidence, I’d say you should call it a good day and probably   quit   One of the reasons for moving away from a naïve approach and more toward the   complexity that we present in the forecast is that that complexity allows you to see where   tensions begin to arise in the projection  And indeed, our experience in the late 1990s is a good   example  It wasn’t just that productivity was performing better than a simple time series model     June 25-26, 2002 17 of 179  of productivity would suggest It was that we were seeing a pattern of errors across a large   number of equations that suggested to us that some important aspects of the structure of the   economy were changing in ways that you needed to respond to as policymakers  If we had been   forecasting with Art’s naïve model—or even with one that was a bit more complicated but still   parsimonious—I’m not sure you would have been able to identify exactly what was going on as   quickly as was possible from analyzing the pattern of our forecast errors  In our case, we were   seeing stronger productivity, less inflation, more consumption, more investment, and a stronger   stock market  It was all those pieces taken together that provided a context for you to understand   what was happening   At the end of the day, if the Congress would be satisfied with your using a twenty-five­  year moving average of money growth to explain what your policy was going to be for the next   year or two, I guess that would be great  And personally if you tell me I should be forecasting   inflation twenty-five years hence, I’ll be happy to use Art’s regression  I’m planning to be here   for only another ten years, so I’d be happy to forecast twenty-five years into the future    [Laughter] But I don’t think that is, as yet, a viable substitute as an alternative mechanism for   forecasting inflation   Indeed, one of the interesting things about modeling inflation has been that in the last   twenty-five or thirty years we economists have not as a profession made a huge amount of   progress Many of the basic models that people are using today to forecast inflation were already   evident in the 1971 or 1972 econometrics of price determination volume sponsored by the   Federal Reserve Board That had Bob Lucas’s original work and the work of Otto Eckstein and   Bob Gordon And, as Art notes, we’re still debating many of those issues  Some think we’re   making some progress, but I suppose I’m skeptical      June 25-26, 2002 18 of 179  I think Art makes a very good point about the reliability of forecasts  In fact, a couple of   years ago we submitted to the Committee a number of papers that looked at questions about how   to make monetary policy in periods of significant uncertainty  We suggested then that you ought   to put less weight on the forecast—as you did, I believe—and pay attention to what is actually   happening That procedure probably was wise and, I think, useful  Now, John and David will   discuss shortly the issues that we have been struggling with and how we’ve been trying to   explain what has gone on recently  But in terms of our being able to provide a context or an   explanation for the behavior of the economy, we still feel strongly that the unemployment rate is   an important transmission mechanism into monetary policy  It’s not the only one, and it may not   even be the principal one, but we believe it’s an important one    Mr Chairman, may I make one clarifying comment just so there isn’t   any confusion about what David and John have shown on exhibit 6?  In our model of the   economy, inflation is a monetary phenomenon  And you as policymakers take all the credit and   all the blame for the long-run movements of inflation, including the disinflation of the 1990s         June 25-26, 2002 38 of 179  What that decomposition in the table is showing is the portion of the unusual behavior of   inflation in the second half of the 1990s attributable to those factors  It does not indicate the   contribution that monetary policy made to the disinflation that occurred because ultimately that   is in the hands of this Committee In trying to explain the unusual developments, that breakdown   indicates that about 12 percent of that is explained by the change in the way you conducted   monetary policy    Another part of this chart that is not shown is the rise in inflation to   14 percent in 1979 and the decline to 5 percent in 1982  That’s all on your plates as well!    President Minehan, one aspect of what we saw in the late 1990s   certainly lends some support to that view  One hypothesis, or one of the previous empirical   stylized facts, was that late in expansions we get sags in productivity as lower-skilled workers   are brought into the labor force But what happened in recent years was obviously just the   opposite So it seems at least possible that some of the productivity gains were in fact being   stimulated by firms in essence trying to work their way around that declining quality of the   available labor pool And I do think it would be a very interesting research project    "
6773,2002-06-25,"4  Thank you, Mr Chairman  We’re going to be referring to   the package of materials entitled “Staff Presentation on the Economic Outlook”    Your first chart presents a broad overview of the staff forecast  The upper left panel   provides an update of our Greenbook projection of real GDP growth by including   data that we received late last week on foreign trade and defense spending  Taken   together, those data point to an upward revision of about ¼ percentage point to the   growth of real GDP in both the first and second quarters—a revision that returns us   close to our May forecast The basic contours of our longer-run projection also   remain largely unchanged from May  Stimulative monetary and fiscal policies,   among other things, are expected to encourage a gradual re-acceleration of final   sales—the red line in the panel to the right  Growth of real GDP—the black line—   shows an even sharper improvement than final sales, as an end to inventory   liquidation and then some restocking adds impetus to production  In the near term,   the lingering softness in labor markets is expected to result in a further rise in the   unemployment rate—the middle left panel—which we project will reach a peak of   about 6 percent this summer  Meanwhile, PCE price inflation—the black line in the   panel to the right—rebounds from levels that were depressed last year by sharply    4 Materials used by Mr Stockton, Mr Oliner, and Ms Johnson are appended to this transcript (appendix 4)                  June 25-26, 2002 53 of 179  falling energy prices  Core inflation—the red line—is expected to move sideways   The lower left panel compares our current projection with the one that we presented  in the January Greenbook As you know, we have strengthened considerably the  projected growth of real GDP in both 2002 and 2003  This faster growth of real  output has led us to revise down our estimate of the unemployment rate a bit this year  and next Dare I say it?  Less slack in labor and product markets [laughter] and a  sharper turnaround in non-oil import prices than we had projected in January more  than offset some favorable supply-side revisions to our forecast, and we expect PCE  price inflation to run a bit higher than in our earlier forecast  As shown in the panel  to the right, the ¾ percentage point upward revision to projected growth of real GDP  this year is composed of almost equal-sized positive contributions from household  spending and business fixed investment, with smaller and roughly offsetting changes  elsewhere   Turning to your next chart, the most recent near-term indicators have been  broadly consistent with our view that economic activity is continuing to expand but at  a considerably more subdued pace than earlier in the year  Manufacturing IP, shown  in the upper left panel, has been increasing steadily since the turn of the year, and we  expect that the gradual recovery under way in this sector will continue  One reason is  that inventories have moved into more comfortable alignment with sales  Days’  supply of manufactured goods—the right panel—has about returned to its low point  in early 2000 In addition, the orders picture has shown improvement in recent  months The ISM index of new orders—the middle left panel—has been fluctuating  around a reasonably robust level in recent months, lending support to the view that  the recent pickup in factory output has some staying power  More broadly, the labor  market seems to have turned up in recent months  As shown to the right, there have  been small increases in private payroll employment in the past two months, after  more than a year of nearly steady declines  Spending also appears to be increasing  this quarter, though at a much slower pace than in the first quarter  In particular, the  increases in consumer outlays over the past few months, shown in the lower left  panel, have been much smaller than earlier in the year  Even though housing starts—  plotted to the right—jumped in May, they returned to a level about matching that of  the first quarter, implying that residential investment will make only a small  contribution to the growth of real GDP in the current quarter, after being a significant  plus in the first quarter  Tomorrow morning we will receive data on orders and  shipments of capital goods in May, an important piece of the business spending  picture   Chart 3 highlights the policy environment that shapes our forecast  The upper left  panel displays our model-based estimates of the equilibrium real funds rate  With the  real funds rate hovering close to zero, we believe that monetary policy is set to foster  a return to above-trend growth later this year and into 2003  In recent months, there  has been a considerable convergence of the staff’s policy assumptions and market  expectations As shown in the right panel, the staff assumptions—the solid black  line—incorporate a bit less tightening than is anticipated by the markets—the solid  red line But those differences are now very small in comparison with the wide gap              June 25-26, 2002 54 of 179  in expectations that existed in January—shown by the two dashed lines  The stock  market—the middle left panel—is projected to be about flat through year-end before  trending up in 2003 The loss of household net worth over the past couple of years is  expected to be an ongoing drag on domestic demand during the projection period   However, the anticipated gradual decline in the foreign exchange value of the  dollar—the middle right panel—should help to fill that shortfall by boosting exports  and restraining imports  Fiscal policy also is expected to provide a substantial boost  to aggregate demand this year and next  Fiscal impetus, plotted in the lower left  panel, exceeds 1 percent of GDP this year and remains above ½ percent of GDP in  2003 Policy actions, the cyclical weakness of the economy, and the substantial  shortfall in tax receipts this year have led to a significant deterioration in the federal  fiscal position As shown to the right, we are now projecting unified deficits of  $154 billion and $127 billion in fiscal years 2002 and 2003, respectively  Steve  Oliner will now continue our presentation    Your next exhibit presents our current take on the strong  performance of productivity growth in recent quarters  The upper left panel addresses  the simple question, “Did it really happen?” In this panel, I use two independent  measures of output—one measured on the product side and the other measured from  the income side  I also use two independent measures of hours worked—one from  the establishment survey and one from the household survey  The remarkable finding  is that it doesn’t matter how you combine these measures; the growth of productivity  appears to have increased over the past year—a period of noticeable weakness in the  economy   One explanation for the unexpected strength is that underlying productivity  growth has been faster than we had earlier estimated  Indeed, in previous forecast  rounds, we responded to these developments, in part, by revising up our estimates of  the growth in structural productivity  As shown to the right, we now estimate that  structural productivity will rise 2 percent this year and 2½ percent in 2003; these  figures are about ¼ percentage point faster than our estimates at the beginning of the  year Structural productivity growth in 2003 is expected to nearly match its  performance in the second half of the 1990s  However, the composition of those  gains is expected to be different We are expecting less of a contribution from capital  deepening—the middle left panel—owing to the modest rebound we are expecting in  capital spending  And we are expecting more of a contribution from multifactor  productivity—the middle right panel—reflecting its recent strength   Another explanation for the buoyancy of productivity over the past year or so is  the influence of adjustment costs—an issue you may recall that was explored by our  colleague, John Fernald, at the Chicago Fed in a paper circulated to the Committee  last year In brief, the idea is that firms incur costs, such as downtime and training,  when they install new equipment, whether it be a computer system for office workers  or machine tools on the shop floor  This represents time and effort that would  otherwise have been devoted to producing final output  In a period of rapid increases  in the capital stock, these adjustment costs could be sizable and might distort the  assessment of underlying productivity growth  Likewise, a sudden decline in  investment, such as has occurred over the past year and a half, might result in a sharp  drop in these adjustment costs, leading measured productivity growth to overstate the  advances in underlying productivity   Line 1 in the lower panel reports the standard measure of labor productivity in the  nonfarm business sector  Lines 2a and 2b present figures for productivity growth that  net out the effect of high and low estimates of these adjustment costs  Firm-level data  suggest that these adjustment costs are relatively small, consistent with the estimates  on line 2a Macro-based estimates, such as those developed by John Fernald, tend to  be larger, similar to those on line 2b  Between 1998 and 2000, when investment was  booming, growth of labor productivity net of adjustment costs exceeded measured  productivity growth However, in 2001, in the wake of the investment collapse,  productivity net of adjustment costs slowed more sharply than measured productivity              June 25-26, 2002 59 of 179  growth In effect, some of the apparent favorable performance of productivity over  the past year may reflect the fact that firms incurred fewer adjustment costs as  investment declined  Still, these calculations suggest that this has not been a large  part of the story, and empirically, our estimate of structural productivity is not much  affected by these considerations   The upper left panel of chart 9 displays a third element in our interpretation of  recent productivity developments  We continue to believe that firms have remained  uncertain about the strength of the recovery and have been squeezing more out of  their existing workforces  This has been reflected in a movement of actual  productivity above our estimated structural trend  Our baseline forecast incorporates  growth in labor productivity of about 1 percent at an annual rate in the second half   The employment implications of the baseline projection are shown to the right  After  a projected gain in private payrolls of 75,000 in June, we forecast a gradual  acceleration to average monthly gains of 150,000 in the third quarter and 200,000 in  the fourth quarter   Recognizing that considerable uncertainty surrounds this aspect of our projection,  I also show the employment consequences of slower and faster productivity growth   In the slower productivity scenario, I assume no growth in labor productivity in the  second half—an outcome close to that projected by our models  Holding our output  forecast constant, such an outcome would be accompanied by very rapid employment  gains and a fall in the unemployment rate to about 5½ percent by year-end  The  faster productivity growth scenario assumes growth in productivity of about  2½ percent through the end of the year, similar to the pace we think has occurred in  the current quarter  Such an outcome would produce, in essence, a “jobless”  recovery, with little net change in payroll employment and with the unemployment  rate rising above 6½ percent in the fourth quarter  This is, of course, a very partial  equilibrium analysis, but it does give a rough sense of how alternative productivity  outcomes could shape near-term labor market developments  In that regard, initial  claims for unemployment insurance—the middle left panel—have fallen to a level  consistent with our projected June employment gain of 75,000  But some further  declines will be necessary over the next month or so if we are to reach our projected  average increase in the third quarter of 150,000  Household impressions of labor  market conditions—shown to the right—also have remained relatively lackluster to  date Overall, we are expecting soft labor market conditions to hold the growth of  hourly labor compensation over the next year and a half below the rates of increase  posted in 2001—measured by either the employment cost index—the red line in the  lower panel—or by nonfarm business compensation—the black line   As can be seen in the upper left panel of chart 10, the subdued growth in hourly  labor compensation and the relatively strong gains in structural labor productivity  together suggest that structural unit labor costs—the black line—will not be exerting  much pressure on prices over the forecast period  The projected depreciation of the  dollar is expected to result in a modest acceleration in non-oil import prices—the  upper right panel Moreover, energy prices—the blue bars in the middle left panel—              June 25-26, 2002 60 of 179  will give a small boost to inflation this year, after providing considerable relief in  2001 Despite these crosscurrents in the outlook, survey measures—shown on the  right—suggest that inflation expectations remain well anchored  As can be seen in  the lower panel, that should not be very surprising  The light shaded area highlights  the envelope formed by our major measures of core inflation  If one looks hard  enough, it is possible to see some small disinflation from 1995 to 1998 and a slight  acceleration between 1998 and early 2001  We are projecting inflation to edge down  again between 2001 and 2003 But overall, the picture has been one of general  stability in the rate of inflation in recent years, a pattern we do not think will be  disturbed over the next year and a half  Karen Johnson will now continue, with the  international portion of our presentation    The final chart presents your forecasts for 2002 and 2003  As  seen in the upper panel, you have revised up your projection for the growth of real  GDP in 2002 and lowered your forecast of the unemployment rate  Your projection  for PCE prices this year has been raised a touch  Your projections for next year are  displayed in the lower panel  The central tendency of those projections shows growth  of real GDP between 3½ and 4 percent This is accompanied by an anticipated  reduction in the unemployment rate and stability in the rate of PCE price inflation   Mr Chairman, that completes our presentation                     June 25-26, 2002 65 of 179   Mr Chairman, I thought I’d just bring the Committee up to date on   the orders and shipments figures for nondefense capital goods that were released this morning    Somewhere in front of you on the table you should see a sheet of paper that we distributed  It   shows the orders and shipments figures for nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft, which is   the component that actually goes into the national income accounts  It also has the figures for   the three major subcomponents of that category  computers, communications equipment, and   everything else   In brief, the numbers were stronger across the board than we had incorporated in our   forecast This is one of those releases where the devil will be in the details, and before we give   any precise figures on the revisions, we’ll need to look at those details  But it looks as if the   computers and communications equipment components were stronger and the “all else”   component was considerably stronger  That greater strength may translate into something on the   order of several percentage points for total E&S spending in the second quarter, which could be   03 or 04 on overall GDP That would move our forecast for GDP back closer to the   neighborhood of 2¼ to 2½ percent  Obviously, we will have some thinking to do about this    We’ll have some information coming in on inventories as well, so we’ll know whether some of   the shipments came out of inventories or not  But right now the picture on investment spending   looks more positive than we had incorporated in the forecast  "
6774,2002-06-25, I don’t think there were any changes in the model itself  
6827,2002-08-13,"  Actually we now get fairly timely data that we purchase from the   semiconductor industry on global production, which I think are probably as timely as the export   data But there’s a very high degree of correlation because of the global integration of this   industry across all these data sources  I think in some sense we’ve seen that show up fairly   reliably in the export data and on the import side as well, and in the global production data that   we’re using to construct industrial production  "
6879,2002-09-24," Thank you, Mr Chairman A year ago, as we gathered here  to discuss the outlook, we on the staff struggled mightily to make a useful  contribution to the economic analysis of the fallout from the unprecedented terrorist  attacks that had just occurred For once, the overused phrase of economic forecasters  everywhere—that the uncertainties are unusually large—was actually true  Although  we made an effort at the time to present what we thought was a balanced forecast, it  seemed much easier for us to envision the downside risks to that projection  In the  event, developments during the past year have, at times, reminded me of crossing the  street in London; I’m often so focused on looking to the left, that I don’t see the car  coming from the right that’s about to hit me  Similarly, amid all the concerns raised  by those terrible events, we simply didn’t anticipate the upturn in activity that was  about to commence That upturn is now nearly a year old, and we see its continuation  as the most likely outcome  But significant questions still attach to the strength of  this expansion   On that score, much of the recent news has been on the positive side of our  August projection In particular, the data on domestic spending have been almost  uniformly stronger than our expectations  The most striking example has been sales  of new motor vehicles, which not only didn’t retreat after the incentive-induced surge  to 18 million units at an annual rate in July but actually increased still further in  August to 18½ million units  Even apart from motor vehicles, consumer spending  appears to be on track to post a solid gain—nearly 3 percent for the quarter, which is                 September 24, 2002 14 of 115  about ½ percentage point faster than we had projected last month  To be sure, the  housing starts figures for August came in a bit below our forecast But permits edged  up for the month, homebuilders’ surveys remain quite positive, and there are few  reports that any noticeable softening has occurred   Moreover, favorable developments have not been confined to the household  sector Readings on shipments for July suggest that outlays for equipment likely  increased sharply Indeed, adding in the apparent strength in transportation  equipment, we are projecting a 10 percent annual rate increase in E&S spending in  the current quarter, more than twice the pace we had projected in August  And those  gains have been widespread, with spending in most major categories coming in above  our expectations Of course, a few bleak spots remain in the business spending  picture Outlays for communications equipment have shown no sign of improvement,  and the overhang of vacant space continues to weigh heavily on the nonresidential  construction sector   Taken together, private domestic final demands—that is, consumption plus  investment—are projected to rise at a 4¼ percent annual rate in the current quarter,  nearly 1½ percentage points faster than in our August forecast  We believe that some  of that strength in sales is coming out of inventories, and thus our upward revision to  the growth of real GDP was a smaller ½ percentage point, bringing the projected  increase in the current quarter to 3¼ percent  Moreover, that upward adjustment  comes on the heels of what we expect to be a similar-sized upward revision to the  second-quarter GDP figure to an annual pace of about 1½ percent   Despite these favorable developments, we have carried none of that stronger near- term growth forward in the forecast  Rather, we have revised down the growth in real  GDP over the next few quarters by enough to offset those upward revisions, so that  the level of output we are projecting for the fourth quarter of next year is about  unchanged from our previous forecast  In fact, we are expecting growth in activity  over the next four quarters to be little different from the pace of expansion that we  have experienced over the past four quarters  So, what gives?   There are several reasons why we have made largely offsetting adjustments to our  forecast, despite the stronger incoming readings on real GDP  One reason is that the  end of the inventory liquidation—at least outside of the motor vehicle sector—seems  to have occurred more quickly than we had previously anticipated, and thus the  positive contribution to growth from the swing in inventory investment is not  expected to be as large going forward A second reason is that we are skeptical that  the recent strength in the orders and shipments figures is yet signaling a substantial  acceleration in capital outlays  The data are noisy, and we are expecting a sizable  portion of the jump in July to be reversed over the next couple of months  Our  estimates for industrial production of business equipment have not shown the degree  of improvement implicit in a literal read of the July shipments figures  I’d also note  that the IP measures for these categories line up reasonably well with the anecdotal  reports we have received from businesses—reports that for the most part have                      September 24, 2002 15 of 115  remained lackluster  Moreover, some of the recent surprise on equipment spending  has occurred in business purchases of motor vehicles and deliveries of aircraft, areas  where we expect outlays to drop back in the months immediately ahead    Labor market developments also support a cautious approach to the recent spate  of solid spending data Employment has been moving sideways in recent months,  and hours worked have, on net, continued to drift down  The increase in initial claims  over the past few weeks might even suggest some deterioration in labor market  conditions Current levels of claims are more consistent with small aggregate job  losses than the small increases that we have incorporated in the forecast  We would  have been less troubled by the recent behavior of the labor market if that was the only  signal of weakness After all, a drop in hours might be taken as just a sign of faster  growth of labor productivity But the fact that the signal from the labor market seems  to have been corroborated by weakness in industrial production has given us pause   Factory output excluding motor vehicles has been flat since June  And that pattern  seems consistent with the surveys of purchasing managers, the discussion in the  Beige Book, and the reports we have received from our business contacts  Although  we do not read the recent data on the labor market and industrial production as  signaling an impending return to contraction in activity, we do believe that these  developments constitute downside risks to our projection—ones that counterbalance  the upside risks associated with the recent strength in spending indicators   Our forecast now anticipates that growth of real GDP will not move above that of  potential until the second half of next year  The basic minuses and pluses in the  outlook remain much the same as they were in August  On the minus side of the  ledger, households are expected to continue to restrain their spending in response to  the considerable hit taken by the asset side of their balance sheets  And we anticipate  that the general climate of caution pervading the business environment will be worn  away only slowly as profits continue to recover and as overhangs of unused capital  are reduced On the plus side, we believe that with real short-term interest rates close  to zero, monetary policy is set to facilitate the process of balance sheet repair, to  stimulate interest-sensitive spending, and eventually to contribute to above-trend  growth as the factors restraining demand abate over the next year or so  An  associated drop in the exchange value of the dollar and further impetus to aggregate  demand from the federal government add to the pickup in activity that we believe will  become more visible by late next year and into 2004   Once again, in assembling this forecast, stronger spending data and weaker hours  have confronted us with the challenge of interpreting another apparent outsized  increase in labor productivity We project an increase in nonfarm business output per  hour of about 4 percent in the current quarter—a figure which, if realized, would  bring the four-quarter growth in labor productivity to about 5¼ percent  Of course,  there are still plenty of missing data for the third quarter to prove us wrong, and, as  we are reminded every summer, all of these figures should be viewed with some  suspicion before they go through an annual revision But even assuming that there  was a two standard-deviation downward revision to productivity—and there is no                 September 24, 2002 16 of 115  reason to think a downward revision any more likely than an upward one—output per  hour would still be up more than 4 percent over the past year   Unlike the astonishing 7 to 8 percent increases that we saw at the turn of the year,  the more recent increases are almost certainly not the result of businesses being  surprised by unexpected strength in demand And as I noted in the July chart show,  we don’t believe that an adjustment cost story, at least in its conventional rendition,  can be quantitatively large enough to explain the upswing in productivity  One  obvious explanation for the performance of the past year is that structural productivity  is growing more rapidly than we are estimating  As you know, we did not make that  our baseline interpretation, but we do see it as a decided risk to our forecast  An  alternative simulation that we included in the Greenbook showed that faster growth of  structural productivity would boost projected growth of real output, lower the  unemployment rate, and put core inflation on a more pronounced downtrend   We think a more likely explanation is that firms, finding their profit margins still  under enormous pressure, are discovering ways to utilize existing resources more  intensively In some cases, that may mean working their employees even harder than  before and harder than might be sustainable over the longer haul  In other cases,  profit pressures may be forcing organizational innovations or efficiency  enhancements  In still others, businesses may be more fully and effectively utilizing  some of the resources, especially capital equipment, that they acquired during the  boom years  There are limits, of course, to this process, which is ultimately governed  by the underlying rate of technical progress  The problem is that we don’t really  know where those limits are  In this forecast, we expect productivity to grow more  slowly in the quarters ahead  But in contrast to some of our forecasts earlier in the  year, we do not expect any reversal in the recent gains, and we have held the level of  productivity further above our estimated structural trend and for a longer period of  time than would be suggested by our models  We think this strikes a reasonable  balance, but needless to say there are considerable uncertainties here   An implication of this revision to our productivity forecast is that the labor market  remains softer for longer than in our August projection  We have also revised up our  forecast of the unemployment rate, in part because of weaker prospective  employment growth and in part because we have now assumed that temporary  extended unemployment compensation will be continued through 2004 rather than  ending in the middle of 2003  All told, the unemployment rate now remains at or  above 6 percent through next year, before declining to 5¾ percent by the end of 2004   This level for the unemployment rate is higher than would be suggested by an Okun’s  law relationship, reflecting the implications of our above-trend forecast for  productivity and the effects of the unemployment insurance program  Should you be  worried about that?  I don’t think so, largely because over relatively short periods of  time Okun’s law is obeyed with roughly the same frequency as a 65 mile an hour  speed limit on the New Jersey Turnpike  [Laughter]                     September 24, 2002 17 of 115  With the unemployment rate remaining well above our estimate of the natural  rate, it might appear surprising that core consumer price inflation falls only a bit more  than ¼ percentage point over the forecast interval  But we think there are several  reasons for only a modest decline in underlying inflation going forward  First, as we  discussed in July, price inflation appears to be less sensitive to resource utilization in  recent years than previously  Second, the noticeable benefits that we were getting  earlier from the effect of a rising dollar on import prices reverse somewhat over the  next two years And finally, the recent small upside surprises on actual inflation and  the approximate stability of most measures of short-term inflation expectations  suggest that there is likely to be considerable inertia around recent rates of inflation   Taken together, these influences lead us to expect declines in inflation through 2004,  but only small declines  Karen will now continue our presentation    Let me make a couple of remarks on your points  Obviously, we can   construct considerably grimmer scenarios than the ones we presented in the Greenbook  And as   I think we’ve mentioned on a couple of occasions, that is an area of research we’re working on    One of the weaknesses in the alternative scenarios that we present to you is that we would like to   consider the covariance of the possibilities of these scenarios in ways we think this type of   analysis does not adequately capture  So, the thrust of your concern is a good one, and it’s one   that I think we need to address better going forward   We have run stochastic simulations of the model using our baseline forecast to look at the   probability that we would hit the zero bound  I think this moves in the direction you’re   suggesting In those scenarios, depending on how we characterize the monetary policy reaction   function—and, again, those scenarios depend importantly on that specification—we come up   with a probability of between 15 and 25 percent of running into that zero bound over the forecast   period That is noticeable Obviously, given the confidence interval on the forecast going out, it   probably shouldn’t be too surprising that there would be the possibility of a series of bad shocks   that would lead to that situation  It certainly isn’t trivial in my view      Yes, corporations have been taking advantage of what has been a   receptive bond market to acquire a lot of liquid assets and in fact have a lot of liquid assets on   their books     Yes    Yes, we’ve seen an increase in both  As I think we showed yesterday   in the staff briefing, the ratio of liquid assets to total assets has increased in the corporate sector   over the past year or so     Yes, I would agree that that’s the general picture we see currently   The weakness in borrowing has been largely demand-driven, not a supply constraint  Better   corporate credits can go to the market and raise funds  They have been doing that, presumably in   some sense to protect themselves against markets that might turn less receptive in the future  But   the weakness in borrowing also reflects the fact that corporations have accumulated these assets   because they have not been doing a significant amount of investment—indeed have been   liquidating inventories—and reducing the demands for those credits    First, let me say that I wouldn’t necessarily characterize it as a   favored explanation In fact one of the ways that I mentioned in which businesses could be   getting more output out of their existing resources is that they actually are learning how to use   the equipment that they currently have available to them  The capital overhang may be allowing   businesses to raise output without adding a significant number of workers because they are using   their equipment more efficiently  So it isn’t just the employee margin  You’re right, certainly, in   suggesting that the flatness in the workweek is not consistent with working employees harder    Don’t forget, though, that the workweek that we measure and that we know anything about   involves just production worker hours One can certainly imagine in the service economy that   some of the efficiencies have been achieved by cutting out white collar, middle manager types,   whose workweek is not measured in our employment survey, and working the remaining   managers longer hours  So some of that could be going on as well  That’s the only way to   reconcile the two because, as you point out, there is a tension between the production worker        September 24, 2002 24 of 115  workweek and what we’re actually seeing in productivity  My guess is that a few of these things   actually are going on in different sectors and in different areas  Some may involve more   efficient use of capital and some may just reflect working workers harder  The point would be in   some sense that one couldn’t look at the recent behavior of productivity and necessarily expect it   to continue indefinitely at that pace because taking up slack in overall resource utilization is one   of the ways in which these gains are being achieved    Obviously, there are many different estimated Phillips curves  Our   forecast actually is reasonably consistent with our estimates of the Phillips curve  Ours at least   has a relatively small coefficient on that gap variable  So I don’t think we view this forecast as   necessarily at odds with our estimated relationships  As I indicated, we think we’re already   seeing some significant swing in import prices; they had been declining about 3 percent in 2001,   and we think they are likely to be rising about 3 percent by some time next year  That’s a swing   of 6 percentage points We don’t see a lot of erosion in short-term inflation expectations, and        September 24, 2002 25 of 115  long-term inflation expectations have come down only some  So there could be some risk of a   more significant break on the inflation expectations side that would allow inflation to come down   more sharply Knowing how sensitive the results of those models are to specifications, I   certainly wouldn’t want to rule out the kind of figures that you cited  We get numbers like that,   for example, in Phillips curves that use capacity utilization rather than the unemployment rate,   and there’s not a lot to differentiate models that use those two variable measures  And as you   pointed out, rules of thumb based on past Phillips curve experience would suggest a more   pronounced downdrift in inflation than we’re showing here     Sure One factor was that when we put the Greenbook to bed we had   only one week of initial claims at 424,000  [Laughter]  Claims data are volatile enough that we   just didn’t take seriously that one week’s data  Now, that level was sustained last week  There   was an old rule of thumb in the division that we had to see at least three successive weeks of   evidence in the data before we took it seriously I don’t know if that’s quite the right number of   weeks, but at this point, if that level of initial claims were sustained going forward or rose even   further, I think we would have to revise our employment forecast  "
6880,2002-09-24," Actually, we reduced it to about 38 percent, allowing for some   revisions in the hours data that we got late last week  "
6937,2002-11-06," Thank you, Mr Chairman  As you know, we received a  considerable amount of information last week after the Greenbook projection was  finalized I am pleased to report that the forecast gods, however briefly, appeared to  be smiling upon us  For the most part, the data were very close to our expectations  and require little change to our near-term forecast  Real GDP was reported by the  Commerce Department in its advance estimate for the third quarter to have risen at an  annual rate of 31 percent, the same as we had projected  Subsequent data on  construction and inventories point to a small upward revision to that figure, on the  order of ¼ percentage point, with no implications for Q4   The broad contours of the labor market report for October also were in close  concordance with our projection To be sure, the decline last month in private  payrolls of 29,000 was a bit larger than we had penciled in, but there were noticeable  upward revisions to August and September that left the level of employment last  month a touch above our projection The unemployment rate finally moved up, even  if not by quite as much as we had projected  Taken together, the picture painted by  the October employment data and virtually all of the other labor market indicators  that we monitor is one of weakness  Employment gains appear to have stalled out  after a brief upturn this summer, and recent readings on initial claims for  unemployment insurance suggest there has been little improvement in conditions  since the October reference week                        November 6, 2002 8 of 122  While the data late last week contained few surprises for us, the same cannot be  said for the bulk of the information that we had received since the September  Greenbook In fact, a notable feature of the incoming data was the uniformity with  which they surprised us to the downside Production, consumer spending, business  outlays, and foreign activity all came in below our earlier expectations  The breadth  of these disappointments gave us little reason to discount the news and led us to mark  down considerably our forecast through the middle of next year  We project that real  GDP will grow at an annual rate of 1 percent in the current quarter and at a pace of  less than 2½ percent through the second quarter of 2003—a downward revision to  growth of roughly ¾ percentage point at an annual rate over that period  The direct  readings on production have not been encouraging  After increasing through early  summer, industrial production is likely to have dropped about ¾ percent in October  on the heels of small declines in both August and September  Factory output received  a sizable boost through the middle of the year from the efforts by firms to stem  further liquidation of their inventories But that impetus now appears to have largely  played out, and before any improvement in the pace of final sales has taken hold   Indeed, as we move into the fourth quarter, growth of final sales appears to be  flagging rather than gaining momentum     In the business sector, the recent readings on spending for equipment and  software have, on net, been below our earlier expectations  Though estimated outlays  for computers have run well ahead of our forecast, shipments of capital goods  elsewhere have been noticeably softer than we had projected in September  These are  obviously noisy data, and caution is warranted in drawing much from their month-to­ month movements  But when considered together with the weak output of business  equipment in IP and the downbeat reports from firms about their spending plans, we  felt a noticeable downward adjustment to our forecast of investment spending was  needed to balance the risks to this part of our projection   Like business spending, consumer outlays also have come in below expectations   Sales of light motor vehicles in both September and October were down more than  we had projected It is difficult to know whether the falloff in sales over the past two  months represents only a payback for the phenomenal pace registered in July and  August or a more fundamental weakening of demand  We have assumed that at least  some of the shortfall represents a signal of softer underlying demand and accordingly  have marked down our projection of auto sales and production over the next few  quarters That said, given the economics of the labor contracts in this industry, we  think that production of a bit under 12 million units at an annual rate is about as low  as the auto companies will go in the near term, barring some more serious shock to  demand or costs  Non-auto spending also has been disappointingly weak of late   Real PCE excluding motor vehicles was about flat in August and September  And  while the weekly data on chain store sales leave a great deal to be desired in terms of  predictive content, their recent weakness lines up well with the souring of consumer  sentiment and anecdotal reports suggesting that consumer spending has remained  sluggish                            November 6, 2002 9 of 122  The only exception to the string of downside surprises that we experienced over  the intermeeting period was in housing  Starts of both single-family and multifamily  housing were far above the level that we had projected for September  Although the  adjusted permits data suggest that those figures probably overstated the jump in  activity, sales of new and existing homes showed considerable strength as well, and  reports from the builders have remained very favorable   With the downward adjustments that we have made to our projection, the  economy does not really break out of the recent pattern of sluggish growth until late  next year Still, we do expect several factors to result in a very gradual improvement   For one, according to our models, the restraining effects on consumer spending of the  steep declines in household net worth are at their maximum from now until early next  year Thereafter, the drag from the wealth effect should begin to abate  Next year,  federal fiscal policy is projected to provide another boost to aggregate demand that is  only partially offset by the ongoing difficulties at state and local governments  And  with the real federal funds rate below the estimated range of its equilibrium, we  expect that monetary policy will be supportive of a gradual pickup in the pace of  activity   One other component of our story is worth mentioning  We have assumed that  there will be a gradual lifting of the uncertainty and pessimism that currently appear  to be afflicting the business sector and that are reflected in cautious hiring and weak  investment  Unfortunately, we don’t have reliable measures of business sentiment   But we have observed that the growth in spending on equipment and software has  been running well below the fundamentals, at least as quantified in our models by the  cost of capital and expected sales and profits—a pattern consistent with reports of  business caution and concern   In response to the recent data and the continued gloomy reports, we have held the  growth of investment spending below that projected by our models into next year   We then allow most of that unusual weakness in spending to dissipate by late 2003,  and this, in turn, gives a lift to business investment and to overall GDP  While this  might seem an arcane bit of forecasting detail, it matters for our projection  And  whether one characterizes this feature of the forecast as a regression residual, as  business confidence, or as animal spirits, in actuality it is a measure of our ignorance,  not our knowledge, about the factors driving the outlook for business spending   As usual, there are various risks on both sides of the projection  We highlighted  several of those in the “alternative scenarios” section of the Greenbook  Rather than  review those possibilities this morning, I thought I would take a few minutes to talk  about some less likely but more consequential risks in the outlook  Specifically  What is the risk of renewed recession?  How likely is it that we could enter a  deflation?  And, by contrast, what are the chances that we are at the front edge of a  much more vigorous recovery than we are currently projecting?                       November 6, 2002 10 of 122  Let me begin with the risk of recession  As I noted earlier, industrial production  has fallen over the past three months, initial claims for unemployment insurance have  moved up noticeably, on balance, in recent weeks on our alternative seasonals, and  sales of light motor vehicles dropped off sharply over September and October  We  have read these data as suggesting a paltry gain in real GDP of 1 percent at an annual  rate in the current quarter It probably could go without saying that any reasonable  confidence interval around that forecast would include a negative number   But what about a cumulative contraction in activity with the depth, duration, and  dispersion that would qualify it as a recession?  Clearly, the odds have risen over the  past few months  An appreciable shock to the economy—for example, another leg  down in the stock market or a spike in oil prices—could without too much difficulty  trigger a downturn But barring such a shock, several factors would seem to be  holding down the odds of recession  For one, some of the major imbalances that  contributed to the contraction in activity last year have been reduced or rectified  If  anything, inventories appear to be on the low side relative to sales, and the steepest  contractions in capital spending now appear to be behind us  Moreover, while  pervasive caution by businesses may be restraining spending, that cautious behavior  also is probably providing some measure of protection against the reemergence of  imbalances that could later lead to a more pronounced downturn in activity   What about deflation?  In our forecast, core PCE prices increase at an annual rate  of about 1¼ percent over the forecast interval  Given our estimate of the bias in this  measure, a reading below ½ percent per annum would constitute actual deflation  As  we noted in our July presentation, your success in stabilizing inflation, and with it  inflation expectations, appears to have made price inflation less responsive to the  output gap than it has been in the past As a consequence, moderate errors in our  output forecast have relatively minor implications for our inflation projection  But  we also noted that many other factors—for example, exchange rates, energy prices,  and productivity— are, at times, important in shaping the inflation picture  Stochastic  simulations of our model, which take all of these influences into account, suggest a  25 to 30 percent chance that core PCE inflation could fall below ½ percent either next  year or in 2004   Finally, we do not believe the outsized risks to our forecast are wholly on the  downside What is the possibility that we could be on the verge of a much more  vigorous expansion—one that drives the economy beyond its estimated potential by  the forecast horizon?  We have made a rather sizable downward revision to our  projection on little more than a month’s worth of information  Moreover, the stock  market has shown considerable strength in recent weeks in the face of what we  viewed as disappointing economic data  The animal spirits that appear to be  inhibiting business spending could evaporate more rapidly than we have assumed,  especially if the stock market were to remain on a pronounced uptrend  Therefore,  we cannot rule out that, with the real funds rate assumed to hold close to zero for the  next two years, at some point a much sharper rebound in activity could develop                               November 6, 2002 11 of 122  Of course, another upside risk to the projection in real GDP is that the growth of  productivity remains stronger than we have projected  But if that risk were to  materialize, faster growth would likely also be accompanied by lower inflation and  less pressure on the economy’s resource base  As a consequence, the policy  implications would be quite different from those associated with much stronger  growth generated solely from the aggregate demand side of the economy  That is, the  funds rate, at least for a time, would need to be below, rather than above, the baseline   Karen will now continue our presentation    I’d say a few things about that  First of all, there is some question   about the data themselves  Our industrial production measures of the output in that area don’t   suggest as much strength as is included in the M3 data [manufacturers’ orders, shipments, and   inventories] that are used to construct the national income accounts and that I mentioned in my   briefing That’s one reason for our leaning in the direction we did; we think maybe that M3 data   will begin to show something that is more in line with what we’re seeing on the production side    So there’s some question about what exactly has happened  Two, I think the replacement   demand story is very important on the computer side  There are a lot of computers, and they   depreciate very rapidly There has been some extension of the service lives of such equipment   over the recession, with companies making do longer with what they have  But once that   lengthening stabilizes, we will see an uptick again on the replacement side  And that is an   important factor in our outlook    Right Still, it is true that a lot of units are being shipped  Despite   the fact that one hears those stories, there is actual evidence of sales  Numbers of boxes are   leaving factories, and somebody is purchasing those items    I’d just mention one other thing  Obviously, it’s an area of very   substantial price declines, too So capital spending budgets in nominal terms, which is what we   mostly hear about, are weaker than what we would translate into real terms  None of this, I   think, completely resolves the tension that you are pointing out here, President Minehan  That’s   why in this forecast in particular we moved more in the direction of a weaker projection of   investment spending for a longer period of time than might be suggested by a reading of our   models But whether we’ve done enough of that, I don’t know  In one of the alternative   simulations we presented in the Greenbook we showed an example of what would happen if we               November 6, 2002 16 of 122  got no improvement in investment spending over the course of 2003 relative to what we’ve   already had in 2002, along with some ongoing weakening on the consumer side  Obviously,   that’s a much weaker picture if we accept those assumptions fully    You’re absolutely right that our forecast, in essence, is predicated   on an ongoing decline in the target inventory-sales ratio  We would expect that ratio in some   sense to continue to get lower and lower over time as businesses manage inventories better  And   quite frankly, our inventory projection actually has inventory investment a little stronger than a   literal read of our models would suggest because we think those models don’t incorporate the   more rapid pace of adjustment of inventories to target ratios than used to be the case  The   models, obviously, are estimated on the basis of historical data that involved slower adjustments    So we think there could be some risk that we’re too strong on the inventory side  But if we were   to get a more pronounced move back to an equilibrium or target inventory-sales ratio in   relatively short order, I think we could see another lift to activity similar to what we saw earlier   this year So we could get another pop coming from that  Businesses report in fact that they’re   running with relatively lean inventories  But I think it would take a positive sales surprise at this   point to actually move them in the direction of wanting to add to inventories more   aggressively—either that or perhaps some sign that commodity prices were picking up more            November 6, 2002 17 of 122  significantly Businesses seem to be fairly comfortable, given their degree of caution, running   with relatively lean inventories But as you know, this is an area of the forecast in which we   have not always covered ourselves with distinction  I’m talking in terms of our ability to predict   either the inventories themselves or minor changes in the sales outlook, which obviously get   amplified in their effect on the overall forecast through the inventory channel  So I think there   certainly could be some upside surprise there as well     Yes Actually, there are quite frequently very large discrepancies   between the two series As we talked about at the Board meeting on Monday, it’s quite rare to   see them line up very well over any considerable period of time So we’re always trying to   explain why one is stronger than the other, usually not too successfully  Our basic view is that   the establishment survey is probably giving a better read on the current state of labor markets  It   appears to line up much better with the weakness that seems to be evident in initial claims for   unemployment insurance, with perceptions by households of the state of the labor market, and   with business reports on how easy or difficult it is to find workers  So we feel reasonably   comfortable taking most of our signal from the establishment rather than the household survey         November 6, 2002 18 of 122   That certainly is possible  I actually don’t know whether or not our   experts would think that we’ve been missing something recently on immigration  As for the   surprising strength in housing activity over the past few months, I would just note that household   formations are extremely elastic with respect to overall economic conditions  We probably   would not view immigration as an important determining factor over short periods of time  So, if   we were to analyze our forecasting errors, I don’t think we would be giving much weight to   unexpectedly strong immigration to explain, let’s say, the experience of the last three or four   months Now over a longer period of time, obviously, underlying demand would be a factor as it   has been in the past when the source of the problem was a population mis-estimate  So it   certainly would line up in that direction    It could, if it were actually measured     It depends on whether they affected that survey to a substantial   extent    We’d now be looking at a third-quarter figure of about 4 percent     Yes    Let me just say a couple of words about that  One is that some of the   things you mentioned in terms of factors that are likely to be weighing on investment are   incorporated in this forecast You may have seen on chart 4 in that presentation that we   indicated we’re expecting aircraft investment—for exactly the reasons you laid out—to be very   weak throughout the forecast period, and that’s true in manufacturing as well  We’re expecting   ongoing declines in investment in that sector and growth in capacity that for a second year will   be the weakest on record since we have been constructing capacity measures  So that process is   operating in the background in our forecast      But on the broader issue of relying on this gloom to lift, one reason I wanted to raise that   in my presentation was that in fact it is quantitatively important in our outlook  Indeed, if we   were to hold the residuals on our investment equations at the levels recorded over the last couple   of years, we’d have the unemployment rate basically holding constant over this forecast period   rather than coming down as it does  Obviously, a consequence would be somewhat lower   inflation as well So it is not an inconsequential feature of the forecast, whether we call it animal   spirits or business confidence or something else  Of course, it’s possible that our model is   misspecified—that there’s some unidentified feature driving investment that we’re not capturing   well and that could persist throughout the forecast period   The way I’m looking at the forecast is that the animal spirits component of it is   diminishing over time  I say that simply because, if one looks at the residuals in those equations,   big gaps don’t last forever; they tend to fade away  So in some sense we’re relying less and less   on animal spirits in this forecast  But that expected diminishment is an important feature in the         November 6, 2002 22 of 122  pickup that we’re showing here And I don’t have much more to offer on that  Unlike the   household sector, where we get some independent measures of sentiment or confidence against   which we can judge developments, we really don’t have statistical measures to rely on as to   whether sentiment is improving or diminishing on the business side      That particular scenario makes no different assumption about the   way animal spirits evolve than does the baseline forecast  So, the strengthening in that   simulation—from the 50 basis point reduction in the funds rate relative to the baseline—operates   through all the usual channels by which we assume monetary policy works  It works through   interest-sensitive spending, more housing, and more capital equipment spending  It works   through a somewhat higher stock market and a somewhat lower dollar  Obviously, if you   thought for some reason that the change in the funds rate would not be operating through those   channels—    —or not as strongly through those channels, you would want to   temper the results there  Now, I don’t believe there’s necessarily any strong reason for thinking         November 6, 2002 23 of 122  that the interest sensitivity of spending at this point would be very different than what is picked   up in the historical averages While we talk about capital overhangs, and indeed there are some    sectors in which capital overhangs clearly remain, we do have $12 trillion worth of investment   occurring in this economy right now That must mean there are many people who are still on the   margin and for whom a lower cost of capital might “crowd in” a bit more spending  A lower   cost of capital might allow some further improvement in the structure of both household and   business balance sheets We’re certainly not seeing any difficulties getting more housing   construction There appear to be construction workers; there is land to be developed; there is   lumber to be used  That channel seems to be operating  So, I’m not uncomfortable with that   baseline But I recognize that one could be concerned about whether it overstates or understates   the sensitivity of the economy  to policy changes going forward    Well, to me one of the simplest ways to think about this is in terms of   the probability of deflation, which I mentioned in my briefing—meaning that we get inflation   roughly ¾ percentage point below our current forecast  As I said, the model suggests that those   odds are somewhere in the 25 to 30 percent range  I think the odds are reasonably symmetric, so   one could expect a 25 to 30 percent probability that inflation could be ¾ percentage point higher,   which would be around 2 percent Now, whether one would consider that to be an inflation         November 6, 2002 24 of 122  problem or not, I leave for you as the policymakers to judge  But that gives you the sense that   there are big confidence intervals around our forecast    By the way, I would certainly encourage you not to think of those extended Greenbook   simulations as forecasts  They are in some sense constructions using the model  But our   confidence interval around our forecast for 2004 is huge  So if you were to ask what the   confidence interval is around a forecast out to 2008, I’m not sure the universe is wide enough,   [laughter] but it is possible to generate scenarios that would include a noticeable deterioration of   inflation   Certainly over the near term, it seems as if a real breakout on the upside in the inflation   outlook would take some doing  It’s not quite so easy to see, especially given how stable   inflation expectations are, that we could get serious erosion in what people think the FOMC’s   longer-term inflation objectives are and, therefore, that inflation could deteriorate a great deal   over the shorter-term forecast period we’re showing in the Greenbook  There is certainly always   the possibility; a central bank can always generate inflation if it tries hard enough  But I’d say   it’s difficult to see that being an issue over the next eight quarters  "
6986,2002-12-10," Thank you, Mr Chairman  I was impressed at the last  meeting with the creative language used by many members of the Committee to  describe the economic outlook  So this morning I thought I’d try my hand at  explaining the forecast using some of that language  To begin with the current  quarter, I can report that—as the saying apparently goes—there has been about as  much pumpkin as we had earlier anticipated though there is clearly less pumpkin now  than in the third quarter    The story of our longer-term projection should be familiar  Though we believe that there was a little jam yesterday and that there is some jam  today, we would have to admit that in the projection it’s still mostly jam tomorrow   The inflation picture also is about unchanged; everything at the dollar store still costs  a dollar With respect to the risks to the outlook, we think we see light at the end of  the tunnel, but we’re nervous about the fact that, whatever the light is, it seems to be  getting brighter while we are standing still   I apologize for not citing all of the colorful metaphors that seemed to be guiding  your deliberations at the last meeting, and even more so for now returning to my own  plodding prose In fact, there’s not a great deal more to be added  It has been a  reasonably tranquil period for the forecast by the standards of the past couple of  years The principal change we made was to incorporate the effects of your easing of  monetary policy and to account for our perception that the elections had shifted the  political balance in favor of somewhat greater fiscal stimulus   The incoming data, on balance, have been close to our earlier expectations and  have reinforced our impression that we are indeed working through a soft patch in  economic activity  The signs of sluggishness have been most evident in the labor  market and in the manufacturing sector, especially the motor vehicle industry  Once  again, we received an employment report immediately after publication of the  Greenbook Private payroll employment dropped 48,000 in November in contrast to  our expectation of a gain of 20,000 Essentially the employment increases that had  occurred over the summer have now been reversed  Our largest forecast error  occurred for the unemployment rate, where we had expected an increase from  57 percent to 58 percent and instead saw a jump to 60 percent  That said, I would  characterize this development as more a “surprise” of timing than magnitude  As you  know, we had been puzzled by the failure of the unemployment rate to rise noticeably  in recent months, given the weakness in payroll employment  The puzzle now seems  to have been resolved in a single month  The only upward surprise in the November  labor market report was in hours worked, which increased a bit more than projected  in the Greenbook Taken together, the November data suggest a bit weaker labor                           December 10, 2002 8 of 87  market than we had expected but with little material consequence for our forecast   We would probably carry a slightly higher unemployment rate into early next year—  on the order of a tenth or so—and leave our GDP forecast unchanged for now   The labor market, however, was not the only source of weakness  The major  contributor to the sharp slowing in activity between the third and fourth quarters has  been the motor vehicle industry  Sales of light motor vehicles have dropped back  considerably from the torrid pace registered this summer, as the average level of  customer incentives has fallen, on net, since August  The slump in sales has led the  automakers to trim production in the fourth quarter  So after contributing about  1 percentage point to the growth of real GDP in the third quarter, motor vehicle  assemblies are lopping off nearly 1½ percentage points from growth in the fourth  quarter And even those production adjustments have not been sufficient to prevent  inventories from having become a bit heavy, so that some combination of further  production cutbacks and sweetened incentives likely will be necessary in the months  ahead   More broadly, activity in the factory sector has sagged again in recent months   We now expect manufacturing IP outside of motor vehicles to drop about ¼ percent  in November, continuing a pattern of decline that emerged in late summer  In our  forecast, we are not looking for any noticeable increases until the spring  The recent  weakness stems, in part, from a significantly diminished impetus to activity from  inventory investment  A smaller swing in nonauto inventory investment and the  cutbacks in motor vehicle production account for essentially all of the slowing in the  growth of real GDP in the current quarter   To date, we have seen few signs that this period of weakness is spreading or  cumulating into something more serious  With the exception of motor vehicles, final  sales are projected to grow about 2 percent at an annual rate in the current quarter, the  same rate as in the third quarter  Moreover, initial claims for unemployment  insurance and insured unemployment have both come down in recent weeks  For the  most part, nonauto inventories appear to be in reasonable balance  And commodity  prices have been relatively firm, suggesting that the recent weakness in factory output  is not yet of cyclical dimensions  Instead, this appears to be a particularly soft spot in  a generally subdued expansion We expect subpar economic performance to extend  into early next year, with real GDP projected to grow about 2¼ percent at an annual  rate in the first quarter—unchanged from our previous projection   However, beyond the near term, we have made more noticeable adjustments to  our forecast, largely to reflect changes in our underlying policy assumptions  Most  important, we lowered our assumed path for the federal funds rate 50 basis points in  light of your action last month  We assume that the funds rate will stay at 1¼ percent  through the middle of 2004 before gradually rising  This more stimulative monetary  policy accounts for the bulk of the upward revision that we have made to the forecast                        December 10, 2002 9 of 87  We have also built in a slightly more stimulative fiscal policy, which provides a  small additional boost to growth in 2004  We have assumed a reduction of personal  income tax payments of $25 billion in 2004, over and above the next installment of  marginal rate reductions  These tax reductions are assumed to be partly offset by  about $5 billion of cuts in federal spending  We view these adjustments to our  forecast as better balancing the risks in light of last month’s elections  As we noted in  the Greenbook, we are largely agnostic about the form in which this stimulus will be  delivered But as an example, a package of this dimension could include pulling  forward the child tax credit and marriage penalty relief that are currently scheduled to  occur later in the decade   The more stimulative monetary and fiscal policies give a steeper tilt to the  trajectory of growth in this forecast  We now project real GDP to increase  3¼ percent in 2003 and 4¼ percent in 2004—about ¼ and ½ percentage point faster,  respectively, than in the October Greenbook That pace is rapid enough to begin to  erode the margin of excess capacity by late next year, and the unemployment rate is  now projected fall below 5½ percent by the end of 2004   As has been the case at several junctures over the past couple of years, our  outlook is once again apparently at odds with that of the market  Even after the  developments of the past week, market participants are anticipating an earlier and  more aggressive tightening of monetary policy than we have incorporated in our  baseline projection  In our forecast, growth remains subdued through midyear,  weighed down by the continuing adjustment of household spending to the decline in  stock market wealth, the playing out of the boost we have been getting from  inventory investment, and the lackluster economic performance of our major trading  partners As a consequence, we do not envision the same urgency for tightening as is  built into market expectations  Only by late 2003 do the waning effects of the earlier  stock market declines and the improving investment picture lift growth in real GDP  above that of potential   We readily admit that we could have this wrong  The markets apparently  continue to be looking for something that resembles a more conventional period of  economic recovery  And with the real federal funds rate at or below zero for nearly  two years, we cannot rule out a period of more-vigorous growth  Those risks are  amplified by the possible enactment of a major stimulus package early next year   Certainly the buzz about that possibility has been growing in recent days  Given the  uncertainties about the magnitude, timing, and composition, we were dissuaded from  building into the forecast a larger and more immediate stimulus package  Instead, we  addressed that possibility in an alternative simulation that assumed a combination of a  payroll tax holiday and an acceleration of the marginal rate reductions included in the  2001 tax legislation, with those actions taking effect early next year  That package—  roughly $115 billion of added stimulus next year—raises growth of real GDP above  4 percent, on average, throughout the projection period  In this alternative scenario,  the faster pace of activity pushes the unemployment rate down to 5 percent by the end  of 2004, and core PCE inflation levels off at just under 1½ percent  While there are                              December 10, 2002 10 of 87  clear upside risks to our projection, we continue to see some sizable counterbalancing  risks to the downside The most obvious risks center on our forecast of capital  spending To be sure, there has been a substantial turnaround in equipment spending  from last year to this; steep declines in spending in 2001 have given way to modest  increases this year In our forecast, that process of improvement continues into next  year and 2004, with growth in real E&S spending picking up from low single digits  this year to low double digits next year  Accelerating output and sales, a low and  declining cost of capital, and tax incentives are projected to help propel faster growth  of spending over the next two years   But thus far this year, equipment spending has continued to fall short of the  fundamentals, at least those that we are capable of quantifying in our models  That  shortfall likely reflects a variety of factors including gloomy business sentiment, a  sense of heightened uncertainty about economic and geopolitical conditions,  financing difficulties in some sectors, and lingering overhangs of capital  Whatever  the sources, the unusual restraint on business spending will need to largely dissipate  by the second half of next year in order to get our projected acceleration of business  spending And that still remains a forecast  Although reports on capital spending  plans have been mixed of late, I think it’s fair to say that the combination of caution  and pessimism still predominates   There are risks to the consumption outlook as well  We view this quarter’s  flattening out as a pause, driven importantly by the drop-off in motor vehicle  purchases If that slump reflects the beginning of a more persistent weakening of  overall consumer outlays—one that occurs before the acceleration of business  spending—the current soft patch could come to look a lot more like the La Brea tar  pits   A final downside possibility is that financial markets have overreacted to a few  pieces of good news in recent weeks  We were impressed by the extent to which the  markets moved on the positive surprises in readings on retail sales, durable goods  orders, and initial claims—all noisy indicators of activity  Any substantial retracing  of these recent gains—and we have seen some of that in the stock market in the last  few days—would cause us to revise down our projection for growth, all else being  equal In sum, we feel comfortable with the balance of risks surrounding our  projection of real output But those risks remain considerable   I have devoted little attention this morning to our inflation projection largely  because there has been little news with regard to price inflation or its determinants   Measures of core inflation have generally drifted down over the past year  And, with  slack in resource utilization expected to persist over the projection period, we  anticipate a further slight reduction in these measures over the next two years  But  neither our models nor surveys of inflation expectations suggest any sharp deviation  from the recent performance of prices in the period immediately ahead  Karen  Johnson will continue our presentation                     December 10, 2002 11 of 87   To the extent that that is built into the futures markets, it’s   comfortably within our forecast    Well, the short and honest answer is “no”  We’d have to think long   and hard about what aspects of the statistical program would have to be adjusted and thus blown   up by a larger population number  Obviously some measures would not need to be adjusted   because many of the figures—the census of manufacturers, the retail census, and so forth—are   universe counts already and would be unaffected  Other measures clearly would be affected—   the total level of household employment, for example  So I’m not sure what that change in the   population figure would produce in the way of altering the picture of the overall economy    However, with respect to some of the fundamental characteristics of the expansion in the 1990s,   I don’t see this revision changing, for example, the sharp acceleration of productivity that we   had I don’t think it necessarily would alter things like the perceived level of slack in the labor   markets, given that changes in population probably would affect both employment and the labor   force I’m sure there are some consequences, but at this point I just don’t know exactly what   they would be    Well, as you know, partly at your direction, prior to the 2000 Census   we had been looking at the possibility that there would be some significant upward revision in   the population estimates, and in some sense that certainly had already informed our thinking    These recent revisions, however, are additional refinements  But again, I’m not sure that they   would affect the picture of the 1990s in any material way  I don’t think the revisions would have   any perceptible effect on the forecast going forward because these are mostly level adjustments   rather than growth rate adjustments    Yes, and the differences weren’t very pronounced last time, whereas   this time they are more pronounced    Yes, as of a little over a week ago it looked to us as if the revision in   market expectations for the funds rate implied an upward revision to the market’s outlook for   spending In contrast, our forecast was only adjusting to the extent that we had lowered the   entire path of the funds rate going forward to reflect your easing move at the last meeting  Now               December 10, 2002 15 of 87  our expectation regarding the funds rate path really has come back closer to where it was at the   time of the last meeting, suggesting no significant revision there either    I’ll start with your second question, and perhaps Vincent will speak   to the M3 data Obviously there was another very significant surprise in the productivity   numbers  Some of that is real in that output, in fact, turned out to be a bit better than we had   expected Some of it is a reflection of the way the statistical system is constructed  The   productivity series that we show and that gets featured by the BLS is a series for nonfarm   business excluding the housing sector  It turns out that mortgage refinancings, which accelerated   very rapidly in the third quarter, are treated as intermediate input to the housing sector  That   shows up as less gross product originating from the housing sector  The latter is subtracted from   nonfarm business output, so we get a much bigger increase in nonfarm business output in the   third quarter We think that will be an additional increment to productivity growth in the fourth   quarter Then, as the refinancing begins to wane some next year, that will be a factor holding   down the growth of nonfarm business output ex housing    That’s absolutely right But I would say—    Right, and if it really did, that would show up as much more   productivity or output in essence in the provision of financial services    Well, I’m trying to explain why nonfarm business output—when one   looks at the top line of GDP—was so close to what we had expected while productivity was so   much stronger You’re absolutely right that to the extent that this productivity growth really   reflects higher productivity in the mortgage banking industry, for example, that’s real   productivity   Obviously, though, that still leaves us with a substantial additional surprise on   productivity We have revised up our estimate of the level of structural productivity for 2002    And we continue to believe that some of this improvement is likely to fade away as business   caution begins to erode But more of it is going to persist than we thought at the time of the last   forecast We’re still nervous about whether we’ve underdone it in terms of revising up the   growth rate of potential output going forward  That is something we plan to reevaluate before   the next meeting, with a bit more data in hand, to see where we are  We typically make   more-significant revisions in our supply-side forecast at the January meeting—and at the August   meeting after we get the annual revisions—so we expect to look at that further  But the pattern   that we’re seeing still appears to be one where we are being surprised by the weakness of overall   employment and by the strength of overall productivity  We’ve interpreted that partly as   indicating that firms are able to extract more out of their given resource base, at least for a time,   and we view some of it as true structural productivity               December 10, 2002 17 of 87   No, but I do think there are some reasons for being a bit cautious   when we get sharp moves  There is a question as to whether the accounting system is in fact   completely frictionless  I’m not sure     It’s not just a one-quarter phenomenon  Obviously, we’ve had a year   now of absolutely spectacular productivity growth    Just to remind you, we did see a pattern of quite strong productivity   growth in the early 1990s that played out before the acceleration in the expansion got going  We   saw a surge in the early 1990s that one also could have interpreted as an acceleration of   underlying productivity, which turned out later not to have occurred  So I think we have a little   statistical support for a pattern similar to what we saw at that time  But I would say that the risks   clearly are more to the upside than to the downside on this aspect of our projection  And we   tried in the alternative simulations to give you a sense of how important that might be going   forward    In terms of the relative contribution of the shocks we built into this   scenario from wages and prices and from the weakness in aggregate demand, it’s roughly half   and half You can see that to some extent by taking a look at the numbers in the recession   scenario, which in essence has just the weakness in demand  That gets real GDP in 2004 down   from the baseline of 13 percent to 09 percent  It goes down another ½ percentage point in the         December 10, 2002 19 of 87  deflation scenario when we incorporate the additional shocks to wages and prices  Now in some    sense, that’s just a matter of how we constructed that deflation scenario  I think the important   point is that it takes a combination of shocks to put us there Obviously, we could have a huge   recession—a three standard deviation type of event on wages or prices—and perhaps get there    But essentially the model doesn’t want to push the economy into deflation without combining a   number of these different kinds of shocks  A combination of shocks is necessary in order to get   a persistent deflation   As for the way the deflation affects output, I think the principal channel through which it   operates in the model is the real interest rate  I should be very clear that this alternative scenario   we’re showing is probably not the deflation scenario you would be most worried about  The   latter is a situation where we get into a deflation and you had already lowered the federal funds   rate to zero and couldn’t use conventional monetary policy anymore to pull the economy out of   recession We’ve done some stochastic simulations to calculate the probability of that type of   deflation scenario, and the model suggests that it is less than 10 percent—something like 8 or   9 percent If we calculate the probability of a deflation by allowing shocks to everything—   aggregate demand, productivity, the wage and price equations—the probability is much higher,   more on the order of one-third But that would not necessarily involve the kind of   macroeconomic situation that would create significant difficulties for you because in many of   those simulations you would still have some scope to lower the federal funds rate to try to reduce   the real interest rate and pull the economy out of that situation    Not of the dimensions that we built into this scenario  Again, we   could construct all sorts of simulations; we could give the model any kind of shock we wished    But in terms of the type of shock we gave it in this simulation, it would not be sufficient to push   us into deflation    Not in the way that this model is constructed  The zero bound on   nominal interest rates, in essence, is the place where the deflation begins to get its own traction   in this model  Obviously, many of the things one might worry about accompanying a deflation   are not features that are easily modeled in the context of our FRB/US model  The various kinds   of financial stress and strains that might begin to develop—types of balance sheet problems—are   treated only very rudimentarily in the model  I would be hesitant to use our model to analyze a   deflationary economy, given that its equations have been estimated on a postwar period in which,   on average, those kinds of problems really haven’t been embedded in the data  So our ability to   estimate the effects of deflation very precisely is going to be relatively small    As you’re well aware, President Broaddus, multifactor productivity   is in essence a residual It measures everything that we don’t really understand about   productivity In extrapolating it, we use various procedures involving statistical filters to try to   ascertain the underlying trend And those statistical filters generally make us feel reasonably   comfortable with the kind of figures we’ve written down here  As I indicated earlier, I think   there are risks on both sides  I see the risks more to the upside than to the downside in this   particular aspect of our forecast, given the issues that President Poole was raising  Our statistical   filters in a sense want to down weight some of the more recent observations; those data haven’t   been through an annual revision yet So there are some reasons for being relatively conservative,   as we have been in our forecast  But the recent performance of productivity has been absolutely   spectacular We are nervous about putting in a lot more productivity growth than we’ve shown,   in part because those same statistical filters, as I indicated earlier, over-interpreted the pickup   that we got in the early 1990s immediately coming out of that recession  They showed more of   that pickup in trend productivity than ultimately turned out to be the case  So I think we need to   be careful about getting head-faked by the last year’s data, given the rather extraordinary   circumstances of the period  But in terms of being able to model underlying technical progress   or organizational efficiencies—the kinds of things that actually go into productivity—we just   don’t have a very good handle on how to measure them     Well, when we first started calculating those probabilities earlier this   fall, I think we were struck as well by how large they were  Again, one could imagine a situation   in which we were getting beneficial shocks to wages and prices and faster productivity growth—   scenarios where those developments were the principal drivers in a period of declining prices    But from a policy perspective, deflation probably distorts—just as inflation does—relative price   signals and the tax system Even with what I would term a relatively benign deflation we’d have   those kinds of effects, so there would be some negatives associated with that  As I indicated to   President Moskow, the more serious concern is ending up in a Japanese-style deflation with   these shocks leading us to zero inflation and with aggregate demand being weak enough that the   Committee had already lowered the funds rate to zero  That scenario has a lower probability    Still, I think one would have to admit that an 8 to 9 percent probability of that outcome is pretty   high, too Obviously, those confidence intervals reflect the fact that there is a lot of uncertainty   in the outlook            December 10, 2002 23 of 87   That’s right  Certainly, if we created 5,000 stochastic runs of the   model to calculate the probabilities, within the 28 percent of cases with deflation there would be   many instances in which the deflation was relatively benign  Those would be instances where   the deflation was caused by faster productivity growth or beneficial shocks to wage and price   setting, with what I would perceive to be less serious consequences for monetary policy    They are from 1970 on, which includes the high volatility period of   the 1970s    Yes, the volatility is much smaller, and indeed the probabilities are   affected by that That’s one of the issues we debated among ourselves in our discussions about   how to present the results We debated whether it was better to show the results using the post­  1983 period as opposed to the post-1970 period  We thought there were some reasonable   arguments in favor of showing the results using only the post-1983 period, but we concluded that   in a sense that might be considered cheating in terms of conveying to you the degree of our   uncertainty However, it is something we are looking at  We don’t know if what we’ve had in   the past twenty years is good luck or if there has been a regime change in how those shocks are   generated We’re trying to see if something has changed to make those shocks smaller               December 10, 2002 24 of 87   To tell you the truth, I don’t recall offhand exactly what the numbers   were, but we’ve done that calculation, and we can certainly circulate them to the Committee    I’d be happy to do that    Indeed, we do see obvious risks associated with that piece of the   forecast But our general outlook is that we will begin to see some overall acceleration of   activity and incomes, so we’re going to get help for the state and local sector from a couple of   different directions One is improving tax bases over the next year  Also, lower interest rates are   certainly helping both the financial condition of state and local governments and their ability to   tap capital markets—as they apparently have done—in order to maintain a number of their   spending programs  And while many states have run through their rainy day funds, there is still         December 10, 2002 25 of 87  some margin to shift funds from there as well  Still, as we look at our 2003 forecast relative to   the trends of the last decade or so, those figures are relatively weak  But we think overall that   some of the intense pressures that sector is feeling right now will probably be alleviated over the   next year Nevertheless, the state and local sector is clearly a downside risk relative to the   federal side, where we see more upside risk    And, as you know, a number of the policy proposals that have been   talked about use the federal government to provide some fiscal relief for state and local   governments  The Administration has not signed on to that idea at all yet    Yes, but there is certainly some pressure in that direction    Just to remind you, we have a higher estimate of potential output,   too, than most other forecasts    That does not explain all of the difference, but it does account for at   least a few tenths of it  "
6987,2002-12-10," Well, in writing down the policy assumption for the purpose of the   Greenbook forecast, I’m not sure I would choose a path that would be considered optimal, so to   speak If you gave me your objective function, including your objectives for both inflation and   the outlook gap and your sensitivity response, I’d be happy to use that for the purpose of the   baseline Greenbook forecast I don’t do that because I don’t know your objective function and I   don’t necessarily want to inject the staff’s view directly into your current policy deliberation by   making it appear as if we are coming to you with a policy recommendation at each meeting  So   in some sense we’re trying to distance ourselves a bit from the issues that you’re going to have to   debate rather than be seen as advocates of a particular policy    That certainly does not leave us off the hook; we have to put down   something as a policy assumption  So what do we do?  Where I think the Greenbook baseline   path for the funds rate delivers a policy forecast is that our baseline forecast puts the economy on   a path to getting the unemployment rate back to the natural rate  And in the extended forecast,   we get inflation down to about 1¼ percent We do it, obviously, with a different trajectory or   different timing of policy—with a little more tightness relative to the optimal path in the near   term and a little more looseness relative to that optimal path over the longer term  But that   forecast is still not inconsistent with arriving at some rough equilibrium out there four or five   years down the road    Again, from my perspective it’s more a political issue than an   economic one because I would not like to sit here at each meeting and tell you that a particular   policy is the optimal one  I don’t believe it’s the staff’s role to say that you should be cutting the   funds rate 25 or 50 basis points, or that you ought to be doing that in three or four steps, or that   you ought to raise it by a certain amount  But I think the Greenbook forecast is useful because it   is not delivering a result that is significantly at odds with what I perceive to be, roughly   speaking, your longer-term policy objectives   In terms of what would happen if we were to pursue this optimal path, the markets clearly   are not building in expectations of something that looks like that path  If anything, as I indicated   in my remarks, they’re expecting more tightening  So in our forecast when you don’t tighten to   the extent that the markets currently anticipate as we move into the second half of next year and   2004, that produces some rally in the bond markets  When the markets see that the economy   does not necessarily need that tightening—and they see you are not doing it—they are going to   revise down their path for the future expected funds rate  I don’t think these actions somehow   result in a downward revision in the markets’ view, relative to current expectations, about what   your longer-run inflation objective is So that’s a long-winded explanation of why it is that we   don’t use that so-called optimal path as the baseline for the projection   I would just say, however, that I’m open to suggestions  Obviously, we are trying to   produce something that is useful for your deliberations  But if I were required to produce a   forecast that involved taking a strong stand on exactly what the Committee’s objective function   looks like, that would be a task fraught with difficulty for me    "
7051,2003-01-28,"  President Minehan, one thing that makes the kind of decomposition   you’re suggesting especially difficult to do is that, if geopolitical risks actually have affected   business decisions on hiring and production, then some of what appears to be a response to weak   employment and production data is indirectly a response to the fallout from the geopolitical   risks   "
7052,2003-01-28,"  Obviously, from a broader perspective, one can say that there are   some downside risks associated with the consumer sector  We are expecting a very weak labor   market over the first part of the year  There are already some signs of concern in the household   sector, and those concerns could be compounded by a continuing rise in the unemployment rate   and lack of any perceptible growth in payroll employment  On top of that is the fact that we   think households are still in the process of adjusting to the hit that their balance sheet has taken    On our forecast of a relatively benign stock market going forward, we see some stabilization of   wealth to income, so we’re expecting the effects of that hit to wane  But it still would have to   constitute a downside risk     January 28-29, 2003 97 of 195    Apropos of our discussion yesterday regarding model uncertainty in policy, it’s clear that   if we get into a situation where the economy is beginning to improve and interest rates are rising,   some of the ameliorative effects of low interest rates on consumer debt burdens will begin to   wane  But that might just mean that we’ll need less of an increase in interest rates to produce the   kind of restraint ultimately desired and not necessarily that it would trigger a contraction in the   household sector  That suggests that you may be confronted with not knowing exactly how big a   reaction you will get in terms of aggregate demand from the rise in interest rates that ultimately   may be necessary  That will be a question you’ll have to face in determining your policy   response     President Poole, we also think that it’s probably an indication that the   very modest improvement we believe is occurring in industrial production is in fact happening    In some sense, I think it reflects more than just the dollar effect  Our sense is that it’s also   signaling that the softness we saw in industrial production earlier in the fall has probably abated   some and that these prices have become relatively firm  They are reasonably well correlated   with industrial activity     Actually, on the fiscal policy side, I see the risks as more to the   upside than the downside  We’ve built in less stimulus than the Democrats have proposed and   less than the Administration has proposed  If our forecast is correct, we will have an economy in   which the unemployment rate is going to be rising  In that circumstance, I believe there’s a   considerable possibility that we could get a significant further dose of fiscal stimulus  So I think   there are upside risks associated with that     On the structural productivity issue, I would just mention—as exotic as this might look—  that our statistical filtering models actually would want to put in even more growth than we did,   based on the course of productivity over the past year  Now, those models were fooled in the   early 1990s when the growth of productivity picked up, a development they interpreted as a   bigger step-up in structural productivity than in fact turned out to be the case  Indeed, much of   that step-up proved to be cyclical  So we feel quite comfortable that we have discounted that   evidence  But I think there are risks on both sides of that     I’d say one other thing, too, which is that looking at the forecast and the risks associated   with it simply in terms of the GDP growth rate is not the only way to look at it  We revised up   both the supply side and the demand side in this forecast  In fact, this is a projection in which the   GDP gap is larger than before  There is more slack implicit in the economy over the next two   years than we had in the forecast last time; we show a higher unemployment rate and a larger   January 28-29, 2003 102 of 195    GDP gap  So it would be wrong to think about this as just a story of strength  One could look at   it the other way around and say that this is a story of some additional slack, in part because we   think there will be productivity gains in the short run that will lead to this higher unemployment   rate  So in that regard there are risks on both sides of this   Again, as I think we tried to make clear in the Greenbook, we recognize that in this   outlook there’s a lot of tension between the near-term weakness that we can actually measure   and the strength that we’re showing in the second half of the year  That pickup requires a lot of   things to happen in the same direction in the second half of this year—dissipation of the   pessimism, a big dose of fiscal stimulus, and a reduction in the wealth effects that we think   currently are exerting a drag on the economy  It would be hard for us to know whether all those   things would be concentrated in the beginning of the second half, around midyear, or whether   some would occur later  Some could be accelerated and others stretched out to produce a   forecast that may have as much growth over the next two years on net, but it may be distributed   differently—either significantly delayed or pulled forward  There’s not a lot of evidence to go   on, in part because we’re so unsure about the lifting of the uncertainty and gloom  We’re talking   here about when and to what extent a residual—that is, what we don’t know about in the   investment area over the last couple of years—goes away  We face considerable risks there in   both timing and magnitude       We just don’t have a lot of science that we can bring to bear here     "
7105,2003-03-18,"  We faced some rather considerable challenges in assembling  this forecast—the largest one, of course, being to find a way to be helpful to you in  setting monetary policy in a period when the probability of imminent military conflict  with Iraq has become very high  Early last fall, the Chairman commenced one of our  pre-FOMC briefing sessions by asking whether the Greenbook forecast was ignoring  the elephant in the room—the elephant being the potential for war  We responded  that we were well aware of that possibility  But we believed that a forecast  constructed to take explicit account of military conflict would focus attention on areas  about which we knew very little and would distract us from providing you with our  interpretation of incoming data and the underlying forces operating on the economy   Still, we recognized then that, by incorporating developments in oil futures and  financial markets, our forecast was, in effect, reflecting the evolving likelihood of  military action in Iraq     Well, in this forecast, the room has become very small and the elephant very   large  As you know, we opted for an approach that we think preserves maximum  continuity with recent forecasts  We have continued to take on board the path of oil  prices implied by futures markets, current readings in financial markets, and recent  measures of consumer sentiment  These indicators, of course, embody a probability- weighted average of a wide range of possible outcomes, reflecting the collective  judgment of market participants and survey respondents  At this point, it seems safe  to presume that they place a very substantial weight on an imminent war  As events  unfold in the coming days and weeks, readings on many variables conditioning our  baseline forecast will shift, as outcomes currently embodied in that probability- weighted distribution become more or less likely  Oil prices, equity values, and  sentiment are almost certainly going to deviate—perhaps substantially—from the  paths assumed in the forecast  We attempted to give you a sense in the Greenbook of  those factors on which we will be most focused and some rough quantitative  assessment of the sensitivity of the forecast to movements in those variables     At this point, you probably need little convincing that we don’t know what will   happen in the weeks ahead with respect to conflict with Iraq or its economic  consequences  But, you may reasonably ask, what are the economic data and  financial market developments of the past seven weeks telling us about the underlying  condition of the US economy as we head into this critical period?  If anyone’s hopes  have risen momentarily that I will answer that question clearly, let me admit up front  that I cannot  A quick look at the top line of our forecast might suggest that we have  learned a great deal about the economy and that what we’ve learned has been  decidedly negative  After all, we’ve revised down projected growth in the first half of  this year to about 2¼ percent at an annual rate, about ½ percentage point less than in  our January forecast  But in point of fact, owing to an upward revision to growth in  the fourth quarter of last year, the level of real GDP is actually higher, on average, in  the first half of this year than in our last forecast  One of the key surprises in the  incoming data was that inventories were not as lean in the fourth quarter of last year  as we had thought  Higher inventory investment accounts for all the 1¼ percentage  point upward adjustment to the growth of real GDP last quarter; final sales were   March 18, 2003 11 of 101    about unrevised  With that stockbuilding already behind us, we see less upward  impetus to activity from this source in the first half of this year  Indeed, a smaller  contribution from non-auto inventories more than accounts for the downward revision  that we have made to our projection of activity in the first half of this year     The recent data on spending, labor markets, and production have presented the   usual mixed bag  For the most part, the strength in spending that was apparent late  last year carried into January  To be sure, sales of new motor vehicles in January  dropped off from the very high level observed in December, but other consumer  outlays advanced at a rapid clip  Housing activity—both sales and construction— jumped to very high levels, aided by good weather and very favorable financing  conditions  In the business sector, orders and shipments of capital goods in January  exceeded our expectations, with spending for high-tech equipment posting an  especially sharp rise  But the picture in February and into March was not nearly so  bright  Motor vehicle sales posted another steep decline last month  Snowstorms in  the East evidently clobbered sales in late February, but reports for early March  suggest that there has been only a modest bounceback so far  Faced with sagging  sales and mounting inventories, vehicle makers have announced significant cutbacks  in production in the second quarter—a sign that they, too, are concerned about some  underlying weakness in demand  Retail sales apart from motor vehicles declined last  month as well, and this morning’s housing starts release—which showed single- family starts off nearly 14 percent, to 13 million units in February—can be added to  the list of downbeat indicators for that month     Readings on the labor market and industrial activity also worsened in February   and have shown little sign of improvement this month  We were especially struck by  the widespread weakness implied by last month’s labor market report  Private  payrolls contracted by 321,000 in February  No doubt, bad weather contributed to the  declines in construction employment, and the call-up of reservists likely crimped  payrolls more broadly  But try as we might, we could find no silver lining in  February’s employment situation  Our January forecast was built on the assumption  that employment would be about flat early this year; instead, job losses have averaged  about 100,000 over the past three months  Industrial production is also coming in  below our earlier expectations  Declines late last year now look to be larger than  previously estimated, and factory output is expected to eke out a much smaller gain  this quarter than we had projected in January  Although the declines in production  witnessed last fall seem to have abated, there appears to be little upward momentum  to manufacturing activity  That view is supported by the available purchasing  surveys, which have recently retraced earlier gains     It is, of course, exceedingly difficult, if not impossible, to determine whether this   most recent softening in the data reflects underlying weakness in the economy or the  intensifying effects of war-related fears and uncertainties  Virtually all our major  economic indicators at this point could be directly or indirectly influenced by actions  or expectations related to the possibility of war  Is consumer confidence low because  of higher war-related energy prices or because the labor market is so soft?  Is the   March 18, 2003 12 of 101    labor market soft because firms are hesitant to hire in advance of an imminent war or  because product demand is weak?  I don’t know of any way to confidently break into  that argument  Moreover, I don’t think this is a signal extraction problem faced  solely by the staff and other economic forecasters  I seriously doubt that households  and businesses can reliably disentangle underlying economic trends from effects  related to possible military conflict  Suffice it to say that, whatever the fundamental  causes, the staff sees the economy on a somewhat shallower trajectory than we had  earlier expected     Moreover, a number of other factors led us to mark down a bit our projected   growth of real GDP over the next year and a half  For one, stock prices at the close of  the Greenbook were about 10 percent below those anticipated in our previous  forecast, and we lowered our projected path by a similar amount  The effect of lower  equity prices was only partly offset by the accompanying downward revision that we  have made to long-term interest rates  I should note, however, that the rise in equity  markets since we closed the forecast, if sustained, would, all else being equal, lead us  to add back in much of the final demand we had taken out of the forecast  Higher  current and projected oil prices, especially over the next few quarters, are expected to  take a larger bite out of household incomes than in the January projection  Perhaps  reflecting to some extent higher energy prices, consumer sentiment has weakened  noticeably since the end of last year  Consumers’ views of their own financial  conditions, broader business conditions, buying conditions, and the labor market  situation have all deteriorated noticeably in recent months  Sentiment has dropped by  more than can be explained by macroeconomic conditions, and in the forecast we  expect this unusual weakness in household attitudes and their effect on consumption  to fade only gradually over the next year and a half     Not all of the key forces operating on the economy have been negative  Fiscal   policy, in particular, is providing more upward stimulus to activity than in our  previous projection  We have defense spending ramping up more sharply in this  forecast compared with the last  We have added about $20 billion to projected  defense spending in both 2003 and 2004  Separately, we have retained the package of  tax cuts assumed in the January forecast, though we have delayed its projected  implementation to the third quarter of this year  Meanwhile, tax receipts have been  coming in much lower than we had expected, largely reflecting another year of  unexpectedly large refunds  Smaller tax payments are providing a noticeable buffer  against weaker labor income in this forecast and help to sustain the projected growth  in consumer spending     Despite the small net downward revision that we have made to the projection, we   continue to expect a gradual acceleration of activity in the second half of this year and  into 2004 for reasons that will sound quite familiar to you  Stimulative monetary and  fiscal policy contribute to the pickup, as does a gradual diminishment of the drag  from earlier declines in the stock market  Productivity growth shows no signs of  flagging and should feed gains in both household incomes and corporate profits   Finally, we expect the unusual restraint on household and business spending, which   March 18, 2003 13 of 101    we are attributing in part to pessimism and uncertainty, to fade over the projection  interval  As has been the case for some time, this feature of the forecast must be  considered more art than science  Even as art, I’ll admit it’s closer to Jackson Pollock  than to Rembrandt  [Laughter]  With slack in resource utilization persisting  throughout the forecast period, core inflation is expected to recede modestly in 2003  and 2004  Indeed, core PCE price inflation drops to 1 percent in the second half of  next year     In working on this forecast, we—perhaps like many others in the economy—have   felt as if we were biding our time, waiting for events to unfold and the situation to  clarify itself  But how much clarification of economic circumstances can be  expected?  Certainly, a quick and successful resolution of the conflict with Iraq could  be followed by a sharp decline in oil prices and a jump in equity values  Household  and business sentiment could improve swiftly and persistently  With just a short lag,  some high-frequency readings on the economy might provide evidence of follow- through to the real economy; initial claims, chain store sales, and reports from  automakers would provide the early evidence on that score  With luck, those  readings would be confirmed by broader monthly measures of spending, production,  and labor market conditions  While it is less pleasant to contemplate, circumstances  could clearly indicate a much less favorable outcome  The use of weapons of mass  destruction, substantial damage to the oil fields, or slow military progress could result  in sizable adverse reactions in oil and financial markets and a further souring of  sentiment  The consequences of these developments could be reflected clearly in the  flow of data on the real economy  In either event, a significant narrowing of  uncertainties would allow us to get a much better fix on macroeconomic conditions  and provide you with clearer direction on the appropriate setting of monetary policy     But a third possibility seems eminently plausible—namely, that there will not be   in the months immediately ahead a dramatic shrinkage in the uncertainty surrounding  underlying economic conditions  There are a number of reasons for suspecting that  this might be the case  Under the best of circumstances, financial markets will be  volatile, and the data on the economy will be both noisy and often available with only  a frustrating lag  It could take months to detect the economic consequences of the  events that will unfold in the period ahead  Moreover, the best of circumstances may  not present themselves  Even if the military situation concludes as quickly and  successfully as it did in 1991, broader geopolitical risks may linger in a way that they  did not after the earlier Gulf War  The threat of terrorist responses may not decline  and could conceivably increase even in the wake of a successful military campaign   As a consequence, the current hesitance to spend and hire may not diminish rapidly   Moreover, there have been additional sources of geopolitical tension in recent  months—North Korea and Iran, to name just two  We will need to be watchful of  euphoric reactions in financial markets and among households and businesses  Those  initial readings may signal a more vigorous rebound from recent doldrums, but that  enthusiasm could prove unjustified over time by the underlying fundamentals  If so,  the favorable initial reaction signaled by asset prices and sentiment would fade     March 18, 2003 14 of 101    Finally, there could be a real economic bounce following the successful  conclusion of a war  Some firms might act on spending and hiring plans that were  delayed by war fears  Households, too, may boost spending that had been deferred by  worries about war and the accompanying high levels of prices for gasoline and  heating fuel  Witnessing such a rebound, however, will provide no assurance that the  economy is moving onto a more persistently vigorous growth path  If the underlying  health of the economy remains lackluster, a temporary period of above-trend growth  could give way, yet again, to subpar performance  In effect, circumstances might be  similar to a year ago  As the worst case scenarios following the attacks of September  11 failed to materialize, we saw a rapid acceleration of activity that could not be  sustained by the underlying condition of the economy  I don’t want to exaggerate in  either direction here  Clearly, we’re likely to know a great deal more than we do now  should a swift and successful military action be completed in the period ahead  But I  suspect that, even in those circumstances, you will see only a partial lifting of the fog  of uncertainty that currently shrouds the economic outlook  Karen Johnson will now  continue our presentation       Obviously that remains a political forecast, and it’s an assumption   that I can’t say we hold with enormous conviction  I would point out that the magnitude of the   tax cut that we have built into this forecast is close to the figures around which the moderates in   the House and Senate are coalescing  That doesn’t necessarily add to its credibility; it merely   indicates that it is a magnitude that is still being discussed actively  I would point out that we   had built in a sizable fiscal stimulus package in December 2001, when the prospects for the   economy looked quite bleak  We took that out of our projection in January of last year, when the   political bubbling around that type of package had simmered down significantly  Then within   three weeks the Congress passed a stimulus package that was almost exactly what we had   projected originally  So it’s awfully hard to know what will happen on the fiscal side  I’m not   even sure how the progress of the war would add to or subtract from the probability that the   package would be implemented  I can see arguments on either side     Now, in terms of its consequences for the projection, it’s a noticeable plus to disposable   income and therefore helps to sustain the growth in consumer spending  So it plays a very   important role in the second half pickup that we’re projecting  If we were to take that out of the   forecast, we would probably still be showing some underlying acceleration in activity, in part   because of these other imponderables such as an overall improvement in household and business   March 18, 2003 18 of 101    sentiment  But economic growth would be slower than in this forecast  I do think it’s an   important factor in supporting disposable income in the projection     There are a few reasons that we think that by 2004 we will see   reasonably robust gains in consumer durable spending  One is the overall interest rate   environment in this forecast, which I think is generally more favorable than in the consensus   forecast  We have built in no increase in the federal funds rate through the end of 2004 and we   have—      There’s a little drifting up in Treasury rates, which is offset in our   view by a compression of private spreads as the overall economy improves  Two, we’re   expecting the relative price of durable goods to continue to decline and to decline quite rapidly   In essence, we think the user cost of purchasing those goods will be relatively low  Three, it’s   also a reflection of our estimate for potential output growth, which is still obviously to the high   side of the consensus forecast  I think that helps to sustain overall growth in household incomes   March 18, 2003 19 of 101    as well as in corporate profits and therefore provides some boost  So we believe there are logical   fundamentals for why consumer durables spending should increase  I must say on the housing   side that we also have very favorable mortgage interest rates  That could be a little on the   optimistic side in light of this morning’s data release and a few readings recently of just a bit   more softness there  I’m not so sure, had we had all of that information before we did our   forecast, that we would have been quite so optimistic on the housing investment side     Our basic thinking has been that one needs to resort to a supposition   of reasonably strong multifactor productivity to explain the incredible strength in labor   productivity that we’ve had over the past two years  If anything, our straightforward statistical   filtering models would want to put in more multifactor productivity growth than we’ve written   down in this forecast  Now, obviously this involves some fairly big risks  Maybe this   productivity improvement in the last year and a half will turn out to have been, in essence, some   significant cyclical rise in productivity, as firms are squeezing harder on their productive   facilities and on their workers to eke out more productivity gains  As you know, in the initial   phase of this more recent acceleration of productivity, that was generally the story that we   bought into  But we’ve been beaten down by the data quarter after quarter, suggesting that we   March 18, 2003 20 of 101    have to give a little weight in this forecast—and we have—to the possibility that multifactor   productivity has continued to improve  We have it at roughly 1½ percentage points, which by   the historical standards of the past 100 years is not an especially large figure     I think you’re right, though  Obviously, if whatever is holding back   investment spending were to persist longer than we have projected in this forecast, it would be   harder in some sense to embody technological improvements going forward  That could have   some follow-through effects on multifactor productivity as well     Well, you’re right that I’m not going to concede that point   immediately  [Laughter]  In fact, one of the things that we did in preparation for this forecast   was to look at some of what we call good case and bad case scenarios  As you know, our   forecast is not based on all the good things that would necessarily follow from a quick resolution   of the conflict because the probability distribution that the forecast is predicated upon includes   some negative outcomes  So suppose in the next few weeks we do have a swift and successful   completion of the military campaign  Oil prices could tumble and perhaps tumble considerably   in the near term—and even in the longer term based on what the futures markets are currently   expecting  We could get a much sharper and more immediate snapback in consumer and   business confidence  We have built in a gradual rebound in confidence  In the case of   households, the hit on confidence that we’ve seen doesn’t erode until sometime next year, and on   the business spending side that does not occur until the end of this year  Suppose that happened   more immediately  One could easily envision—maybe we’ve already seen it to some extent—a   pop in equity markets and some of the risks that were weighing on markets going away  We fed   those types of assumptions into the model, and it was easy to get an extra percentage point on   GDP by the end of 2004 and ½ percentage point less on the unemployment rate  So I think there   is a probability mass on the upside   Now, there are some obvious and rather significant risks to the downside as well, and I   hope I hinted at them in my remarks  Certainly, one could envision all sorts of bad outcomes in   March 18, 2003 22 of 101    Iraq  But even putting aside those risks, a chunk of this forecast relies on an improvement in   investment spending—essentially whatever has been depressing investment spending goes away    There is not a lot of science one can bring to bear on that, so there are downside risks associated   with that forecast  We saw a pattern of strength around the turn of the year followed by   weakness, but it is hard to do a signal extraction from that  The recent data have been quite soft,   and we see nothing yet in the data that hints at the acceleration in activity that we’re forecasting    It looks to us as if the economy is just continuing to move along at this subpar baseline rate of   growth, but we don’t see many signs that things are falling apart either  So if you were hoping to   pin some of our forecast on developments that we actually are able to put our fingers on, we   can’t do that  It still involves more forecast than anything apparent in the direct economic   readings     Our best guess is that we still have a little way to go on the saving   rate, but not a lot further, in response to the deterioration that has occurred in household balance   sheets  We have models that put the saving rate anywhere between 5 and 7 percent in the long   run, but I think somewhere around 6 percent or just north of that is probably the right territory    March 18, 2003 23 of 101    The question is how do we get there?  Second, could we get there more rapidly than we have   projected?  Obviously, the answer to the second question is “yes, we could”  But I do not see   that as much of a concern  Households have been subjected to a number of very significant   shocks over the last couple of years—the substantial decline in the stock market, the recession,   and the terrorist attacks—and none of them seemed to result in a pullback on the spending side, a   big increase in precautionary saving  The combination of all of those developments didn’t seem   to produce an unusual jump in the saving rate  Given the uncertainty that people are facing in   the events ahead of us, maybe we will see a pickup in the saving rate  But I don’t quite see that   happening exogenously  In many respects I’d say that consumption has followed our model   quite closely, which suggests a considerable lag in the adjustment of household spending to   deterioration in consumer balance sheets  So I think it’s a risk but not one that I’d put at the top   of the list of risks that we’re facing  But obviously, going forward, one could picture events that   could engender the kind of fear or concern on the part of households that could produce a higher   rate of precautionary saving  That matters a lot in our forecast  If we were to get a significant   step-up in the saving rate relative to our baseline forecast, that would weigh very heavily on the   outlook going forward     We’ve heard those reports as well  I’m not quite sure how that   would net out or quantitatively how significant it would be at this point   "
7154,2003-05-06,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  There has clearly been a  narrowing of uncertainties surrounding the outlook as well as a considerable amount  of good news for the economy since the March Greenbook was completed  The  successful and expeditious completion of the war in Iraq has alleviated some of the  pressing concerns that had been weighing on participants in the energy and financial  markets  Indeed, with OPEC production higher, remarkably little damage to oil fields  in Iraq and, as yet, few signs of negative political spillovers elsewhere in the region,  oil prices have tumbled  The spot price of West Texas Intermediate crude oil is  expected to average about $9 per barrel lower in the current quarter than we had  anticipated in our previous forecast     In financial markets, stock prices began to move noticeably higher just as we were   completing our March projection  The lifting of war-related uncertainties and the  better-than-expected earnings reports for the first quarter boosted equity prices about  13 percent above the level assumed in our last projection  Risk spreads on corporate  bonds have narrowed as well, especially for lower-tier firms  Households too seem to  be feeling better  Consumer confidence has rebounded in recent weeks, retracing  much of the decline that had occurred since last fall  Finally, one of the key upside  risks to the projection that we had highlighted earlier appears to have materialized, as  the defense spending implied by the recently enacted supplemental is considerably  more than we had incorporated in our previous projection     So with all of that apparent good news, our forecast might come as something of a   disappointment  We have revised down the growth of real GDP throughout 2003,  and the 28 percent increase projected for the year is nearly ½ percentage point less  than in the March Greenbook  To be sure, greater stimulus from the factors that I just  mentioned does produce more-rapid growth next year  But even with the sharper  pickup in activity that eventually develops in our forecast, the level of real GDP is  lower and the GDP gap higher, on average, in 2004 than in our previous projection     Our principal motivation for this downward revision has been a fairly steady   drumbeat of negative news on the real economy  To start, the spending data have  been coming in somewhat weaker than we had anticipated in March  Consumption  and investment taken together rose just 1½ percent at an annual rate in the first  quarter, more than ¼ percentage point slower than in our last projection  Moreover,  at least in the household sector, we aren’t entering the second quarter with much  momentum  Outside of motor vehicles, consumer spending has been relatively flat in  recent months  Sales of new motor vehicles improved to 164 million units at an  annual rate in April, up from a 16 million unit pace in March  But that incentive- stimulated increase was aimed at alleviating the inventory problems that had  developed this winter, and the cutbacks in production scheduled by the manufacturers  will continue to be a drag on aggregate activity in the current quarter  Moreover, our   May 6, 2003 10 of 115    business contacts in this industry report that the response to the recent boost to  incentives has, if anything, been disappointing  Housing activity has not been as  buoyant as we had expected  Starts and permits have had a softer tone, and we now  expect a flattening out in this sector in coming months instead of modest gains     Business spending also has presented some downside surprises  On net, the   readings on orders and shipments of capital goods in February and March were below  those anticipated in our previous forecast  In the high-tech area, outlays for  communications equipment have shown notable strength of late, but computer  spending is growing less vigorously than we had expected  Outside of high-tech, a  projected increase in current-quarter equipment spending does not appear sufficient to  reverse a now larger estimated decline in the first quarter     The mildly negative innovations in the spending data, taken by themselves, would   not have justified the size of the downward adjustments that we have made to private  demand for the remainder of the year  Our thinking about the underlying strength of  the economy was more heavily influenced by the surprisingly weak recent readings  on the labor market and industrial activity  Private payrolls have been contracting at  an average monthly rate of 85,000 since the turn of the year, and with initial claims  for unemployment insurance averaging close to 450,000 in recent weeks, there are  few signs that businesses have, as yet, stopped shedding workers  Moreover, the  employment decline and the sharp drop in the workweek in April point to another  contraction in hours worked this quarter  Perhaps this is more good news on  productivity—and quite likely it is  But I don’t think that’s the whole story  We are  now expecting a decline in total industrial production of ½ percent in April and a drop  in the manufacturing component of about ¾ percent  Activity in the factory sector  has generally been contracting since the fall  That weak picture seems to line up very  well with negative readings from purchasing managers and the continuing downbeat  tenor of the reports that we have received from business contacts     It is, of course, possible that we have overreacted to the incoming data  I should   stress that we are still working with readings on the economy that, for the most part,  were taken before or during the war  We have interpreted the greater weakness in  that information as suggesting that underlying activity has been softer than we had  earlier estimated  But we can’t confidently rule out that the war-related restraints on  the economy were more intense than we have been allowing for  Beyond the  readings from commodity and financial markets, we still know very little about the  postwar economy  In brief, we have received more favorable readings on consumer  confidence and chain-store sales and less favorable readings from initial claims     As I noted at the outset, defense spending is one element of final demand that is   likely to be considerably stronger than was anticipated in our previous forecast   Indeed, our projected increase in outlays for defense now accounts for more than half  of the GDP growth that we are projecting for the current quarter  That made us  nervous enough to canvas our brothers and sisters in the forecasting community, both  inside and outside government  We got pretty much the same answer from   May 6, 2003 11 of 115    everybody “Gee, that’s interesting; we haven’t really thought much about it yet”   Armed with that helpful guidance, we tried our best to steer a balanced course  To  the upside of our forecast, the CBO is estimating noticeably higher defense spending  for fiscal year 2003 than we have incorporated in this forecast  With only two  quarters remaining in the fiscal year, their figures imply some whopping increases in  Q2 and Q3  To the downside, OMB’s latest take on Iraq-related defense spending is  about as far below our forecast as CBO’s is above  But even the OMB figure is  consistent with a somewhat faster spendout of recently enacted budget authority than  was observed after the Gulf War  The bottom line is that the confidence interval  around this feature of our forecast is very wide     Although our revisions to private and government spending, on net, resulted in   somewhat slower growth in real GDP, we continue to show growth picking up in the  second half  The basic logic of that forecast remains the same as in the last  Greenbook—forces are in place that will work in concert to produce a pickup in real  activity over the second half of this year  Accommodative monetary policy, another  dose of fiscal stimulus, waning negative wealth effects, improving consumer and  business confidence, and lean inventories are the key ingredients in our forecast of  reacceleration in spending and production     Vincent remarked to me after the last meeting that President Minehan’s   description of all the things that had to go just right to get the staff forecast had made  me sound a bit like the guy on the Ed Sullivan show who would come out and start  spinning ever greater numbers of plates on the end of sticks  As more plates were  added to the mix, each one had to be spun with precision and speed to maintain the  balance of the entire delicate construction  While I am reluctant to endorse this  characterization of the forecast, I will admit that my arms have been getting a bit tired  waiting for a big finale  [Laughter]     Obviously, there remain serious risks to both the timing and magnitude of the   acceleration in real activity that we are projecting  The recent gains in equity markets  and declines in risk spreads could be signaling that a stronger-than-expected rebound  is in the offing  As you know, we have made much of gloomy sentiment and  heightened caution as factors that have retarded business spending over the past year  or so  But it would be a mistake to equate caution on the part of businesses with  inaction  In fact, they appear to have been hard at work  Balance sheets have been  strengthened, aided importantly by an environment of low interest rates  Firms have  become leaner through workforce reductions, reorganizations, and more-effective  utilization of their existing capital stock  And with a few exceptions, businesses have  kept inventories very lean in relation to sales  These adjustments could be setting the  stage for a more-vigorous expansion ahead     But there also remain ample grounds for skepticism about the reacceleration in   activity that we are projecting to occur in the second half  We continue to believe  that unusual forces have been holding back investment spending and that these forces  will gradually dissipate  It is possible that this story is just wrong  Perhaps   May 6, 2003 12 of 115    investment has been weak because there are relatively few profitable investment  projects available  In other words, perhaps our model is misspecified, and the recent  pace of investment spending reflects fundamentals that are less favorable than we  recognize  In this case, the acceleration in equipment spending would likely be less  impressive than anticipated in our forecast  There are risks to household spending as  well  As we discussed at the last meeting, the personal saving rate remains well  below its long-run equilibrium  We have been comfortable that households are  making adjustments to consumption and saving of about the size and on roughly the  time line anticipated by our models  Still, we cannot rule out the possibility of a more  abrupt upward movement in the saving rate—associated perhaps with heightened job  insecurity should the labor market remain in the doldrums  This too would produce a  more muted pickup in activity than we are projecting     Even if we have the basic elements of the reacceleration of real activity about   right, considerable uncertainty remains about the timing of the step-up in growth   The process of repair and recovery from the bursting of the asset bubble and the  myriad other shocks that have hit the economy in the past few years could take longer  than we are anticipating  At this point, timing does matter  Core consumer price  inflation has been moving lower in recent quarters, and in our forecast most major  measures are expected to move into a range that encompasses zero inflation, once  allowance is made for likely measurement error  Any serious delay in the recovery or  shortfall in its magnitude would imply a larger output gap, at least for a time, and by  our analysis would result in an even lower inflation rate  As you know, for this  round, we updated the calculations for the probability of deflation that we presented  last December  Because the baseline forecasts for both output and inflation have been  revised down since then, we now estimate that the probability of deflation—defined  as core PCE price inflation falling below ½ percent by the end of 2004—has risen  from about 28 percent to about 35 percent  I’d take these figures with a grain of salt   But it doesn’t take complex stochastic simulations to recognize that, with inflation  this low, any reasonable confidence interval would include a sizable probability that  the aggregate price level could fall  Karen will now continue our presentation       I’d say that in our last forecast the war-related uncertainties were just   a part of what we saw as a much broader set of concerns and uncertainties about the economic   outlook that were helping to hold back P&E spending  So we hadn’t bet a lot on the end of the   war being a major source of upward impetus to such spending  As I indicated, in general the   data have been a little softer on the capital spending side, not dramatically so but enough on the   core component—the non-high-tech, nontransportation component—that we just didn’t see signs   that capital spending would move up as rapidly as we had in the last forecast  Second, some of   the revisions that we made to the second half of the year had less to do with the actual data we   were seeing on the various spending categories and more with what we were seeing on the   production and employment side  The latter in essence suggested that overall demand was likely   to be weaker than we had anticipated  For that reason we put in some reduction in our forecast   of equipment spending and also took some out of consumption  It is our view that to date overall   activity in the first half of this year is fundamentally softer than we had estimated at the time of   the last forecast  We are starting off at a lower base moving forward    As I said in my remarks, because we have leaned on the employment and production data   fairly heavily, it’s possible that we have overreacted by still trying to disentangle what are and   May 6, 2003 16 of 115    what aren’t war-related effects on the production and the employment sides  It could be that   those effects have been bigger and that we’re somehow misreading that as an indication of   fundamental weakness  But in general I’m comfortable with the balance of risks that we have in   this forecast     Certainly in the second and third quarters of next year we think we   will see a relatively large pulling forward of that spending  If one could look a little beyond the   2004 horizon in this forecast, we’d expect a bit of a pothole in activity in 2005 in part because of   that payback on the investment spending  But also we wouldn’t anticipate as big a stimulus from   even further cuts in personal income taxes       Well, in our forecast we incorporated the view that the worst is past   in this area  In fact we’d expect, with the gradual improvement in the pace of growth going   forward, that corporate spreads would continue to narrow some over the next six quarters  In   May 6, 2003 17 of 115    essence, there’s an increase in profitability and an improvement in overall activity as well as   some waning of these effects that together should result in further compression of spreads     As for the extent to which the governance issue is having an effect, one certainly hears   lots of business people talk about the effects that the uncertainties and liabilities associated with   corporate governance have had on their own activities and on their hesitance to take certain   actions  I’m not quite sure how to interpret those comments, but we hear them often  So that   would be another reason in our minds for this effect to last a little longer and to fade more slowly   over the projection period  But that’s in effect trying to read the anecdotes  I couldn’t tell you   how many tenths of a percentage point in equipment spending we’ve incorporated for that effect    But I think the corporate governance issues are part of our overall story of business hesitance,   gloom, and uncertainty     Actually, the CBO number is above ours, and OMB is below   May 6, 2003 18 of 115      I’ll let Mr Wilcox, who has Treasury experience, address that   question  I would just point out that, when we first started talking with OMB on this, they were   in the CBO camp and were well above us  They have just in the last week or so shifted toward   this lower number     That’s quite possible      And that is roughly ½ percentage point on GDP growth     Well, that’s always a possibility  It’s our view, however, that the   basic health of the corporate balance sheet has improved and has improved quite noticeably over   the last year or so  We’ve seen a decline in default rates  We’ve certainly seen a significant   drop-off in the interest share of cash flow, aided by a low interest rate environment  Whatever   the cause of this recent decline in spreads, it obviously is reducing the cost of capital to   businesses  Now, as I indicated in my remarks, if businesses don’t have reasonable projects   available then the decline in spreads might not provide the stimulus to investment spending that   we’re anticipating  But we’re fairly confident that it has been helping to reduce the cost of   capital     As for spreads widening again, that is always a possibility, as I said earlier  If there were   any significant doubt about the likelihood of a reasonable step-up in the pace of activity and   therefore some reemergence of concerns about whether the improvements in corporate health   that have occurred thus far can be sustained going forward, that could cause a rise in spreads    May 6, 2003 20 of 115    That, in our view, obviously would be part of a very bad patch for the economy going forward    However, within the context of our forecast, we believe it’s quite reasonable to expect some   further narrowing of these spreads, which are still high by historical standards     Absolutely  There certainly has been a very significant strain that   was related to the fact that firms had invested in so many projects     Right     The short answer is “not much” because these gaps, as you know,   widen out and come back in  You’re right that recently there has been a remarkably large gap   between the payroll and the household survey data  Our reason for emphasizing participation in   our analysis of the gaps that have developed between the payroll and the household employment   data is that we’re focusing on the unemployment rate because of its implications for measuring   the slack in the labor market  Movements in household employment have effects on both the   numerator and the denominator of the unemployment rate and therefore have less effect on the   rate  What has really surprised us is the extent to which the unemployment rate has stayed   relatively low given the weakness that we have seen in payroll employment  As we highlighted   in our presentation to the Board yesterday, we have some shreds of evidence to suggest that this   development is probably related to a broader discouragement in the workforce than the   “discouraged workers” question in the survey would indicate  As a consequence of that, while   we’ve seen less of a run-up in the unemployment rate during this period of weakness, we think   we’re also likely to see less of an improvement in the unemployment rate once economic growth   really begins to pick up       The household survey is the one upon which the unemployment rate   is based      I think it would be a mistake to focus on household employment as   suggesting that there is greater health in the overall labor markets and the employment situation    Every survey taken of both households and businesses about the availability of jobs or the   availability of workers lines up very well with the weakness that we’ve seeing in payroll   employment  These readings seem at odds with the strength that is being suggested by the   household sector data     Yes     Well, there is a discontinuity  But I don’t know whether or not it’s   an important factor in explaining this recent jump  I don’t know if Larry has any insight     The fiscal package that we’ve incorporated on the tax side is one that   has all the elements of the President’s program with the exception of the dividend tax relief    That would be consistent roughly with the $350 billion package in aggregate size being   discussed by the Senate, not the $550 billion package being discussed by the House       That’s over ten years  But we have incorporated in our forecast the   passage of that bill, and we have its effects on disposable income starting in October of this year    So it gives a fairly good pop to disposable income starting in the fourth quarter and into early   next year  It is an important factor  From the political gridlock simulation in the Greenbook,   you can get a sense of how important the fiscal package is in our forecast  We’d expect   something closer to 4 percent GDP growth next year instead of 4¾ percent if political gridlock   materialized   May 6, 2003 24 of 115    In terms of the effects of the fiscal package on the economy, it is certainly the case that   the staff’s forecast does not assume so-called Ricardian behavior on the part of households  We   think that disposable income is going to show up in consumer spending  For some households   that are liquidity constrained, it will provide an immediate boost to spending  For other   households that are more forward-looking, some of this involves a pulling forward of a tax cut   that was already planned  One would expect, therefore, a little less impetus to spending than   might otherwise occur from that acceleration in the timing  But even that, in a present   discounted value sense, is an improvement in permanent income  So those tax cuts contribute,   and contribute importantly, to the growth in overall activity  If we took that fiscal stimulus out   of this forecast—or alternatively, if we assumed that it happens but has no effects—there would   be a more muted improvement in overall activity  We’d have a forecast with the unemployment   rate still running at roughly 6 percent through the end of next year, which is in essence no   improvement       There would be some offset through lower long-term interest rates if   the package did not pass  And we’d get a little crowding in on the investment side  That feature,   by the way, is incorporated in the model simulations that do have a forward-looking element to   them    "
7220,2003-06-24,"  Obviously, we can always weave together a series of very plausible   outcomes  For example, let’s say we started with weaker productivity growth than we are   currently forecasting  If that were to come as a substantial disappointment to financial market   participants, one could imagine that, as we pushed out yet again the diminishment of this unusual   restraint on investment spending until the middle of next year, we’d have the resource utilization   gap remaining  Suppose the gap did not diminish at all over the forecast period  I think the   combination of those developments and maybe a little less impetus to spending from the fiscal   policy that has been enacted could quite easily get the GDP growth forecast into a range of   something that started with a 3 and not a 4  We certainly did not intend the alternative scenarios   to suggest that it would be unreasonable to imagine a forecast that was running in the 3½ to   4 percent range next year; I think that would be quite reasonable  David indicated his confidence   intervals on the inflation side; the confidence intervals on the real GDP side are quite wide, too,   as you know; and a forecast as low as you were suggesting would fit within them quite   comfortably   June 24-25, 2003 79 of 211      Well, obviously you want to think through the full implications of   this  With an earlier release of the FOMC central tendency forecasts, one difficulty you might   face in your testimony would be that, with the added three weeks of data, people will be asking   you to provide an update on it  You may or may not be in a position to do that  But other than   that, I’m not sure that I see any substantial downside risk     It probably would be a wise thing to do!  "
7356,2003-09-16,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  The data that we have received  since the August Greenbook support our view that an acceleration of activity is under  way  A pickup in the second half of this year has been a feature of our forecast since  last January  But for the first time we can say that the expected improvement in the  economy is based on some fact and is not just forecast  If anything, the data have, on  net, been stronger than we had expected  Looking back, the economy was not so  weak in the second quarter as was previously estimated; and looking forward,  surprisingly strong readings on private spending have led us to revise up projected  growth of real GDP in the second half of this year from 4 percent to 4½ percent   Even the components of the projected step-up in activity are roughly in line with our  story  Consumers appear to be spending out of the considerable slug of disposable  income that has been delivered through personal tax cuts; low interest rates are  providing support to housing activity; and capital spending is poised to post a second  large quarterly increase     The skeptical among you could certainly be forgiven for asking, “Haven’t we   heard this before?  Is this any different from 2002?”  But there is an important  difference  Nearly half the growth of real GDP that we experienced over the first  three quarters of 2002 resulted from efforts by firms to stem the rapid liquidation of  their inventories; improvement in the pace of final sales in that period was minimal   By contrast, the acceleration of activity this year has been more than accounted for by  larger increases in final sales  Indeed, inventories have been drawn down sharply as   September 16, 2003 15 of 106    spending has picked up  Needless to say, this is a more auspicious configuration for  future activity than occurred in 2002     Obviously, the congruence of recent developments with our long-standing   forecast of a second-half acceleration is heartening  But we aren’t declaring victory  yet  It’s more like being pleased that your luggage has arrived with you on the plane  to Katmandu for your trip to climb Mt Everest  To be sure, the trip is off to a good  start, but you probably shouldn’t conclude yet that you will reach the summit  We are  simply too early in the process to know whether we are on the front edge of a  powerful expansion that will begin to erode the margin of excess productive capacity  that has built up in the economy over the past three years     There are basically four elements central to our projection that we will achieve   and sustain above-trend growth over the next two years  First, monetary and fiscal  policies provide a positive impulse to the growth of spending  Second, that impulse  to spending boosts income, which feeds back to more spending through the multiplier  effect  Third, the combination of more spending and higher output raises the demand  for capital and, through the accelerator effect, boosts the growth of investment  spending  Fourth, as the signs of sustainable growth become more convincing, there  is a gradual improvement of business sentiment and some lifting of the restraint that  we have seen on hiring and spending  Because all these factors operate  simultaneously, no simple accounting of these influences is possible  But let me offer  some impressions     As I noted earlier, we are seeing clear signs that fiscal and monetary policy are   providing a boost to growth  Although the pattern has been choppy, defense spending  has contributed importantly to the growth of real GDP this year  Reductions in  marginal income tax rates and advance-refund checks for the child tax credit no doubt  help to explain the strength of consumer spending  Meanwhile, favorable financing  conditions and improved balance sheets have supported interest-sensitive outlays in  the household and business sectors     But moving beyond this policy-induced push on spending, the picture is   considerably murkier  For example, gauging current business sentiment is not easy   Judging from reports in the Beige Book and from our business contacts, the mood  seems to have improved marginally  In 2002, many business people said that they  simply didn’t see any signs of improvement in underlying economic conditions, and  they were quite emphatic in stating that the economists were crazy  While I wouldn’t  want to endorse that particular psychiatric evaluation of the profession, I’d have to  admit that they were right about business conditions  The prevalent mood now seems  to run between skepticism and guarded optimism, with less outright hostility to the  view that conditions are improving  Still, it is clear that businesses remain cautious  and are behaving accordingly  Inventories are under tight control, and firms have  continued to be reluctant to add to their payrolls        September 16, 2003 16 of 106    We may, however, be seeing some evidence of a greater willingness to engage in  capital spending  Real spending on equipment and software was up about 8 percent  at an annual rate in the second quarter, and the data in hand suggest to us an even  stronger 16 percent gain in the current quarter  This may reflect some brightening of  sentiment, but the fundamentals have been improving as well  In addition to the drop  in borrowing rates, the partial-expensing provision is holding down the cost of  capital  Moreover, business output, final sales, and cash flow have accelerated this  year, and that also is likely supporting capital outlays     However, to move more firmly onto a sustained path of above-trend growth, we   will eventually need some help from the labor market  In our forecast, as the impetus  to incomes from tax cuts fades, faster growth of employment and labor income more  than fill the gap, sustaining relatively rapid growth of consumer spending  This part  of the process is not yet in evidence  The biggest surprise we have experienced over  the intermeeting period has been the weakness of the labor market  Private payrolls  declined again in August, and initial claims for unemployment insurance have edged  back up over 400,000 during the past two weeks  As a consequence, we have pushed  off again the time at which we expect to see an upturn in hiring      One should be careful not to exaggerate the extent to which the multiplier process   depends on job growth  Large gains in output by definition result in large gains in  income  To date, those gains are coming from faster growth of labor productivity and  the income is flowing heavily to profits  Corporate earnings are boosting cash flow  and likely are helping to finance some of the increases in capital spending  Moreover,  heightened corporate profitability has provided a lift to equity prices, which in turn  support business spending through a lower cost of capital and household spending  through the wealth effect  Indeed, taking all of these channels into account, the  propensity to spend out of capital income is only marginally smaller than the  propensity to spend out of labor income  So the multiplier effect is attenuated but not  eliminated when output gains are generated through faster productivity     Still, I think that only limited comfort should be taken from that observation,   largely because the recent configuration of the growth of output and productivity is  not sustainable  Ongoing declines in hours worked and employment will be  associated with a rising unemployment rate—a development that could at some point  sour consumer attitudes  Even setting aside that possibility, increasing slack will  eventually put downward pressure on inflation; with an unchanged funds rate, the  accompanying upward pressure on real interest rates will have negative consequences  for aggregate demand     As seems so often to have been the case in recent years, interpreting   developments on the supply side of the economy has been just as central to our  forecasting enterprise as getting a good fix on aggregate demand  The performance  of productivity over the past year has remained phenomenal  Over the year ending in  the second quarter, productivity in the nonfarm business sector is estimated to have  risen more than 4 percent—a pace that we think is likely to be matched or exceeded   September 16, 2003 17 of 106    in the current quarter  Moreover, the historical revisions to labor productivity  released by the BLS after their incorporation of new estimates of hours worked point  to larger increases in output per hour in both 2001 and 2002 than previously  estimated  In light of these developments, we thought adjustments to our estimates of  structural productivity and potential output were needed to better balance the risks to  our forecast  In the end, we raised the estimated level of structural labor productivity  by a cumulative 2 percent by the end of 2003, after accounting for a break in the  series  We also increased the growth rate of structural productivity about  ¼ percentage point over 2004 and 2005 to 2½ and 2¾ percent per annum  respectively  Owing to a downward revision to the trend in the workweek implied by  the revised data, our upward revision to potential output was slightly smaller     There are several plausible explanations for the exceptional performance of   productivity  For one, firms are likely using more fully and effectively technologies  and capital that were introduced and installed in the late 1990s  The boom years may  have masked inefficiencies that had built up  But in the more difficult circumstances  of the past several years, firms have been under intense pressure to cut costs in order  to improve the bottom line  Some of the gains may also be coming from  developments at the industry level  Many startups and firms that entered new lines of  business in the boom period never gained any traction and eventually folded their  tents in the intensely competitive environment of the past few years, leaving the most  efficient producers with a larger share of the market  Finally, advances in technology  and organizational know-how are probably providing a bigger boost than we had  previously recognized to the growth, and not just the level, of structural productivity   Hence, we nudged up further our estimates of the growth of multifactor productivity  for the next two years     With the upward adjustments we made to aggregate supply exceeding those we   made to aggregate demand, we are forecasting both stronger growth of real GDP and  a slightly higher output gap than in our August forecast, a gap that is not expected to  be eliminated by the end of 2005      As you know, current market expectations, as well as those of many professional   forecasters, are that you will begin to tighten by the middle of next year  In contrast,  we have assumed that the federal funds rate is held at its current level until the middle  of 2005  On the surface, it might appear that the staff is assuming not only that the  punch bowl will be left on the table after two years of partying but also that the  central bank will be ladling out punch faster than fraternity brothers on pledge night!   Needless to say, that is not how we view our policy assumption       In our forecast, we expect the pressures on inflation over the next two years as   more likely to be down than up, and thus there will be little urgency to begin the  tightening process  The margin of slack in labor and product markets is expected to  recede only slowly over the next two years  This reflects both our relatively  optimistic outlook for the growth of potential output and our forecast that growth of  real GDP will slow in 2005, when fiscal policy swings from a position of   September 16, 2003 18 of 106    considerable stimulus to one of slight restraint  Slack in labor markets should help to  keep downward pressure on labor compensation  At the same time, the sustained  strong uptrend in structural productivity should then translate those modest gains in  labor compensation into minimal increases in structural unit labor costs  Barring  some exogenous shock, it is difficult to envision any noticeable deterioration of  inflation expectations  To us, these influences, taken together, seem a recipe for  subdued inflation  In our forecast, headline CPI inflation declines from 2 percent this  year to about 1 percent in 2004 and 2005  Core inflation edges lower over the next  two years, and energy prices decline in line with expectations embedded in current  futures prices  We believe the risks are comfortably balanced around that projection       The mean Blue Chip forecast has an unemployment rate of 5¾ percent by the   fourth quarter, very similar to ours but with CPI inflation remaining at 2 percent next  year  Obviously, it is difficult for us to take a firm stand on the wisdom of our  forecast relative to that of the Blue Chip  Their 2 percent CPI forecast is at the upper  end of the 70 percent confidence interval around the staff projection—so their  forecast is clearly a credible one  Of course, I’d also note that the lower end of the  70 percent confidence interval around our forecast includes a small decline in  headline prices in 2004—so that outcome cannot be written off yet either  Karen will  now continue our presentation       I think the answer to that is “no” in the sense that, while we could do   a numerical calculation, I don’t think it would convince anybody that what we were estimating   was necessarily the marginal propensity to consume out of those monies     What we’ve seen, obviously, is a very significant jump in disposable   income that, as one would expect, was not matched fully by an increase in consumer spending of   the same magnitude in July  But just because the amount spent of that increased disposable   income was 50 percent or a bit more, I don’t think we’d say that it is a measure of the marginal   propensity to consume out of those tax cuts  As you know, Mr Chairman, in the research on the   2001 tax cut and even the tax change in 1990-91, there is still some academic controversy   regarding the propensity to consume  We took a stand in 2001 that the tax cuts would be spent    I don’t know whether they were or weren’t, but we think the data lined up pretty well with our   forecasts in that period  We took a stand once again this year that the tax rebates and the   addition to disposable income would show up as increased consumer spending, and that has been   the case thus far  So we’re taking from that experience the belief that the broad construct of our   story is in the right ballpark  Some people argued that the bulk of the tax checks would just go   straight into savings and would not really show up as spending  We didn’t think that was going   to happen, and we don’t think it has happened—though given the noise in the data, one can’t   necessarily be sure      The rebate checks were mailed in July and August     I think that would be something to monitor  The chain stores sales   have softened a little, but the indicator content of those sales is not huge  You’re right that motor   vehicle sales through the first ten days of the month appear to have dropped back from the   September 16, 2003 22 of 106    August pace, but they’re stronger than the estimate we had written down in this forecast and still   seem to us to be suggesting quite good numbers      Right, and we had penciled in 161  So we’re taking that recent   higher sales pace as potentially a positive innovation to our forecast     On the point you’re raising about whether or not the effect of the   higher cash flow from the tax cuts begins to peter out, I think we’re going to have to watch   spending carefully to see  As I indicated in my remarks, while we don’t really expect any   significant strength in the labor markets to occur until next year, we do expect to go from   declines in employment to some small increases by the end of this year     There are workers all over the place now  But perhaps in the late   1990s firms were simply spending a lot to increase their capital stocks in order to overcome that   labor shortage—investing in computer equipment, networking equipment, and so forth—without   fundamentally reorganizing their production processes or the way they did business  The   pressures in that period were on expansion and sales, so companies may have been more focused   on those efforts than on using the technology to reshape their business processes  With the lower   opportunity costs of undertaking more fundamental reorganization measures in a period of slack   demand such as we’ve had the last couple of years, it could well be that firms are beginning to   integrate more fully the technology they’ve acquired  People talked a lot about that happening in   the second half of the ’90s, but many companies may not actually have been doing it  I’m   throwing out a few hypotheses  Obviously, there’s still a huge puzzle here about productivity,   and I wouldn’t begin to argue that we fully understand what has been going on       It would certainly work to offset that effect  As we look further   down the road beyond the Greenbook horizon, we do see the equilibrium real rate rising in part   September 16, 2003 24 of 106    because of the stronger productivity that we’re projecting and in part because of the deterioration   in the fiscal situation  Over the period of this forecast, we still have an elevated equity premium   and some lingering weakness in total business fixed investment  It’s true that equipment   spending is picking up, but in our forecast we still have quite weak spending on structures and a   relatively elevated level of the dollar  Those things are working in the opposite direction to hold   down the equilibrium real rate over the next few years  So I think you’re right; certainly a   recognition that the economy is going to grow much faster in the long term would tend to keep   real interest rates high in order to ration current production to meet rising demand  But we don’t   think that the surprise, if you will, on the funds rate that will occur if our forecast comes to   fruition will be large enough to offset that tendency for the real rate to rise over the longer term     Just to reiterate some of the discussion we’ve had on that point, I   certainly agree with you that my life would be much simpler if I could just pick off that market-  based funds rate path and plug it into the forecast  But as I think about what has transpired over   the last several years, many times that procedure would have had us writing down a forecast that   I think would have looked quite absurd to you  In 2001 and 2002, for example, the markets kept   expecting a much sharper turnaround in the funds rate than in fact was consistent with our view   about the underlying strength in aggregate spending  So we would have been showing a forecast   that would have had as its baseline policy assumption your taking actions to further raise the   unemployment rate and to drive inflation down even lower  One can see that even in the   alternative simulation, which we do include in the Greenbook, using the market-based funds rate    If we had built in the market funds rate path this time, we would have been suggesting—  given the rate increases that the markets are currently anticipating to begin in the middle of   2004—that the Committee would drive the growth rate of GDP well below its potential in 2005   September 16, 2003 26 of 106    That would effectively stall out any improvement in the unemployment rate—with the rate at a   level we view as considerably above the natural rate—and further drive down inflation  So I’m   not sure whether that’s the appropriate point of departure for us to take  We think it’s more   helpful to put out our story and try to be as transparent as possible about what we’re assuming   and then let you decide where the various weaknesses are in our analysis  I’d leave it to the   Committee to decide which method is better  I don’t think it would be any more difficult to base   the forecast on the market’s expected path for the funds rate  It might be a little more awkward   to write that story occasionally, using policy assumptions that would in essence be fostering   disequilibrium in the economy rather than moving over the longer run toward equilibrium    However, we think—we hope—that we’re putting on the table something that is useful to your   discussion     I’d just note that I’d be happy to solicit the views of the Committee   on this point  We’re trying to produce a product that will be helpful to your discussions  That’s   the object of the Greenbook  We like to be right, but what we are really looking for is to have   some value added in terms of the quality of your policy discussion  I’m skeptical that making   this change would be a move in that direction, but I’m not stubborn  So if there is a significant   sentiment otherwise, we would obviously want to respond to that     In some of the work that we did for you a year and a half ago—I will   have to dig it out—we looked at that question, and it turned out that the Greenbook assumptions   were a little better than the market forecasts  However, we didn’t want to draw from that the   conclusion that we do better than the markets—first, because it was an assumption and not   necessarily a forecast and, second, because anything could happen in a small sample  But the   evidence certainly wasn’t decisively against the Greenbook-type assumptions  We can update   that work, although if we update it for the past year and a half, I think if anything we’ve been   closer than the markets in anticipating that there was not going to be a need for any immediate   tightening       Using the error pattern of past Greenbook forecasts, a 70 percent   confidence interval on our inflation forecast for 2004 was roughly plus or minus 1 percentage   point  That means that 30 percent of the time the errors will be larger  As I indicated in my   remarks, there is a 15 percent chance that we’ll get something at or above the Blue Chip’s   2 percent forecast if our error history holds going forward  But there is also a 15 percent chance   that the CPI could be at or below zero in 2004  So the confidence interval is wide, and it would   include both headline inflation that shows no deceleration and headline inflation that shows   considerable deceleration   Now, as to the logic behind our forecast, one of the things that we talked about a year ago   in July, when we had this conversation about Phillips curves and gaps in output, is just how flat   the aggregate supply curve or the Phillips curve has gotten in recent years  In our view, that   reflected in part the fact that the Committee had done a good job of tying down inflation   expectations when those expectations were moving, but it also did not rule out the possibility that   structural changes could be occurring as well  In periods of low inflation, there may be more of   a tendency to commit longer term to price contracts and so forth and that might actually flatten   out the Phillips curve  So with the gap especially large and diminishing over the projection   September 16, 2003 30 of 106    period, we still see the pressure as down but not sharply so—especially in light of very little   evidence that inflation expectations are moving dramatically one way or the other  In fact, I   think implicitly in our forecast we assume that there actually will be a little further decline in   inflation expectations  So we think the change in inflation is going to be modest but more likely   to be down than up     I think you’re absolutely right that one of the biggest differences   between our forecast and the consensus forecast is a more optimistic outlook on aggregate   supply  A number of you, in fact, have remarked on how optimistic our forecast is  I really   don’t view it as all that optimistic because the gap is large and it diminishes only very slowly    Now, we could be wrong about that  But if we’re wrong, our productivity assumption doesn’t   September 16, 2003 31 of 106    necessarily mean that we will be wrong significantly about the output gap going forward, too  It   could very well be that, if we’re wrong about underlying productivity, we’ll see faster   employment growth but also less demand going forward because the economy will be generating   less potential income expectations going forward  So to be honest, we think we have the risks   reasonably balanced around our productivity forecast  But I must say that our statistical filtering   models are chomping at the bit to have us move our forecast higher  Our recent pattern of errors   would suggest the same thing  We thought we had solved this problem, but we’ve been making   consistent errors in underforecasting the strength of productivity     Obviously, the first possibility is that we could be wrong      The second possibility is that the markets and maybe the   policymakers, too, have to adjust their sights regarding what the economy is going to be capable   of doing  You can do that only on the fly  As the Chairman indicated again, to my chagrin, we   really can’t forecast very well  It’s not possible to look very far ahead  The Committee will   have to be groping its way toward learning how much of these recent gains in productivity can   persist going forward—whether the level will persist and whether the higher growth rate that we   are forecasting will persist  But we don’t think there is anything inconsistent between a period of   5 percent GDP growth and a funds rate that remains at 1 percent  There is considerable slack in   the economy  The underlying growth of the potential of the economy is relatively rapid, but that   September 16, 2003 32 of 106    growth can occur in the context of a decline in the inflation rate  A lot of people in the early   1980s thought that, once the economy came out of the recession, inflation was bound to rise to   5 or 6 percent  The reality was that the economy could grow quite rapidly in that period because   so much slack had built up  We know that there are a number of uncertainties and risks   surrounding our forecast  We realize that you know that as well  So I don’t want to make too   strong a case  But the simple notion is that a pickup in the economy’s growth or even a sustained   period of relatively strong gains doesn’t necessarily preclude inflation pressures remaining   diminished    "
7416,2003-10-28,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Karen and I will attempt to be  brief this morning  We suspect that this may be an occasion where we may have an  easier time explaining our economic outlook to you than you will have figuring out  how to explain your economic outlook to others  As a consequence, we intend to  yield back the balance of our time to Vincent Reinhart     In a nutshell, things have been going very well for the US economy in recent   weeks  The data have been coming in almost uniformly stronger than we had  expected six weeks ago  The latest piece of news fitting that pattern was this  morning’s release of the September report on new orders and shipments of  nondefense capital goods  New orders outside of aircraft were up nearly 4 percent  last month, after having been about flat in August  Shipments of nondefense capital  goods excluding aircraft were up 25 percent in September, more than reversing the  decline in August  The figures are a bit stronger than we had expected and would  probably lead us to add about 1 percentage point to the projected growth of  equipment spending in both the third and the fourth quarters, bringing the increases to  13 percent and 12 percent, respectively  However, the report also showed  manufacturers’ durable inventories liquidating even faster than we expected     On balance, the data that we have received since the close of the Greenbook   would leave unaltered our estimate of the increase in real GDP in the third quarter of  6¼ percent at an annual rate, a figure nearly 2 percentage points above that in the  September Greenbook  All of that upward revision reflects stronger readings on final  sales, with notable positive innovations in consumption, housing, government  outlays, and net exports  No doubt, some of the burst in spending last quarter was  simply borrowed from the future  Most notable in that regard, we are interpreting  some of the unexplained strength in consumption as reflecting a more rapid response  than we had anticipated to this summer’s reduction in personal income taxes  As a  consequence, we lowered our projected increase in real PCE in the fourth quarter to  offset some of the third-quarter surprise     But in other areas, the data appear to be signaling greater underlying strength in   demand  Housing stands out as the most prominent example  Starts, permits, and  sales have all been phenomenal of late  As a consequence, we marked up our forecast  of residential investment across the projection period  Yesterday’s release on sales of  new and existing homes for September certainly supports that decision  New home  sales maintained their recent robust pace of about 115 million units; and existing  sales clocked in at 67 million units, establishing yet another record for the series     Netting areas of payback against those of greater momentum, we revised down   the projected increase in real GDP in the fourth quarter by ¼ percentage point to just  under 4½ percent  Needless to say, that is only a small offset to the sizable third-  October 28, 2003 13 of 126    quarter surprise  This morning’s orders figures suggest that we may be undoing even  that small downward revision  When coupled with some slight further upward  revision to growth in 2004 and 2005—largely reflecting the weaker exchange value  of the dollar in this forecast—these revisions imply a level of real GDP about  ½ percent above that in the September Greenbook throughout the projection period     That said, I see the changes that we have made to this projection as largely being   ones of degree  The basic forces that we had earlier expected to be at work in the  economy now appear to be showing through in the data  Low interest rates and a  surge of disposable income generated by tax cuts have provided a powerful stimulus  to household spending, especially on durable goods and housing  Moreover, low  interest rates, together with a waning aversion to risk, sharp gains in corporate  profitability, rising sales, and the partial-expensing tax provisions appear to be  creating a considerably more hospitable climate for business investment  While the  pattern has been choppy, outlays for defense have also been providing a sizable boost  to activity in recent months     Perhaps even more encouraging, some of the areas that gave us, and probably   many of you, greatest pause about our forecast in mid-September have shown some  tentative signs of improvement in recent weeks  Industrial production has firmed a  bit of late, with notable strength in the production of high-tech goods, especially  computers and semiconductors  The national and regional purchasing managers’  indexes suggest that further increases are in train this month  There are also signs of  a nascent recovery in labor markets  Private payrolls expanded by 72,000 in  September, and the July and August figures were revised to show smaller declines   Initial claims have been averaging close to 390,000 this month, and insured  unemployment has moved lower—suggesting that layoffs may have abated some and  that hiring may be turning the corner     Could the surprising strength of such a broad array of economic indicators be   signaling the start of an even more vigorous expansion than we are projecting?  The  answer, of course, is “yes”  Much of the strength in private spending has been in  interest-sensitive areas such as autos, other consumer durables, housing, and capital  equipment  It is certainly conceivable that we are underestimating the potency of  zero real interest rates  The recent weakening of the dollar might be another  indication that the current stance of policy is delivering greater stimulus to activity  than we have been projecting  Another explanation for the recent pickup in activity  could be that business caution is in the process of fading  As you know, we expect  the unusual restraint on business spending and hiring to have largely dissipated by the  middle of next year  If business sentiment were to improve more rapidly than we are  anticipating, the accompanying step-up in the pace of hiring, capital spending, and  inventory investment could make the next few quarters look a lot more like a normal  business cycle recovery than we currently expect     I must admit that, in preparing this briefing, I was struck by how often I was   struggling to find synonyms for strength  Over the past three years, I had developed a   October 28, 2003 14 of 126    reasonably complete list of substitutes for weakness  But lest you fear that we have  fallen prey to the sin of conviction concerning our forecast of sustained expansion, let  me assure you that we remain capable of conjuring dark thoughts about the outlook   Indeed, there are still some very palpable downside risks to our forecast       For one, neither we nor anyone else should have much confidence in an ability to   parse out the effects of this summer’s drop in personal tax rates and the issuance of  rebate checks on the time profile of consumer spending  Our calculations rely more  on judicious assumption than on hard empirical evidence, so the uncertainty  surrounding these estimates is large  Maybe the recent strength in consumer spending  has been mainly the consequence of the tax cuts and, because we have experienced  little or no growth in labor income, spending will shortly peter out  Some  circumstantial evidence could be seen as supporting this hypothesis  Chain store  sales—an admittedly poor predictor of broader consumer spending—have dropped  back in recent weeks after popping up this summer, and the reports that we hear from  the automakers are that sales have dropped from spectacular to merely good in recent  weeks     It is also possible that some of the strength in business spending will prove to be   transitory  Before the war began in March, one of the explanations for the so-called  soft patch was that, given the enormous uncertainties, businesses were putting capital  spending projects on hold  Maybe the noticeable upturn in orders since the spring is a  temporary bulge that reflects the implementation of those previously deferred  decisions rather than an acceleration in the underlying demand for capital equipment   Such a possibility might square with the limited and guarded guidance that companies  have provided for revenues and profits going forward, despite the spectacular gains  many have experienced recently     There are also ample reasons to discount the available signs of improvement in   the labor market  We have seen similar periods of false hope over the past couple of  years  Private payrolls improved a year ago, only to fall back most of this year   Moreover, both initial claims and insured unemployment dropped to levels  comparable to those we are currently observing on three other occasions during the  past three years  Obviously, none of those occurrences ultimately proved a precursor  to sustained expansion     False positives were not just a feature of the labor market data  The purchasing   managers’ indexes showed improvement similar to that seen recently in early 2002,  and industrial production posted a brief period of increase in the middle of that year   With investors apparently pricing in substantial odds that a more vigorous expansion  is under way, any perceptible disappointment on that front could feed back negatively  through financial markets onto the real economy That would put at risk our forecast  that output will grow rapidly enough to make a dent in the current margin of  underutilized capacity      October 28, 2003 15 of 126    We have taken some comfort from the greater synchronicity of the positive  signals in the current episode relative to those earlier false starts  Moreover, unlike  2002, the pickup in activity to date has been driven by a strengthening of private final  demands, which are now increasing more rapidly than at any time since the late  1990s  Still, we will need to see more evidence before we can confidently confirm  the sustained above-trend expansion that we have been predicting     In contrast to the many surprises in the spending and production data, price   developments have been unfolding pretty much as we had expected  We continue to  believe that the economy has the capacity to grow rapidly over the next two years  without putting upward pressure on inflation  Slack in resource utilization diminishes  only slowly in our forecast, with the unemployment rate expected to decline to  5½ percent by the end of 2004 and to 5 percent by the end of 2005  Likewise,  manufacturing capacity utilization rises from its current level of around 73 percent to  only 78 percent at the close of 2004 and just above 80 percent by the end of 2005  In  short, available capacity combined with continued strong gains in structural labor  productivity should keep a lid on cost pressures  Meanwhile, there have been few  signs that inflation expectations have deteriorated in any material manner, and given  our benign outlook for prices, we think the odds are low that expectations will  become unglued over the next two years  However, as we noted in yesterday’s Board  presentation, the confidence band around our forecast for core inflation is quite wide   And the uncertainty surrounding that forecast has more to do with unaccounted-for  shocks than it does with our uncertainty about the strength or weakness of the  economy over the next two years  Those results imply both that we will almost surely  be wrong and that we probably won’t be able to offer you with any confidence good  explanations as to why  Karen Johnson will now continue our presentation       We should be able to have that calculation, I would imagine, by the   coffee break or shortly after the break     There are really three principal reasons that we show as much   strength as we do in consumption for 2004  The most important is that we’re expecting a very   significant improvement to occur in the labor market  As has been noted a few times around this   table, our forecast is that job gains are going to be running 350,000 plus a month in 2004  That   is going to be creating a sizable acceleration in labor and—to the extent that there has been any   precautionary saving motive for the last two years—acting to restrain consumption less  Second,   we still get additional disposable income from the enacted tax cuts so that more disposable   income is being delivered by fiscal policy as we move into 2004  Finally, the wealth effects,   which have been a significant drag on spending over the last two years, are turning from big   negatives to neutral  For us that is the principal reason we’re showing a step-up in real PCE next   year  On an annual average basis we still have the saving rate rising a bit, from 3¼ percent in   2003 to 3¾ percent in 2004  We see some reasonable risks around that forecast  But to the   extent that you have doubts about any of those three elements in the forecast, I think you would   have concerns about our consumption forecast as well   October 28, 2003 19 of 126      On your last point I think roughly speaking these scenarios are   additive  For most intents and purposes the model is reasonably linear, so I think you could   probably perform the analysis that way  As for your first question, I’ve been puzzled by the   consensus inflation forecast as well, especially when our forecast is predicated on energy prices   declining significantly over next year—in line with current expectations in the futures market for   oil  So if the energy price assumptions in the consensus forecast are based on those futures   prices, that forecast must have a rather sharp acceleration in underlying inflation  One   October 28, 2003 20 of 126    possibility, of course, is that the Blue Chip forecasters put a great deal more emphasis on speed   effects—or the change in the unemployment rate—whereas we are still relying on the level of   slack in both labor markets and product markets to be a restraint on overall inflation  We think   the evidence supports that gap type effect  But as we discussed a little over a year ago in the   special presentation to the FOMC, the Phillips curve has gotten flat enough that we don’t derive   a great deal of traction in our inflation forecast from movements in the resource and output gaps     So I think one possibility is that there will be some deterioration in inflation expectations   if we get as much growth as we’re projecting and policy remains unchanged  That’s why we   included that inflation expectations scenario because it seemed to us the most plausible way,   other than just through noise, that we could get significantly higher core inflation next year  On   the other side of that, though, we see downside risks, with the level of the price markup over unit   labor costs—and its mirror image in the profit share—having recovered quite strongly  If these   competitive pressures were to operate to bring that back down closer to historical average levels,   we see downside risks associated with this forecast as well  So I think we’re comfortable with   our forecast  But as I noted, those confidence intervals that we showed at yesterday’s Board   presentation suggest that nobody should hold a view on that with strong conviction     I guess I’m forced to say “no”!  [Laughter]  We still think that in   essence the equilibrium real funds rate is going to be below its historical average by the end of   2005  One reason is that the level of the dollar is still relatively high despite the fact that it has   come down  Second, the investment share in GDP is still quite low relative to its historical   average  Now, as we look further beyond the end of 2005, we do think it would be reasonable to   expect a return of the equilibrium real funds rate back to its historical average of 2½ percent or   so; we think that’s the direction you’ll be headed toward at that point  But we don’t see that   process as occurring so rapidly that the market’s expectation is the one that we want to buy into   for the end of 2005  That might be the case looking down a couple more years, but not in 2005     In part there’s another factor that boosts the equilibrium rate further down the road but   that in the intermediate term is providing us with the capacity for noninflationary growth, and   that is that we’re expecting a further acceleration in potential output growth sometime beyond   2005  As the improvement in investment that we’re forecasting occurs, it lifts potential capital   services and provides a bit more space for the economy to grow  Again, in the long run that   obviously is a factor why interest rates would need to be somewhat higher  But over the   intermediate period it allows rates to be somewhat lower     That’s a risk that I think we tried to highlight here  Obviously that is   very difficult for us to forecast  We don’t view that as the most likely outcome in part because,   with energy prices declining rapidly, headline inflation actually is going to be quite low  I don’t   October 28, 2003 22 of 126    think that’s a situation in which we’d anticipate that inflation expectations would likely be   building up much of a head of steam     I think that is where the rubber meets the road  In fact, we are   following our models quite closely here, but the underlying assumption is that structural labor   productivity is growing 2¾ percent  If we’re wrong and it is considerably higher, then the first-  round effects would be that the economy will be able to grow faster with less employment going   forward  If we’re not going to get that slowdown in productivity, we’re not going to get the   boost to labor growth associated with that  That would mean on the other side of the income   statement that profits would be higher as well  We’d probably figure that would net out to a   slightly weaker economy, given that the marginal propensity to consume out of labor income is   somewhat higher than that stemming from capital income  So, if we got a shift in an adverse   direction for labor next year, that would probably tend to weaken our overall outlook   Now, as you know, in the last forecast round we revised up further our estimates of   structural productivity  We didn’t do that this time  We’re just weeks away from a   October 28, 2003 23 of 126    comprehensive revision to the national income accounts that is going to change the last five   years of history—and maybe in significant ways  Our thought was, Let’s wait to see what   happens in the comprehensive revision and then try to put it all together We got the hours   revision this summer, and we’ll be getting the output revision shortly     It would indeed  It would give that lower inflation through its effects   on the aggregate amount of slack  There would be less employment and, therefore, a greater   amount of slack in the labor market  If it were also a reflection of an underlying improvement in   structural labor productivity growth that was greater than we thought, that too would be relieving   cost pressures even more than we are currently estimating     As we showed yesterday, inflation is so slightly above our estimate   of measurement bias there, it wouldn’t take much to do that  Now, on the anecdotal side, as I’ve   indicated, we’ve seen a few tentative signs that some improvement may be under way  This is   the first time we’ve revised up our employment—     One change we did make was to trim some of the strength we had in   first-quarter employment because we didn’t see enough in the forward-looking indicators to   provide us with confidence on that  We trimmed some in Q1 and have stronger employment   growth for the remainder of next year  It’s a forecast     At least the optimistic staff of the central bank!  [Laughter]  I leave it   to you to decide how optimistic you wish to be  You’re right—our forecast is an outlier  We   really struggled with that in the sense that if we were to be less optimistic about the aggregate   supply side of our projection, we would be showing even greater employment growth than we   October 28, 2003 25 of 126    already are showing  I think we’d have a hard time explaining how the level of productivity had   gotten quite so high  We already have it substantially above our estimate of structural   productivity growth  Our interpretation of the strong employment gains that we’re showing is   that a lot of what we’ve seen has been cyclical  So we’re getting pulled in both these directions   on the productivity side  The productivity and the employment data would tend to make us want   to be more optimistic  If we were more optimistic, we’d be showing even lower inflation than   we’re showing, and that would push us further away from the consensus in that direction     I think that’s clearly a downside risk  Again, our forecast is   predicated on the notion that the spending pattern this summer wasn’t fully a sugar high related   to the fiscal stimulus  We believe that the overall environment for consumer spending—with   some improvement in balance sheets, some step-up in sentiment since the spring, and low   interest rates—is providing support to consumption  We couldn’t see attributing all of the higher   spending just to the tax effect  But to the extent that one might be looking at the high-frequency   October 28, 2003 26 of 126    indicators, I think the recent readings would give one at least a little concern about our forecast   that consumption will remain as strong as we have projected  Now, our PCE forecast drops off   to less than 2 percent in the fourth quarter, so we have assumed that there’s going to be some   payback—part of it related to motor vehicles—for a lot of the strength that we saw earlier  Here   again we were balancing the possibility that the data may be signaling greater underlying   momentum than we are allowing for versus the possibility that more of this has just been a   temporary pulling forward of purchases  Whether we got that balance right or not, I don’t know    As I indicated, trying to pin down the tax effects is mostly guesswork  We really don’t have very   much in the way of hard empirical evidence to base those calculations on  So to me that says   that the uncertainty about consumption for the next few months is especially large  The   confidence interval is always wide, but I think in this period it’s even wider than usual because   we have to contend with trying to interpret something about which there is a great deal of   uncertainty     I’ll let Vincent speak to the monetary aggregates, but in terms of   short-term borrowing, businesses did a whole lot of borrowing in the second quarter in the   environment of very low interest rates  They built up their liquid assets and solidified their   balance sheets quite significantly  Corporate cash flow and internal funds have been going   gangbusters recently, and it is still the case with respect to demands for short-term credit—for   example, inventory investment—that firms are continuing to liquidate inventories  So we put   October 28, 2003 27 of 126    those things together and we’re not reading from the recent drop-off in business borrowing a   signal of impending weakness  I don’t know, Vincent, if you have any words you want to say   about this     I suggest that comparing the Board’s bureaucracy to something that   would move at the speed of light is pushing that analogy!  [Laughter]  First, I think you’re   obviously right  Any time you’re using a model estimated with historical data to forecast a   future period with events that are toward or outside the limit of what you’ve estimated your   model on, you have to believe that there’s going to be some wider confidence interval around   that forecast  We have never been able to find, and we have looked for it, evidence of   nonlinearity in the gap term or of what people used to call “goal line effects”—evidence that the   influence of the gap might become smaller the closer we get to price stability  The data don’t   seem to support that very strongly   The question that President Santomero has raised is certainly one that we have been   concerned about because of the possibility that our model may not be able to pick up that kind of   October 28, 2003 29 of 126    regime shift  I think the alternative simulation that we did—where we let inflation expectations   in a sense become unglued from what our model would expect—does try to highlight for you   what we think the potential consequences of that risk would be  As I indicated, there are a   couple of reasons why we don’t view that as the best baseline expectation  One is that we think   headline inflation is going to be quite well behaved when energy prices start to come down    That’s certainly going to help  It’s also the case that, if we’re right at least in the first half of   next year, let’s say, markets are going to be able to see that, even though there’s not going to be a   change in monetary policy, you’re also not throwing in the towel on containing inflation  Actual   inflation will be coming in quite low, if our forecast is correct, so your behavior in fact will be   consistent with expectations about your objectives  To a large degree that is the way we would   provide some rationale for our baseline assumption  Obviously, if we get rapid growth and a   string of unattractive inflation numbers, the risk would start to rise that people would wonder   whether or not you were giving in on your inflation objective  We see that as a potential risk if   market observers are looking at 5 percent GDP growth and employment is picking up and you   don’t do anything for a considerable period of time on the monetary policy front  On the other   hand, they will be seeing core inflation figures, if we’re right, that look very good and headline   inflation figures that look extremely good  So they’re not necessarily going to see a compelling   requirement for you to have to adjust policy  They might, in fact, be quite comfortable with that   outcome     Well, I have a hard time imagining that the NIPA revisions are going   to alter the output and inflation nexus fundamentally  The unemployment rate is not going to be   affected at all by this, of course  The price figures, although they get revised, tend not to be   revised dramatically or persistently enough for the relationships in our inflation equations to   change  One area in which we could see changes big enough to affect underlying parameters in   the model might be investment spending  For example, if there’s a significant revision in   software investment—we saw one the last time there was a NIPA revision—that could influence   our thinking about what is happening with the long-run share of software investment relative to   overall output That in turn could affect our potential GDP forecast and our view of what   investment spending is likely to be over the next few quarters  Similarly, if we get big revisions   on the income side, that could alter the saving rate enough perhaps to change our view about the   sensitivity of consumer spending and saving to wealth       We’ve had very big revisions on the income side, some of them   flowing through quite often into the saving rate  So I think that is a real possibility     I just want the record to show that that is not the case!  [Laughter]  "
7476,2003-12-09,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  As I sat down to deliver my  briefing at the last FOMC meeting, I was feeling pretty good  After all, the sizable  acceleration in aggregate output in the second half that we had been projecting for  some time seemed to be materializing  Even the more controversial aspects of our  forecast—a pickup in capital spending and a turnaround in the labor market—were  receiving some support from the incoming data  To be sure, it was early and  considerable risks remained, but I thought the case would be easier to make than it  had been in months past  Indeed, I figured that by 10 o’clock I’d be relaxing with a  doughnut, listening to Vincent execute the more difficult assignment of laying out a  3 by 3 by 3 Rubik’s cube of policy objectives, options, and risk assessments   [Laughter]     So, needless to say, I was not prepared for the full extent of the resistance that our   forecast met at the last meeting  In contrast to the situation in June, when our  projection of a 4 percent annual rate increase in real GDP in second half of this year  was widely viewed as too optimistic, there was considerably less consensus at the last  meeting about the nature of our error  Some of you argued that the economy would  not strengthen as much as we were projecting and certainly not to the point of eroding  the margin of slack in labor markets as quickly as we were anticipating  In contrast,  others of you appeared to be skeptical that we could hold the funds rate so low for so  long without generating a larger boom in output growth, greater inflationary  pressures, or both   December 9, 2003 11 of 133      For two reasons, I thought I would address your critiques head on this morning    The first reason is that, from time to time, it is useful to remind the Committee that I  did graduate summa cum laude from the “Mike Prell School of Charm”  [Laughter]   Second, the issues that you raised at the last meeting were serious, central to your  policy deliberations, and ones that we have continued to struggle with over the past  six weeks     So why do we believe that the economy will be strong enough to put a sizable   dent in the slack that has developed in labor markets over the past few years?  We  start from the premise that monetary and fiscal policy will continue to provide a  substantial dose of stimulus to aggregate demand in coming quarters  Real interest  rates are low, and risk spreads have come in—making the cost of capital favorable to  businesses and households  The stock market has increased markedly since March  and is expected to rise still further over the projection interval  Those increases  should encourage business investment and help to repair household balance sheets   Meanwhile, the exchange value of the dollar has fallen noticeably and is expected to  edge down further, buoying the competitive position of US producers on world  markets     The improvement in financial conditions has no doubt been a key factor   supporting the recent upturn in capital outlays  Real spending on equipment and  software seems likely to post an increase at an annual rate of about 14 percent in the  second half of this year, with spending on both high-tech and more traditional capital  equipment contributing to the upswing  From the vantage point of the second half,  our projected increase in real E&S spending of 18 percent next year doesn’t look to  us like too much of a stretch  After all, the cost of capital is projected to remain very  low, and given the usual lags, the recent sharp acceleration of business output, sales,  and cash flow should provide considerable impetus to investment spending well into  next year  Moreover, the impending expiration of the partial-expensing provision  should provide an additional fillip to spending in 2004     The household sector also has been receiving a lift from expansionary fiscal   policy  Consumer outlays soared this summer, as disposable incomes jumped in  response to lower personal income taxes  Spending hit a bit of a pothole this autumn,  but we believe that it will pick back up in coming months  The figures on motor  vehicle sales in November provide some encouragement to that view, though broader  reports on recent retail sales have been mixed  Households will receive another large  slug of disposable income in 2004 from this year’s tax legislation  Lower taxes along  with a pickup in hiring are expected to boost real disposable income by 5 percent in  2004, and real PCE is projected to increase about 4½ percent     Monetary and fiscal policy are not the only sources of upward impetus to output    Inventory dynamics should also be lifting production in coming months  Indeed over  the next four quarters, a gradual strengthening of inventory investment is expected to  add nearly ¾ percentage point to the growth of real GDP  Even that trajectory for   December 9, 2003 12 of 133    stockbuilding is sufficient only to flatten out the inventory-sales ratio by the middle  of next year at a level noticeably below our estimate of the long-run target  The  recent data suggest that manufacturers are boosting production enough both to stem  the inventory liquidation that has occurred for most of the year and to respond to the  improvement in their order books  After falling earlier this year, manufacturing IP  was up 3½ percent at an annual rate in the third quarter  And given the data in hand,  factory output is likely to increase nearly 1 percent in November and more than  5 percent at an annual rate for the fourth quarter as a whole  So even the lagging  manufacturing sector is showing reasonably widespread signs of life     Will this faster pace of overall spending and production prove to be a temporary   blip?  That possibility still can’t be ruled out  As I noted at the last meeting,  estimating the short-run consequences of the tax cuts involves more in the way of  educated guesswork than hard science  The recent softness in consumer spending  could give one pause  On the other hand, the widening scope of the economic  improvement that we are witnessing, including increased capital spending, an end to  inventory liquidation, an upturn in hiring, and rising factory output, suggest that the  forces at work are broader than just income tax cuts     Of course, even if we are roughly correct about the course of spending over the   next few quarters, our projected decline in the unemployment rate to 5¼ percent by  the end of next year could be wide of the mark  Last Friday’s report on the  November labor market provided mixed evidence on our progress  Private payrolls  rose 50,000 in November and have been increasing about 90,000 per month, on  average, over the past three months  That’s a bit less than we had incorporated in the  December Greenbook  However, the workweek increased again last month, and  aggregate hours worked actually came in a little above our expectations  Moreover,  the unemployment rate declined another tenth, to 59 percent      Our projection assumes that something akin to a cyclically normal recovery in   employment begins by midyear  Because we are assuming that the participation rate  will recover somewhat, after having fallen so much over the past few years, the  ½ percentage point decline in the unemployment rate that we are projecting is  actually a bit slower than the cyclical norm  Of course, that doesn’t mean that it  couldn’t be slower still  The timing and magnitude of the improvement in the labor  market, in addition to depending on the strength of aggregate demand, is a function of  the ability of firms to continue to extract greater efficiencies from their operations   As an empirical matter, we lack any precise gauges here, and we can’t rule out that  we have been too pessimistic about the trajectory of structural productivity  We  explored that possibility in an alternative simulation in the Greenbook  The  consequences of such an outcome are both a weaker labor market and much lower  price inflation than in our baseline projection  Although the recent data have  certainly been encouraging, the step-up in the pace of the expansion is still relatively  recent, and some combination of weaker aggregate demand and stronger aggregate  supply could result in an economy that is slower to absorb the existing slack in  resource utilization and produce even lower inflation than we are projecting   December 9, 2003 13 of 133      However, as some of you have noted, there are sizable risks on the other side of   our projection as well  Most notably, holding the real federal funds rate close to zero  for another year and then only moving it up gradually in 2005 could set off a  substantial boom in activity, higher inflation, or both  With real rates so low, why  aren’t we projecting a stronger expansion over the next two years—one perhaps that  resembles a more normal cyclical recovery?  There are several reasons  For one,  some of the usual contributors to the upsurge in activity in the early stages of  recovery are not expected to play their typical roles  In particular, outlays on housing  and consumer durables have already increased steeply over the past couple of years,  and while we expect low interest rates to help maintain that spending, we project  outlays in these areas to decelerate over the next two years  Meanwhile, some other  sectors have been and are likely to remain lackluster over the next year or so   Nonresidential construction activity still appears to be adjusting to high vacancy rates  and weak rents, and we anticipate only gradual improvement in that sector next year  and into 2005  Moreover, despite the past and prospective decline in the dollar and  the modest recovery abroad, the external sector is expected to subtract from growth  over the next two years  Finally and importantly, fiscal policy swings from a source  of considerable stimulus early next year to some small restraint in 2005  From the  perspective of our forecast, the shift in fiscal policy is doing some of the work that  would otherwise be required of monetary policy     Another concern raised about our forecast was that perhaps we will experience   more inflation with output growth that is the same or weaker than we are projecting   This implicitly is a concern that we are too optimistic, in some respect, about  aggregate supply  The outside consensus forecast appears to embody this view by  combining higher interest rates, weaker activity, and more slack, with faster inflation   The basic contour of our inflation forecast hasn’t changed since the last meeting  We  continue to expect that declining energy prices will push down headline inflation and  that core prices will increase in 2004 and 2005 at about the same pace as this year   The sources of that subdued inflation picture also remain the same  Economic slack  is expected to diminish only gradually  Rapid increases in structural labor  productivity hold down costs, and the markup of prices over unit labor costs, which  has increased sharply in recent quarters, levels out  With headline inflation coming  down, inflation expectations are anticipated to hold steady or drift lower  One hears a  variety of stories expressed to support less favorable outlooks for inflation  One  argument is that speed matters  Perhaps it is not the level of resource utilization but  the change in resource utilization that influences inflation  The problem is that we  can find little to no empirical support in the US data for this story  The economy  grew at rates well above trend in the early 1980s and early 1990s  And despite  noticeable declines in the unemployment rate, core inflation moved down, not up   That casual observation is confirmed by a lack of econometric evidence for the  existence of economically meaningful speed effects     Another concern has been that the rapid rise in commodity prices could be   signaling the emergence of more-intense inflation pressures  But it is very common   December 9, 2003 14 of 133    for commodity prices to rise sharply in the early stages of recovery without having  much influence on the prices of final goods and services  Primary commodities have  low labor content and are sold on auction markets that are very sensitive to changes in  demand  They constitute a very small share of the value added of most finished  goods and services, which typically are much more sensitive to movements in labor  costs  As an aggregate inflation shock, we believe the recent surge in commodity  prices is likely to be of minor consequence     Another possibility is that inflation expectations will deteriorate over the next   year or so in response to strong economic growth and our assumption of continued  policy patience  This would seem to be a more serious risk, and we explored its  consequences in an alternative in the Greenbook  But we don’t think that that’s the  most likely outcome  Looking at Treasury indexed securities, inflation compensation  over the next five years has moved up since the summer but only to the top end of the  range in which it has fluctuated over the past few years  Likewise, inflation  expectations from the Michigan survey have moved back up in recent months along  with energy prices, but haven’t broken out to the upside  We don’t see in our  projection the types of developments that would likely result in a serious erosion of  your credibility     Perhaps the most obvious source of upward risk to our inflation projection is that   most or all of this year’s slowing in core inflation reflected transitory factors that will  be absent or—worse yet—be reversed next year  For example, the smaller increases  in residential rents, motor vehicles, and medical services may prove short-lived  As  you know, we discounted a great deal of the slowing observed earlier this year, and  the bounceback in the data in subsequent months has been very close to our  expectations  But perhaps we haven’t discounted enough of this year’s low core  inflation  If so, then price increases next year will be higher than we are currently  projecting  However, if that were to occur, it will be important to bear in mind that  this acceleration of prices reflects the unwinding of favorable developments this year  and is not the result of an overheating economy capable of generating ongoing  increases in inflation     In summary, we acknowledge that there are very large risks to virtually every   important dimension of the staff projection  There almost always are  If it provides  you with any comfort, we have placed at the very top of our holiday wish list the  acquisition of shiny new models that will allow us to make it all clear for you in the  coming year  But barring that unlikely outcome, we will simply need to be content  knowing that, with the recent run-up of commodity prices, our lump of coal will at  least go a little bit further this year than it has in the past  [Laughter]  Karen Johnson  will now continue our presentation       Let me mention two possibilities  Just in terms of cross-country   comparisons of wage and price determination, there was a line of work that suggested that in the   United States nominal wages are sticky but real wages are flexible whereas in Europe everyone’s   wages are so tightly indexed that there is more real wage rigidity  That could lead to a situation   in which one gets something akin to hysteresis in unemployment in Europe, which in essence   says that whatever the unemployment rate has been recently is more or less the natural rate    Therefore, it becomes the changes in the unemployment rate that matter more than the level of   the unemployment rate      Let me state emphatically at the outset here that what we put down in   the Greenbook was not a policy prescription  I understand your question, but our forecast was   December 9, 2003 21 of 133    not meant to advocate a particular path or strategy for you to take  I do think, however, that it’s   not an implausible baseline assumption—obviously it’s something we arrived at in our   forecast—that the economy will be growing at potential at the end of 2005 with a real funds rate   that is still below its equilibrium  We think that, going into 2006, we will have some continued   acceleration in underlying potential output that is being driven by the speed-up in investment   spending that we expect to get over the next two years  So we believe we can enter that year   with a below-equilibrium funds rate and still not generate any acceleration of inflation until later   in 2006  This is all model construction, obviously  I’m still mostly worried about trying to   figure out what happened in the last quarter  If you’re asking me if I know with any confidence   what will happen in 2006—      But suppose at the end of 2005 the nominal funds rate is at 2 percent   and you thought that a 4 percent nominal funds rate—a 3 percent real funds rate and 1 percent   inflation—was where the rate had to go  Could this Committee raise the funds rate 200 basis   points in 2006?  I think you certainly could  You raised it 250 basis points in 1994  So you’re   not that far from equilibrium on the funds rate, given what you’ve demonstrated in the past as a   reasonable willingness to be aggressive  In 2005 as the economy slows down in accordance with   our baseline forecast—if that were to happen—I think you’re going to be confronted with some   uncertainty about what the sources of that slowdown are and how persistent they are likely to be    And that could potentially make you want to be somewhat cautious about how quickly you   remove the monetary stimulus  So that was the basic logic  We did not see this as a forecast in   which you are definitely falling way behind the curve by the end of 2006 and we see inflation   December 9, 2003 22 of 133    pressures as extremely subdued  And we didn’t see that you would have to go that far beyond   the forecast horizon to remove the remaining monetary stimulus       First of all, the standard errors are large on both the output gap and   the natural rate of unemployment     Yes  So I would certainly say that a percentage point band around   our estimate of the natural rate of unemployment is probably a one standard deviation event  As   you know, over the years we’ve made adjustments in our estimates, both for things that we could   identify in terms of structural changes in labor markets and also just to conform our estimate to   what was happening out there in the real world  So there is a lot of uncertainty about that   December 9, 2003 23 of 133    estimate  In terms of the shock effects, I tried to touch on that a little with the commodity price   comment  If we were to take literally some of our stage-of-processing type models, the run-up   we’ve had thus far in commodity prices—and we’re expecting some deceleration of that going   forward—might be worth a couple of tenths at most to final goods and services inflation     That’s for the total  That’s a pretty small effect  On the energy side,   following what we see as expectations in the futures markets, we think that energy prices are   likely to come down and that that will feed through favorably not just to indirect business costs   but also on the inflation expectations side   In terms of the effect on non-oil import prices of the decline in the dollar that has   occurred, our forecast is that, after increasing 1¾ percent this year, core non-oil import prices are   going to rise only 2 percent next year and then actually decelerate some in 2005  So that is   measured in basis points, not even tenths of a percentage point, in terms of its overall effects on   inflation  That’s just measuring the import price part alone, not necessarily how the decline of   the dollar is likely to feed through to aggregate output  So again, in our model and our forecast   of the important exogenous variables, we just don’t see the big shock coming through  I think on   the inflation expectations side there is a risk  In essence, we are assuming that next year there   will be some further edging down of inflation expectations especially as energy prices decline   and headline inflation rates recede  But that could prove to be wrong  Also, as I indicated in my   remarks, another significant risk is that we got extremely good inflation numbers in the first half   of this year and we fed a little of that through into our forecast next year  That might be   ascribing too much of a signal to the slowing we’ve seen this year, and we could get some   bounceback just from an unwinding of these favorable effects     December 9, 2003 24 of 133      Again, hard data on the magnitudes of outsourcing are not available    But I’m skeptical about that being a major impediment to employment growth  Many of these   forces have been in operation or have been under way for the past decade in a period when our   economy was generating lots of employment growth  We had a very strong manufacturing   sector and tight capacity utilization just a few years ago  So the notion that the world has   changed in such a fundamental way that an appropriately accommodative monetary policy and a   stimulative fiscal policy won’t be able to take up slack seems to me to be far-fetched  I think that   places too much emphasis on these effects    To me the more important risk to our employment forecast is that we see the level of   productivity as having moved up so much that we think it’s probably well above its structural   level  In essence we believe there will be some increased hiring in an effort to begin to relieve   pressures that have developed as businesses have pushed very hard on their existing workers and   December 9, 2003 25 of 133    facilities to improve the bottom line  Unfortunately, we can’t have much confidence in our   ability to have that gauged very well  It is possible that the stock of efficiencies for businesses to   draw on is still quite large and that the need to increase employment might be significantly less   than we’re thinking  Obviously, that doesn’t mean that policy couldn’t crowd in those jobs  If   that’s the case and the supply is in fact bigger than we think, then demand needs to be stronger to   take up the slack     I mentioned the five-year inflation expectations, in part, because we   don’t think the five-to-ten-year inflation expectations are conditioning current wage and price   setting decisions  I don’t think anybody is setting a wage contract over the next year or two or   three based on five-to-ten-year inflation expectations  But those expectations obviously would   matter for the real rate on longer-term securities  I think Brian Sack, our briefer yesterday,   December 9, 2003 27 of 133    mentioned that there is a liquidity story but that there is also a possibility that market participants   have shifted their views as to your longer-term inflation objective  It seems a bit far-fetched that   so big a change in expectations could have occurred over such a short period of time  So we’re   somewhat skeptical about that  Brian also mentioned hedging demands, but we think that was   probably a relatively short-lived effect  I don’t know whether Brian Madigan or Vincent wants   to say any more about that     We’ve certainly seen no corroboration in any other survey of   inflation expectations that there has been any deterioration     We’ve continued to tinker with both the models and our definition of   deflation since June  Let me put it on a consistent basis with the numbers we provided in June so   you can actually compare how economic events have changed those probabilities We would   calculate that the probability in 2004 that core PCE prices would be running below ½ percentage   point—which is our estimate of the measurement error and thus would be real deflation—has   fallen to about 23 percent  That probability on our June baseline forecast was 35 percent  The   probability of what we would call a more pernicious deflation—that is, prices declining on a   measurement-adjusted basis and the unemployment rate remaining at or above 6 percent in 2004   —has fallen from 7 percent to about 3½ percent  So those probabilities have receded  I’d leave   it to you to judge whether you thought those were big numbers or small numbers  But clearly the   improvement in the underlying baseline forecast has made deflation a less likely event than we   calculated in June     I think one reads and hears more about a return of pricing power than   was the case a few years ago  I’m not quite sure what that means  There has obviously been a   significant firming, as I indicated, not just in commodity prices but in intermediate materials   prices too as the economy has picked up some speed  Again, we don’t think that is going to be a   major source of positive inflation shock  But I think one hears more about pricing power there    December 9, 2003 34 of 133    There have been other areas, too  For example, in education and medical care, one never heard   that there wasn’t pricing power     I would note two things that I think are relevant  First, given the   spectacular increases in productivity, if one assigns even some small portion of that going   forward as an increase in underlying productivity, that’s still a major factor that will be relieving   cost pressures on the business side  Second, we think there were some special factors in the   second half of the 1990s  The inflation outlook that we’re showing you in this forecast is   nowhere near as benign as what happened in the late 1990s, when the unemployment rate fell   through 5 percent to below 4 percent and we didn’t get any inflation  In this forecast, with an   unemployment rate that remains at or above our estimate of the natural rate, we think we will not   be getting much further deceleration in inflation  Part of the reason relates to some of the factors   that you mentioned—for example, that on the compensation side things are going to be a bit   firmer  We think we’re not going to see much downward pressure there in part because of   medical costs and in part because employers might be relying primarily on more traditional   means of providing labor compensation  So in essence we believe that we have built into this   forecast the broader effect that you’re getting at in your question  I’m skeptical about the view   that the world has become less competitive and that there will be a return of more-significant   pricing power  If anything, I’d say that factor might be a downside risk to our inflation   projection  Given the strong burst of productivity, the markup over unit labor costs has increased   in the nonfinancial corporate sector almost back to its peak in the 1990s—a peak from which it   subsequently fell—and that was a force that contributed to disinflation in that period  So   December 9, 2003 35 of 133    although we have that markup more or less leveling out, one could just as easily imagine that   going down as up  "
7542,2004-01-27,"  I think Larry was planning on talking about it     President Poole, if we went back to June of last year and had this   conversation, you would have said suppose we had forecast for the second half of the year what   actually transpired  If the story was 6 percent GDP growth in the second half of last year, do you   January 27-28, 2004 109 of 238    think the markets would possibly have forecast us not to be tightening until late 2004?  That   might have sounded far-fetched last June, but in fact that is exactly where we are right now    There has been considerable convergence between our forecast and the market’s forecast    I take that to be in part because market participants have been surprised as well at the apparent   capacity of this economy to grow without generating significant pressures on resource utilization   and without generating significant pressures on price inflation  In fact, we view our forecast—  that we could get to the middle of this year without tightening—as not unreasonable because, if   we see some pickup in payroll employment and continued strong growth, we’re still going to be   looking at an inflation situation that looks incredibly benign  Despite the fact that the dollar has   gone down, the pass-through of that into import prices has been relatively modest, as we   discussed on Monday at the pre-FOMC briefing  The indirect effects of the jump in energy   prices that we’ve seen appear to us to be moderate, and they were quite modest previously    We’re seeing very little sign of pressures on the labor cost side either in nominal compensation   or in unit labor costs, obviously, with the strength in productivity  So, we don’t think the funds   rate path we have assumed is unreasonable; and in essence, at this point the difference between   our path and the market’s path is about 50 basis points by the end of 2005  We think the market   will continue to be surprised by a combination of strong growth in aggregate demand but with   that being matched by considerable strength in aggregate supply  We’re expecting a   continuation of the kind of convergence that we’ve seen over the last six months in their   expectations toward ours   Having said that, there’s tremendous uncertainty about how the markets will react to the   data, whether or not our forecast will be right, or whether the market’s view of underlying   economic developments will be correct  So, we feel pretty comfortable that we are putting on   January 27-28, 2004 110 of 238    the table an outlook that is not far-fetched and in fact could be quite reasonable  And I take the   behavior of financial markets over the last six months as some small evidence in support of our   position and approach       Obviously, we are looking at those signals from the market and   asking ourselves precisely those kinds of questions  We are not ignoring that  We think we have   incorporated our best judgment as to what signals the markets are sending us  It wasn’t that we   weren’t paying attention to what the market was saying in late 2000; we just had an excessively   optimistic view of what was going on  I would say that three or four months later we were   January 27-28, 2004 111 of 238    forecasting a flat funds rate going out and the markets were already forecasting an increase in   interest rates starting in the second half of 2001  We did not incorporate that market view, and in   that case I think our judgment was better  But you are right—it’s not a matter of who wins the   horse race  It’s a matter of putting on the table a vehicle that is useful for your discussions  And   as we noted in the memo, we thought we would be producing a less helpful vehicle by using   those market expectations  We cited a few examples where using the market-based funds rate   would have presented an outlook that was inconsistent with our view of the economy  There   were times that the market was forecasting a tightening of monetary policy when we viewed the   underlying strength of the economy as considerably weaker than the market thought  So if we   had taken the market’s view about interest rates with our view about how the economy was   developing, we would have produced a baseline forecast that had a tightening of the federal   funds rate with the unemployment rate rising and the inflation rate continuing to come down    That did not seem likely to be the most helpful vehicle for organizing your discussion   As David Wilcox and I noted in our memo, the information content of the staff’s forecast   is pretty much independent of the assumed funds rate path  We could write down an infinite   number of funds rate paths and an infinite number of GDP, inflation, and employment paths to   go along with that  The fundamental information that we would be bringing to the table would   be the same in each one of those various simulations  The issue is where you want to begin in   terms of the framework on which to base your discussions, and I think that’s a matter of taste on   your parts  We’ve tried to address some of your concerns by putting on the table some   alternatives, and at times we’ve provided a market-based funds rate scenario  At other times   we’ve recognized that many of you might be wondering what the outlook would be if the fed   January 27-28, 2004 112 of 238    funds rate were held constant throughout the forecast period—that in some sense that could be   more helpful in your discussions  That’s where we come out at this point     I would just add a comment on the house-price side  I would say that   a year and a half or two years ago we were very skeptical about house prices having more frothy   characteristics  We are quite happy to see a slowing in house-price appreciation  House prices   have moved high relative to rents, and I think we are a little less confident about those being at   full equilibrium  If anything, we would be a little worried about the risks of a sharper   deceleration  It is quite rare for aggregate national house prices actually to turn down, but I don’t   think we could rule out a period of extended flatness in real estate prices going forward  And   that would put more pressure on household balance sheets than is incorporated in the baseline   forecast    January 27-28, 2004 114 of 238      Well, even these rates of house-price appreciation are faster than the   growth rates that we’ve seen in nominal rents so far  So we’ve got to get that part down into a   sort of balance before we even have the ratio of house prices to rents flattening out some     I’m not sure  There wouldn’t necessarily be any linkages  There is   some substitution but—      On the margin that could certainly be a factor  My guess is that it   wouldn’t explain the basic divergence we’ve seen between house prices and rents     Obviously, in terms of our understanding how much productivity and   efficiency gains are still there to be harvested—let’s say one-time increases—we have almost   nothing upon which to gauge that  We can talk to businesses or try to undertake econometric   estimates, but we have been consistently surprised over the course of the last two years by the   performance of productivity  One of the biggest challenges in putting together the forecast has   been to try to assess how much of what we’ve seen in productivity is going to be sustainable   growth going forward  We don’t know how much was a series of one-time adjustments that   firms accumulated over the late 1990s through tremendous amounts of capital investments or   how technology may have offered organizational efficiencies that businesses are just being able   to take advantage of     I don’t think we have very much confidence at all in our ability to pinpoint the quarter or   even half-year in which that stock of efficiencies will play out  Could that go on for another   year?  I think that’s certainly possible, and one of the simulations we had in the Greenbook was   in essence a higher level of productivity prospectively  What that forecast produced was a   weaker labor market, higher unemployment, and lower inflation than we are showing in the   baseline  I think you have to give that some reasonable probability weight in your thinking about   how the employment situation is likely to progress    On the other hand, as hard as it is to believe that there are upside risks to our productivity   forecast, that also remains a possibility  A year or so ago productivity turned out to be much   stronger than we thought  So it may be that over the second half of last year there was in fact an   January 27-28, 2004 119 of 238    improvement in underlying productivity that was being recognized by businesses and households   and those entities really did step up their spending quite significantly  And it may be that what   we are seeing now is just not a terribly unusual lag between that step-up in output growth and a   pickup in employment and that we will soon start to see a more significant increase in jobs    Taking our models that use labor market indicators—such as initial claims, layoff   announcements, and past payroll employment gains—we don’t need to see any further   improvement in those indicators to get job growth on the order of the 150,000 per month that we   are forecasting for the first half  Those same models have been predicting better employment   gains than we’ve seen for the last six months  So there are still some very significant risks, and I   think that your queasiness about the extent of this step-up is well founded because of our   inability to be able to pinpoint precisely when those productivity opportunities will for the most   part have played out  "
7543,2004-01-27,"  The revision principally has to do with a sort of respecification of the   model rather than objective changes in economic circumstances  As Vincent said, a significant   chunk of that came about by how we were modeling the term structure premium  So I think that   upward revision should not be taken as a change in economic circumstances  On the other hand,   from your perspective of how far the rate is from what that model estimates the equilibrium rate   to be, the distance is wider  "
7594,2004-03-16,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  As usual, we have received a  mixed bag of data since the January FOMC meeting  Over most of the past six  months, when we said “mixed” data, we generally meant data that were either  stronger than we had expected or that were a lot stronger than we had expected   By contrast, during this intermeeting period, we received figures on both sides of our  January projection  As you know, on net, we read the incoming information on labor  markets, production, and spending as suggesting that there was somewhat less  upward momentum to activity than we had previously thought  Our largest  disappointment was centered in the labor market  Private nonfarm payrolls were flat  in February and have been increasing at a pace of only about 65,000 per month since  the upturn in hiring began last September  That is well below the pace we had  envisioned several months ago  To be sure, initial claims for unemployment   March 16, 2004 11 of 107    insurance since the turn of the year have fluctuated in a range that in the past was  associated with stronger employment gains than we have experienced to date  But  those data likely reflect a decline in layoffs, and we have scant evidence, as yet, that  new hiring has picked up materially  There have been a few hopeful signs in the  recent data  Temporary-help employment has been trending higher since last spring,  and the average workweek has moved up since the turn of the year  But those looked  to us to be thin reeds on which to rest our earlier projection  As a consequence, we  marked down considerably our projected improvement in employment over the first  half of the year, and along with that lower employment path, we reduced the  projected growth of hours worked     If the pattern of the past couple of years had been repeated, this would have been   yet another occasion for a weak labor market report to result in a further upward  revision to productivity  But this time, somewhat softer readings on manufacturing  production and on spending persuaded us to revise down our projection of the growth  of real GDP by about as much as we revised hours, leaving our productivity  projection about unchanged  Among the slightly softer indicators that influenced our  thinking was manufacturing IP  Despite an increase of 08 percent in February,  smaller gains in December and January took down our projected increase in factory  output in the current quarter from 7 percent at an annual rate to 6 percent  Obviously,  this is a revision best viewed as one of quantitative degree rather than one of  qualitative substance  The anecdotal reports still seem to signal steady improvement  in the manufacturing sector  We just don’t see quite the degree of vigor that earlier  indicators had suggested     We also have had, on net, some negative surprises in the spending data  Perhaps   consistent with the slightly softer readings on IP, both exports and inventory  investment have come in below our expectations  The weakness in inventory  investment is somewhat surprising to us in light of the low carrying costs of  inventories  We have heard reports that some firms have encountered difficulties  acquiring needed materials and some discontent on the part of businesses with  breakdowns in their just-in-time inventory arrangements  These difficulties may have  held down inventory investment  But we don’t believe this is a phenomenon with  sufficient breadth or magnitude to explain the meager additions that firms have made  to their inventories in recent months  Instead, we think the subdued pace of  stockbuilding likely reflects the same continued cautious behavior on the part of  businesses that is evident in their hiring decisions     The single largest source of downward revision to our GDP projection has been   construction activity, where the recent data have come in below expectations for the  residential, nonresidential, and state and local sectors  To be sure, we had anticipated  some falloff in residential construction from the torrid pace set late last year  But the  drop-off in starts in January, especially in the single-family sector, was larger than we  had penciled in  Moreover, sales of new and existing homes also fell significantly,  and as a consequence, the commissions on those sales, which are part of GDP,  amplified the slowdown of spending in this sector  Homebuilding figures for   March 16, 2004 12 of 107    February were released this morning, and those data show another drop in single- family starts—from an upward-revised figure of 155 million units in January to  149 million units in February  Nevertheless, permits have remained quite firm, and  they point to some bounceback in construction in coming months  All told, these data  might take a tenth off of our current-quarter GDP projection  Nonresidential  construction activity also has come in below expectations  Construction of office  buildings, commercial structures, and manufacturing facilities continues to contract   Although there are faint signs of improvement, vacancy rates remain high and rents  soft  Meanwhile, although budget conditions are improving among state  governments, funds are still very tight, and these entities have further trimmed their  construction spending     The only other notable area of greater-than-expected softness has been spending   on light motor vehicles  Sales averaged about 16¼ million units in January and  February, about ½ million units below our previous projection  At the same time,  production of light vehicles has come in above our expectations  As a consequence,  inventories appear a bit high to us  In the projection, we resolve that tension through  a combination of production restraint and a pickup in sales that is induced in part by a  sweetening of incentives     It is important to note that not all of the news over the past seven weeks was   negative  Excluding motor vehicles, consumer spending was actually a bit stronger  than we had expected  And business outlays for equipment and software were  noticeably stronger in both the fourth and first quarters than we had projected in  January  High-tech spending has continued to increase rapidly, while spending on  capital equipment outside of high-tech and transportation has posted a marked  acceleration in recent months  As you know, equipment spending had appeared to us  to have been unusually weak over the past year or so given our view of the key  fundamentals—a low cost of capital, accelerating final sales, and ample increases in  cash flow  That gap is now closing, and along with the continued boost from the  partial-expensing provision, we are projecting that real E&S will maintain double- digit gains through the end of the year     Taken together, the incoming data led us to revise down the projected growth of   real GDP by a little more than ½ percentage point at an annual rate in the first half of  this year, after a bit larger revision in the fourth quarter of last year  All else being  equal, multiplier effects would have argued for a lower growth rate in the second half  of this year as well  However, the substantial rally that has occurred in the bond  markets in recent weeks led us to mark down our projected path for long-term interest  rates, and those lower rates are expected to provide a considerable cushion to  spending going forward  Still, we do have on net a lower level of real GDP, and  hence a higher output gap, throughout the projection period compared with our  previous forecast  Whereas in January, the output gap was nearly eliminated by late  next year, in the present forecast that gap remains at nearly ¾ percent of potential  GDP at the end of 2005      March 16, 2004 13 of 107    With more slack in resource utilization, you might have expected to see somewhat  lower inflation in this projection  That effect, however, was offset by several  countervailing considerations  First, the incoming data on core inflation were a bit  above our expectations in recent months  Moreover, oil prices have moved up  sharply and are expected to stay higher for longer than in our January forecast  And  finally, the prices of non-oil imports have increased more rapidly of late than we had  anticipated earlier The bottom line is that we still expect core PCE prices to increase  about 1 percent this year and next     Stepping back from the details of the forecast, we continue to believe that the data   and the anecdotes are consistent with an economy that is expanding fast enough to  take up slack in the economy’s utilization of resources  We expect fiscal stimulus,  accommodative monetary policy, and ongoing rapid gains in structural productivity to  sustain a brisk expansion through the end of next year  Coming as it has on the heels  of an extended period of mostly upside surprises, the events of the past seven weeks,  including last week’s bombing in Spain, have clearly restored a sense of two-way risk  to the outlook  Just how large are those risks?  Well, that’s a question that we have  been working to answer more precisely for you     As you know, we included confidence intervals around some key variables in our   forecast as a standard feature for the first time in this Greenbook  Over the past few  years, we have shifted somewhat the emphasis of our forecast presentation away from  a single narrative focused on explaining the baseline projection toward inclusion of  more material highlighting some of the chief risks surrounding the economic outlook   The presentation of confidence intervals for the projection seemed to us a logical  extension of that effort  We have calculated those confidence intervals both using the  real-time track record of the staff forecast and using stochastic simulations of our  large-scale econometric model  We thought several purposes could be served by  including these measures in the Greenbook       One very important purpose is to illustrate how much uncertainty surrounds the   staff baseline projection  For this purpose, the confidence intervals calculated using  the actual forecast record of the staff projection would seem the most informative  measures  Those intervals are, indeed, wide  The 70 percent confidence interval  around our projection of a 5¼ percent unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of  2005 runs from 4¼ percent to 6 percent  Similarly, the 70 percent confidence interval  around our forecast of a 1 percent increase in core PCE prices in 2005 runs from  about zero to 2 percent  And it is important to remember that this implies that there is  a 30 percent chance that the actual outcome will lie outside these bounds  The width  of these bands does provide me with one small consolation  When asked in the past  how confident I have been about various aspects of our projection, I believe the  record will show that I have almost consistently responded “not very”  It looks as  though I’ll be pretty safe sticking to that answer  [Laughter]     We also included in the table and as fan charts confidence intervals generated by   stochastic simulation of FRB/US  The reason that we have added this second   March 16, 2004 14 of 107    approach to the mix is that it allows us to undertake calculations that cannot be  performed with the Greenbook forecast errors  For example, we can decompose  sources of forecast uncertainty in the way that we did recently in a pre-FOMC  briefing for the Board, breaking out inflation uncertainty into uncertainty about  supply, demand, and the unexplained equation residual  This approach also provides  us with an ability to compute certain conditional probabilities—for example,  probabilities of deflation under different monetary policies  We have provided some  of this material to the Committee in the recent past, and we anticipate doing more of  the same in the future     We also will continue to plot in the fan charts the alternative scenarios that we   present in the Greenbook  Like the confidence intervals displayed in those charts, the  alternative simulations are generated using our large-scale model  A number of you  have remarked on occasion that, after reading the descriptions of the alternative  scenarios, you were surprised to see that all we got on GDP growth or the  unemployment rate were a few lousy tenths and, in most scenarios, considerably less  than that on the inflation rate  I have noted in response that a drawback to the  alternative scenarios is that they do not account for all of the covariation in the shocks  to which the economy is subjected  The confidence intervals generated by stochastic  simulations do just that  By placing the alternative scenarios in the fan charts, we  hope to provide you with a better perspective on just how much of the probability  space we are exploring with those alternatives      Finally, the confidence intervals may provide a context for the Committee to   consider the uncertainty surrounding the projections that you include in the Monetary  Policy Report to the Congress  As you know, those forecasts are presented as ranges  and central tendencies  But, of course, ranges and central tendencies are measures of  forecast consensus, not measures of forecast uncertainty  Based on our past forecast  errors, the 70 percent confidence interval surrounding our forecast of the  unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of this year is about 1¼ percentage points  wide; in contrast, the width of the FOMC’s forecast range of the unemployment rate  in the fourth quarter of this year was just ¼ percentage point wide  So, while there is  considerable consensus on the Committee about the expected unemployment rate late  this year, there is probably much greater uncertainty associated with each of your  individual forecasts     Needless to say, advertising our ignorance in such an explicit fashion gave us   some pause  But given the increasing prevalence of product liability lawsuits, we  thought some appropriate warning on the Greenbook forecast was warranted   Perhaps the confidence intervals should be viewed as something like a warning label  that reads, “Do not operate large economies while under the influence of a baseline  projection alone”  Karen will now continue our presentation         It’s a deceleration, not actually a decline, in productivity  That   deceleration in productivity is a function of the fact that by our reading, even with what we   consider to be a fairly optimistic view on the growth of potential output, the level of productivity   is above its long-run trend  This pattern looks to us like standard cyclical behavior  What we   have is a deceleration in productivity as it goes from above trend back toward trend  That results   in a slowdown in the growth of productivity and accounts for the step-up in payroll employment   that we believe will occur  Again, that looks to us to be consistent with the cyclical time series   performance of productivity around a spline function type trend, which is basically the way we   put together the longer-run productivity forecast  So as many of you have noted over the past   year or so, that forecast incorporates a significant element of risk  It certainly has been an area   where we have been wrong and wrong rather consistently in one direction over this particular   period—that is, in anticipating that some of what we perceive to be cyclical increases in   productivity are going to abate going forward  As I think I responded to President Minehan at   the last meeting, we really just don’t have a lot to go on in terms of gauging how much of a   backlog of one-time efficiency improvements still exists out there  So in writing down these   figures in our forecast, we are trying to blend some judgment and some econometrics  But this is   indeed an area where our confidence is not terribly high     That would be an average over a long period of time whereas this   would be a relatively brief period of somewhat lower cyclical growth  On the inflation point, I   would just note that we don’t think there is a big effect on prices from swings in unit labor costs   that are associated with cyclical movements in productivity  We tend to believe that firms in   their pricing behavior try to look through cyclical movements  So the implicit acceleration in   unit labor costs that is incorporated in this projection does not exert much upward pressure on   inflation     Right, employment and profits both  I think in some sense in the   forecast we have a cyclical slowing in profits that also looks to us to be fairly typical  What we   typically see is a big increase in profits when productivity is soaring in the early stages of a   business cycle and then, as productivity slows down, profits growth slows as well and the labor   share begins to recover  Admittedly this cycle has been one where everything has been more   drawn out, so to speak, than has been the case in the past  And because of that we feel much less   confidence in gauging the timing of that cyclical slowing in productivity     That’s a very real possibility     Actually, I’d have to go back and ask our model folks because it’s in   terms of the implicit inflation expectation that is embedded in that model      I’m sure it’s lower than 2½ percent      We highlighted this scenario in part because the model probably   incorporates lower inflation expectations than those of some market participants  And in light of   the decline in the dollar and the acceleration of commodity prices, there are at least a few straws   in the wind that suggest that perhaps inflation will not be as sanguine as we are forecasting  So   we wanted to highlight that possibility to some extent  But I think you’re absolutely right   Around our baseline forecast we see that risk balanced against a risk that inflation expectations   could come down further and maybe even considerably further  If our inflation forecast begins   to materialize in the data—surprising people in terms of how benign the behavior of prices will   be—inflation expectations could decline  And if the increase in commodity prices and the   March 16, 2004 22 of 107    decline in the dollar really are not providing much upward impetus to inflation, one could see a   break to the downside as well   As we noted in the Greenbook, another downside risk that we see on the inflation side is   that the markup over unit labor costs looks very high to us and that’s associated with strong   profitability as well  We have that only tipping down over the forecast period, in part owing to   the assumed deceleration in productivity  It’s certainly possible, though, that we could get a   sharper decline as competitive pressures put more downward pressure on the price markup  That   would be another source of significantly lower inflation going forward  So while we view the   risks as reasonably balanced, we certainly think we could have declining inflation expectations   as well as increasing expectations     We have interpreted this downturn in labor force participation as   principally a cyclical phenomenon  Nevertheless, we have revised down the level that we think   the labor force participation will eventually return to; we’ve revised that down in light of the   employment data  But the basic message of our forecast is that a lot of the people who have   March 16, 2004 23 of 107    withdrawn from the labor market will make themselves available again when the economy and   job prospects begin to improve     Admittedly, we can’t see that from the discouragement data because, as you point out, the   reasons people give for leaving the labor force include leaving for school or to take care of home   responsibilities  And an increasing number of people are reporting that they are retired  So it’s   possible that the reduced labor force participation will prove to be more persistent than we are   anticipating  If that’s the case, then in essence there is less slack in our baseline forecast  If we   get our growth forecast along with less of a bounceback in labor force participation, there will be   a bigger decline in the unemployment rate than we’re showing, and the labor markets could   tighten more immediately  The result would be greater pressure on inflation than we’re showing     I was going to say that I feel reasonably confident, but I guess I should strike that word   from my lexicon, so I will say that we feel comfortable in our belief that a significant part of this   downturn in participation will prove to have been cyclical  That’s in part because of the timing   of the downturn  The peak in participation coincided so closely with the peak in the tightness of   the labor markets and the deterioration coincided so closely with the period of persistently weak   labor markets that it’s hard to think that it was not cyclical  It would be difficult to consider it a   coincidence that the trend turned significantly downward starting right at the peak of the business   cycle  But obviously that remains a risk  We see the risks in this aspect of the projection more   as one in which labor markets could tighten more quickly than we’re forecasting     Yes  Part of the complication that has arisen in doing this analysis is   that the questions in the household survey on labor force participation were changed in the mid-  March 16, 2004 24 of 107    1990s, as you know  Consequently, we have no cyclical experience in terms of how people   actually were responding to these questions about being in the labor force and why they were in   or out of the labor force  So we’re uncomfortable with our ability to look at past cyclical   patterns and draw a lot of inferences from that going forward     Yes, Bill has been working on the issue  But ultimately, though we   may be able to draw some inferences, it’s going to be hard to believe—given that the questions   were changed—that we’re getting something that tracks very closely with past cyclical behavior    But he is attempting to do that decomposition  "
7645,2004-05-04,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  After countless meetings and much  effort to assemble the Greenbook over the past few weeks, I must admit that it was  disappointing to come to work last Thursday to find that our forecast had a half-life  shorter than a jar of mayonnaise in the Mojave Desert  [Laughter]  As you know, the  BEA reported that their advance estimate of the growth in real GDP in the first  quarter was 42 percent at an annual rate—a full percentage point less than the  forecast that we had published only the day before  We spent the last few days poring  over the details of that release in order to assess its implications for understanding  where the economy has been and where it might be going  That task was made  somewhat simpler by the fact that so much of our error was concentrated in inventory  investment  Indeed, our projected increase in final sales for the first quarter of  4¼ percent at an annual rate was only slightly above the BEA’s estimate of a  4 percent increase, with small differences spread out over several categories of  spending  And after incorporating yesterday’s data on construction outlays, the BEA  would likely raise its estimate of the growth of final sales close to our April forecast       The inventory discrepancy, however, was more consequential  We had been   anticipating nonfarm inventory investment to contribute 1 percentage point to the  growth of real GDP in the first quarter, while the BEA is now estimating that  contribution to be just ¼ percentage point  About two-thirds of our miss was in  accounting for truck inventories, which might seem surprising given that we have  reasonably good data on the number of vehicles held in inventory  Unfortunately, the  BEA does not use a straightforward translation of those data to estimate inventory  investment for trucks  And it appears that our attempts to mimic the more  complicated BEA procedures led us far off track last quarter  I hope that you will  take it as a sign of mercy and not disrespect if I spare you from the details  But in the  final analysis, we saw nothing in last week’s data that would lead us to alter our  forecast of truck production for the year as a whole  Hence, we believe that, to a first  approximation, what was lost in real GDP in the first quarter from truck inventories  will be made up later in the year, starting in the current quarter  Owing in part to a  smaller estimated drag from the motor vehicle sector, we have boosted our projected  increase in real GDP in the second quarter to 5 percent from the 4½ percent figure  that we published in the Greenbook  Our miss, however, was not confined to motor  vehicle inventories  Other inventory investment also came in below our expectation,  and here we do see the data as having some information content  The BEA’s  translation of the book value figures shows a continued liquidation of real non-auto  inventories rather than the stabilization that we had anticipated  In response to this  apparent continued reluctance by firms to restock, we are inclined to stretch out the   May 4, 2004 13 of 112       rebound in inventory investment that we had been projecting to occur over the  remainder of this year and into 2005  That adjustment knocks a tenth off GDP  growth this year and adds a tenth to growth next year relative to last Thursday’s  Greenbook       At this point, you are probably beginning to wonder where the mercy is that I had   promised earlier, so I’ll leave the trees and return to the forest  And I must say, the  forest is looking pretty good  Much as we expected, accommodative monetary policy  and a third consecutive year of substantial fiscal stimulus are combining to provide a  sizable boost to growth  Importantly, the labor market is beginning to show broader  signs of life  Private payrolls rose 160,000 per month, on average, in the first quarter,  up from the 60,000 per month pace of the fourth quarter  Hiring intentions as  reported by Manpower and in the NFIB survey of small businesses also have been  moving up in recent months  Even households’ assessments of current labor market  conditions have improved some of late  That said, we still believe that it is premature  to conclude that the employment situation is firmly on the path of steady  improvement  The events of last autumn come to mind  As you may recall, the  October employment report showed two consecutive increases in private payrolls  close to 120,000 per month, with noticeable upward revisions to preceding months   The long-awaited jobs recovery looked to be under way  But by the December report,  those large gains had been revised down substantially, and the initial estimate for  December was an increase of just 5,000 jobs  So, the March employment report  should be viewed as encouraging but not definitive       The gains in wage and salary income associated with the recent pickup in hiring   have combined with the stimulative effect of last year’s tax cuts to provide a  substantial lift to household buying power  And households have not been shy about  using that buying power  Despite a drop in sales of new motor vehicles, total  consumer spending rose 4 percent in the first quarter; and with car sales projected to  move up a bit, we expect real PCE to climb at a pace of about 5 percent in the second  quarter  Housing activity has remained exceptionally robust, with both sales and  construction of new homes at or near record highs  Business spending, too, has  continued to increase sharply  Real outlays for equipment and software rose  12 percent in the first quarter, and with order backlogs for capital equipment  continuing to rise, the outlook remains quite favorable      The economy finally appears to be firing on all cylinders  Low real interest rates,   tax cuts, and large increases in government spending are fueling aggregate demand,  and final sales are advancing briskly  Add to that mix what appear to us to be very  lean inventories, and there is considerable tinder for an even hotter economy than we  are projecting—a possibility that we explored in an alternative simulation in the  Greenbook  Nevertheless, I don’t think that you should discount the downside risks  surrounding the outlook just yet  As I noted earlier, the improvement in the labor  market must still be considered tentative, and the ongoing liquidation of inventories  could be a sign that business caution, while fading, has not yet evaporated  Even  extracting the signal from the strengthening of final sales over the past year is not   May 4, 2004 14 of 112       straightforward  Fiscal policy could be proving a more potent source of stimulus to  the economy than we have allowed for in our forecast, and thus as this stimulus shifts  to restraint next year, the downdraft in demand could be more pronounced than we  currently expect  Needless to say, we believe that we have balanced the risks in our  forecast for real activity, but the uncertainties remain substantial       Perhaps the biggest challenge to our forecast over the intermeeting period came   not from the real-side data but rather from the inflation figures  With only a few  exceptions, the readings that we received on hourly labor compensation and prices  were to the high side of our projection  As usual, we can trot out a list of special  factors that contributed to some of the fluctuations that have occurred over the past  six months  Used cars, apparel, and lodging away from home are among the culprits  in the recent pickup in inflation  But the breadth of the surprises that we have  experienced thus far this year suggested to us that recent wage and price  developments could not prudently be ascribed to special factors alone     Confronted with last year’s sharp decline in price inflation, we had to make an   assessment at the turn of the year as to how much of that deceleration reflected a  signal about underlying inflation and how much was just noise  We view the recent  data as suggesting that we attached too much weight to last year’s slowdown and that  the underlying inflation rate has been above our earlier estimate  As a consequence,  we increased our projection of core consumer prices by between ¼ and ½ percentage  point, on average, this year and next  I should note that, in response to this upward  revision to inflation, we also raised our funds rate path by a similar amount      Although we raised the level of projected inflation in this forecast, we did not   fundamentally change its trajectory  So after a bulge in the first half of this year, core  PCE price inflation is projected to move sideways at a 1¼ percent annual pace over  the remainder of the projection period  That flat path for inflation reflects influences  that are individually small and generally offsetting in our forecast  Over the next year  and a half, some upward pressure on costs results from a diminishing margin of slack  in resource utilization and an end to the acceleration of structural productivity  But  the indirect effects of the expected retreat in energy prices and a flattening out of core  non-oil import prices after this year’s commodity-induced surge are expected to take  some pressure off core inflation in 2005       Obviously, there is plenty of scope to take issue with the assumptions   conditioning our inflation projection  Slack could be taken up more rapidly than we  expect, especially if labor force participation fails to rebound as anticipated  Energy  prices have disappointed both the futures markets and us over the past year by  moving up, rather than down  Strong global demand and continuing geopolitical  uncertainties could keep prices in these markets higher and for longer than is  incorporated in our forecast  And if the dollar were to resume a sharper descent,  prices of imported goods and services would rise more quickly than projected, and  domestic producers would have still greater latitude to lift their prices     May 4, 2004 15 of 112       There are other risks to our inflation outlook as well  For example, despite the  upward revision that we have made, our forecast still reads some signal in last year’s  disinflation  If all of the price deceleration last year was noise, then our projection of  core consumer prices remains between ¼ and ½ percentage point too low going  forward  A more troubling possibility is that we have fundamentally misestimated  the amount of resource slack in the economy  The most prominent error made by  inflation forecasters in the late 1960s and 1970s was a persistent over-optimism about  the NAIRU  That over-optimism had two consequences, both of which were adverse  for inflation  First, the economy was allowed to overshoot potential, resulting in a  demand-driven increase in price inflation  And second, a failure to recognize and  lean against that demand-driven acceleration in prices resulted in higher inflation  becoming more firmly embedded in expectations       There is some evidence to support these concerns  A number of you have   reported hearing stories from employers that finding workers with the right skills is  difficult; if those types of mismatches are widespread, then the NAIRU may indeed  be higher than we currently estimate  The evidence on inflation expectations is  mixed  But depending on one’s preferred measure, those expectations have been  stable to somewhat higher in recent months  We explored the consequences of a  higher NAIRU in an alternative simulation in the Greenbook  In that simulation, core  PCE inflation increases to around 2 percent in 2005 and would continue to increase  beyond the forecast horizon without an adjustment to policy  While a higher NAIRU  is as a possibility, we don=t believe that it fits all of the facts comfortably   Importantly, measures of hourly labor compensation have been running at or slightly  below our models, on average, over the past two years—models that incorporate a  5 percent NAIRU  And while there has been some improvement, the labor market  still looks more lackluster than hot       I don’t want to leave you with the impression that we see the risks to inflation as   skewed to the upside  After a year of very subdued readings on core inflation, the last  three months of larger increase may ultimately prove to be the outliers, and our  upward revision to the inflation forecast this round may turn out to have been an  overreaction  Moreover, models that incorporate a role for the level of the price  markup suggest noticeable downside risk to our inflation forecast  The extraordinary  gains in productivity over the past few years have allowed firms to rebuild profit  margins back to the peak levels observed in 1997  In our forecast, these margins  narrow only a bit over the next two years, as unit labor costs accelerate gradually and  price inflation remains roughly stable  Models that assign a bigger role to the price  markup expect competitive pressures to eventually result in both faster wage growth  and lower price inflation, and thus a more rapid return of labor’s share of income to  its historical norm  A scenario along these lines in the Greenbook pushed core PCE  inflation down to ½ percent in 2005       In sum, I know that as the nation’s chief worriers you don’t need the staff to   explain to you that the backlog of unresolved worries remains high  As always,  economic, financial, and geopolitical uncertainties abound  But in surveying the   May 4, 2004 16 of 112       economic landscape, one cannot help but be struck with how conventional, familiar,  and balanced the risks and uncertainties look today in comparison with those that we  faced just a year ago  Karen will continue our presentation         No, we don’t have the report on General Motors yet    "
7694,2004-06-29,"  I would just add, though, that in the case of this asset preference   shock that Karen noted, we are going to have higher real interest rates, which will crowd out a   certain amount of interest-sensitive spending  Some of that will fall on housing investment and   some on consumer durables, but some of it will fall on business fixed investment as well     In that short a time period     And in 1986 we sat here and had a conversation—one in which I   actually participated, sort of in Linda’s role—and tried to ferret out what the consequences were   June 29-30, 2004 44 of 203          going to be of the dollar depreciation that was in train and how much dislocation there would be    We were all concerned about whether there would be enough domestic capacity to meet the shift   in demand that was going to take place toward tradable goods and away from other goods  We   wrung our hands a fair amount about that  But in retrospect, it’s clear that there’s a lot of   flexibility in the US economy  And given that the shock took place over 2½ years, there was in   a sense plenty of opportunity, therefore, for the private economy to respond more smoothly to it    So there was less risk associated with the rising risk premium in financial markets  That process   occurred more smoothly, I think, than we thought was likely to be the case ahead of time   "
7695,2004-06-29,"  My recollection is as well, from the general Greenbook projections we   do, that the sizes of the confidence intervals around our core CPI forecast are similar to those around   our core PCE forecast     Governor Gramlich, those figures did get our attention, though  There   were upward revisions to the nonfarm business comp hours starting in the fourth quarter of last year,   and we also missed on the ECI in the first quarter—it came in higher than we had projected  That   was one of the factors that prompted us to go back and look at our estimates of both the NAIRU and   potential output  We made a very marginal, almost cosmetic, upward revision to our estimate of the   NAIRU—we raised it by just a tenth—but we also revised down potential output just because we   June 29-30, 2004 86 of 203          thought the overall constellation of wage and price data was more negative than we had anticipated,   given our previous estimates of the levels of potential output and the gap  So I think we’ve tried to   respond to that, but it was something we found troubling vis-à-vis the views that we held in April     I’d say that two factors are behind the revisions we made to the federal   funds rate assumptions that underlie our forecast  One, importantly, was the downward revisions   we made to potential output  In essence, those downward revisions suggested to us that you needed   to be closer to neutral by the end of our forecast period than we had previously assumed  A piece of   that—and these are all simultaneously determined within our forecasting system—was that the   inflation figures were higher as well  We didn’t think that revising up our inflation forecast as much   as we did, without making a corresponding adjustment to the federal funds rate—and therefore   allowing the real federal funds rate to be on a weaker path than we had in the last forecast—would   be warranted  So the higher inflation and the lower estimate of potential output suggested to us that   the underlying path for the funds rate probably needed to be steeper than we had been assuming   previously     Obviously, it depends a little on whether rates move up earlier in our   projection period or later  My guess is that if there were a significant surprise on long-term interest   rates next year, most of the impact of that would probably be felt late in the year and moving into   2006  "
7799,2004-09-21,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Judging by the standards of the  last few meetings, perhaps the biggest news is that we have made no major changes  to our Greenbook forecast since it was published last Wednesday  Of course, I’ll  admit that it helps when there are few data to get in our way  But even reaching back  to the August projection, much of the incoming data on production and spending  have, on balance, come in pretty much in line with our earlier expectations that the  expansion would regain its footing as we moved into the second half  Indeed, last  week’s release of industrial production indicates that a solid expansion remains under  way in the factory sector  Manufacturing output increased ½ percent last month after  an upward-revised increase of nearly 1 percent in July, and gains in recent months  have been widespread across industries  Reports from regional and national  purchasing managers have been similarly upbeat  For the quarter as a whole, factory  output appears likely to increase 6¼ percent at an annual rate       Likewise, the spending data have, for the most part, remained firm  Purchases of   light motor vehicles averaged nearly 17 million units at an annual rate in July and  August, about ½ million units above the pace of the first half of the year  These  figures along with the retail sales data put real PCE on track for a 3¾ percent increase  in the current quarter, considerably faster than the 1½ percent pace registered in the  second quarter  Housing starts—just released this morning—reached 2 million units  at an annual rate in August  Ongoing strength was especially evident in the single-  September 21, 2004 14 of 100          family sector, where starts edged up to 167 million units from an already elevated  level  Business spending, as well, looks to be advancing smartly  Orders and  shipments for a broad variety of capital goods have been moving up, and backlogs of  unfilled orders in many industries have continued to mount  Real spending on  equipment and software is projected to increase 13 percent in the current quarter,  about in line with the sizable second-quarter advance  Meanwhile, nonresidential  construction activity has surprised us to the upside, and the odds are looking better  for a continuation of the recovery that appears to have gotten under way earlier this  year  Even the government is chipping in, led by a surge in current-quarter outlays  for defense  All in all, the catalogue of positive developments has been encouraging  that the expansion is not faltering  On balance, the incoming data leave our estimate  for the level of real GDP in the current quarter about the same as projected in the  August Greenbook     If that is all that had transpired over the past six weeks, this would have been a   reasonably quiet forecast round  But it was not  At the considerable risk of finding  myself classified in the taxonomy of Governor Schwarzenegger as an economic  girlie-man, [laughter] let me admit to harboring some pessimistic perspectives on  recent developments  While near-term GDP was not much affected by the incoming  data, we had to deal with a slug of incoming information that suggested to us that the  economy has less momentum going forward than we had previously been expecting   Chief among our concerns has been the employment situation  Gains in payroll  employment in recent months have been well short of our earlier expectations  At the  time of the August Greenbook, we were projecting employment gains to average  about 300,000 per month in the second half  With two months of data now in hand,  private payrolls appear more likely to increase in the neighborhood of 120,000 per  month in the current quarter, and we have lowered our fourth-quarter projection to  gains of 200,000 per month  A higher workweek and somewhat larger increases in  average hourly earnings have provided some offset to the weak hiring, but we still  have a substantial shortfall in labor income in recent months relative to our August  expectations  In addition, wage and salary income was revised down considerably in  the first half of this year on the basis of unemployment insurance tax records  Those  revisions and the weaker employment gains of recent months have pushed the  personal saving rate below 1 percent in the current quarter—nearly ¾ percentage  point below our August projection  All else being equal, the lower level of income  implies somewhat greater restraint on consumption going forward, and thus a steeper  rise in the saving rate than we had incorporated in our previous projection      Another negative for the outlook was the loss of prospective stimulus from   inventory investment  The pace of stockbuilding in the second quarter of this year  now appears to have been considerably faster than was estimated last month  That  step-up in the pace of stockbuilding along with weaker final sales appears to have  brought inventories into more comfortable alignment with sales sooner than we had  been expecting  Indeed, in our August projection, inventory investment was a source  of stimulus to production in the second half of this year  It now appears that the bulk   September 21, 2004 15 of 100          of that stimulus is already behind us  We have also had to contend with less  favorable news from the technology sector  The recent shipments figures for  computers and communications equipment were to the soft side of our expectations   Moreover, reports from a number of leading technology companies have been  relatively downbeat about the outlook for earnings and sales  Intel, Cisco, and  Gartner Group have all indicated some deterioration in near-term prospects  There  has also been a noticeable slowing in the pace of high-tech production, concentrated  in computers and semiconductors  We do not believe that these developments are  signaling the start of a serious slump, but they have led us to temper our outlook for  high-tech investment this year and next  Proving that we can find dark clouds on  even the brightest horizon, the recent lower-than-expected readings on price inflation  implied that our August path for the nominal federal funds rate was, in real terms,  exerting a bit more restraint on demand over the projection period     Putting these pieces together, we had a forecast in which no progress was made in   reducing the margin of slack in resource utilization and in which price inflation  notched still lower  That outcome led us to flatten the assumed trajectory for the  funds rate by 50 basis points by the end of next year—an adjustment that was  sufficient by our reckoning to result in a gradual reduction in the output gap  I should  note that market participants also appear to have marked down their expectations for  policy at the end of next year by a similar amount  As a consequence, we still have a  shallower assumed uptrend for the funds rate than is currently embedded in fed funds  futures  In our projection, the funds rate is assumed to move up to 2¼ percent by the  end of next year and to 2¾ percent by the end of 2006—an endpoint roughly 60 basis  points below current market expectations     We see several key features of the current economic landscape as suggesting to us   that such a gradual tightening of policy will be sufficient to contain inflation  pressures while promoting an eventual elimination of the output gap  First, fiscal  policy is expected to swing from the substantial stimulus of the past three years to  mild restraint in 2005  We are probably already experiencing the front edge of that  diminishing stimulus  In our projection, fiscal policy over the next year is doing  some of the work that would otherwise be required of monetary policy  Second, as I  noted earlier, the reversal of the low level of the saving rate imposes restraint on  spending going forward  Not only is the current level of the saving rate below our  estimate of the target, but the target itself is likely to be moving higher as interest  rates increase  Third, the external sector is expected to be a considerable drag on  activity in the United States, as domestic and foreign demands are increasingly  directed away from US producers  By 2006, real net exports are expected to knock  more than ⅔ percentage point off the growth of real GDP  Karen will have more to  say on this issue shortly, but suffice it to say here that our widening external deficit  creates a stiff headwind for the economy  Finally, our shallow path for the funds rate  also reflects our relatively optimistic outlook for price inflation  In our projection,  the remaining margin of slack in resource utilization, a small decline in domestic  energy prices, and a leveling out of non-oil import prices result in an edging down of   September 21, 2004 16 of 100          projected core consumer price inflation from about 1½ percent this year to 1¼  percent over the four quarters of 2006     Even with our revisions, we see some clear downside risks to the projection    While the incoming data have been encouraging of the view that the soft patch is  receding, the data have hardly been definitive on that point  The run-up of energy  prices this year could well be exerting greater restraint on household spending than  we have allowed for in our projection  Moreover, it has created yet another source of  uncertainty with which businesses must cope  Indeed, the vocabulary of business  caution seems to have crept back into discussions of the hiring and capital spending  plans of our industry contacts  If these concerns are more pervasive or more severe  than we have implicitly recognized in the projection, the soft patch could prove more  persistent in coming months     Of course, we readily concede that we may have overreacted to some of the softer   economic indicators of recent months  There are a number of reasons that one could  be concerned that the low level of the funds rate assumed in our projection will  stimulate faster economic growth, higher price inflation, or both  For one, simple  historical relationships between the real funds rate and the output gap suggest that the  level of the funds rate assumed in our projection has, on average in the past, resulted  in a much more rapid closing of the output gap than we are forecasting  We used  such a simple relationship to calibrate an alternative simulation for the Greenbook,  and the accompanying surge in demand in that simulation not only closed the output  gap but resulted in some overshooting of potential by the middle of next year  Our  problem with adopting something like this for the baseline is that we don’t currently  see the harbingers—stronger asset-price appreciation, a weaker exchange value of the  dollar, or more-rapid increases in interest-sensitive spending—that we think would  both signal and stimulate a more vigorous track for activity     Another resolution to this possible tension is that the output gap could already be   much smaller than we are estimating  In other words, the low real funds rate of the  past few years may already have done its work  Of course, the implication going  forward is that the economy has less room to grow than we think  Again, we  illustrated this possibility with an alternative simulation that embodied a higher  estimate of the NAIRU and a lower estimate of the trend rate of labor force  participation  On our assumed path for the funds rate, the economy again overshoots  potential, and core price inflation moves up steadily from current levels  Such an  outcome is, no doubt, plausible  Our ability to measure the economy’s productive  potential is limited, and the profession has not distinguished itself in this endeavor in  the past  Moreover, some employers are reporting that it has become difficult to  locate workers with the skill sets that they need, providing a hint that the labor market  may be tighter than we are estimating  But in the end, we are unpersuaded  The  participation rate and the employment–population ratio are very low, and the declines  in those measures in recent years coincided with the weakening labor market  Also,  survey evidence suggests that, while household and business perceptions of the labor   September 21, 2004 17 of 100          market have improved, those perceptions remain well short of the conditions that  prevailed at other times when inflation pressures emerged     The actual inflation data themselves are considerably more ambiguous on the   question of whether we have overshot potential  Certainly, the recent data have been  more encouraging  After hitting a high of 2¼ percent at annual rate in March, the  three-month change in the core PCE price index through August appears to have  receded to below 1 percent  Just as the earlier pace likely overstated the emergence  of inflation pressures this year, the most recent figures probably overstate the  dissipation of those pressures  Our best guess is that the underlying pace of core  consumer price inflation is about 1½ percent at present  That still represents some  pickup from last year’s 1¼ percent pace  We believe the acceleration in core prices  this year can largely be explained by the indirect effects of the steep increases in  energy prices and by the larger increases in import prices  But we can’t rule out the  possibility that labor and product markets are tighter than we currently estimate     In sum, we are expecting moderate above-trend growth, moderate erosion of the   output gap, a moderate drop in inflation, all brought about by a moderate rise in the  federal funds rate  Yes, we too know that it will never come to pass; but we are  satisfied that we have produced a forecast in which we don’t know the most likely  direction of the surprises     Before handing the baton to Karen, let me return to the dark clouds for a moment    Here, I don’t mean the ones that the staff has conjured about the outlook, but rather  the ones real people see when they look out the window  As the Greenbook went to  press last week, Hurricane Ivan had yet to make landfall  The storms of the past  month are bound to leave an imprint on the economic data, though most of the effects  will be on the income side of the accounts  A big jump in economic depreciation is  likely to be matched by lower rental income, lower proprietors’ income, and reduced  corporate profits  As far as real activity is concerned, we simply don’t have enough  information yet to reach an informed judgment about the possible magnitude of any  effects on spending or production  But as devastating as these events have been for  so many people, we are not expecting the effects to be large enough or persistent  enough to have any implications for your policy       Let me just provide a little domestic-side perspective on that    Obviously, one of the issues that we were struggling with in this projection is that we have a   surprisingly shallow trajectory for the funds rate  And you might wonder why that isn’t showing   through more forcefully in this forecast, but it is on the domestic spending side  We have for   private domestic demand an acceleration of 1¼ percent this year, which moves up to 4½ percent   next year and to 4¾ percent in 2006  The reason that isn’t showing through to top-line GDP and   production is that, on our dollar and net export forecast, a lot of that demand is showing up in   demands for producers abroad not in demands for producers domestically      I think I can say unequivocally that on the econometric side a couple   of months of extra data are not going to allow us to identify these things  Now, there is an   interesting coincidence that consumption was especially weak not only as oil prices were rising   but as margins were increasing substantially, and there was some improvement in consumption   in August, as margins shrank very dramatically and prices came down  So there could be some   September 21, 2004 23 of 100          small nod in the direction that you suggested, but it would be hard for us to distinguish those   relationships  One reason to be a little skeptical about just using a model run—model multipliers   on the energy effects—has been that we don’t see the offsetting strength in drilling activity    Drilling activities improved and improved noticeably, but not as much as we would have   expected especially given that far-dated futures have increased quite a bit  So there could be   more restraining effects of higher oil prices this time around than has been true, on average, in   the past because we’re not getting some of the natural offsets that occur     To start with the last question, just as a benchmark we ran an   alternative model simulation in which the real exchange rate depreciated at a 5 percent annual   rate over the forecast period, in contrast to the 1½ percent decline that we’ve actually built into   the forecast  That 5 percent decline produced enough additional growth and a little extra   inflation so that, if one were to apply a Taylor rule to that outcome, the funds rate path would be   just about on track with current market expectations  So that certainly would be one way to   reconcile the difference between our forecast and current market expectations of the funds rate      Yes, that was with FRB/US  I would say that Karen, if she were to   run FRB/Global, might come up with slightly different estimates, but we do see that as an   important element  Now, in terms of explaining the difference between the implicit equilibrium   funds rate in the staff forecast and that which FRB/US would produce, a couple of things stand   out  One is that interest-sensitive spending in the judgmental projection looks soft relative to   what the model would expect  Interestingly enough, that’s surprisingly so in household interest-  sensitive spending; the model wants to see considerably stronger housing investment and also   stronger consumer durables  The model also thinks that—take it for what it’s worth—the stock   market should be stronger and the exchange rate should be weaker  Those actually are the three   most important components of the difference in how we see the outlook from what the model   would expect  In both cases of projecting asset values—for both the stock market and the   September 21, 2004 25 of 100          exchange rate—we’ve taken a sort of neutral approach to the forecast  But there are reasons for   being skeptical about that going forward  "
7852,2004-11-10,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I suspect that for many current  and former New Englanders, the stirring victory of the Boston Red Sox last month  gave hope to other long-deferred dreams  In my case, I mused that if the Red Sox  could come from behind to beat the Yankees and then sweep the World Series, wasn’t   November 10, 2004 14 of 107    it possible for the staff one day to get the near-term employment forecast right?   [Laughter]  Alas, while the dream lives on, the reality of last Friday’s employment  report left me feeling a lot more like Bill Buckner than Manny Ramirez     As you know, through the summer and into the fall we had doggedly held to our   forecast that a pickup in employment growth was imminent  But after four  consecutive sizable disappointments that left reported gains in private payrolls  averaging just 77,000 per month since May, our September projection calling for an  immediate acceleration to increases averaging 200,000 per month seemed a stretch to  us this time around  As a concession to these developments, we marked down our  projection for private payroll gains in the November Greenbook to about 100,000 per  month in the current quarter and delayed any meaningful acceleration of employment  until late winter  Then last Friday, as the ball dribbled between our legs and rolled  into right field, the BLS reported that, well, the labor market had not been so weak  after all  Private payrolls increased 296,000 in October, and the level of private  employment in September had been revised up 81,000  To be sure, the jump in hiring  last month got a considerable boost from construction employment, which was likely  related in part to rebuilding efforts in the aftermath of the hurricanes  And none of the  labor market indicators that we monitor would suggest taking October=s gain of nearly  300,000 as the present hiring trend  But the currently estimated average gain of about  175,000 per month over the past three months does not seem an unreasonable  estimate of the underlying pace of private employment growth  Ironically, that is  pretty close to our forecast back in the September Greenbook     While recent experience reinforces, yet again, the caution with which one should   approach these estimates, the average job gains now reported to have occurred in  recent months do fit more easily with other indicators suggesting that a moderate  improvement in labor market conditions is under way  Initial claims for  unemployment insurance have been moving sideways at a level consistent with the  somewhat larger employment increases now reported; the number of individuals  exhausting their unemployment insurance has continued to fall in recent months; and  surveys of hiring intentions have, for the most part, moved up     As you know from reading the Greenbook, the weak employment situation was   one of the key factors behind our downward revision to real GDP growth over the  next couple of quarters  We viewed the meager employment gains and the associated  shortfall in labor income as likely to be a drag on consumer spending late this year  and into the next  Obviously, the October employment report suggests that this drag  will now be smaller than we had anticipated     But we had other reasons as well for trimming our near-term GDP forecast,   including weaker readings on industrial production, a further jump in non-auto  inventory investment last quarter, and considerably higher oil prices over the  projection period  And these factors, for the most part, still argue for a somewhat  weaker outlook than we had projected in September  Although the data in hand  suggest that manufacturing IP will bounce back from a hurricane-depressed decline in  September, the average gains in recent months have been to the low side of our  expectations  The recent softness has been most pronounced in the high-tech sector   November 10, 2004 15 of 107    but has extended elsewhere as well  We are now projecting factory output to increase  3¾ percent at an annual rate in the fourth quarter, nearly 2 percentage points less than  in our September projection     Some of the slowing that we have observed in industrial production could have   resulted from a diminishing impetus to output from efforts by businesses to rebuild  previously depleted stocks  Indeed, that impetus appears largely to be behind us  The  level of non-auto inventory investment last quarter is estimated to have been much  higher than we anticipated in September, and a drop-off in inventory investment is  expected to subtract about ¾ percentage point from the growth of real GDP in the  current quarter      Finally, we again had to contend with higher oil prices in this forecast  Last   Wednesday, as the Greenbook went to bed, the spot price of West Texas intermediate  crude oil was expected to be about $7 per barrel higher on average over the projection  period than in the September Greenbook, and the price of imported oil was projected  to average about $4 per barrel above our previous projection  Prices have come down  noticeably over the past week  But the price of WTI is still about $4 per barrel above  our September Greenbook projection, and the price of imported oil is estimated to be  about $2 per barrel higher  Those higher prices are taking another bite out of  household incomes and are likely to restrain spending somewhat in coming months     Putting this all together, the events of the past week would lead us to mark up   somewhat our November projection for the growth in real GDP over the next couple  of quarters to a pace just shy of that which we projected in September  Karen will  discuss this morning’s trade data shortly, but it looks as though those data would  cause us to raise our estimate of third-quarter growth to around 3¾ percent at an  annual rate  Moreover, given stronger employment and lower oil prices, we would be  inclined to revise up our projection for the growth in real GDP in the current quarter  from the 3½ percent figure in the November Greenbook to something closer to  4 percent and to revise up the first quarter of next year from 3 percent to about  3½ percent  These adjustments would probably add a tenth or so to growth in each of  2004 and 2005      To be frank, after the large downward revision that we made to the projection at   midyear, subsequent adjustments have been relatively minor  During this period, the  economy has, for the most part, appeared to us to be growing at or modestly above  trend  And the prospects seem favorable for a continuation of that performance  To  be sure, fiscal policy is projected to shift from providing considerable stimulus to the  growth of real output this year to being a roughly neutral factor next year  But  monetary policy, at least by our reckoning, will remain reasonably accommodative  over the projection period  And the restraint being exerted on the economy by the  run-up in energy prices this year should begin to fade next year as prices first stabilize  and then decline      We continue to see some important risks to this admittedly benign outlook  Even   with the declines in recent days, by virtually any metric the jump in crude oil and  other energy prices this year constitutes a large shock  In the past, most especially in   November 10, 2004 16 of 107    the 1970s and early 1980s, oil price shocks were accompanied by an unusual degree  of restraint on household spending, which is to say that standard linear models seem,  on balance, to understate the weakness in spending in these episodes  Despite this  evidence, we did not build any appreciable nonlinear effects into the projection  We  suspect that the effects of oil price shocks on sentiment and spending in the ’70s and  ’80s were amplified by a regulatory environment that resulted in shortages, gas lines,  and disruptions that created a great deal more economic uncertainty than households  and businesses are now coping with  Moreover, we haven’t yet detected in either the  spending data or readings on consumer sentiment any outsized response to this year’s  oil shock  Still, it’s probably premature to be confident that such effects will not  manifest themselves at some point in the current episode     Another downside risk is that high-tech equipment spending is on a weaker long-  term trajectory than incorporated in the baseline  Third-quarter spending on  computers and software was well below our earlier expectation, and the news  continues to suggest that spending on tech equipment has remained lackluster  We  have weakened this element of our projection through the first quarter of next year,  but then we are projecting a reacceleration of these outlays back closer to historical  norms  The recent softness combined with smaller declines in the relative price of  high-tech capital goods over the past year or so could be signaling that the pace of  technical progress and the imperative to invest in this type of equipment is waning   We believe that it is too soon to draw that conclusion, but this possibility does  constitute some downside risk to our projection     The risks in the outlook for capital spending, however, are not one-sided  Outside   of high-tech, equipment spending has been growing briskly  We have continued to  interpret some of this strength in spending as being stimulated by the partial- expensing provisions  With the bulk of that stimulus scheduled to expire at the end of  this year, we are anticipating a drop in equipment outlays in the first quarter and some  small restraint on spending in subsequent quarters  But as we have noted on  numerous occasions, our calibration of the magnitude of this effect is based more on  educated guesswork than on hard science  If the effect has been smaller than we  currently estimate, then underlying demand has been correspondingly stronger, and  hence there could be greater momentum to equipment spending as we enter next year     Another key upside risk that we have been pointing to for some time remains that   the very low level of real interest rates assumed in our projection will spark a sharp  acceleration in activity or inflation  Two obvious channels through which that could  occur are the stock market and the exchange value of the dollar  For both of these  elements of the forecast, we employ something akin to a random walk with drift  We  project the stock market to rise in line with the risk-adjusted yield on bonds, and we  project the dollar to fall only slightly from current levels  The shallow trajectory that  we have assumed for the federal funds rate could, of course, provoke a steeper rise in  the stock market or a larger fall in the dollar than incorporated in the baseline  forecast, and by enough to matter  For example, if we were to assume that the dollar  resumes declining at the average annual rate observed between its peak in 2002 and  early this year—about 6 percent—rather than the 1½ percent annual rate decline that  we are projecting, a simulation of FRB/US suggests that the accompanying impetus to   November 10, 2004 17 of 107    demand would cause output to overshoot potential and inflation to edge higher by  2006  In response to that outcome, a Taylor rule would prescribe a path for the funds  rate about 50 basis points higher than in our baseline in 2005 and about 75 basis  points higher in 2006—a path for the funds rate similar to that currently built into  futures markets  Certainly, such an outcome seems well within the realm of  possibility     Turning to inflation, our projection has changed relatively little over the   intermeeting period  Increases in the core CPI for August and September were, on  net, a bit higher than we had been projecting  But much of our miss was in prices for  used cars and lodging away from home, and we did not attach much signal to these  developments  Indeed, core PCE prices have actually been running a bit below  expectation, though again not by enough for us to alter our basic outlook  Meanwhile,  the recent readings on hourly labor compensation have surprised us to the downside   Figures on comp per hour from the ECI and from the NIPA-based compensation  measure both came in at about 3½ percent at an annual rate in the third quarter, about  ½ percentage point less than in our previous projection  There really has been no  discernable trend in compensation inflation over the past couple of years  Of course,  the biggest news on the price front has been the run-up in oil prices that I mentioned  earlier  Higher energy prices are projected to boost headline CPI to about 3¼ percent  at an annual rate in the current quarter, about 2 percentage points above the  September forecast  The indirect effects of these higher energy prices are expected to  add another tenth or so to core consumer price inflation over the next few quarters  It  is our sense that higher prices for oil, other commodities, and imports are continuing  to feed through into core consumer prices      Going forward, our expectation is that energy prices will edge down, commodity   prices will level off, and the increases in import prices will slow  These  developments are anticipated to place downward pressure on core consumer prices  next year  But in our forecast, these beneficial developments are largely offset by the  diminishing margin of slack in resource utilization and by some upward pressure on  costs associated with a slowing of structural labor productivity during the next two  years  Both the pluses and minuses are relatively small here, and we are anticipating  core PCE inflation to move about sideways at its current annual pace of about  1½ percent     Let me conclude with a brief thought on the uncertainties in the outlook    Obviously the list of risks remains long  There is much we don’t understand about  why the economy has failed to show even greater vigor in response to massive fiscal  stimulus and very low real interest rates  More broadly, geopolitical risk and the  threat of terror are almost certain to be permanent features of the economic landscape  And some very daunting long-term challenges—most notably, those associated with  large budget deficits, low household saving, and a widening current account deficit— are always a threat to cascade back into the present in unpleasant ways  But on the  positive side, those risks now seem to be confronting an economy that is  fundamentally less fragile than it has been at many points in the past four years   Karen will continue our presentation      November 10, 2004 18 of 107      Well, our projection is certainly above those forecasts, as you point out    Certainly one feature of our stronger outlook for motor vehicles is that we have lower interest   rates—and noticeably lower interest rates—than are currently built into market expectations  So the   financing environment that we think is going to prevail is quite favorable  Another factor is that   we’re still a little more optimistic on longer-term potential output growth than the consensus   forecast  So in some sense we think there’s going to be greater wherewithal to purchase motor   vehicles  Now, whether we have it right in terms of how that splits up between the numbers of   units produced and the value per unit could certainly be open to some question  But in general in an   economy in which the unemployment rate is continuing to come down, energy prices are reversing   some of this year’s run-up, and interest rates surprise on the low side, we don’t think our forecast is   too much of a stretch  We are aware, however, that it is higher than the automakers are currently   saying and higher than most other outside forecasters are currently projecting     Well, obviously, it could matter considerably  We are anticipating the   budget deficit basically to remain at $410 billion or thereabouts in fiscal year 2005 and to edge   down only to $390 billion in 2006  If one were concerned that the current political configuration   were going to result in less fiscal discipline, or at least had the possibility of producing an   environment with less discipline, one could imagine more spending  And on the tax side, certainly   making the tax provisions permanent would be likely to boost interest rates, and there’s already   some expectation of that built into current interest rates  So once it happened or if that uncertainty   were removed, we might get somewhat higher long-term interest rates coming about from that, but   it wouldn’t be a complete innovation in the market’s thinking at this point   We are not very good political prognosticators  So in essence, in this forecast we are   anticipating continued supplementals to support ongoing operations in Iraq  We have incorporated   the tax law changes that have occurred to date, but we aren’t anticipating any further significant   November 10, 2004 23 of 107    cuts, and there is implicitly some restraint on nondefense nondiscretionary spending in here  That is   an area where it seems to me the uncertainty could perhaps be the greatest   Having said that, I must say that I can think of a lot of other things that would have a bigger   and more immediate impact on the economy  We have shot a whole lot of fiscal bullets off here,   and it’s rather hard to imagine another couple of years of stimulus that would average the 1 percent   that we’ve seen over the last three years  One could hope or imagine that there might be more   discipline than we’ve built into our forecast, though I don’t see the distribution of risks as strongly   supporting worries about too much fiscal restraint at this point  So I think somewhere between the   basically neutral fiscal policy that we’ve built into the forecast and the stimulus that has occurred   over the last three years is probably in the right neighborhood  We have something that averages a   little less than ¼ point in 2005 and 2006 as extra stimulus from fiscal policy     I certainly welcome your imagination [laughter] if you wish to apply it   to this particular problem  My colleague, David Wilcox, who presented some of this material in his   chart show presentation in July, might want to jump in here  But it isn’t aggregate demand, as you   point out, or policy assumptions because inflation in the United States is very inertial and not   terribly sensitive to changes in the output gap  Now I know when telling our stories that, because   we have so few hooks on which to produce inflation in the forecast, the monetary policy   assumption can often sound as if it features very prominently when, in fact, it doesn’t   November 10, 2004 24 of 107    There’s obviously considerable uncertainty on the supply side, both with respect to things   like oil prices or commodity prices that could, if they doubled again in the coming year—and one   could imagine such a development—provide significant upside surprise or an even more   pronounced slowing in structural labor productivity than we are projecting  We’re concerned about   that latter possibility as well, and we showed an alternative simulation with a productivity   slowdown  Again, one could use even more imagination and think that maybe it would slow even   more dramatically than we’re showing, in which case cost pressures on businesses are going to   manifest themselves more intensely than we’re currently anticipating in the projection  So those are   a few stories that one could tell   The honest truth about the width of the fan charts that we show with regard to our forecast   is that a lot of that is just unexplained residual in the model  The models are explaining only about   60 percent of the year-to-year variations in the inflation rate  We have been wrong in the past on   inflation, and we will be wrong in the future  Our models seem to explain only a portion of the   variation in inflation, and we recognize that our ignorance is a big source of uncertainty in the   outlook     Well, I think the employment report would not change our funds rate   forecast very much  One of the things that I tried to highlight in my remarks, though, is that there   are a couple of really major pieces of the outlook—such as movements in the exchange value of the   dollar and movements in the stock market—where as a matter of joint strategy we are embedding in   the forecast a pretty neutral assumption  For example, the dollar’s path is almost like a random   walk, and the stock market will just go up at the risk-adjusted return that one can get in the bond   market  Now, it’s quite conceivable to me that participants in the market might be factoring in   some combination of developments in those areas that, with the kind of funds rate path we’ve   written down, could produce more stimulus either because spending will be more interest sensitive   or because the transmission of the funds rate into asset markets could be more powerful than we’re   assuming in our forecast     So we write down our funds rate path as sort of a conditioned assumption and, obviously, as   developments change, we react to that  But in your considerations as a policymaker and in thinking   about the full range of the risks that you’re confronted with, you might want to ask, Could it be that   the setting of the funds rate would produce either considerably more spending or inflation than the   staff has incorporated?  I also noted that it’s still the case—and it’s one of the factors that we are   struggling with and don’t really have a clear answer to—that we haven’t over the past two years   gotten as much activity out of very, very low real interest rates as we would have anticipated  As I   noted in response to a question by President Yellen last time, some of that is apparent in housing   and some in business investment also where, even though the growth rates have recovered, the level   of spending as a share of GDP looks to us pretty darn depressed relative to the trends that one might   have anticipated in response to these low rates  And in our forecast we’re carrying forward some of   that unexplained weakness  Obviously, if that unexplained weakness were to diminish more   November 10, 2004 26 of 107    rapidly than we envision—if we get more spending and more output—we’d have a higher funds   rate path associated with the outlook as well  "
7914,2004-12-14,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  In brief, the news that we have  received since the completion of the November Greenbook five weeks ago has been  supportive of the view that the economy has been growing modestly above trend and  will likely continue to do so into next year  Indeed, both the incoming data on  economic activity and some of the key factors that condition the projection point to a  more favorable outlook than was anticipated in our previous projection  A pickup in  the pace of hiring and stronger growth of consumption led us to mark up the projected  pace of real GDP growth in the second half of this year by ¼ percentage point, to  3¾ percent at an annual rate  Since the publication of last week’s Greenbook, we  received stronger-than-expected readings on retail sales and wholesale inventories  and weaker-than-expected figures on international trade  On net, these data appear to  be about a wash for current-quarter GDP     Looking beyond the near term, higher equity values, larger gains in house prices,   a lower exchange value of the dollar, and a drop in oil prices suggest greater upward  impetus to spending and activity over the next two years  In fact, incorporating this  more favorable configuration of financial and oil market developments into our  projection would have resulted in output overshooting potential  In order to forestall  that outcome, we raised the trajectory of the assumed federal funds rate, and we are  now just slightly below the path implied by futures prices  I suppose that if I were  truly in the holiday spirit I would give you a gift by stopping right here, because that  is pretty much the story behind the forecast  But seasonally adjusted, I’m not feeling  any more generous than usual      December 14, 2004 9 of 118           So let me start with the labor market  The October and November employment  reports did not provoke in us the same euphoria followed by disappointment that was  apparent in the reactions of financial markets  Taken together, the employment  increases in October and November were noticeably stronger than had been  incorporated in the previous Greenbook and allayed our concerns that weakness in the  labor market might sap the vigor of the expansion  As I noted at the last meeting, our  November projection had put underlying gains in private payrolls in the second half  of this year at around 100,000 per month  But it now looks as if hiring has been  running around 160,000 per month, and we expect it to pick up to around 225,000 per  month by the spring  Most other readings on the labor market also point to a gradual  improvement  The only discordant note has been the increase in initial claims over  the past two weeks  We are not yet inclined to read much into that increase, but it  does highlight downside risks to the employment outlook     Consumer spending also surprised us to the upside  In response to the incoming   news, we raised the projected growth of real PCE by ½ percentage point in the second  half of this year, and yesterday=s retail sales release suggests a further small upward  adjustment of a few tenths to our fourth-quarter consumption forecast  We are now  estimating that real PCE advanced at an annual rate of more than 5 percent in the  third quarter and will increase at a 3½ percent pace in the current quarter  That  slowdown is more than accounted for by a drop-off in motor vehicle sales in October  and November  With inventories remaining uncomfortably high, we are expecting  that the automakers will be forced in coming months to adopt a combination of some  cutback in production from current schedules and sweetened incentives to boost sales   Outside motor vehicles, real PCE is now projected to grow at a 4¼ percent annual  rate in the current quarter, a bit faster than in the third quarter  The anecdotes about  the holiday selling season have been mixed to downbeat in recent weeks  I don’t  think that we have ever been very successful in matching holiday anecdotes to the  published data  Still, we’ve assumed a weak December for retail sales, in part on the  basis of these stories and the dropback in weekly chain store sales     In the business sector, outlays for capital equipment have continued to increase   steeply, with real E&S up about 17 percent at an annual rate in the third quarter and  projected to increase 11 percent in the fourth quarter  Taken together, those gains  were close to our earlier expectations  In looking at our E&S forecast, it is clear that  we are approaching something akin to a “moment of truth”  A few years back, based  on calibrated theoretical models and a healthy dose of judgment, we built into our  forecast of equipment spending a noticeable effect from partial expensing  That  effect included a boost to spending during the period when partial expensing was  permitted, followed by a pothole after its expiration  Gee, it seemed pretty logical at  the time  And even now, there is evidence to support our position  Real spending on  equipment has exceeded the expectations of our econometric models that make no  allowance for partial expensing—and by an amount close to that of our estimate of  the expensing effect  Moreover, new orders for capital goods fell off in October and  fell a bit more than is necessary to create our first-quarter dip in spending  And while  the anecdotes have been underwhelming, we’ve always recognized that only a small   December 14, 2004 10 of 118           fraction of firms would be on a margin where this provision actually influenced their  spending decisions     But all that said, it just doesn’t feel as if the risks are symmetric around this aspect   of our projection  The probability that the effect will turn out to have been smaller  than that incorporated in our projection seems larger to me than the probability that  this effect will exceed our expectations  Part of my discomfort arises from the  recognition that, if we had started out our forecast with a null hypothesis that partial  expensing would have no effect on spending, I could easily imagine myself sitting  here today arguing that the data and anecdotes had not contradicted that hypothesis  either  I don’t want to exaggerate the vulnerability of our GDP projection to this  assumption  In fact, we have offset about two-thirds of the tax-induced swing in  equipment spending in inventories and imports so that domestic production of capital  goods is much less affected than spending  Still, if the partial-expensing effect turns  out to be smaller than we have estimated and underlying demand for equipment  correspondingly stronger, the economy is likely to carry somewhat greater  momentum into early next year than is implicit in our forecast  While crossing one’s  fingers is not a forecasting methodology typically covered in graduate-level  econometrics, that is what we will be doing over the next few months  [Laughter]     Of course, the momentum that the economy carries forward into next year will be   affected to a much greater extent by the broader developments in the economic and  financial environment than by the effects of partial expensing  And on that score, the  key factors conditioning our projection have strengthened noticeably over the past  five weeks  As you know, one of the key upside risks we saw to the projection was  the possibility that the accommodative stance of monetary policy would be  accompanied by sharper movements in asset markets than we were forecasting   Some of those risks may have manifested themselves of late, at least to some degree   The stock market is about 4 percent higher than in our previous projection; house  prices are projected to average about 5 percent higher; the price of imported crude oil  is about $3 per barrel lower, on average, in 2005 and about $2 per barrel lower in  2006; and although the dollar has retraced some of its earlier declines, by the time we  closed the Greenbook last Wednesday, it was still below our previous projection  The  increase in household net worth associated with higher prices for equities and houses  provides a considerable boost to household spending over the projection period, as  does the increase in real income stemming from the lower price of oil  Meanwhile,  the weaker dollar is projected to give a lift to exports and to trim the growth of  imports     The only notable factor on the negative side of the ledger was the further   downward revision that we made to our forecast of spending on high-tech equipment   While the news was not uniformly downbeat, enough of it was negative to make us  take another hard look at our forecast  With relative prices for tech equipment not  declining at the pace they had a few years back, with few signs of new applications  that would substantially stimulate demand, and with domestic and foreign producers  reportedly cautious about the outlook, we lowered our projection of the growth of real   December 14, 2004 11 of 118           high-tech equipment spending  We now project that the growth of spending on this  equipment will equal, rather than exceed, its historical average going forward  We  believe that this outlook better balances the risks     On net, the positives for the economic outlook significantly outweighed the   negatives and, as I noted earlier, without an adjustment to our policy assumption  would have resulted in actual real GDP overshooting potential by the end of the  projection period  As a consequence, we raised our path for the funds rate 50 basis  points, bringing the assumed level to 2¾ percent by the end of next year and to  3¼ percent by the end of 2006  Our assumed path is now just ¼ percentage point, on  average, below that implicit in the fed funds futures market  These adjustments  altered the contour of our projection, with faster growth in real GDP now projected  for next year, followed by a more noticeable slowing of growth in 2006 as the less  accommodative stance of policy shows through     The inflation picture has changed little over the intermeeting period  Our forecast   for core CPI in October was right on the mark, as was our forecast for core PCE   Moreover, there have been only modest changes in the key determinants of inflation   The larger-than-expected drop in the price of oil is partly offset by the higher prices  for non-oil imports  In our forecast, total PCE inflation is still expected to recede  from 2½ percent this year to about 1¼ percent in 2005 and 2006, while core PCE  inflation remains roughly unchanged at 1½ percent over the next two years  As in the  previous forecast, that stability in core inflation is brought about by several small  offsetting effects  A diminishing margin of slack and some slowing of structural  productivity are expected to place slight upward pressure on inflation  But these  effects are offset by some reversal of this year’s jump in energy prices and a smaller  projected rise in non-oil import prices     At the last meeting, Vice Chairman Geithner asked, in effect, whether the benign   outlook for inflation in our baseline and even in our alternative simulations reflected a  lack of imagination on our part or, perhaps the unstated alternative, a lack of  intelligence  [Laughter]  I was at least grateful to implicitly be offered a choice—you  know, cigarette or blindfold  In the end, I’m not certain that we can offer the Vice  Chairman much comfort on the intelligence front  But we did attempt to exercise our  imaginations better, and it is fair to say that, in surveying the landscape, some upside  risks to inflation strike us as potentially more potent than others     One risk is that economic growth will exceed our expectations, causing resource   utilization to tighten more quickly than in the baseline projection  While that  outcome certainly cannot be ruled out, we don’t see the implications for inflation as  being especially large, at least over the two-year time frame of our projection  As we  have highlighted in the past, inflation simply is not very sensitive to the output gap in  our models; the effect is not zero, but it is nonetheless small  Moreover, a corollary  to this observation is that, if we have mis-estimated the natural rate of unemployment  or the output gap, we don=t think the consequences for inflation would be large over   December 14, 2004 12 of 118           the next eight quarters—again because inflation does not appear to be especially  sensitive to resource utilization     Another risk might be that the upward pressure on inflation from rising   commodity and materials prices will intensify in the coming year  Oil prices have  certainly surprised us and participants in futures markets this year  Moreover, a  steeper slide in the dollar or more rapid improvement in industrial activity here or  abroad could produce more significant pressures in commodities markets  If sharp  increases in materials costs were to continue, an increasing fraction of firms that to  date have absorbed these costs may attempt to pass them on to customers  Based on  quotes from futures markets, we don’t see a continuation of rapid gains in commodity  prices as the most likely outcome, and given the small share of costs accounted for by  raw materials, the consequences of an upside surprise do not loom especially large   Nonetheless, it does seem a risk worth closely monitoring      In our view, a more prominent and sizable upside risk to the projection is that   firms will act more aggressively to raise prices in order to limit the damage done to  their profit margins by slowing productivity and rising unit labor costs  Those  tendencies could be amplified if productivity slows more sharply than we are  projecting  As you know, we showed a simulation combining these developments in  the Greenbook, and the consequence was an acceleration of core PCE prices to  2¼ percent by 2006, ¾ percentage point above the baseline forecast and at the outer  edge of our 70 percent confidence interval  We don’t think that the evidence favors  such an outcome, but we see this as an important vulnerability in our otherwise  sanguine outlook     More broadly, we are trying to remain especially alert to developments that would   suggest that this year’s price shocks will propagate forward into higher underlying  inflation  In addition to the possibility of slower growth of labor productivity, any  signs of a significant pickup in nominal wages would have troubling implications for  costs and prices  But the broad measures of hourly labor compensation have been  running a very steady 4 percent or so over the past year, with little indication of an  imminent takeoff  Inflation expectations also deserve close scrutiny  Inflation  compensation as measured by the five-year TIPS spread has moved up in recent  months, but five- to ten-year inflation compensation has barely budged  Moreover,  survey measures—either short-term or long-term—have changed little over the past  year  At this juncture, we see still few signs that this year’s upturn in inflation is the  beginning of a process of more-pronounced deterioration  Obviously, the size of the  confidence intervals surrounding our forecast admits a reasonably wide range of  outcomes over the next two years, both to the upside and to the downside of our  inflation projection  Although we are comfortable with our outlook for inflation, we  leave it to the Committee to decide whether this forecast deserves a holiday turkey or  whether it is the holiday turkey!  Karen will continue our presentation       I’m so glad to hear that  [Laughter]  "
8031,2005-03-22," No weighting    It’s an unweighted index    So wool tops have the same weight implicitly in the index as, say, a   contract on gasoline or copper          And each is included So it’s not a terribly rigorous—    Steel is not Steel is the principal one that hasn’t moved up  "
8032,2005-03-22," It is the case, however, Mr Chairman, that there has been a broad-  based upward movement in commodity prices in the last four weeks  So—    Thank you, Mr Chairman  By virtually all measures, the  economy has been humming along at a very solid pace in recent months  We are  estimating that real GDP expanded at a 4¼ percent annual rate in the fourth quarter of  last year and is likely to grow at about that pace in the first quarter of this year   The contributors to the expansion have remained much the same  The household  sector has, to date, shown no signs of flagging  Consumer spending has been moving  up smartly, and housing activity continues to be very strong  Meanwhile, equipment  spending by businesses remains on a steep uptrend  And we have even seen some  signs of improvement in nonresidential construction, though most of that  improvement has been centered in the upswing in drilling activity that has  accompanied the jump in energy prices  Inventory investment and hiring—the last  major areas in which we could detect the cautious business behavior that had been  such a prominent feature of this episode—now appear to be tracing more normal  cyclical patterns                                               March 22, 2005 9 of 116  Although the pace of the expansion in real activity is much the same as that of a  year ago, the character of the expansion now feels different While I can easily  imagine looking back on these words with regret [laughter], the persistent and  widespread improvements that we are now witnessing certainly leave the impression  that the expansion is more firmly established and less fragile with respect to adverse  shocks than it was in early 2004   As you know from reading the Greenbook, we think that the recent greater  momentum in real GDP will carry forward for a while  That greater momentum in  activity and heightened upward pressures on inflation led us to raise the assumed path  of the federal funds rate by 50 basis points beyond the very near term  As in past  forecasts, tighter monetary policy, diminished impetus from rising equity values and  house prices, and fading fiscal stimulus are expected to gradually put a brake on the  pace of activity In our projection, the economy reaches the end of next year with the  funds rate in the neighborhood of neutral, output close to potential, and core inflation  running around 1½ percent Were it to occur, such an outcome would be very  pleasant indeed   Of course, we know that our point forecast, like any point forecast, will occur  with probability zero So what should we worrying about?  While my colleagues who  attend our lengthy forecast meetings were not exactly thrilled by it, the removal of my  arm from its sling in the past few weeks has allowed me, once again, to bring my  principal value added to the forecasting process, and that is copious amounts of hand- wringing [Laughter]   In the remainder of my remarks, I=d like to focus on three difficult questions with  which we had to wrestle in assembling this forecast First, what should we make of  the recent strength in capital spending and what are its implications for the outlook?  Second, how should we balance some powerful crosscurrents at work on the supply  side of the economy?  And third, what is happening with inflation?  I=ll take them  each in turn, although there are some common threads that tie them together   Let me begin with the changes that we have made to the projection for equipment  spending Our last hope for evidence supporting the partial-expensing pothole in the  first quarter of this year largely evaporated with the January data Domestic  shipments of capital equipment were up across the board, and imports of capital  goods were strong as well Likewise, new bookings for capital equipment rose at a  brisk pace early this quarter, and the backlog of unfilled orders has continued to  mount  To be sure, we are projecting some deceleration in E&S spending in the first  quarter, but most of that deceleration reflects a drop in purchases of light motor  vehicles, and we don=t see the expiration of the tax incentive as the major factor here  Indeed, much of the upward revision to our projection of capital outlays in the first  quarter has occurred among long-lived assets—the types of capital equipment that we  thought would have been weakest early this year                                      March 22, 2005 10 of 116  So, little remains of our elegant story  Our calibrated vintage capital models  failed us, and clearly finger-crossing has not proven a terribly robust forecasting  technique We even tried an approach gently suggested to us by Governor Olson at  the time of our last forecast—you know, had we thought about trying common sense?  [Laughter] We tried, but even that didn=t seem to work  In a conversation with our  colleagues at Treasury that they asked remain confidential, they indicated having  been surprised that an appreciable number of firms with taxable income have simply  not taken advantage of partial expensing Moreover, some firms have taken it for  purchases of longer-lived assets, but not for shorter-lived assets This pattern of  behavior might suggest that administrative complexity may have loomed larger as a  discouraging factor than we or others imagined  But the facts are likely to remain  obscure for a long time, while the IRS tabulates the corporate income tax forms for  recent years For now, we=re raising the white flag of surrender and chalking it up as  a defeat for models, luck, and logic   I wouldn=t drag you through this discussion if it were just a sideshow in the  forecast But the changes that we made here were of policy significance  We revised  up the growth in real equipment spending by 10 percentage points in the current  quarter, from a decline of 5 percent at an annual rate to an increase of 5 percent   Moreover, we had previously interpreted some of last year=s strength in capital  spending as resulting from firms pulling forward outlays to take advantage of the tax  break If that was not the case, then underlying demand was likely stronger than we  had previously recognized As a consequence, we are projecting some of that  additional strength to carry over into the first half of this year   After accounting for follow-on multiplier–accelerator effects, the revisions to our  forecast of equipment spending boosted growth of real GDP by nearly 2 percentage  point this year and by ¼ percentage point next year These adjustments more than  offset the downward revisions to our projection that were necessitated by the higher  expected path of oil prices, which we estimate will trim about ¼ percentage point off  the growth in real GDP in each of the next two years   The faster pace of capital spending incorporated in this projection also had  implications for aggregate supply through its contribution to capital deepening  But  that was just one of a number of changes we made on the supply side of our  projection As I noted earlier, we have had to contend with two strong crosscurrents  in this aspect of our forecast faster-than-expected growth of labor productivity, on  the one hand, and slower-than-expected growth of the labor force, on the other   With regard to productivity, we appear to be starting this year with another large  upside surprise Our estimate of the growth of output per hour in the first quarter has  been revised up by 2 percentage points since the last Greenbook to a 3½ percent  annual pace                                March 22, 2005 11 of 116  As you know, the surprising strength of productivity over the past few years has  required us to take a stand on how much of the recent gains has reflected structural  improvements that will persist going forward and how much has reflected the  cautious hiring stance of businesses and their ability, at least for a time, to elicit  greater effort from their workforces  In other words, we have had to parse these  innovations into trend and cycle components  With positive surprises to productivity  continuing, the story about caution-induced effort seemed to us to have diminishing  plausibility Both our models and our best judgment suggested raising our estimates  of the structural component of productivity in recent years and correspondingly  lowering the cyclical component   In addition to raising the level of structural productivity through the end of last  year, we also nudged up our estimate of the growth of structural productivity going  forward by about ¼ percentage point per year to about 3 percent per annum  About  half of that upward revision reflected the larger contribution from capital deepening  that followed from our stronger investment forecast  The other half reflects stronger  projected growth of multifactor productivity  Businesses have been making  substantial gains in technological and organizational efficiencies in recent years, and  we anticipate more of that to continue over the next couple of years than was assumed  in our January projection   While the revisions that we have made to structural productivity, all else equal,  would have resulted in a noticeable upward revision to the projected growth of  potential output, all else was not equal Just as we have been surprised to the upside  by productivity, we have been consistently surprised to the downside over the past  year or so by the weakness in labor force participation We had been expecting that,  as the labor market began to give clearer signs of sustained improvement, more  workers would be drawn back into the labor force  We still think that is likely to  happen   But the growing tension between our expectation of an imminent upturn in labor  force participation and the reality of its ongoing decline prompted us to overhaul our  models in this area, disaggregating age, sex, and cohort efforts at a much more  detailed level than we had done in the past The upshot of that work has been to  suggest that more—though certainly not all—of the decline that we have observed in  participation over the past few years has been demographic and less has been cyclical  than we had earlier thought At the risk of oversimplifying some complicated  interactions, whereas we had earlier thought a continued uptrend in women=s  participation would about offset the ongoing decline in the participation rate of men,  we now think that women=s participation may be flattening out even as men=s  participation continues to decline All told, we estimate a more noticeable downward  tilt to aggregate trend participation, and thus potential labor input is more limited than  we had previously projected                                   March 22, 2005 12 of 116  On net, the upward revisions to productivity slightly exceeded the downward  revisions to potential labor input, and we revised up the growth of potential output by  01 percentage point this year and next These upward revisions were smaller than  those we made to actual GDP, and, as a consequence, the GDP gap is a touch smaller  in coming quarters than was the case in our January projection   A slightly tighter economy has added to a growing list of worries that would make  any compulsive hand-wringer proud  That list would also contain higher oil prices,  larger increases in non-oil import prices, a steep rise in commodity prices, a  reemergence of price pressures from intermediate materials, some deterioration in  near-term inflation expectations, and a disappointingly large increase in core PCE  [personal consumption expenditures] prices in January  To our relief, this morning=s  PPI for February did not add to this list The increase in core finished goods—at 01  percent—and the increase in core intermediate materials—at 05 percent—were right  in line with the Greenbook projection   But taken together, price developments over the intermeeting period have been  troubling The effects of higher oil prices are already being felt at the pump, and  headline inflation measures will be up noticeably in February and March  Moreover,  higher energy and materials prices are adding to business costs, and higher prices for  imports are lessening competitive pressures on the pricing decisions of domestic  producers In response to these developments, we have raised the projected increase  in core PCE prices to 1¾ percent in 2005 and 1½ percent in 2006—about ¼  percentage point higher than our previous projection in both years Still, the basic  contours of the inflation forecast remain the same  Such a modest revision might lead  some to wonder if the staff should be doing a little more hand-wringing if we wish to  avoid an eventual neck-wringing!   But at this point, we believe that only a modest revision is warranted  As you  know, for the prices of oil and other commodities, we take our cues from futures  markets  And, as they have for much of the past year, those markets are suggesting  that a flattening out of prices is just around the corner and that declines will occur by  next year Futures markets have not proven to be terribly reliable guides to prices  over the past year, but we simply aren=t confident that we can outguess the markets in  these areas   We view the larger increases in core PCE of late as suggesting that the size, pass- through, and persistence of price pressures from energy, imports, and other  commodities has been greater than we had earlier expected  But we do not think that  we are, as yet, experiencing a broad-based upward push on inflation  One piece of  evidence in support of that interpretation is that all of the acceleration in core PCE  prices over the past year has occurred among core goods, where the influence of  energy, materials, and imports is likely to be largest  Core services have actually  decelerated                                   March 22, 2005 13 of 116  Moreover, the labor cost picture remains quite subdued  Growth in hourly labor  compensation has basically moved sideways in recent quarters  Our projection  incorporates some acceleration in wage inflation in response to higher price inflation  this year and a gradual tightening of the labor market  But the faster projected growth  of actual and structural labor productivity holds down the overall increase in unit  labor costs Indeed, the combination of slightly higher price inflation and lower unit  labor costs resulted in an upward revision to the price markup in this projection,  which already was above historical norms  In effect, greater pricing power is implicit  in this forecast   As I see it, the most disquieting development on the inflation front has not been  the run-up in energy and commodity prices, but has been the apparent rise in inflation  compensation over the next three years—at least as best as we can judge by readings  from the inflation swaps market  Should a deterioration in inflation expectations  eventually come to be reflected in wage- and price-setting decisions, you would be  facing a more substantial, persistent, and ultimately costly acceleration of labor costs  and prices As we showed in an alternative simulation in the Greenbook, those  difficulties are amplified if monetary policy is slow to respond to heightened inflation  expectations, and real interest rates are inadvertently eased   On the other hand, the most comforting development on the inflation front has  been the continued exceptional performance of productivity  Although we have  revised up our forecast for actual and structural productivity, we are still betting on a  substantial slowdown of structural multifactor productivity  As we showed in another  simulation, if that doesn’t occur, cost pressures could be considerably less than we  are currently anticipating and inflation could drop to the low end of your comfort  zone   Karen will continue our presentation    Well, we have not undertaken a calculation like that, Mr Chairman,   and it strikes me that it would be relatively complicated to construct  But we could certainly take   a look at it From our perspective—and this is one of the reasons we are giving for the   improvement in multifactor productivity—investment in information technology is a general   purpose technology So, beyond just the improvements in the production of information   technology equipment, we are now seeing more signs of widespread application of information   technology And the organizational efficiencies that it has allowed have been a factor in keeping   multifactor productivity elevated  That’s one of the reasons we’re still reasonably optimistic   about this While the growth rate will not continue at the pace recorded in the past few years, we   think it’s going to remain at a pace that is above average by historical standards    When you say “already in there”—    I don’t know the precise answer to that question I’m not sure if   Steve Oliner, who is our expert on this, would have any thoughts on the subject    The most significant component of the slowdown that we’re   projecting, as I indicated, is a substantial drop in purchases of light motor vehicles  We’re   basically trying to mimic the BEA [Bureau of Economic Analysis] in terms of calculating the                                                 March 22, 2005 24 of 116  share of light motor vehicle sales going to the business sector versus the household side; there is   a big swing in that share    Well, I’m not quite sure  I don’t want to impugn them that way  We   could be wrong, obviously, about that component  The nontransportation component we have   only a bit slower than it was in the fourth quarter of last year  So at this stage, we are just doing   our best straightforward read of the incoming data  We are not imposing any additional add-  factors or restraint on the assumption that the partial expensing is pushing things down  That   said, this is a very volatile area of the forecast and one in which we have made big errors  And I   assume others have as well    As I indicated, one of the refinements that we undertook in this   modeling effort was that, in addition to tracking age and sex, we tried to look more carefully at   cohort effects Basically, what we are now seeing is that the participation rates of women   coming into the working age population relative to the participation of those exiting it are not as   different as they were in years past In earlier years the participation of women entering the   labor force was so much higher than those who were leaving that it was driving an aggregate   increase And now, looking at that more carefully, the difference is less pronounced than it had                                March 22, 2005 25 of 116  been in the past So our forecast for the participation rate of women is a little flatter, going   forward  "
8079,2005-05-03," Just briefly, the special topic at the June meeting will be the question of    recent developments in housing, with a special focus on whether or not we think a housing bubble                                       May 3, 2005 103 of 116  has developed The lineup is Josh Gallin and Andreas Lehnert here at the Board They are going to   present our views on the probability and potential magnitude of an asset price misalignment in   residential real estate markets  And they’re also going to talk about how that might unwind if, in   fact, there is some overvaluation  They will address the issues of whose balance sheet the risks   reside on and what the consequences might be for household and financial institutions should we get   a more serious retrenchment in house prices  Dick Peach from the New York Fed is going to offer a   more skeptical assessment of those bubble concerns, and Glenn Rudebusch and John Williams of the   San Francisco Fed have agreed to discuss what, if any, consequences there might be from conditions   in the housing market for your monetary policy  We’re going to post the presentations at least a   week in advance, and we’ll also post any supporting materials as they become available  "
8080,2005-05-03," Thank you, Mr Chairman  In reviewing my remarks from  the last meeting, I managed to find that at least one of my insights had survived the  intermeeting period  If you will allow me, I quote “While I can easily imagine  looking back on these words with regret, the persistent and widespread  improvements that we are now witnessing certainly leave the impression that the  expansion is more firmly established and less fragile with respect to shocks than it  was in early 2004” Unfortunately, as I see it, the surviving insight is that I would  come to regret my words  Just how much, I think remains an open question  But the  past six weeks have clearly restored a greater sense of two-way risks to the outlook   Just as the great preponderance of data that became available in the early part of  the year had led us to revise up our outlook for the real economy, it seems nearly  every major economic release since the last meeting has been to the low side of our  expectations The litany of bad news has been long and varied Private payrolls  increased by just 100,000 in March In the manufacturing sector, output slipped a bit  that month, and our estimates for January and February were revised down  A very  weak retail sales report for March held down the growth of overall consumer  spending in the first quarter With orders and shipments for capital equipment  having dropped sharply in March, growth of equipment and software spending is  looking a bit weaker in the first half of this year than was incorporated in the  previous forecast Moreover, the data on merchandise trade for February suggest that  demand for our exports was softer than we had expected and that a greater portion of  domestic demand is being met by foreign rather than domestic producers  And,  reflecting the softer tone of the economic data, stock prices dropped about 4 percent  below our March baseline assumptions  All in all, it has been a pretty downbeat  collection of data   As you know, we lowered our forecast of the growth of real GDP for the first  two quarters of the year We now estimate that growth in the first quarter was about  3 percent, in line with the advance estimate of the BEA [Bureau of Economic  Analysis] and more than 1 percentage point below our March forecast  For the most  part, we didn=t see much to argue with in the BEA=s estimate; in comparison with  them, we are projecting a slightly larger contribution from net exports and a slightly  lower contribution from inventory investment but the same top line  With much of  the softness in the data occurring later in the quarter, we also revised down our  projection for second-quarter growth of real GDP to 3½ percent, about ½ percentage  point below our previous projection Some of that weakness is projected to carry  forward, so that the GDP gap at the end of 2006 is about 1 percent in this forecast  rather than being nearly eliminated as it was in our previous forecast  And that                                                  May 3, 2005 10 of 116  larger output gap occurs despite the fact that we trimmed our path for the funds rate  by 25 basis points starting in the second half of this year   Obviously, the relevant questions at this point are What are the explanations for  the recent spate of disappointing economic reports and what are the accompanying  implications for the outlook?   One plausible hypothesis is that what we have experienced has largely been  statistical noise that has produced a weak quarter of GDP growth but that should  have little or no implication for our assessment of the strength of the economy going  forward There is evidence to support this view Perhaps most notably, initial  claims for unemployment insurance have averaged about 325,000 over the past  month—a figure at the low end of the range that has prevailed as the labor market  has gradually but steadily improved  And insured unemployment has also continued  to drift lower So there is not much sign of an inflection point in activity here   Moreover, despite last month=s weak retail sales report, home sales remained strong,  and the reports we have received from the automakers suggest that motor vehicle  sales were solid in April These are developments that don=t seem consistent with a  view that consumers are in the process of throwing in the towel  And in the business  sector, anecdotal reports from our contacts have generally remained favorable both  with respect to their order books and their capital spending plans   Those considerations made us comfortable discounting significantly the recent  weakness in the data But we didn’t think it was prudent to dismiss that weakness  entirely, either There simply was too much bad news  In addition, there was  corroboration for some of the downbeat statistical readings from other sources  The  poor performance of retail sales has coincided with a sag in measures of consumer  sentiment over the past few months  Likewise, the reports from purchasing  managers are consistent with the slower growth of manufacturing activity that  appears to have occurred since the turn of the year   A second plausible explanation is that the run-up in energy prices is taking a  greater toll on activity than we had anticipated The price of gasoline has soared in  recent months  And while I doubt that many households are monitoring far-dated  futures prices for oil, there may be a growing realization that the ramp-up in gasoline  prices is likely to prove a persistent drain on purchasing power That, in turn, may  be leading consumers to trim spending in other areas  Further evidence that  households may be viewing the recent increases in gasoline prices as likely to be  longer-lived can be gleaned from the mix of motor vehicles being sold  In contrast  to most of last year, we are now seeing signs that households are shifting purchases  away from large gas-guzzling models to smaller more fuel-efficient vehicles   Businesses too, no doubt, are feeling the squeeze on their incomes, and, in light of  the uncertainty about how households are responding to the recent jump in energy  prices, they may be pulling back a bit from hiring and capital spending until the  situation clarifies itself                                                   May 3, 2005 11 of 116  By our estimates, the depressing effects of the increase of oil prices since  December 2003 on the growth of real GDP should be peaking in the first half of this  year, so the timing is consistent with our view that energy prices may well have been  an important factor in the slowdown in activity that we have experienced  But the  weakness seems too extensive to stem from that cause alone   Accordingly, we have also put some weight on the possibility that the incoming  data are signaling that underlying aggregate demand is not as strong as we had  earlier anticipated Of course, one interpretation of that observation is that the  degree of monetary accommodation may not have been as large as we had  previously gauged   Over much of the past year, despite gradual increases in the real funds rate, our  estimates suggested that we could be very comfortable with the view that policy  remained accommodative—a view that seemed consistent with the incoming data on  the economy  We still see monetary policy as accommodative, at least from a  medium-term perspective, but we recognize that we are now edging into grayer  territory The confidence intervals around estimates of the equilibrium real funds  rate that we show in the Bluebook are intended to give you a sense of just how  ignorant we are about its precise value, if that wasn=t already abundantly obvious to  you   We certainly can=t rule out that we have overreacted to the recent news A  rebound in April spending, a few upward revisions to data from earlier months, and  this recent period will barely register a ripple on the surface of a solid underlying  expansion But I would note that our reaction has not been idiosyncratic either  Market participants have also marked down their path for the federal funds rate by  about as much as we have over the intermeeting period   Of course, weaker real activity has been only one of the difficulties with which  we have had to contend The news on inflation, for the most part, has also been  somewhat disappointing, especially the readings on energy and import prices  In  response, we have revised up prices in these two areas noticeably in the first half of  the year The incoming data on core consumer prices were only a tad above our  expectation To be sure, the 04 percent increase in the core CPI grabbed  considerable attention But we correctly anticipated that this increase would  translate into a milder 02 percent increase for the market-based core PCE measure   This was higher than we had projected in the March Greenbook, but by an amount  measured in basis points, not tenths   Taken together, these developments led us to mark up our forecast for headline  PCE inflation in the first half of the year by about ¼ percentage point to 2¾ percent  at an annual rate, while our forecast for the increase in core PCE prices has remained  at about a 2 percent annual rate The upward revisions in headline inflation in the                                          May 3, 2005 12 of 116  first half do have consequences for inflation going forward  Higher consumer price  inflation, through a combination of formal and informal arrangements in labor  markets and perhaps through some slippage in inflation expectations more generally,  seems likely to find its way eventually into wage inflation and back into prices  That  was the motivation for the upward adjustment to our projection of core consumer  price inflation to 19 percent this year and 17 percent next year—01 percent higher  than our March projection in both years However, the contour of our inflation  projection remains the same  As in past forecasts, we expect some slight easing of  pressures on inflation as the pass-through of higher prices for oil, imports, and other  commodities begins to wane   Of course, it remains an open question as to whether and when we will get the  slowing in oil and materials costs that we are projecting  For the most part, we  continue to take our cues from futures markets for these prices  Although I cannot  see a clearly superior alternative, I will admit this approach has not been a surefire  recipe for success over the past year During that time, the cumulative upward  revision in our forecast for core PCE prices in 2005 has been about ¾ percentage  point As we noted in yesterday=s Board briefing, we believe that this revision can  largely be explained by the upward surprises that we have experienced in the prices  of oil, imports, and commodities  Looking forward, an easing of those pressures  remains an important element of our forecast  But it remains just that, a forecast   Moreover, we recognize that, at some point, the consequence of a series of cost  shocks could look to many people an awful lot like an accelerating price level  And  if that view were to cement itself, the implications for inflation expectations and the  feedback into wages and prices could be a less favorable inflation outcome than  shown in the Greenbook   In that regard, we continue to draw comfort from the fact that wage inflation has  shown no signs of increase during the past couple of years Hourly labor  compensation from the national accounts increased 4 percent at an annual rate in the  first quarter, below both our March projection and the average pace posted last year   More surprisingly, the employment cost index, released last Friday after completion  of the Greenbook, showed an increase in hourly compensation of just 2½ percent at  an annual rate in the first quarter—with wages rising at a subdued pace of just under  2½ percent and hourly benefits slowing to a 4¼ percent pace, the smallest rate of  increase we=ve seen in quite some time  This is certainly good news and suggests  that we are not yet witnessing anything that looks like a wage-price spiral   But it=s still the case that we have presented you with a forecast that shows both  higher price inflation and a wider output gap, and thus a less attractive set of policy  options from which to choose  Moreover, if I were a sensitive, sharing kind of guy,  I=d probably admit that the incoming data have raised my anxieties about the  outlooks both for activity and for inflation However, while it wasn=t covered in any  of my management training, I have made it a strict rule to avoid developing any  emotional entanglements with the forecast that I supervise so as not to complicate                                             May 3, 2005 13 of 116  my professional or personal life  [Laughter] If I step back and take a more  dispassionate look, while recent developments have highlighted reasons for concern,  the outlook still remains quite favorable  The economy has been averaging growth  at or above potential over the past year despite what has been a huge energy price  shock, the removal of massive fiscal stimulus, and the withdrawal of monetary  accommodation  And after a dip in the first quarter, growth is projected to return to  its above-trend pace starting in the current quarter Meanwhile, even with sharply  higher oil prices, a declining dollar, rising commodity costs, and diminishing slack,  core consumer prices are up only 1¾ percent over the past 12 months—a pace that  remains low even by the standards of the past decade  And we are projecting core  PCE inflation to remain at or below 2 percent over the projection period  By most  objective metrics, it remains a bright picture   Having accumulated another 2,000 words of potential regret, I should probably  turn the floor over to Karen at this point    We certainly haven’t seen any surge in orders to domestic producers that   would be indicative of that    I don’t think a mix story is explaining the first-quarter divergence there   The big slowdown in the benefits component came from what the ECI is measuring as employer   contributions to pension plans; there was a big drop in that component  It doesn’t necessarily have   to line up, in an accounting sense, with what’s happening in the national income accounts  So, I   think it’s more than the wage mix side that seems to be—    They’re not measuring that exact same component on a quarterly basis   in the same way    It could be But also we have seen big discrepancies in the past that   haven’t necessarily ever been reconciled in later publications of the national income accounts  So   it’s conceivable    Perhaps    First of all, on whether or not we’ve experienced the pothole, I think   you’re certainly right that January isn’t necessarily the perfect test But I don’t think that the   hypothesis you suggested would work, in the sense that the equipment had to have been installed by   the end of December to qualify for partial expensing    Not just ordered There were a couple of exceptions to that general rule,   but the equipment was supposed to have already been installed  So the timing doesn’t look good for                                 May 3, 2005 19 of 116  the pothole story But that doesn’t necessarily mean, given how noisy those data are, that we   couldn’t still be seeing some pothole effect now    To be honest, we took out most of our pothole effect at the time of the last forecast, but we   didn’t take all of it out So we certainly think there’s some consistency between what we’ve seen   and our assumption that there would be a pothole effect  You’re right that we certainly didn’t view   the March reading as indicating a huge turning point  We just basically fed those data through our   near-term statistical filters, and then, beyond the near term, allowed our econometric model to   “speak,” if you will And the econometric models still revise down the level of investment spending   over this forecast horizon So it isn’t the case that we offset the weakness that we saw; we’ve   actually carried that forward    It’s a level effect We had a drop in long-term interest rates, which   tended to cushion, through the cost of capital, some of the downward revision that we would have   had otherwise And we’ve allowed a little bit of the accelerator effect to show through As we look   at the situation, it is still the case, if one believes that underlying final sales are continuing to expand   at a reasonable clip—and we recognize that that’s an open question but that’s the view that we have   taken in the forecast—that the cost of capital is low And corporations’ balance sheets still look   pretty strong to us Corporations are sitting on a very big pile of liquid assets, so we don’t think   there’s going to be much difficulty financing this amount of investment spending  So, this is one of   those areas where we have read the recent news as probably more noise than signal  We have given   it some signal, though, and that’s why we have the level a bit lower by the end of this forecast than   we did last time    The rise in energy prices that we’ve had suggests to us—and especially   as we look at those far-dated futures contracts—that this probably is going to be a drag on the level   of potential output going forward   We made a more discrete adjustment in the fall to reflect that  And when we update our   entire supply-side portion of the forecast in June, we’re going to have to revisit that issue We do   see this as a factor While we haven’t heard a lot of reports of firms talking about increasing   scrappage of capital equipment, given the significant change in relative factor prices that there has   been, we’d expect to see some of that going forward  So, we look at the rise in the relative price of   energy as a negative for potential output It would be a small negative, because those effects occur   over very long periods of time  It isn’t usually reflected as a very large discrete change in the level   of potential output, but it could be a factor weighing on it    You’re raising a good question, and I don’t know the answer There   could conceivably be some nonlinearity in that process  But I think we’re talking about effects that   are measured in tenths of a percentage point—not quarters or halves of a percentage point—in terms   of the effects on multifactor productivity, or, in essence, capital input going forward    The result of that exercise suggests, if anything, a little surprise that we   didn’t get a touch more pass-through  Actually, I was surprised when I first saw those results but not   after I sat back and thought more carefully  Certainly, if you had told me in late 2003, when oil   prices were $25 to $28 a barrel, that they were going to be something north of $50, that the markets   would perceive that as being very largely a permanent change, that we would see an ongoing   depreciation of the dollar and a very significant acceleration in intermediate materials prices, I think   I would have said core consumer price inflation now of just 1¾ percent would be a pretty good   outcome  So, as I thought more about it, I was more comfortable with the results that we presented   yesterday   Now, as we indicated in the Greenbook in an alternative simulation, while we are   comfortable with our inflation forecast, we could certainly understand it if you were less comfortable   with our assessment of the pass-through to core inflation, given that this has been an area where we   have made persistent errors  It’s very hard to estimate these pass-through effects  I know of work   done over the years at the Board and by Reserve Bank staff aimed at trying to estimate indirect   energy price effects or import price effects  Sometimes the coefficients are zero and sometimes they   are large It looks to us as if, more recently, the size of those coefficients has diminished, but that                                             May 3, 2005 22 of 116  could simply be a function of the fact that many of those variables were relatively stable over a long   period of time  It’s just very hard to estimate precisely what the effects are  Our alternative   simulation, where we doubled the size of those pass-through effects, is intended to give you a sense   of how far things could get out of line if we made a rather big error in the size of the pass-through    And, as we noted, there would be a very noticeable effect going forward So, it does seem   reasonable to wonder not only about whether we have the underlying forecast right for oil, imports,   and other commodities but also whether we have the pass-through of that correct    First, I’d note that we are not necessarily buying into the BEA’s March   assumption, which showed another very large inventory accumulation  In fact, that’s one of the   areas where, in writing down our forecast, we differed—to the tune of about $6 or $7 billion—with   the BEA We have a lower level of inventory investment  So, that’s just their forecast against ours   At least on our assessment, the BEA’s figures overstate the extent to which inventories were   accumulated in the first quarter   Now, in terms of looking for areas where there are inventory imbalances, it’s quite clear that   one problem area is the motor vehicle industry  They’re still sitting with a very large days’ supply of   cars and especially of trucks We do think the implication of that would be a drag on GDP growth                                             May 3, 2005 23 of 116  going forward, and we’re already seeing signs that the auto manufacturers are cutting back   production The other problem areas are a little harder to identify  Supplies of some types of   chemicals look a little high at this point, and in paper and printing and a few other areas there   apparently are some higher levels of inventory–sales ratios  We think that is part of the reason why   we’re in a bit of a soft period for industrial production  When we look at that flow-of-goods system   that we report occasionally in the Greenbook—which doesn’t use the Census Bureau and BEA data   on inventories but infers inventories from what we think is going on with production and   consumption—that shows not much going on at all  If anything, the weakness in industrial   production suggests that maybe the inventory investment in the Census Bureau data may be   overstated to some extent  So, it’s an area we’re watching, but it doesn’t seem to us as if a   significant problem has developed    I might note also that yesterday’s purchasing managers’ report showed a drop in the number   of purchasing managers who viewed their customers’ inventories as too high  That had inched up,   and it’s come back some  So at this point, we’re inclined to think that some of what has happened   in the first quarter was probably unintended inventory accumulation  That is a negative for the   second quarter’s GDP growth, but it isn’t what I would call a significant inventory cycle at this   point    They do I don’t actually have that figure in front of me  In motor   vehicles, they are basically doing a unit accounting They use different seasonals than we do, but   they should be showing something like that    Right    Mr Chairman, I would note that I do have in front of me a table   showing the BEA’s assumptions for March, and the BEA is showing a liquidation of motor vehicle   stocks but very large accumulations elsewhere  "
8143,2005-06-29," Thank you, Mr Chairman  We have five briefings this afternoon and   the issues covered in those briefings are so intertwined that we thought it would be best if we just                                                                                       3 The materials used by Messrs Gallin, Lehnert, Peach, Rudebusch, and Williams are appended to this transcript  (appendix 1)      June 29-30, 2005 4 of 234  presented all five and then opened the floor for discussion and questions afterward  We recognize   that a long presentation, coming right after lunch and while a number of you are still probably a bit   jet-lagged, could test your powers of concentration, but I think you’ll find the presenters to be both   well informed and entertaining  [Laughter]  So with that we’ll begin     We’re here to answer your questions and to listen to your  discussion     Mr Chairman, we have, in fact, looked at farmland values and at the   data that are collected by the Reserve Banks, and there has been an appreciable acceleration in   farmland prices  It varies a considerable degree by District  For example, in areas like the San                                                   June 29-30, 2005 25 of 234  Francisco District or the Richmond District, where the interface of the urban expansion into   agricultural areas probably is greater, we’ve seen a much more pronounced acceleration than, for   example, in the Dallas District   As we put that all together, it is true that we don’t have a good series broken down by   regional land prices per se  But it’s very difficult to believe that the acceleration we’ve seen in   residential property prices doesn’t reflect to a very significant degree an increase in land prices    While it may be difficult to do Morris’s type of calculation, we just haven’t seen anything like the   acceleration in basic construction costs that would suggest anything other than a substantial increase   in land values  And when we looked at those farmland prices to see if there was some confirmation   of that impression in the agricultural land prices, it seemed pretty clear that we were seeing that    Again, that doesn’t necessarily mean that the farmland is overvalued  I think the same questions are   open on the agricultural land prices as they are in Dick’s and Josh’s debate about whether or not   housing is overvalued, but there has been a substantial step-up in recent years    I think Josh and Dick should have an opportunity to talk a little more   about their differences of view in this area      Let me make one other point on the reasons why there may have been   an increase in the equilibrium price-rent ratio, because I certainly agree with you and President   Yellen that there are some good reasons  Those reasons could well include financial innovation,   changes in capital gains taxation, and supply constraints  However, lots of asset price   misalignments start out with situations where there are good reasons why those prices are rising   rapidly  Productivity innovation and changes in business models, and so forth, were I think   probably valid explanations for the increase in stock market prices, but that doesn’t mean—     While they were probably valid explanations for the stock market rise   in the ’90s, they didn’t necessarily, in the end, go all the way to explaining how far those valuations   had moved, even if they had somewhat of a solid economic impetus to begin with     Okay     You have to think in terms of the environment that we are forecasting to   occur  It’s a pretty tame interest rate environment; so it’s not one that will necessarily generate   significant concerns about the costs of those reset mortgages  Now, obviously, we could be wrong   in both directions  One could imagine a situation where the rates rose faster  And that’s one of the   channels by which monetary policy has traction on the economy; if households face higher rates,   they would curtail their spending in response to that  But presumably you’d only be raising rates   more rapidly because, in essence, you needed restraint on aggregate demand  So you would   welcome that result, as long as it wasn’t precipitating some big nonlinear type of event in terms of   people responding very, very sharply to that kind of change in the environment    That certainly seems possible When I look at Josh’s exhibit 3 on   page 5, I see the Miami price-rent ratio at 64 percent above its trend  Now, it’s possible that   everybody just woke up and decided, boy, there are people in Miami who are just really terrific to   be around—it’s an exciting city and fascinating people live there  [Laughter] But it’s also possible   that that statistic could be an indication that people have unrealistic expectations about the rate of   increase in house prices expected in Miami  And there is certainly a lot of anecdotal evidence that   in that particular city there is a lot of flipping of properties going on as well as other developments   that might not be reflective of a purely equilibrium move in house prices or of agglomeration   economies   So I’m still a little nervous about this  There are a lot of good reasons why prices ought to   be high relative to rents and relative to incomes  And I think even President Poole’s suggestion that   maybe housing is undervalued can’t be ruled out  We’ve done simple dividend discount-type   calculations on rents and interest rates  And if you make a certain assumption about the growth rate   of real rents going forward and the persistence of low interest rates, you can get figures showing   further appreciation of maybe not 40 percent but rates that are pretty high  So we think that’s within   the probability distribution  But we’re also worried that we’re seeing in many markets and for the                                          June 29-30, 2005 65 of 234  nation as a whole a run-up in prices that certainly looks very unusual by historical standards  It   could very well be that this time is different and it’s all being driven by fundamentals  But we don’t   think you should rule out the possibility that you could be facing a period in which prices could be   declining or just be softer   One point that has been made is that we obviously don’t know how the end will look—if   there is an end  The end could come through a long period of just relatively subdued growth in   nominal house prices  It wouldn’t have to be associated with a 20 percent decline  As we noted in   the Greenbook, that is an extreme drop  In fact, to get to John’s scenario 3, a lot of extreme things   have to happen It takes an unusually large drop in house prices and a lot of spillover effects  As   you recall, the first scenario was pretty tame; if you move down 50 basis points on interest rates, it   offsets that  But if you layer on top of the decline in house prices a big drop in consumer   confidence, a big equity extraction effect, or a much bigger wealth effect from housing—which   looks to us to be pretty much on the edge—and throw in some covariance with a bond market event,   the situation worsens substantially  But it takes a lot to get to a real disaster type of scenario   So even though we feel that house prices have moved out of alignment with the   fundamentals, we don’t necessarily think the implications of that are that you’re going to be   confronted immediately with some large problem  In fact, our best guess would be that the   misalignment would unwind in ways that would be quite feasible for you to offset and insulate    There are questions on the supervisory side  There I don’t think the historical evidence   suggests that supervisory policy has been used effectively to head off asset bubbles or to elegantly   deflate them when they occur  What you might hope to do is to have in place policies that will   prevent the kind of spillover effects of John’s scenario 2 so that you just have a wealth effect  In   other words, house prices might go down or soften and that will show up on various agents’ balance                             June 29-30, 2005 66 of 234  sheets as a reduction in wealth  One might hope that they respond accordingly and that we won’t   have the complications with intermediation or other kinds of things that would add to that effect  So   our story basically is that we’re worried about valuations in the housing market, but we don’t   necessarily see that as having profound consequences for your policy going forward   "
8144,2005-06-29," We didn’t think at the time that we needed much special explanation   because, as you can see in David’s upper right-hand panel, the four-quarter change in comp per hour   was still below 5 percent and it only edged a bit above the ECI  So, we didn’t really see that as a   divergence As David noted, we went through a period from mid-2001 through mid-2003 where   comp per hour was running below the ECI  We were viewing the acceleration that occurred in the   P&C measure through the middle of last year as a series being just a bit noisier and running a little                                      June 29-30, 2005 93 of 234  above the earlier pace It was really when we got to the fourth quarter and had that extraordinary   increase—which we do think reflects to some degree the stock option exercises and bonuses—that   we thought that story was an important one in explaining the divergence    In part I’d answer that question by saying that I don’t view our funds   rate path as a prescription  We are not trying to convey to you what you should do  In our thinking   about this, we were confronted with a couple of crosscurrents in the forecast this time around that   led us just to leave the funds rate path unchanged  One was that we got higher inflation and higher   inflation forecasts, which might have been pushing us up  On the other hand, much of that was a   supply-shock kind of effect where we were getting higher oil prices and a stronger dollar, and those   factors would have been weakening GDP had we raised the funds rate  So, that confronts you as   policymakers with the choice  It’s not that we think you ought to pick the funds rate path we wrote   down as the baseline forecast  It’s a case in which you’re confronted with a shock, and that has   made the tradeoff less favorable for you, and you’re going to have to think about how much of that   you would want to take in lower output and how much in higher inflation   So, you’re right, we could have raised the funds rate path  We showed an alternative   simulation in which you tightened a bit more aggressively and that brings the inflation rate down to   1¾ percentage point at the cost of something on the order of 3 percent GDP growth going forward    That’s about all I’d have to say on that    I think part of the purpose of putting that in the Bluebook was to   suggest that if you in fact view your objective as 1½ percent on core PCE inflation and you want to                                June 29-30, 2005 98 of 234  react in the way that optimal path suggests, you would need to be tighter than in the baseline   assumption in the Greenbook  Those differences are pretty small because while I don’t follow that   path precisely, I use that as some guidance in thinking about where to set the funds rate path for the   Greenbook  Our goal is to put a forecast on the table that would be helpful to you in your   discussion    You could view that either as a higher inflation objective or, as I’m   assuming, more patient monetary policymakers—a case in which you achieve that objective over a   longer period of time    At this point, obviously, what we don’t know dwarfs by several orders   of magnitude what we do know  We do know from the Annual Survey of Manufacturers that the   M3 data probably overstated the growth rate of capital spending in 2003  That could be a source of   downward revision And the annual retail sales revisions also pointed to a little softer path for   consumer spending  I wouldn’t want to make a big deal out of those things, simply because there’s   so much else that we will learn that could completely offset them  But if we had to guess now, we’d   expect the changes to be in the direction of a small downward revision on the level of GDP    If I had to guess, I’d say ameliorated in the sense that in the last couple   of quarters when that gap has gotten quite large, it was being driven by the very rapid gains in   compensation per hour  Now, another reason for us to think that these increases are probably                                   June 29-30, 2005 100 of 234  reflective of something like stock options is that if you wanted to measure output from the income   side, what the income side would be saying is that there must have been an explosion of growth in   output over the fourth and first quarters  We just don’t see that confirmed by other evidence either   in physical product data from industrial production or labor market developments  We see nothing   that would suggest that that in fact occurred     We’re expecting that the BEA is still not going to know anything for probably another   couple of years in terms of getting income data that would actually allow them to pin this down    But our expectation is that there probably would be some downward revision to corporate profits in   2004 to reflect the fact that some of that involved stock option exercises that have not yet been   picked up in corporate reports   MR WILCOX Even there, though, the timing within the year is very uncertain  We don’t   know how they parse it out across the quarters and whether it would line up tightly with the stock   option story    Mr Chairman, could I just correct something that I said earlier?  On the   revisions to GDP, we have received data that we think will ultimately result in a downward revision   to E&S spending, but it’s not clear that they actually are going to get incorporated in the annual   revision that comes out this year  Evidently the Census schedule currently calls for their revised   data to be given to the BEA after the annual revision, so they won’t be picked up  That’s the biggest   of the components of the data that we’ve gotten toward revised GDP  "
8235,2005-09-20," In adjusting our forecast of the US economy to incorporate  the consequences of Hurricane Katrina, we were forced to rely more on economic  judgment and assumption than our models  Perhaps that is just as well, given what I  heard last month in Jackson Hole  At various turns, the staff was criticized for                                                   September 20, 2005 11 of 117  building models that bear no resemblance to economic reality and praised—or at least  I think it was praised—for then having the good sense to essentially ignore those  models through the wise use of add factors   That mixed message reminded me of a story told by Nobel laureate Ken Arrow   During World War II, Arrow was assigned to a team of statisticians to produce long- range weather forecasts  After a time, Arrow and his team determined that their  forecasts were not much better than pulling predictions out of a hat  They wrote their  superiors, asking to be relieved of the duty  They received the following reply, and I  quote “The Commanding General is well aware that the forecasts are no good   However, he needs them for planning purposes”  [Laughter]    I’ll have to admit that we face more than the usual challenges in the period ahead   Over the next few months, I suspect that we will encounter considerable difficulty  extracting the macroeconomic signal from economic data that could be profoundly  affected by the consequences of this disaster  But as we set ourselves to that task, it  will be important not to lose sight of the fact that the larger influences of monetary  and fiscal policy, financial conditions, and global energy developments, rather than  the hurricane, are likely to dominate the macroeconomic outcome a year hence   In that regard, while it might seem like ancient history and a world away, most of  the macro data that we received since the August Greenbook provide a window on  how these forces were shaping economic developments prior to Katrina  In brief, we  saw the balance of the incoming information as broadly consistent with our view that  the economy had been growing at a brisk pace early in the second half    In particular, the household sector seemed especially buoyant  Sales of motor  vehicles were receiving a considerable boost from the employee discount programs   And last week’s retail sales report for August suggested consumer spending  excluding motor vehicles had been well maintained  Meanwhile, housing activity  remained strong, with both starts and sales holding near historic highs  I should  mention that this morning’s release showed housing starts in August remaining above  2 million units at an annual rate—close to our expectations  Even the external sector  appeared poised to make a contribution to current-quarter growth, rather than being  the drag we had earlier anticipated   But there were some disappointments as well, mostly focused in the business  sector Growth of factory output has slowed noticeably, with manufacturing IP  [industrial production] having averaged increases of 02 percent in recent months—  half the pace seen late last year We have interpreted that deceleration as reflecting  efforts by firms to bring inventories into better alignment with sales, and we expect  some pickup in activity as this process plays out  But as yet, we have few hard data  to suggest a marked improvement is close at hand                                           September 20, 2005 12 of 117  The incoming information on new orders and shipments for nondefense capital  goods also has been on the soft side of our expectations  Spending on computers  looks to be on track for a 16 percent increase in the current quarter, a relatively  modest gain for this component and well below our previous projection  And outlays  for capital goods outside of the tech area have been about flat since the turn of the  year As you may recall, equipment investment was surprisingly strong in the second  half of last year, and we may now be experiencing some payback for the earlier  strength It is also possible, however, that higher oil prices could be damping  business confidence, raising uncertainty about the outlook and making firms more  reluctant to invest And, of course, we can’t rule out the possibility that the recent  weakness in equipment spending reflects a dearth of profitable investment  opportunities, which would raise questions about the underlying thrust of aggregate  demand going forward  For now, we think it is too early to reach that conclusion, but  the recent softness here certainly raises that risk   Putting these pluses and minuses together, we thought the economy was on track  for growth in the vicinity of 4 percent in the second half of this year  We were  encouraged in that interpretation by the ongoing improvement in labor markets   Gains in private payrolls had averaged about 175,000 in recent months, and with the  readings on initial claims remaining in the low 300,000s, a continuation of those  increases seemed likely   Looking a little further down the road, there had been the usual crosscurrents in  the key factors influencing the contours of our forecast  Oil prices continued to rise,  siphoning off even more purchasing power from households  But, we were surprised  yet again by the strength in housing prices, with the OFHEO [Office of Federal  Housing Enterprise Oversight] repeat-transactions index up about 13 percent in the  year ending the second quarter The associated upward revision to housing wealth  more than offset a slightly weaker stock market to boost overall household net worth  over the projection period  All in all, it seems likely that, absent the hurricane, we  would have been presenting to you a forecast that was very similar to that in the  August Greenbook   It is, of course, an understatement to say that Katrina creates complications for  our forecast—some that we have confronted in the past and some that are unique to  this episode  There has been a sizable destruction of the capital stock; we have  assumed that loss to be about $75 billion, but at this point any estimate must be  considered a guess subject to substantial revision  There has been an unprecedented  displacement of people and activity from the Gulf Coast region  Important links in  the nation’s transportation network have been disrupted  And of perhaps greatest  concern from a macroeconomic perspective, the economy has been subjected to a  further energy price shock at a time when households and businesses already were  having to cope with the effects of nearly two years of steadily climbing prices                                                 September 20, 2005 13 of 117  As we noted in the Greenbook, our assessment is that, with a few wrinkles, the  influence of Katrina on economic activity will trace out a pattern similar to that we  have seen after previous disasters  Output will be depressed in the near term by the  disruptions to production in the region and elsewhere  As those disruptions ease,  activity begins to recover And then once rebuilding efforts really get under way,  output receives a considerable boost  In reality, aspects of all three of these phases  operate simultaneously—but with different intensities as time passes   In that regard, one can’t fail to be impressed with how rapidly some aspects of the  recovery process already are occurring—in many cases, faster than was initially  expected Some evacuees are finding employment elsewhere; many firms are either  temporarily or permanently relocating offices and employees; and workarounds are  being found for some of the transportation bottlenecks that have developed   Still, there is no denying that the disruptions remain substantial  About 15 percent  of total US oil production and 7 percent of US natural gas output remain shut in at  facilities located in the Gulf  As Karen noted, four refineries are still off line and full  recovery may not occur for several more months  Activity in the chemical,  shipbuilding, and food processing industries—to name just a few—remains seriously  impaired  More broadly, business has been disrupted throughout the region  And  while many businesses have been effective in developing workarounds, these  adjustments are often less efficient and more expensive than before   In our forecast, we have assumed that these disruptions pull down the level of  activity in the third and fourth quarters, lopping more than ½ percentage point off the  annualized growth of real GDP in the second half of this year  Accompanying this hit  to growth, payroll employment is expected to drop 250,000 in September—a shortfall  of about 400,000 relative to trend Employment is then expected to stage a gradual  recovery in subsequent months    Although rebuilding activities are already under way, those activities don’t really  show through with any macroeconomic force until early next year  In that regard, the  draining and environmental cleanup of New Orleans will slow the rebuilding phase  compared with past hurricane recoveries   The dynamics of the recovery process will be influenced importantly by the  response of the federal government  We have assumed an $85 billion fiscal package,  about $70 billion of which is spent over the next two years  This spending is  projected to provide a powerful counterbalance to the depressing effects of Katrina  and is a chief reason why activity is projected to approach the pre-hurricane baseline  by the middle of next year   Our assumed federal spending package might seem small compared with the $200  billion figure that has gained such attention in recent days  However, we think our                                                  September 20, 2005 14 of 117  package is appropriately scaled to our estimates of the extent of the damage that has  occurred and the dimensions of the economic disruptions  Even with that scaling, I  should note that we have the federal government footing the bill for a vastly larger  share of the losses than is typical—nearly dollar for dollar in our forecast relative to  the 25 percent reimbursement rate that is more the norm   One obvious risk that you confront is that the hurricane, viewed from a  macroeconomic perspective, could prove less disruptive to activity and that a massive  dose of fiscal stimulus is about to be layered on top of an economy that was already  nearing its productive limits  In those circumstances, there is the potential for some  overshooting in output with accompanying upward pressure on inflation   But Katrina has amplified some of the downside risks to the outlook as well   Prior to the storm, we were already concerned about the cumulative effects of the rise  in energy prices over the past two years As we noted in our briefing yesterday, there  is at least some evidence that sharp jumps in the price of oil have at times in the past  been associated with outsized effects on consumption  With the retail price of  gasoline having risen above $300 per gallon in much of the country, there is certainly  cause to be concerned As a macro guy, I hope that those of you involved in  supervision haven’t been too hard on home equity lending, because pretty soon  people are going to need a loan to fill up their SUVs  [Laughter] Moreover, the price  of gasoline is not the only drain on consumer budgets  Households will face another  hurdle this winter when the bills for heating oil and natural gas come due  So this  source of downside risk seems likely to be with us for some time   For now, there simply isn’t much hard evidence to suggest any nonlinear response  is gaining traction As I noted earlier, consumer spending has continued to surprise  us to the upside Although last Friday’s report on sentiment showed a substantial  deterioration, that drop closely matched our expectations  The forecast is predicated  on a gradual recovery in sentiment by the end of the year  If that were not to occur,  we would become more concerned about a greater retrenchment in consumer  spending   Of course, the cumulative effects of higher energy prices also pose some  nonlinear risks to the inflation outlook  Three channels, not entirely independent of  each other, would seem to be of greatest concern a broad-based breakout to the  upside in inflation expectations; an intensified push on the part of workers to restore  real wages for the ground lost to higher energy prices; and an effort by businesses to  more aggressively repair damage that may have occurred to profit margins from  rising energy costs   If one were inclined to worry about the potential for a more pronounced  deterioration in inflation expectations, last Friday’s preliminary read from the  Michigan survey for September might be unsettling  Median year-ahead inflation                                      September 20, 2005 15 of 117  expectations moved up to 46 percent, the highest level since 1990, while  expectations for the next 5 to 10 years edged up to 31 percent, just above the narrow  range in which they have held over the past several years  However, we suspect that  the enormous increase in gasoline prices that took place over the first half of the  month was a contributor to this development, and we would counsel waiting for a few  more readings before concluding that there has been a consequential deterioration in  inflation expectations That view receives some support from TIPs [Treasury  inflation-protected securities]-based measures of inflation compensation, which have  also increased, but by much less than the survey reading   We also don’t see much evidence that we are on the verge of a substantial  acceleration in labor compensation motivated by efforts of workers to restore real  wages Abstracting from the surge late last year that we believe was related, in part,  to stock option exercises and bonuses, the growth of hourly labor compensation has  been reasonably stable over the past few years  And while the labor market has  tightened up, we don’t hear much from our business contacts to suggest that the  competitive environment has changed in a way that would have altered their ability or  inclination to grant substantially larger pay increases in the period ahead   Finally, there is a concern that the steep rise in energy costs has placed the  margins of some businesses under pressure and that efforts to restore margins could  result in more upward price pressure than is currently anticipated in the forecast  To  be sure, there is considerable heterogeneity across industries  However, as best we  can judge, in the aggregate, the margins of nonfinancial non-energy producing  corporations have reached high levels over the past couple of years despite pressures  from energy costs  Hence, businesses either have been reasonably successful in  passing through higher energy costs or have implemented other offsetting  efficiencies Looking forward, we think that we have made adequate allowance for  further pass-through of higher energy prices, but we acknowledge that there are  considerable uncertainties about the magnitude of that effect   Much like the data on real activity, the incoming information on the price side  provides little evidence of an emerging nonlinear response to higher energy prices   Indeed, the recent figures on core inflation have been both well-behaved and to the  low side of our expectations On the basis of last week’s CPI, we estimate that core  PCE prices were up 01 percent in August and are on track for an increase of around  1¼ to 1½ percent at an annual rate in the third quarter  Moreover, prices of core  intermediate materials have actually been falling over the past four months after the  steep run-up experienced last year  We are anticipating some acceleration in core  consumer prices and in core intermediate prices in the months immediately ahead,  owing to the end of the auto incentive programs and the pass-through of higher  energy prices But we have built these effects into the forecast using our usual linear  models as guides, rather than incorporating any outsized effect                                        September 20, 2005 16 of 117  While we do not believe that we have yet experienced nonlinear effects on either  output or inflation, any further upward movement in energy prices would certainly  intensify the risks of such outcomes  With another storm moving toward the Gulf, we  will be watching The Weather Channel closely in the next few days   Before closing, I would like to draw your attention to some substantial changes in   both the content and format of the Greenbook’s green sheets that we implemented   this round As far as we can determine, this is the most significant change in the   forecast presentation in a few decades  We recognize that we may have imposed   some transition costs on those of you who were used to the previous format  But our   objective was to make the presentation more user-friendly and to make the forecast   and how it has changed between rounds more transparent to you and your staffs    Obviously, we are open to suggestions for further improvement and, if past is   prologue, we should be able to work them into the Greenbook at some point in the   next few decades [Laughter]    Karen and I will be happy to take your questions     The part that we actually incorporated into our estimate of potential   output was the destruction of the capital stock—the $75 billion drop there  That is just such a   tiny fraction compared to the overall size of the capital stock that, in fact, it rounded to a tenth on   the capital intensity contribution but rounded to not even a tenth on overall potential GDP  So   we built that part in                         September 20, 2005 17 of 117  Now, it is true that what we are going to be experiencing in the next few months will   have combinations of demand and supply effects, and we didn’t build the temporary disruptions   in the supply chain into our estimate of potential GDP  We could have  You’re right; in some   sense that is a temporary reduction in supply  So we wouldn’t necessarily tell you to take the   output gap estimates in the second half seriously in terms of the notion that a lot more slack has   opened up in the economy   On the labor market side, we actually did think hard about whether or not this event   would be significant enough to raise structural unemployment  Again, our best guess is that   while a little of that may be going on, it isn’t large enough to round to even a tenth on overall   structural unemployment  If all those people we think have been displaced became structurally   unemployed, that would be an increase of a couple of tenths in structural unemployment  But, in   fact, we expect that by early next year that will not be a significant factor pushing up the natural   rate of unemployment  So I think we’ve tried to contend with those issues  As a matter of   presentation, we did build some of the things you raised—for example, the transportation   bottlenecks—into our estimate of potential output    Obviously, in terms of the transmission of that output gap in thinking   about inflation, our Phillips curve in essence is so flat and that slightly higher output gap is so   briefly encapsulated in the forecast that it doesn’t really have any noticeable effect  But we did   think about how we should communicate the consequences of the supply disruptions in potential   output And again, we just decided on reflection that we would incorporate the part that was the   capital stock destruction but not necessarily other supply disruptions that are admittedly going to   be occurring in the next few months    In terms of how the price forecast has evolved over the last couple of   years, the single biggest factor is the higher energy prices  But we’ve also had to contend with   an acceleration—of modest dimension, but an acceleration—in import prices and an increase in   other materials prices  So, in terms of decomposing the sources of revision to our core consumer                                   September 20, 2005 19 of 117  price inflation numbers, those are the main contributors  Beyond that, we haven’t really seen any   other innovations on the cost structure on the side of businesses that we think have lifted core   prices   But in our view, the persistence of higher headline and core inflation over the last few   years will cause—and we do think there has been a little bit of evidence—some small   deterioration in inflation expectations, and we have built that into our forecast  The way that   shows up, as I think you were hinting, comes through some prospective acceleration in nominal   hourly labor compensation  We haven’t seen it yet to any significant degree But in our forecast   we think there will be some indirect effects working through higher labor costs going forward     As for the time dimension over which that will occur, we think that process is probably   under way There may be some evidence of it in the TIPS-based measures that Dino cited, and   the survey evidence suggests that the process may now be beginning  We’re starting to see a   small but gradual erosion in inflation expectations, and that persists through our forecast horizon   Now, looking farther out, with energy prices projected to start declining and headline inflation   coming down from the 3-plus percent area to more like 2 percent going forward, we would   expect that process to reverse a bit in the period beyond the current forecast horizon  So those   inflation pressures probably will diminish a little at that point    Core PCE goes up to 2¼ percent next year and then comes back   down to 2 percent, as the indirect effects of lower energy prices begin to work through  And                                        September 20, 2005 20 of 117  then we’d probably see some beneficial effects in alleviating inflation concerns—this would be   beyond the forecast period—which would help push inflation down a bit further    Surprisingly, or at least surprisingly to me, the Michigan survey has   had a reasonably decent record over many years—better than you might think      Well, on the year-ahead inflation forecast  The longer-term forecast   actually has not been around long enough to develop a lot of observations on that  The evidence   is mixed when you more or less throw all of the determinants of inflation into an equation  In   fact, it’s a matter of some controversy among the researchers on the staff as to whether or not the   Michigan survey has any additional explanatory value  But I recognize that you were just   referring to the straightforward inflation—    Our indexed securities markets have not been around long enough to   develop a really significant track record  I think the evidence on the indexed securities from   other countries is that there is information content in those expectations, but I don’t know what   their general track record has been    Not by me  I think we did that at your request  [Laughter] And we   were not so convinced by the evidence that we’ve maintained that particular series for   forecasting    Indeed, we did not get as much downward revision as we were   expecting and, in essence, we built into this forecast more persistence to the level of   compensation  But the growth rate of compensation as we moved into this year still looks like a   big spike, and the growth rate going forward hasn’t been that much higher  So, I would say that   obviously we were not as optimistic as we were last time around  We had to give that some   weight, but we didn’t necessarily see those data alone as signaling an ongoing acceleration in   labor compensation  The two other pieces of evidence we bring to bear on that are the ECI   [Employment Cost Index], which has shown no acceleration, and average hourly earnings, which             September 20, 2005 24 of 117  also have not shown any additional pickup So that suggests to us that we’re probably on the   right track with regard to the sources of the surge late last year  Speaking more broadly about   overall labor cost pressures, we’re still not interpreting the current situation as one of ongoing   sharp acceleration but rather just a reflection of a higher level last year    I don’t recall whether the ECI data, when we looked at it this spring,   actually resolved the tension between the various measures  David Wilcox indicates that it did   not Okay So we have looked at that, but—    Well, when we looked at it, that didn’t in fact resolve the tension   between them    I think it was a little bit of both  As I indicated, the scale of that   package we thought would be sufficient in some sense, given our estimates of the amount of   damage that has occurred, to provide both the wherewithal to fund substantial amounts of the   rebuilding and to provide significant offsets for income losses that were associated with the   disruptions                   September 20, 2005 28 of 117  The $200 million figure which, as I mentioned in my briefing, has gotten so much   attention recently actually came into play after we closed the Greenbook  But even if that had   come up before, I don’t think we necessarily would have altered our projection significantly    Our reading of that is that if the figure comes in that high, it’s more likely to be because it   includes the funding of some very long range and expensive construction projects around New   Orleans—for example, the significant strengthening of the levees to a category 5 level of   protection That spending would occur outside the window of the current forecast projection   But obviously there are risks, and if I had to be honest, I’d say the risks are probably   more to the upside of the figure that we have built into this forecast than the downside, given the   current political climate in which the general attitude seems to be “we’ll spend whatever it takes   to make this happen”  We illustrated a little bit of that in an alternative simulation that we   showed in the Greenbook in which the disruption effects are relatively small and you get a much   bigger fiscal stimulus  The results associated with that are a drop in the unemployment rate to   below what we would think of as the natural rate and a bit higher inflation pressures  "
8280,2005-11-01,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Most people that I know really  seem to dislike how early holiday decorations go up at the shopping malls these  days Not me I=m a forward-looking kind of guy who likes to plan ahead  You  folks are already on my mind, and I know what would make the perfect holiday  gift for you this year The answers to two questions  How much more will  monetary policy need to be tightened to secure stable prices and maximum  employment?  And, how will you know when you have reached that point?   Unfortunately, Nieman Marcus is not carrying that gift this year, so you will have  to settle for the usual from me—another Greenbook forecast  Yes, I know that=s  about as exciting as a new pair of socks on Christmas morning  But on the  assumption that it=s the thought that counts, I=ll offer my thoughts on those  questions this morning                                  November 1, 2005 13 of 114  Obviously, there is an explicit answer in the Greenbook to the question of how  much farther tightening will need to proceed, and our answer is not much farther   We have assumed that the funds rate tops out at 4¼ percent by the end of the  year—a figure only slightly below current market expectations that place the peak  at a bit above 4½ percent In setting that path, we needed to consider both the  current momentum of the economy and the principal forces likely to be shaping  the contours of aggregate demand over the next two years   At the time of the September Greenbook, we had expected Hurricane Katrina  to exert noticeable restraint on economic activity over the remainder of the second  half The anticipated drag reflected disruptions to production in the region, as  well as the broader response of consumer spending to the steep run-up in retail  energy prices that followed in the wake of the storm  But we saw this shock as  hitting an economy that had retained considerable momentum over the summer  months and did not think that it would be of sufficient dimension to derail the  expansion   Since then we have grappled with the effects of Hurricane Rita, which further  slammed the energy-producing sector in the Gulf Coast and put added upward  pressure most notably on the price of natural gas, and Hurricane Wilma, which  caused disruption and property damage in Florida  Much as we had anticipated  six weeks ago, we are now in a thick data fog that makes it difficult to separate  the underlying trend in the economy from the influence of the storms  But we are  feeling increasingly comfortable arguing that the data support our earlier view  that the economy would retain its momentum this fall    To begin, payroll employment fell in September, but that decline was not as  large as we had expected, and the BLS [Bureau of Labor Statistics] noted that  employment gains outside the areas affected by Katrina were on pace with those  earlier in the year Industrial production took a very large hit in September from  the combined effects of the hurricanes and the Boeing strike, but absent those  factors, factory output apparently would have picked up noticeably in that month   And reports from purchasing managers indicate that these gains are likely to  continue in the period immediately ahead   As you know, we received the BEA=s [Bureau of Economic Analysis] advance  estimate of third-quarter GDP last week after the Greenbook was completed   Real GDP is estimated to have increased 38 percent at an annual rate last quarter,  about ½ percentage point above our forecast  At this point, we have found no  major reasons to quarrel with the BEA and would probably revise up our forecast  of the third quarter toward their estimate  We also didn=t see much in that release  that would cause us to revise our projected increase in real GDP of 3½ percent in  the fourth quarter In any event, taking all of this information together, we see the  economy as having been at least as strong, if not a bit stronger, than we had  anticipated in the September Greenbook                                    November 1, 2005 14 of 114  We project activity to advance at a 3¾ percent pace in the first half of 2006,  similar to that in the second half of this year  We are expecting that rebuilding  efforts and government transfer payments will be providing a noticeable lift to  activity during that period  But aside from those influences, broader  macroeconomic forces are projected to slow the pace of activity as we move  through 2006 and 2007 Tighter monetary policy, waning wealth effects—  including a slowdown in house price appreciation—and diminishing fiscal  stimulus all work to brake the current momentum in activity  Those effects are  only partly offset by some support to disposable incomes and spending from a  projected fall in energy prices All told, the growth of real GDP is expected to be  close to the pace of potential during the next two years—a bit above it in 2006  and a bit below it in 2007   Viewed from a slightly different perspective, the gradual but steady tightening  of monetary policy over the past year and a half has moved the real federal funds  rate into the range of estimates of the equilibrium real rate  That assessment is not  idiosyncratic to the Greenbook The model-based estimates that we provide to  you in the Bluebook are in the same ballpark   These estimates of the equilibrium real rate remain a bit to the low side of  historical norms, but that seems reasonable to us for two reasons  First, the  investment share of output has recovered over the past several years, but it  remains below trend  Second, and perhaps more importantly, the external sector  continues to siphon off a noticeable portion of domestic demand  These  influences persist in our projection, suggesting to us that real rates will need to be  a little lower than usual over the next two years  Of course, it is worth  remembering that a 70 percent confidence interval around the estimates of the  equilibrium real rate is 2 percentage points wide—so there is plenty of scope for  reasonable women and men to come to different views on this issue  That is  especially so because the estimates of r* do not indicate the level of rates  necessary to produce any specific desired rate of inflation   Those wide confidence intervals suggest that the answer to the second  question, how will you know when an appropriate stopping point has been  reached, will be far from obvious After all, under our baseline projection, real  GDP will be growing at a 3¾ percent rate in the first half of next year—faster  than potential  To be sure, as I noted earlier, we will attribute that to rebuilding  effects, but it will be hard to have much conviction about our ability to estimate  the size of those effects  Moreover, on our forecast, core PCE [personal  consumption expenditures] inflation will be edging up early next year to a pace  just shy of 2½ percent   The difficulty is that the case for stopping soon is predicated on developments  that remain forecasts rather than facts  For example, any diminishment of the  impetus to household spending from rising wealth will depend importantly on the  course of house prices We are projecting house prices to decelerate from this                                  November 1, 2005 15 of 114  year=s 10 percent increase to 4 percent in 2006 and 2½ percent in 2007  We seem  to be hearing with greater frequency anecdotes of some cooling in housing  markets, but that certainly is not yet evident in the data   Fiscal policy also is an important element in the projected slowing of  economic activity over the next two years  After hurricane-related spending tails  off over the first half of next year, we are expecting real federal purchases to be  about flat over the remainder of the projection period  We have been encouraged  by the heightened concern being expressed by many on Capitol Hill about the  deteriorating fiscal picture and the need for greater spending discipline  Indeed,  our assumed $85 billion hurricane-relief package that appeared so modest  compared with the figures being bandied about at the time of the last meeting is  looking pretty good right now But whether that translates into more durable  discipline is obviously open to question So the bottom line is that, as we move  into next year, you are likely to have data in hand that continue to suggest solid  expansion, but a forecast of some noticeable slowing by the second half of next  year and into 2007   Confronted with this situation, one could approach the staff projection in a  manner similar to that with which President Reagan approached the Soviet  Union—trust, but verify  In other words, continue to tighten until the data show  more convincingly the effects of policy restraint  Along those lines, we included  in the Greenbook a simulation that laid out the consequences of steadily raising  the funds rate to 5 percent by the meeting in May 2006  This additional  tightening drops the growth of real GDP to just a bit above 2¼ percent late next  year and into 2007; and with growth below that of potential, the unemployment  rate rises to about 5½ percent by the end of the projection period  Core PCE  inflation edges down to 1¾ percent that year, and further disinflation would be in  train beyond the forecast horizon  Depending on your policy preferences, this  outcome might not even be characterized as an “overshooting” but rather simply  establishing more firmly a core inflation rate comfortably below 2 percent   Of course, there are considerable risks surrounding the baseline projection,  and some of those risks would be amplified by a more aggressive tightening of  policy One obvious concern is that at some point the tightening of policy could  trigger a more pronounced retrenchment in spending and activity   In that regard, there are a few straws in the wind worthy of your attention,  most of which are centered in the household sector  Motor vehicle sales have  dropped off sharply since July, and consumer spending excluding motor vehicles  slowed noticeably over the same period and is estimated to have actually declined  in September  So we are heading into the fourth quarter on a weak note  The  softening of spending has also coincided with a steep drop in consumer sentiment   And all of this has occurred in advance of households receiving some very hefty  heating bills this winter                                 November 1, 2005 16 of 114  Should these developments portend a more sustained weakening in consumer  spending, there could be consequences for business sentiment as well; business  attitudes never seemed to shift convincingly from caution to exuberance in this  expansion, and the continued solid gains in capital spending that underpin our  forecast might not materialize if the strength and durability of the economic  expansion were called into question   I should stress that this is not how we are reading the recent data  The slump  in motor vehicle sales looks to us like a payback for the extraordinary spike that  occurred this summer; the drop in other consumer spending in September most  likely reflected the disruptions associated with hurricanes; and declines in  consumer sentiment, like the stock market, have predicted many more recessions  than have actually occurred over the years We don=t yet see the signs of cyclical  contraction But then again, if truth be told, we rarely do much in advance   Of course, we see some prominent risks on the other side of our baseline  projection, and some of those risks would be moderated by a more aggressive  tightening of policy One risk is that we are underestimating the underlying  strength of the expansion, and that left unattended this momentum will carry the  economy beyond its potential  Certainly, last week=s stronger-than-expected  estimate of third-quarter real GDP provides some support to this concern  With  margins of slack in both product and labor markets already slim and with  pressures on business costs intense, an overshooting could result in a further  deterioration in the inflation picture  Our view that the aggregate supply curve is  relatively flat implies the deterioration in inflation would probably be small, but it  also implies that wringing out the added inflation would be costly  Furthermore,  any tendency for inflation expectations to come unmoored would simply  compound the costs of moving inflation back into a more comfortable zone   While I acknowledge these concerns, I don=t, in fact, believe that the risks to  our inflation projection are skewed to the upside  As you know from reading the  Greenbook, we are expecting that the further run-up in energy prices in recent  months will pass through into core inflation early next year and that the higher  headline inflation that we have experienced this year and last will result in some  modest increase in inflation expectations that feed back into the growth of labor  costs   However, to date, indications of a noticeable deterioration in inflation  expectations are largely limited to the very recent step-up in the Michigan Survey  measures, which occurred in the wake of the spike in gasoline prices in  September  And last week=s news on labor costs was a touch to the low side of  our expectations and certainly provided few hints of any sizable acceleration  If  inflation expectations remain firmly anchored, then there may be little to no  increase in core price inflation next year  So, in sum, I am confident that we will  be wrong, but I don=t know in which direction                                   November 1, 2005 17 of 114  You know, the only drawback to shopping early is that you have longer to  second-guess your choices After working on these remarks over the past few  days, I have begun to wonder whether 19 pairs of socks would not have been the  more considerate gift [Laughter]   Karen will continue our remarks    Certainly  Basically, embedded in this forecast is some implicit   deterioration in inflation expectations or underlying inflation momentum on the order of about ½   percentage point from the end of 2003 into 2006  We think we need some of that to explain the   pickup in actual core inflation that we’ve had, which has been a deterioration of about a percentage   point  Some of that follows from the fact that higher headline inflation probably has fed back a bit   into inflation expectations, so we think there has been some slight deterioration there on net  With   energy prices flattening out and then turning down, we have some very low headline inflation   numbers coming soon; that will start to appear around the turn of the year  So we think some of the   pickup that has occurred is likely to unwind, first, as the indirect effects of the higher energy   prices—which we think will still be a small plus early next year—start to wash out by later next                                        November 1, 2005 21 of 114  year As headline inflation comes down, that will reduce somewhat underlying inflation   momentum, and we have inflation expectations moving back down into 2006  It’s a pretty small   move The deceleration we’re projecting in 2007 from 2¼ percent to 2 percent reflects mostly the   indirect effects of energy prices and some slowdown in import prices  But we would think that that   inflation expectations process, which we have built into this forecast and which is relatively minor,   would begin to unwind later in the forecast period    A couple of tenths  One of the reasons for raising this issue is that it   remains a matter of considerable uncertainty on our part  And I think a good case could be made   that we haven’t really seen much sign yet of any underlying inflation being built into the labor cost   side especially  That’s still just a part of our forecast  The pickup we’re projecting in compensation   costs is, in part, a feed-through of higher headline inflation  It’s also, in part, a feed-through of   better productivity finding its way eventually into real wages  But we haven’t really seen it yet  So   I think a case could be made that even the small amount that we have built in could be overdoing it    And that’s one of the reasons we wanted an alternative simulation in the Greenbook in which we   showed you what would happen if we’re wrong about that   Obviously, on the other side, it’s hard to know whether or not your actions and your   statements perhaps have been the key factors keeping overall inflation expectations relatively well   contained  Your actions and communications about policy intentions may have, in essence,   conditioned both the wage- and price-setting environment in which workers and firms currently find   themselves                            November 1, 2005 22 of 114  On the other side of our forecast, if you were to stop tightening soon and communicate that   basically the inflation situation wasn’t a problem, there is some risk that observers would interpret   that to mean you would be more likely to acquiesce to higher inflation going forward  And that   could feed through to expectations  So we also showed a simulation in which things deteriorate   more noticeably on our funds rate assumption than we built into the baseline     As I said, I feel that we’ve balanced the risks  As I looked ahead and asked myself if no   change in inflation expectations going forward would be a balanced forecast—meaning, “is it just as   likely that they’ll be going down as going up over the next year?”—I didn’t think that scenario, in   fact, had balanced risks  So we felt comfortable building in a little more upside on the thought that   that would probably better balance the risks given the inflation pressures that are currently   confronting firms and workers    It does, indeed  In essence, what is going on with the stock market is that   we’ve had a net stimulus in the economy this year coming from the run-up in the stock market that   occurred last year; so there are lagged effects of that earlier increase on spending  Going forward it                                  November 1, 2005 23 of 114  goes from a net stimulus to more of a neutral effect because we’ve made basically a neutral   assumption about the stock market going forward   That contrasts with the housing market, where we think we’re getting a lot of net stimulus   right now But in our forecast of a slowdown to 4 percent, that moves toward neutrality, and then   the 2 percent rise in house prices that we’re forecasting for 2007 actually would impose a little bit of   restraint on overall spending at that point    This is probably putting far too fine a point on it, but they’re both about   equal in the forecast in terms of their overall effects—in terms of the underlying thrust or the   underlying restraint that is being put on growth going forward    On the house price front, obviously, there aren’t market signals  But   we’ve confronted the very same problem of trying to forecast an asset price that we don’t have   enormous confidence in  So the approach that we have taken is that we presented a few models at   the special briefing last July—some models that rely more on the momentum in underlying house   prices and other models that take seriously some sort of error correction to a rent-price ratio to bring   that ratio back into equilibrium  And our forecast is a mix of those various approaches   I guess I’d plead guilty in the sense that our house price forecast, along with our rent forecast,   does imply by the end of the projection horizon a little of what we view as the current over-  valuation diminishing  But mostly that forecast is fairly neutral in that our assessment of over-  valuation pretty much involves prices holding at that higher level going forward  It gets a little   worse in the near term and then gets a little better a bit further out  But it is an element of the   forecast that obviously is important and about which there is considerable uncertainty    We haven’t learned any more  We are not inclined to discount that   figure  We saw nothing in the details to suggest that that would be appropriate  It looks to us like a   translation miss between the BEA’s more detailed construction of the figures out of the orders and   shipments figures and some deflation issues  I think at this point we probably would be closer to 36   than to 38 Karen’s people think they would be inclined to be just a little lower than the BEA’s   current estimate, and we would as well  We learned a bit about deflation on the residential side that   would suggest we’d probably be a little lower than the BEA  But all of that is small potatoes  The   basic story is that it still looks to us to have been stronger than we were expecting and probably   suggests a little more underlying strength than was implicit in our forecast for the second half of the   year  "
8324,2005-12-13," Thank you, Mr Chairman  In the spirit of the season, I am   tempted to report that I bring you great tidings of comfort and joy  However, this is,   after all, the Federal Reserve, so it is probably more appropriate to simply note that   tidings have improved modestly over the intermeeting period  While not quite in the   miracle category, we have raised our projection for the growth of real GDP over the   next two years and lowered our projection of price inflation    As you know, we revised up our estimate of the growth in real GDP in the third   quarter by more than a percentage point and left fourth-quarter growth unchanged  As   a consequence, real output is now projected to expand at an annual rate of nearly 4   percent in the second half of this year—about ½ percentage point faster than we were   forecasting in October The surprising strength in recent months has been widespread    But clearly, one of the standout areas of strength has been consumer spending  To be   sure, sales of light motor vehicles were a bit softer than we had expected, but that was   more than offset by considerably stronger consumer outlays in other areas    This morning=s retail sales report for November provided further evidence of the   underlying strength in consumption  Although spending in the retail control category,   which excludes sales at auto dealers and building supply stores, dropped 06 percent   last month, that decline was more than accounted for by lower gasoline prices  In real   terms, we estimate that spending was up more than 1 percent for the month  That   figure is somewhat stronger than we had expected and would likely cause us to revise   up the growth of consumption nearly ½ percentage point at an annual rate in the fourth   quarter    Business spending also has been strong of late  We are now projecting that growth  in real spending on equipment and software will average 6½ percent at an annual rate in  the second half of this year, an upward revision of nearly 3 percentage points from the  October forecast  The surprise was concentrated in capital spending outside the  transportation and tech sectors, where the incoming data on orders and shipments of  capital goods suggest that the earlier lull in spending has ended  After being about flat  in the first half, we are projecting real outlays in this category to rise 5 percent at an  annual rate in the second half of this year  As you know, we had been puzzled by that  earlier weakness and had been anticipating a recovery of spending in this category  In  the event, that recovery has occurred a bit earlier and with more force than we had  reckoned six weeks ago                               December 13, 2005 10 of 100  In light of the 1 percentage point upward revision that we made to real GDP growth  in third quarter, it may appear a bit surprising that we only carried the higher level, and  not a higher growth rate, into the fourth quarter  But part of our upward surprise in the  third quarter was in non-auto inventory investment  With stocks appearing reasonably  well aligned with sales in most sectors, we didn=t see the need to make any further  upward adjustment to this aspect of the forecast  Moreover, some of the third-quarter  strength in GDP reflected defense spending that seemed likely to have been pulled  forward from the fourth quarter Both of these judgments appear to have been  supported, and then some, by incoming data in the past two days  Yesterday=s Monthly  Treasury Statement and this morning’s reading on retail inventories suggest that both  defense spending and inventory investment are likely to be even weaker in the fourth  quarter than we had written down Balancing these softer readings against the stronger  retail sales data would leave our forecast for real GDP growth in the fourth quarter  unchanged at about 3½ percent   In contemplating the forecast for 2006 and 2007, we had to make some assessment  of the sources of the strength in activity in the second half of this year  As we had  anticipated would be the case back in September, we are now in the position of having  to interpret whether the errors in our forecast of aggregate activity reflect misestimates  on our part of either the hurricane effects or of the underlying behavior of the economy   We do believe that some of the surprising strength of activity is probably  attributable to smaller negative effects from hurricanes than we had previously penciled  in To be sure, production in the energy sector is coming back a bit more slowly than  we had expected, especially production from the off-shore platforms in the Gulf of  Mexico But outside of energy, production appears to be recovering more quickly   Output of chemicals, paper, rubber and plastics, and some areas of food processing  improved noticeably in October and November  And we look to be getting a bigger  plus from the production of construction supplies  On the spending side, the hits to  consumption of housing services, food, and gasoline—areas that we had thought would  be affected by hurricane-related disruptions—appear to have been smaller over the past  few months than we had incorporated in our previous couple of forecasts  Of course,  most of this remains educated guesswork and needs to be taken with a grain of salt   But all in all, we are inclined to attribute a few tenths of the surprising strength in  second-half growth to smaller hurricane effects   We have interpreted the remainder of the surprise as suggesting that underlying  aggregate demand has been stronger at prevailing interest rates than we had previously  projected and that, all else equal, some of this strength will carry forward into next  year Spending receives a further boost in the projection from the upward revisions that  we made to stock market and housing wealth, which totaled about $1 trillion over the  forecast period All in all, it=s a stronger demand picture than we were envisioning at  the time of the last meeting                              December 13, 2005 11 of 100  However, the information that we have received over the past six weeks has not  been confined solely to aggregate demand  Developments on the supply-side of the  economy also appear to have been more favorable than we had expected  The surge in  output growth last quarter was accomplished with almost no increase in hours worked   Consequently, output per hour in the nonfarm business sector rose at a 4½ percent  annual rate in the third quarter and is now estimated to have been up more than 3  percent over the past four quarters As optimistic as we have been, the data have  continued to outflank us on the upside in recent quarters   In response to this continued good news, we revised up our estimates of structural  labor productivity In addition to an upward adjustment to the level this year, we  boosted the growth of structural labor productivity about ¼ percentage point to a bit  above 3 percent in both 2006 and 2007 Capital deepening is making a slightly larger  contribution to this estimate, but most of the upward revision has occurred in  multifactor productivity  Despite being nearly a decade into this favorable productivity  wave, there are few signs that the efforts or abilities of businesses to implement greater  technical and organizational efficiencies are flagging   On balance, the revisions that we made to aggregate demand were a touch larger  than those we made to aggregate supply, and we estimate the output gap to be slightly  narrower, on average, over the next two years than in the previous forecast  In response  to these developments, we raised our path for the funds rate another 25 basis points, to  4½ percent by early next year   Despite these modest adjustments, the basic contour of our forecast remains  unchanged After increasing 3¾ percent this year, the rise in real GDP slows to 3½  percent in 2006 and 3 percent in 2007  That pattern reflects several powerful  crosscurrents We expect activity to be boosted early next year by rebuilding efforts in  the Gulf Coast region Moreover, with energy prices projected to level out after  increasing sharply over the past two years, the drag on aggregate demand from the  earlier run-up in prices should begin to ebb  But these positives are more than offset by  fading fiscal stimulus, the lagged effects of tighter monetary policy, and a gradually  diminishing impetus to consumer spending from equity and housing wealth   In sorting through the details of our forecast, it should be pretty obvious that a  flattening out of activity in the housing sector is one of the principal sources of slower  aggregate growth After contributing about ½ percentage point to growth in real GDP  per annum over the past four years, we are projecting residential investment to be a  roughly neutral factor over the next two years  But that is still all forecast To date, the  hard data on housing have remained solid  Housing starts have remained at elevated  levels, new home sales hit a record high in October, and house prices as measured by  the OFHEO purchase index continued to increase at a double-digit pace through the  third quarter   That said, reports of cooling in the housing markets seem to me to be more frequent  and more widespread than was the case six months ago  As we noted in yesterday=s                           December 13, 2005 12 of 100  Board briefing, a variety of indicators of housing activity have turned down in recent  months Household attitudes toward home buying have dropped sharply; builder  ratings of new home sales have deteriorated; the index of mortgage applications for  home purchase has fallen off; and the inventory of unsold homes has moved up  Taken  in isolation, none of these measures has an especially reliable statistical relationship to  housing activity But taken together, they could be indicating that we are at the front  edge of some cooling in these markets   I offer one more piece of evidence that I think almost surely suggests that the end is  near in this sector While channel surfing the other night, to the annoyance of my  otherwise very patient wife, I came across a new television series on the Discovery  Channel entitled “Flip That House”  [Laughter] As far as I could tell, the gist of the  show was that with some spackling, a few strategically placed azaleas, and access to a  bank, you too could tap into the great real estate wealth machine  It was enough to put  even the most ardent believer in market efficiency into existential crisis  [Laughter]   Only time will tell if these indicators are giving us a head fake or are the start of our  long-awaited slowdown in this sector For now, we are sticking with our call that  housing activity will level off next year Moreover, we continue to anticipate that a  more visible deceleration in house prices will be in evidence by the middle of next year,  and the associated slower growth of household net worth contributes to the projected  up-tilt in the personal saving rate  In our view, both of these developments are critical  for damping growth by enough to prevent the economy from overheating   To date, the news on inflation does not suggest that we have overshot the mark on  potential, though our ability to make that assertion with any confidence in real time is  admittedly very tenuous  To begin, measures of core consumer prices came in a bit  below our expectations We also had a faster unwinding of the earlier hurricane-related  increase in retail energy prices  Survey measures of inflation expectations have  retraced virtually all of this autumn=s run-up, and TIPS [Treasury inflation-protected  securities] -based measures of inflation compensation have retreated as well  On the  cost side, lower hourly compensation and faster growth in structural productivity imply  less pressure from labor costs, and the markup of prices over unit labor costs has risen  further, pointing to a somewhat larger cushion between costs and prices   These developments led us to reduce our projection of core consumer price inflation  for 2006 by ¼ percentage point to about 2 percent and to trim our forecast for 2007 a  tenth to 1¾ percent  The contour remains much the same  We still are expecting a  slight pickup in core inflation as we enter next year, reflecting the direct and indirect  effects of higher energy prices this year  In that regard, the core PPI for intermediate  materials increased 1¼ percent in both September and October, with the price increases  concentrated among goods that are heavily dependent on petroleum and natural gas   And higher prices for these inputs as well as higher prices for transportation services  seem likely to place some mild upward pressure on core inflation in the months  immediately ahead  Still, I think this forecast is best characterized as one in which  inflation pressures are in the process of topping out rather than continuing to build                                    December 13, 2005 13 of 100  Obviously, there are some very important risks on both sides of our forecasts for  real activity and inflation, and we tried to highlight some of the more prominent ones in  the Greenbook  I recognize that our baseline forecast, in which the economy=s growth  slows to about trend, output settles out at a level very close to potential, and inflation  pressures ease a bit, all with just a little more tightening of policy, seems too good to be  true No doubt, events will conspire to force adjustments, both major and minor, on the  staff projection Perhaps I=ve just written the “flexibility and resilience” speech for the  Chairman so often over the past few years that I=m suffering from something akin to the  Stockholm syndrome—the tendency of hostages over time to sympathize with the  views of their keepers [Laughter]  But as I look back over the past year and observe  how well the economy performed in the face of some pretty substantial shocks, I don=t  think our optimistic outlook is unwarranted   Karen will continue our presentation    Well, I’m certainly uncertain about it  [Laughter] There’s no doubt about   that But I actually see some risks on both sides of that forecast  On the upside, we are banking on a   rather steep increase in the saving rate over the next two years  If our large-scale quarterly   econometric model wants to extend the surprisingly low saving rate that we’ve seen over the past   couple of years forward into the future, that suggests the possibility of a greater step-up in consumer   spending  So there is some upside risk   On the downside, some of the step-up that we have in consumption over the next two years is   related to our forecast of an acceleration in compensation per hour, which, thus far, has remained very   low And if we don’t get that step-up in compensation growth, we’re not going to have the labor   income immediately to support this pickup in consumer spending going forward  And I think that   constitutes an important downside risk   So I feel comfortable that we have the risks reasonably well balanced, but there are some big   question marks, I think, on the consumption forecast going forward     We will certainly take on board your recommendation to expand more of   our analysis of the aggregate supply side  I would just say that this is an area where, in the past   several years, we have made very significant changes in the underlying structure of the way we’ve   produced the forecast  We present a great deal more detail in terms of the composition of the   aggregate supply side of our forecast than we were doing five or six years ago  So I think we’ve taken   steps in that direction                                   December 13, 2005 21 of 100  I would also caution, just a bit, against page counting for judging the amount of analysis of the   supply side  To get to output, we’ve got to go through all the various pieces of the spending side to   get there  I hope in my remarks this morning I made it clear that we were interpreting much of the   news that we’ve received about spending to have supply-side implications and that the information   should not be taken just as a feature of aggregate demand  But we certainly share your desire to have   a better and more thorough understanding of what is happening on the supply side of the economy,   because it has proven over the last decade to be a very important source of macroeconomic variation    Well, I’ll just add a couple of further comments that relate to your   concerns One is that, given our forecast of labor force participation—which is pretty mild, as you   know—we think you should be lowering your sights as to what the underlying trend employment   growth would be on the establishment survey  We’re now putting that at roughly 90,000 a month, so   that—    To keep pace with our slight downward trend in labor force participation    So if we’re right about that—and as you know, there is considerable uncertainty about that piece of   the forecast—then you’re going to have to start thinking of 90,000 as a pretty good number  Now,                                   December 13, 2005 23 of 100  we’re actually able to manage above 90,000 over the course of the next several months and into next   year, in part because we do think labor force participation is still below its trend  And as we move   back toward trend, we can get growth in overall payroll employment at a little above trend  So we   don’t really see the eventual slowing of employment gains as signaling a significant weakening in the   labor market But we do have growth a bit below trend further out when GDP growth drops a little   below potential  So that’s also an element of the forecast   Now, you’re right in some sense  If that were to occur in the context of gains in compensation   per hour that are roughly equal to what we’ve had, rather than the step-up that we’re projecting, we’re   going to have a shift in income distribution toward capital income and away from labor income     And we think that shift would have a small negative effect for aggregate   demand  The negative effect is not as big as you might imagine because, obviously, to the extent that   the income distribution is going toward capital, the stock market would be strong, so the wealth   effects on consumption would be a little larger or capital spending would probably be stronger  Still,   if we’re wrong about this piece of the forecast, I think it goes in the direction that things could be a bit   weaker in terms of overall spending by 2007 than we’re forecasting    I’d be happy to, if you’re really willing to listen to it!  [Laughter]    We’d be happy to do that as well  In principle, the upward revision in our   forecast for structural productivity growth this time was due to two factors  One was that productivity   was a lot stronger than we thought  But it wasn’t just that productivity was stronger; so it’s not just   this moving-average error term  It’s also the fact that we’re at a point in the business cycle, with labor   markets having tightened as much as they have, when we would have thought productivity growth   would be running a little below trend  So our previous estimate of the trend of 2¾ percent, with actual   productivity growing 3 percent, implied that productivity was being driven even further above trend    And in our underlying model, in which there is a cyclical and a trend component to productivity, that   didn’t really seem sensible to us at this point, given that we think labor markets are close to balance   We arrived at that view not just from looking at the employment rate but at plenty of other indicators   of labor market activity, which suggested to us that the underlying structural trend in productivity   probably has been faster than we thought  So we narrowed that tension by raising structural   productivity rather than continuing to forecast that actual productivity was going to slow back toward   our trend  I think that’s the principal source of that element in the forecast   Now, as far as the technical factors go—I’ll be very brief here—our analysis of structural   productivity uses nonfarm business output and hours as measured from the establishment survey                                          December 13, 2005 25 of 100  Potential GDP is a measure of output measured using GDP—not output in the nonfarm business   sector—and hours from the household survey—not the establishment survey  So there are two   technical factors that tend to account for the wedge the output growth in the nonfarm business sector   versus GDP, and the growth in household hours versus establishment hours  And both of those   factors have been significantly negative over the course of the last several years  That is, output, as   measured by GDP, has been slower than nonfarm business output  And growth in hours, as measured   by the household survey, has been considerably stronger than in the establishment survey   So you need both of those factors, in essence, to reconcile structural productivity and potential   output  That is why you might be puzzled as you look at the forecast wondering Gee, they’ve got 3   percent structural productivity but only 3¼ percent growth in potential GDP  But, in fact, that’s the   way we do that element of the analysis  We’re more or less forced into that particular position    Well, the answer to that question is yes  [Laughter]  But actually I’m not   terribly worried that we’re doing that in this kind of filtering, which uses the structural model and   some statistical filters  We are downweighting the most recent observations because they haven’t   been through annual revisions  And there are plenty of reasons for thinking that the information   content in that third-quarter GDP number is not as large as the information content of productivity   measured in 2003  So we try to account for that as well  "
8372,2006-01-31,"2  As we see it, the recent configuration of data suggests that, to the extent that there  was any noticeable weakness in the fourth quarter, it was short-lived, and we are     Thank you, Mr Chairman  A few years back, I noted that my  briefings could largely be characterized as a collection of confessions and excuses   This morning I would like to add a new element to that list  denial  As you know,  the BEA’s advance estimate for the growth in real GDP in the fourth quarter—shown  in the top left panel of your first exhibit—came in last Friday at an annual rate of 11  percent, about half the pace that we had projected  But at this point, we don’t believe  that this estimate should be taken as a signal that the economy has fundamentally  weakened  To be sure, after a first round of sorting through the details of that report,  we haven’t found a smoking gun that gives us any strong reason to override the  BEA’s estimate  But we have assumed that there will be a bounceback in some areas  that were surprisingly weak last quarter, most notably motor vehicle output and  federal spending   2 The materials used by Messrs Stockton, Struckmeyer, and Sheets are appended to this transcript (appendix 2)   January 31, 2006 16 of 106    heading into the first quarter on a reasonably solid trajectory  As seen in the top right  panel, after spiking up this autumn, initial claims quickly returned to pre-hurricane  levels and have dropped even further in recent weeks, giving no suggestion of any  softening in the labor market  Industrial production (line 1 of the middle left panel)  actually peaked in the fourth quarter, driven by a sharp acceleration in manufacturing  output (line 2)  Moreover, as shown to the right, recent manufacturing surveys are  supportive of our forecast of moderate gains in production as we move into the new  year     Consumer spending and capital outlays have also remained solid  Setting aside   the effects of the large swings in motor vehicle purchases that occurred in the second  half of last year, consumer spending, shown in the bottom left panel, has been on a  steady uptrend  And yesterday’s reading on real PCE excluding motor vehicles in  December suggests that the first quarter started on a strong note  Shipments of  nondefense capital goods (plotted as the red line in the bottom right panel) were  released last week after the Greenbook was published, and they were stronger than we  had projected  Moreover, new orders (the black line) have remained above  shipments, suggesting that equipment spending should be buoyant in coming months      The top left panel of your next exhibit lays out our longer-term outlook for real   GDP  As seen by the blue bars, the growth of real GDP is projected to step up this  year to 39 percent before falling back to 3 percent in 2007  That pattern is influenced  importantly by our assumed hurricane effects, and as shown by the red bars, aside  from those effects we are expecting a gradual deceleration in activity over the next  two years  Our inflation projection is shown to the right  Overall PCE prices are  expected to decelerate over the next two years as consumer energy prices slow  sharply  We continue to expect a small bump-up in core inflation this year as higher  prices for energy, nonfuel imports, and commodity prices are passed through into the  prices of final goods and services  But we expect core inflation to edge back down in  2007 as these influences abate     Although this story is pretty much the same as the one in December, we did have,   in addition to last Friday’s GDP excitement, a few other developments to deal with  over the intermeeting period  As shown in the middle left panel, crude oil prices rose  further in recent weeks and are now projected to average $650 per barrel higher than  in the December Greenbook  As Nathan will be discussing shortly, we also revised  up a bit our projection for foreign activity, lowered our projection for the dollar,  and—as shown in the middle right panel—raised our forecast for nonfuel import  prices  With oil and imports providing a little more upward pressure on costs, we  nudged up our forecast for core PCE prices this year and, along with it, our fed funds  assumption over the next year—plotted as the black line in the bottom left     We made no substantive changes to our fiscal policy assumptions  As shown in   the bottom right panel, fiscal policy provides some impetus to activity this year,  related largely to hurricane spending and the implementation of the prescription drug  benefit, but is expected to be a nearly neutral influence next year    January 31, 2006 17 of 106      The principal source of slowing in aggregate activity in our forecast continues to   be the housing sector, the subject of exhibit 3  The accumulating data have made us  more confident, though far from certain, that we are reaching an inflection point in  the housing boom  The bigger question now is whether we will experience the  gradual cooling that we are projecting or a more pronounced downturn  I’ll be  interested to hear your reports this morning  As for the recent data, sales of existing  homes (the red line in the top left panel) have dropped sharply in recent months and  by more than we had expected  New home sales (the black line) have also moved off  their peaks of last summer but are more consistent with our expectation of a gradual  softening  That expectation receives some further support from the more-timely  mortgage bankers’ purchase index—plotted to the right  Purchase applications also  are off their highs but are not indicating any sharp retrenchment through January      With respect to house prices, the recent data and anecdotes also have pointed to   some weakening  As a result, our forecast of a sharp deceleration in home prices— shown in the middle left panel—seems less of a stretch than it did a while back  As  shown to the right, the bottom line is that, after contributing importantly to the growth  of real GDP over the past four years, residential investment is expected to decelerate  sharply this year and to turn down a bit in 2007  As we have noted before, our house- price forecast also has implications for consumer spending  Slower growth of house  prices is the chief factor causing the wealth-to-income ratio (the black line in the  bottom left panel) to drift down over the projection period  That downdrift, along  with the lagged reaction to higher interest rates, results in a gradual rise in the  personal saving rate over the next two years  As shown to the right, although  spending growth falls short of that of income, overall PCE receives considerable  support from the strong gains in disposable income that result from the projected  flattening of energy prices, ongoing employment gains, and a step-up in the pace of  hourly compensation     Business investment is the subject of exhibit 4  Spending on equipment and   software, plotted as the black line in the top left panel, slows gradually over the  projection period, largely because the accelerator effects that propelled the earlier  recovery in capital outlays begin to wane  Nevertheless, with the cost of capital  remaining moderate and corporate balance sheets strong, we are forecasting solid  increases in real E&S spending this year and next     Our projection for total nonresidential structures, shown in the panel to the right,   reflects some divergent patterns in the components  We expect outlays for drilling  and mining (line 2) to increase sharply further this year in response to the run-up that  has occurred in the prices for crude oil and natural gas  Although those prices are  expected to level off, the lagged effects of the earlier gains should result in some  further, albeit diminished, increase in drilling activity in 2007  Excluding drilling and  mining (line 3) we are projecting a modest recovery in nonresidential construction  activity in response to ongoing gains in employment and gradually declining vacancy  rates in the office and industrial sectors   January 31, 2006 18 of 106      One of the reasons that we are reasonably optimistic about the investment outlook   is that the total return to capital—plotted in the middle left panel—remains quite  favorable  And although we expect that return to recede a bit as labor costs pick up, it  would still remain elevated by historical standards over the forecast period     The remainder of the exhibit is something of a going-away present to the   Chairman  While he always seemed to have a grip on where productivity was headed  in the future, we always seemed to be struggling to explain what had happened in the  past  Most recently, those struggles have centered on understanding the continuing  strong gains in productivity in the first half of this decade  One important element of  our story has been that the investment boom of the late 1990s was at least partly  responsible for sowing the seeds of the further acceleration in multifactor productivity  that we have experienced this decade  That capital equipment embodied rapidly  improving technologies and allowed firms to sometimes radically restructure business  processes  More broadly, as adjustment costs associated with absorbing those  investments waned, the productivity advantages showed through more clearly      The bottom panel provides some modest support for the proposition that some of   the improved performance of multifactor productivity of the first half of the decade  can be traced to the earlier investment boom  That panel employs a new data set  based on research spearheaded by my colleagues Carol Corrado, Paul Lengermann,  and Larry Slifman that calculates multifactor productivity for detailed industries   Along the x-axis, we measure for each of 60 industries the average rate of growth in  investment over the 1995-to-2000 period relative to that industry’s historical norm   On the y-axis, we plot the acceleration in MFP experienced by each industry from the  1995-to-2000 period to the 2000-to-2004 period  As seen by the red regression line,  those industries for which the growth of equipment and software was unusually high  in the late 1990s were more likely than others to experience a subsequent acceleration  in multifactor productivity in the first part of this decade  Obviously, this is not a  structural relationship and is meant to be impressionistic  But the recovery in  equipment spending over the past few years leaves us optimistic that multifactor  productivity can continue to grow at a rapid clip, though perhaps not quite at the pace  registered over the first half of the decade  Sandy will now continue our presentation       The final exhibit presents your economic projections for 2006   and 2007  The central tendencies of those projections anticipate real GDP to increase  about 3½ percent this year and then to run between 3 and 3½ percent in 2007   Forecasts of core PCE price inflation are centered on 2 percent this year and between  1¾ and 2 percent in 2007  Meanwhile, the unemployment rate is expected to be  between 4¾ and 5 percent both this year and next  I would appreciate receiving any  revisions in your forecasts by the close of business Friday  My colleagues and I  would be happy to take any questions that you might have       I don’t know either, Mr Chairman  I would suspect, though I don’t   really know, that workweeks would tend to decline later in an individual’s life cycle, certainly   relative to the prime age working years     Or affluent and more likely to be taking on part-time work in   retirement  [Laughter]  I’m not suggesting that your workweek is likely to fall; I’m sure it’s going   to maintain its current level!  [Laughter]     That sounds like a reasonable sensitivity  As you know, we have   presented this effect in the past  It’s a little larger than the effects that we get when we run our   model, which would be measured more around ¼ percentage point to ½ percentage point  Now,   you may recall that last June John Williams presented some simulations of various housing-price   scenarios  Our relatively small effects come from just simulating a lower path for the price of   housing, and as you know, our model has a relatively low marginal propensity to consume out of   housing wealth, one that is similar to that out of overall household wealth   It’s not difficult to imagine upping those effects  If one wants to assume that, instead of the   three and a half cents on the dollar effect that we have incorporated in our model, the marginal   propensity to consume was around five to seven cents on the dollar, those effects would obviously   be increased  The second potential channel that our straightforward model simulations don’t   account for is that a lower path for housing prices could be accompanied by some hit to consumer   sentiment  There would be an outsized effect on consumer spending if households really became   more pessimistic given the downturn in what is an asset with a high profile in their portfolios  And   the third possibility that John explored in his simulations was related to one of the alternative   simulations we show this time around  If weakening in house prices and housing activity occurred   January 31, 2006 27 of 106    when the term premium was widening back out, you would then have the effects not only directly   on the housing-sector side, which could be amplified, but also on other forms of interest sensitive   spending   So I think there are some pretty wide confidence intervals  The numbers that you cited are   bigger than our standard simulation, but seem reasonable and in the ballpark if one wants to make a   few adjustments in some of the assumptions that we made  As I contemplate our outlook and the   things that I worry about the most on the domestic side of the economy, I’d say the housing sector is   clearly one of the biggest risks that you’re currently confronting     Mr Chairman, I quickly consulted with my labor economist experts at   the coffee break about your question about the demographic effects on the workweek, and, indeed,   there is—and it’s incorporated in our forecast—a modest effect of the aging of the workforce on the   workweek, with older workers having shorter workweeks  Obviously, the longer-term trend has   been driven more by the shift in the composition of employment from manufacturing toward more   service-oriented industries, which have shorter workweeks, but there is a perceptible demographic   effect as well  "
