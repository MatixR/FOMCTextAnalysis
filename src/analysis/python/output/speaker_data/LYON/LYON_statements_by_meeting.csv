7449,2003-12-09,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Overall for the current quarter economic   conditions have continued to improve in the Ninth District  This improvement is attributable   primarily to continued strength in residential real estate markets, an uptick in manufacturing, a   modest increase in consumption, and an improved agricultural picture  Other sectors—including   commercial real estate, mining, and energy—are holding steady  There are no reports of   significant increases in prices or wages  I’ll have a little more to say about wages and prices in a   minute, but first and perhaps most important, it appears that labor markets have stabilized  One   of our Minnesota directors noted recently that for the first time in a number of months none of   his contacts had plans to decrease jobs at their companies  He did add, however, that employers   he spoke with were still cautious about hiring additional employees    Next week we’ll announce the results of our annual Ninth District business survey    Preliminary results show that 34 percent of the respondents expect to increase employment at   their firms in 2004, whereas 16 percent plan to reduce jobs over the coming year  If the stories   we’re hearing from our directors are any indication, some of the job losses will be due to   outsourcing and the movement of operations overseas   Other anecdotal information we’ve received lately reflects a similar moderately   optimistic tone  For example, business conditions in the information technology sector are   reportedly improving, albeit slowly  And some business expansion was noted, including by a   telecommunications firm in southwestern Wisconsin and a window manufacturer in Minnesota    Agricultural conditions appear favorable, with a solid grain harvest and high cattle prices   bringing mostly good news from our Agricultural Advisory Council—a relatively rare event    December 9, 2003 63 of 133    According to our advisers, this good news for agricultural producers is creating positive spillover   effects in rural communities   Returning to the question of wage and price increases, according to our recent business   poll, almost 80 percent of respondents expect wages at businesses in their communities to   increase between 2 and 3 percent  Only 4 percent of the respondents predict that wages will   grow 4 percent or more  At the same time, respondents report significant productivity increases   this year and plan to increase capital investment in 2004  Lastly, more than half the respondents   predict that prices for their products and services will remain unchanged, whereas 30 percent   expect price increases next year     Turning to the national outlook, there are many indications that the solid expansion will   continue over the next several quarters  Firms are hiring again, payroll employment has   increased in each of the past four months, and hours worked are up sharply  Initial claims for   employment benefits have been generally declining, and the unemployment rate has fallen   slightly  The weak manufacturing sector appears to be turning up  While consumer spending   has slowed, data on orders and shipments of nondefense capital goods indicate that last quarter’s   rebound in business spending on equipment and software is continuing into the current quarter    Further, residential construction continues to be quite strong  There are also indications that real   growth in foreign economies is picking up, which should improve exports     We are optimistic about the performance of the real economy next year, but we’re not   quite as optimistic as the Greenbook  Moreover, we see weaker growth in employment and   hours worked and stronger growth in productivity next year than the Board staff does  With   respect to inflation, we’re also somewhat less optimistic than the Greenbook  We see headline   rates of inflation either unchanged or modestly higher over the next few quarters  This view is   December 9, 2003 64 of 133    based both on our models and on recent movements in market interest rates  We see core   inflation rates remaining roughly at current levels  Thank you  "
7450,2003-12-09,"  Mr Chairman, I support your recommendation  The proposed language   captures our view of the impact of recent developments and, as you have outlined, preserves   policy flexibility  "
