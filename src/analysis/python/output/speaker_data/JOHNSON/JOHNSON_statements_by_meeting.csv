30,1987-08-18," In the absence of the Vice Chairman of the FOMC, I'll try to kick things off I think we need to begin, though, with nominations for the chairmanship of the FOMC And I'd like to nominate Mr Greenspan as Chairman of the FOMC   Are there any objections? [Laughter] Mr Chairman   I have one, Mr Chairman I was looking this morning at the Telerate A lot of the reasons given on the dollar's decline are that oil traded down yesterday and oil prices are dropping this morning in foreign markets And I wonder how much of an influence that is having on the exchange rate too; it seems to move in parallel fashion   Mr Chairman, I'd like to second that recommendation for the additional amount   Peter, on your concerns about September Are we anticipating, or is the Treasury anticipating, a cash balance problem?   The answer is, we want to be prepared if it does "
31,1987-08-18," I agree in general with what the Greenbook says and what I've heard about the outlook I do think it's picking up; it looks better and there is some growing upside risk However, I have a number of concerns that really cause me to question this view completely, and there are a few problems that I have with the Greenbook forecast, in particular So, I'm still uncertain, overall First, the growth that we see appears to be primarily due to the improvement in real net exports; export volume is causing the stimulus that we see right now And, if that is indeed the case--if most of the growth is coming in the external area rather than in domestic aggregate demand--you have to really ask yourself how much of the potential Phillips-curve type effects on pricing you can get from that kind of growth And that modest expansion in aggregate demand, I think, is being verified somewhat by the aggregates, as well as by other types of evidence for consumption You really have to ask how much inflation pressure can be produced by that type of a scenario When you look at the broader inflation indexes, the CPI, excluding energy, shows some pressure, but the PPI shows no influence outside the energy area As a matter of fact, it has been decelerating this year, ex-oil So you really don't see a broad buildup yet on the price side  -15-    8/18/87  The staff forecast has rising interest rates, and I think some of their policy assumptions are inconsistent with the forecast That rise in interest rates, at least if the aggregate models are correct, is going to produce a further weakening in the monetary aggregates Looking at a further weakening in the monetary aggregates, you have to ask yourself How much nominal GNP can you get out of those kinds of aggregate growth rates, and does the velocity number that is consistent with that make any sense at all to you? I don't think you can get too much from a rising interest rates scenario out of the aggregates to produce enough nominal GNP to produce a serious risk  The other point I have is on the movement of the dollar One problem I have on the dollar is what I pointed out yesterday in the Board meeting we really have had no net depreciation of the dollar this year Now, there's always the possibility, and I continue to worry about the downside risks on the dollar I know it has come off a little today; we've talked about some of the reasons But the fact of the matter is that there has been no net dollar depreciation this year and we're late into the year The forecast is contingent upon a 10 percent depreciation in '87 to produce the lagged effects on prices in '88 Of course, there are still four months of opportunity for that But you have to ask yourself, if you're not going to realize that kind of dollar depreciation this year, how are you going to get those lagged effects for '88? The other point is that if the oil price is expected to hover in the $18 range--and it's my feeling that the dollar is being influenced some by the oil price--an oil price in that range will keep the dollar high relative to the currencies of major industrial surplus countries like the mark and the yen And if the dollar stays stronger because the oil price hovers in the $18 range, how are we going to get the dollar depreciation? On all of these questions, I'm not saying that they can't be overcome, because I see the outlook picking up some, too But I really haven't resolved these questions in my mind and I think they are serious alternative issues to deal with So, given these problems, I don't think we have enough evidence to expect a big upward move   That's pretty awful "
32,1987-08-18," Sounds like a good case for early release   I guess I see some firming signals and, as I said, a little more upside risk than I did before But, a lot of the early warning signals--some of the financial market signals--are not showing us as strong a concern as they did at our last meeting So, I'm a little reluctant to see us stick our neck out too far I guess I'm somewhere around alternative B with asymmetric language to give us  -30-    8/18/87  the option of a potential tightening if we see firmer signs But, sort of like Wayne, I'm not sure I want to commit myself to anything on instinct; I've got to have a little more evidence When people read the minutes in six weeks, they'll look at what was going on when we made those decisions The thing that has happened since the last meeting is that the real economy is showing more firmness, but that's about all I see right now Maybe we'll be ready for a tightening move later, but for now I favor alternative B, with asymmetric language I am for deemphasizing the dollar a little because, as I said earlier, I see it somewhat influenced by the oil price; and I'm not sure that the declining oil price, which might send the dollar down, is something we should be worried about The dollar declined significantly, consistent with the decline in oil prices in 1986, and we saw inflationary expectations break in the face of that; we tried to resist the dollar's downward move; it certainly wouldn't have been a resistance against inflationary expectations I'd like to avoid that kind of a problem I think the dollar is still an important issue, but I think it depends on what's influencing it So, I would rather highlight inflationary expectations and just leave the dollar as a proxy for that   Yes, $500 million, with asymmetric language   I'd like to second what Jerry says   I agree with Wayne's point that it is likely that they could come in there I would want to change the whole language in terms of clarifying what we are saying if we go to 4 to 6 percent I would want to make clear that though we're assuming no change in policy, the aggregates may come in in the 4 to 6 percent range But that's not what it could imply So, I'd rather just leave it alone   Well, 5 to 6 percent may be okay   That has always been the range used in the past, just to convey within the reserve target--   That is going to lead to other [unintelligible] If it turns out to be an average number, you're going to have people low-balling it until it clears the average "
83,1987-09-22," Peter, you mentioned the market being nervous I agree that there is still some of that, but I think we did achieve-- though I realize it hasn't been fantastic--some flattening in the yield curve out of the discount rate move Even though the long end went up to around 980 percent at one point, it has settled down around 960 percent; and we have seen a larger move on the short end of the market than we have on the long end, even though it has fluctuated   I wouldn't do that because [unintelligible] it could have been some fear of Fed tightening preceding it But I think the tone seems to be more inflation fears or psychology, or the dollar, and everything else, more than just-- I don't know how you sort all this out But still it does appear that there has been some flattening achieved   Second "
84,1987-09-22," I guess that was sort of what I was going to ask One other question I had in mind I'm not a big ""aggregates person"" but, in line with this whole issue of aggregate demand, it strikes me that this recent uptick in interest rates is going to have a further damping effect on the aggregates I think that is fine, but at some point, you have to ask how much aggregate demand is plausible in that scenario I think you are restraining it You have to come up with some fairly implausible velocity growth numbers to get aggregate demand outside of a range that would present a real breakout in overall aggregate demand It seems to me that we have it pretty well cornered here In the long run, you could have a couple of bad quarters under that scenario but, given these recent moves in interest rates, what are we projecting on the broader monetary aggregates?   You have about 4 percent  -12-    9/22/87   Why would it pick up with higher interest rates?   That's sort of what I'm getting at You have it cornered a little, it seems to me   What has the regional inflation rate been doing in New England?   But overall, I mean the broader--   The Boston CPI?   Well, I agree with most of the discussion on the economy It has been covered pretty well I do think the economy has clearly picked up strength, and there is very little downside [risk] in the economy now It is clearly in an expansion phase at a higher level than it was on before, but there's still an outstanding question--we've already discussed this and Mike went over it very well--as to how much of this is production-generated by the external economy and inventory building versus an overall expansion in aggregate demand I think that is the key to what we would have to do on the monetary policy side As I said earlier, I think that a lot of this seems to be trade-related Some of it is not I think there has been a buildup in inflationary expectations I am fairly pleased at the moves we have taken; I think they were proper and should have the effect of eventually moderating aggregate demand to a level consistent with the forecast Now, we are hedging against the plausibility of what kind of velocity number you could expect to go with those aggregates Like I say, I think we are close to having the thing cornered The lags are long; we may have to go through a few quarters of some pressure before we see the other side of that But, I don't see a lot of room for nominal GNP under the kind of monetary policy we have now The numbers don't seem to add up, except for maybe a couple of exceptional quarters, in the short run A couple of other points I think are interesting in spite of our concerns about the trade situation and the deficit--and I agree those are the major fundamental concerns--we seem to pass over those large deficit items I think that's because we are concerned more about the longer run; but we pass over the really tremendous improvement in the budget deficit this fiscal year over the last fiscal year, without a dime's improvement in the current account The amount of pressure that has been taken off has to be relatively substantial We have gotten no real reduction in the current account and a $60 billion dollar reduction in the federal budget deficit That has to be an important factor Now, whether that continues is another matter I think that is the question But, if anything, we have relieved pressures on the capital import side Maybe we are making up that difference on the domestic growth side and  -29-    9/22/87  the demands of government are shifting more toward the private sector But we have seen the dollar come down and we probably have seen net capital outflows  In terms of the question of long-term interest rates, I tend to think that what has happened is mostly inflationary expectations I think long rates have gone up primarily due to that My personal opinion is they probably overshot, and eventually things will settle back down a little in the market As I said, the flattening of the yield curve from our discount rate change was somewhat comforting; even though we didn't actually see a decline in long rates, we did see a flattening I don't see anything out there that would push up the real rate dramatically I think some of that inflationary expectation--I really don't know how much--is sort of a risk premium, but that could be put in the inflation expectations category I don't see anything that shocked the cost of capital that would, in a way, raise the real interest rate In other words, I don't see anything that has improved real returns on capital investment dramatically If anything, the repeal of the investment tax credit in the tax bill has reduced returns on equipment; and there probably has been an improvement in terms of inventories because of the lower corporate rate; but, overall, I don't see any big shock to the cost of capital So, I think it is mainly inflationary expectations and, hopefully, it will run off over time "
85,1987-09-22," I am sort of caught between the $500 and $600 million, but I am basically comfortable with alternative B with symmetric language I had thought about $500 million with a tilt toward tightening for the same reasons that Bob Forrestal mentioned; there is something in that, too But I don't feel strongly either way I would appeal to Peter, though, that in maintaining $600 borrowing--which I think is fine--we ought to do that as smoothly as possible, and not give any obvious signals that might confuse the market into thinking that this is a tightening move It is going to be perceived that way by some anyway, but I think that we ought to try to do it in as smooth a fashion as possible   Yes, it's in there   It's ""would"" either way   It says respectively, but you would take--   Yes   You want to say 4 to 6 percent for the M2?   This is what would have been consistent with $600 million borrowings, even before, I think   4 to 8   Well, Peter's skills will take care of that  SPEAKER(?) Good "
141,1987-11-03," I think they are more concerned about that than the dollar exchange rate They pretty much got all their trading partners pinned down in the EMS, and I think that's about all they care about If the EMS were to break up, you would see them concerned   Why don't they do something about it?   I'm just saying that's their responsibility rather than ours   At this stage, really, the perception in the markets, given the new world we are in, trying to defend the dollar with higher interest rates here--I think that's where you would see a tailspin   That's exactly what I mean There are a lot of things new here; there are a lot of changes in expectations We really don't know We are on uncharted waters   Maybe I'm off in the bushes somewhere, but I think it's clear to the market that the risk on the dollar today is mainly being caused by foreign central banks who are resisting the kinds of pressures on their markets and are forcing the dollar down For us to try and deal with that situation here would be catastrophic   Peter, my interpretation of what has gone on in the bond market lately is simply that it was just some backing off from some of the flight to quality When things were extremely sensitive and unstable, we had a lot of movement in the Treasury securities on the long and the short end--maybe a little more on the short end, but a lot all over the yield curve And I think as the stock market has shown some stability over the last several days, we probably have seen less pessimism there, and probably some movement back out of the quality assets--I don't know if back into the stock market, but maybe into other types of instruments I don't know what your reading is, but if that really is going on, it seems to me that maybe those excess reserves will start to wind down a little My guess is that quality spreads look a little better than they did before; maybe not, but that's my impression   Somewhat lesser "
142,1987-11-03," I really don't have much to add but I'll put in my two cents' worth I basically agree with Ed Boehne's view about the domestic economy that it's too early to tell what the effect is going to be of all this We really don't have any serious data at  -24-    11/3/87  this point to evaluate the situation I think we are probably not going get data that we are going to feel confident about, in terms of being symptomatic of the effects of this, until a couple of weeks, maybe Retail sales data are three weeks away; we may have some early car sales data and things like that but the orders impact of this is down the road There's a lot of information that still is not available; the only thing we really have at this point is some of the sentiment indexes So, we don't know how to read the overall impact, although I agree with Ed that it's hard to imagine sentiment improving as a result of this I think it's pretty clear that there is an additional air of pessimism about the outlook that didn't exist before and that expectations definitely have changed What effect that's going to have is difficult to tell  If you look right now at the fundamentals in the economy, they do look good; I agree with Bob's point on that Things are adjusting fairly nicely in the way that we expected and in the way the staff had described in the forecast We are seeing a transition, I think, from domestic aggregate demand to more externally generated growth I think that is positive and it still seems to be continuing One of the things I worry about now--after the fact, with this change in the financial markets--is that that export-led growth may come under some pressure Even though the dollar is obviously weaker, it is going to improve, I think In that relative sense, other problems are going to [damp] the prospects for export-led growth One of the issues in the financial markets is that foreign stock markets around the world actually have fallen more than the US market In percentage terms, they have all come down by more than the New York Stock Exchange composite So, the stock market impact abroad is greater than it is here What that means is really not clear But combine that with [these other developments] the fact that interest rates in those countries are relatively higher because of the fall in interest rates here recently and the not very large adjustment in interest rates abroad; the fact that their currencies are appreciating, and therefore, damping their ability to export; and the fact that if income is going to be falling here, we are going to be demanding less in terms of imports from those countries So, not only is there going to be an income effect on them, there is going to be a substitution effect And I think the question is How strong are those economies going to be? And how strong is our external performance going to be under those conditions? I don't really know; I just think there are big uncertainties And I agree with what Jerry said we need some flexibility at this stage, but it's really too early to tell what is going to happen We need to maintain our flexibility, but we need to face the reality that the world has changed Sentiment and expectations are different, both in real growth and in inflation; and I think we have to acknowledge that "
143,1987-11-03," Just take whatever borrowing is consistent   That's what ""B"" says   What did Bob say? Did he say just take out that other sentence, or what did he mean?   By a variant of ""B"", did you mean the revised version of ""B""?   Okay, that's what ""B"" means from now on, right?   Yes, I think I'm right in line with everyone else alternative ""B"" as we have defined it, Variant I, Corrigan language, and asymmetric I think we are going to have a bit of a problem if during this intermeeting period we finally decide that we can move to a borrowing target Making a transition from funds rate targeting to that could be a little touchy, even though we don't know when we will decide all of a sudden that things are stable enough to go from a 6-3/4 percent center of gravity on the funds rate to a $400 million borrowing target, or whatever I don't think it's going to work that smoothly We may need to think about how we make that transition at some point; that might be a good time for a call  - I'm totally indifferent, but you might even drop the whole sentence    Yes, I'll just be agnostic "
193,1988-03-29," I'd like to nominate Chairman Greenspan, of course, as Chairman of the FOMC to kick this meeting off So, I move Chairman Greenspan as Chairman of the FOMC   It looks like it's all done, Mr Chairman   Yes, I also move President Corrigan as Vice Chairman of the FOMC   Yes, I'd like to move that Governor Angell be the FOMC member in charge of [Freedom of Information Act] appeals and that Governor Seger be the alternate   Sam, what did you say again about the currency after the end of the [Japanese] fiscal year?   What kind of appreciation would it take for the rest of the month, or late in the month, to produce an average of the month below 126 [yen per dollar]?   The Japanese really haven't been intervening on the scale that they had before, right?   It's going to be mark-to-market for all of them after the fiscal year has ended, right?   And there will still be a strong incentive for them not to want the exchange rate [unintelligible] right?   I have one more question Maybe I've been reading too much into this, but it did run on the wires here that the Bank of Japan has decided to tighten up some They made an announcement that they were going to tighten up on money and bank reserves At least the way that I read it over the wires several times was that there had been some sort of announcement of slight tightening for short-term conditions in Japan It seems kind of strange that they would do something like that   I understand what they are doing I'm just saying that the market seems--   I think a lot of it depends on which way the fundamentals are taking the exchange rate, too It's a lot easier to have intervention speed up the adjustment if it's supporting the direction of the fundamentals If you're trying to fight the fundamentals, I think it's much more difficult--the seventies were a good example of that and, most recently, the last couple of years It does work even then on the psychology, but it's much more fleeting, I think   Maybe I'm wrong, but it could be, too, that this is viewed as a little more of a regional issue than Continental If I remember right, there was a lot of concern about Manufacturers Hanover at the same time and there was a great deal of concern that this might spread into the money center banks in general, whereas I think now the basic view is that this is a Texas or Southwest regional problem  SPEAKER(?) But didn't Europeans hold their paper more than the--   I didn't say that it was I said that was a perception  SPEAKER(?) In my own point of view, I think that perception might not be exactly right   I can conceive of circumstances in which it wouldn't be  SPEAKER(?) Maybe there's greater faith that you people can work it out down there, too  SPEAKER(?) Peter, we talked about seasonal borrowing before, but refresh my memory At a time that seasonal borrowing is relatively low, as it is now, it will take a higher level of borrowing to accomplish the [unintelligible] Is there a [unintelligible], say, in December or January?   First, I was going to say that I compliment everyone involved in this study for a very careful presentation of the issues I think it's very well done and balanced I also compliment the people preparing this for their remark on page four that says ""And it is money market rates, rather than the division of reserves between borrowed and non-borrowed components, that have the most direct impact on other financial variables in markets--such as long- term interest rates, exchange rates, and money growth--through which monetary policy is transmitted to the economy"" That's the point that I've been trying to make for a while, because it is the transmission through the funds rate adjustment that is the fundamental feature of monetary policy that we're dealing with here--whether it's the effect on money growth, or other relative interest rates, or whatever That's the transmission mechanism; it's not borrowed reserves Borrowed reserves are simply a mechanism by which we adjust the funds rate, and it's as simple as that  Now, I think there is a legitimate argument for doing it the way we are doing it I think the point is made in the memo that a borrowed reserve target does allow for some variability in the funds rate and for some market forces to show through However, my own personal view, and others may differ with it, is that the major reason for variation of the funds rate in pursuing a borrowed reserve target is not market forces--it's basically reserve estimate errors and problems associated with the reserve equation It is rare for market forces to actually be a major factor in variation of the funds rate, even though you might have some of that show up In trying to be more sensitive directly to the funds rate as a means of setting monetary policy, you can still allow for those market forces to affect the funds rate You don't have to go into the market three times a day to adjust the funds rate to keep it within some narrow range I think that all you have to do is what we are doing now--to some extent, what we were doing for a while earlier--which indicates that you are more sensitive toward the funds rate than the borrowing objective And you enter the market once a day at the normal time, but your operations are geared toward sensitivity of the funds rate and not toward some borrowing objective which really has no meaning other than to influence the funds rate  Chart 2 in the paper is a beautiful chart that shows some of the problems with the procedure that we've been following We had a paper prepared back in July, I believe it was, that was an excellent paper too--it pointed out there was a consistent bias of actual borrowings above expected levels We didn't know exactly why; we had a number of potential explanations for that But it's also illustrated in Chart 2 But more important than the upward bias in actual versus expected in that chart, is the fact that I don't agree with the argument in the paper that there are just very short periods of deviation of borrowings from expectations and expected funds rates, because it's clearly not the case One piece of information that is missing on this chart is how often there were intermeeting conference calls or arrangements with the FOMC that explain the variations from  -10-    3/29/88  expectations; I assume the expected line takes that into account For instance, there's a prolonged period in the spring of 1987--I think everyone here remembers this very distinctly--where you can clearly see in the early months of 1987 this huge spike in adjustment and seasonal borrowing over the expected range That took place for a two-month period That wasn't just a short fluctuation in borrowings relative to expectations That was a huge spike If I remember, borrowings averaged almost $800 million during the entire intermeeting period in which the expected borrowing was between $300 and $400 million That's not just a little fluctuation; that is a prolonged period of actual borrowing well above the expected level You can see the expected level tick up a couple of times there The only intermeeting conference call took place on April 30th, during which we adjusted the borrowing assumption from $300 million to $400 million But you can see that that doesn't nearly compensate for the actual borrowing You can go back for a longer period earlier--you can see in the middle of 1986--when borrowings clearly averaged well above expectations for a 4-month period; all of 1985 is another good example But you can see that on that chart  So, I think that there is a serious issue of whether we can actually keep borrowings on an expected path And my problem with that is What's the point anyway? The only point is to achieve some reasonable range for the funds rate, which represents the transmission mechanism of monetary policy into the economy So, I think that these charts and the data available here clearly show that there are some problems with this approach Now, I'm not sure that we have to do something drastically different I've been very satisfied with the way the operations have been run in the last several months But I don't see why we can't pursue a procedure more consistent with being sensitive to the funds rate rather than some borrowing objective It doesn't make any sense to me that we would do otherwise  The last point I would make on that is that I just can't buy the view that being more sensitive to the funds rate is what got us into trouble in the 1970s I wasn't here then--maybe some of you were--but from talking to people who were here and trying to study that period, from what I can tell, the mere fact that we were trying to be sensitive to the funds rate wasn't actually the problem I gather that money growth wasn't all that bad relative to targets during that period If anything, it had to do with a misunderstanding of money supply measures just like some of the problems that we have now Also, I think that it had to do with probably a slightly different philosophy But we're big boys and it's hard to believe that we can't sit here at this table and agree to set monetary policy where it should be, whether it's being sensitive to the funds rate or what And if we don't buy that, it means that we have to agree to a procedure that tricks us into the right monetary policy And I just can't buy it   That's consistent with what I said--I anticipate the problem would be money supply problems   There were interest ceilings in the banking system; you couldn't even effectively get the rate [up] Well, I'm not talking about--  SPEAKER(?) What part of the [discussion]--?   I agree But how is that different from a borrowing target? I'm just saying that the borrowing approach has the same problem with it If you agree that that was a problem in 1979, a borrowing target would present the exact same problem So I don't know--   But how does borrowing do that?   Then you're arguing for maybe as much fine tuning as several days' changes in the funds rate, in order to stay on some borrowing path continuously through the two-week period You know, I'm just asking; if everybody wants that, that's fine I'm just saying, you can look at the evidence and see for yourselves that there are long periods when the FOMC's policy directives have no meaning And if that's okay with everybody, it's fine with me   But what if you don't like the monetary policy that goes with that? What if you don't want--   Well, that's the other implicit issue associated with this procedure It's led almost by discount rate changes--using the discount rate as one of the primary mechanisms of monetary policy   If the FOMC doesn't mind being dragged along by the discount rate, that's fine   I agree that that is what's going on   But, Jerry, we don't talk about borrowing targets now for the times--   Well, I'm not suggesting we announce to the world that we're targeting the funds rate   We're going to do what we always do We aren't going to announce to the world today that we target borrowed reserves   But that's no different than today What is a change in policy today?   But that's all I'm talking about It's exactly what you do when you alter the funds rate because--   But it is   How is it different?   The directive would read the same way it does now   I wouldn't do that   I'd do exactly what we do now; the directive would read exactly the same We'd sit here and vote on a range of federal funds rates instead of a borrowing number or something like that And we'd do open market operations the same way we do them now   The directive would say slightly more, or slightly less, pressure on reserve positions   But we would still be targeting a monetary  aggregate   The same way we try to figure out what the  appropriate borrowing number is How do we know what the relationship is between borrowed reserves and monetary aggregates?   But what--   But what is this borrowing target? What does it have to do with monetary aggregates? It has nothing to do with them   It doesn't have anything to do with monetary aggregates   I'm simply saying, if you hit your borrowing target precisely--say you hit it on the nose the entire time--what monetary aggregate growth would you get out of that?   It's totally unpredictable--   I'd love to be able to narrow this argument from conceptual theoretical issues down to whether we want to use this procedure for various other reasons That's fine with me I just want to make sure we understand what--   On the theoretical issues of the procedure, I'm not convinced that's the case It sounds like a lot of confusion to me   You're saying zigs and zags in borrowing are productive?   I agree with that   I agree   I agree with what you're saying   I'm saying exactly what you're saying, Frank I'm saying do exactly what you're doing now, except that you avoid the big zigs and zags on borrowings instead of on the funds rate That's all I'm saying   You mean borrowing or what?   The funds rate Oh, I don't think you need to do anything different than what you're doing now You'd go in once a day, around 1140 am, but the action the Desk took would be more sensitive towards a rate protest than it would be toward a borrowing protest   That's the only difference that we would pursue As a matter of fact, we would do exactly what Peter has been doing for the last several weeks I'm saying I think it has been outstanding   I would too, if we're going to do exactly what we've been doing But I think that's consistent with what I'm arguing   Let me just suggest, Roger, if you look at chart 2, you're in for a lot of phone calls   Yes, well, that's what I was talking about   But that's a lot of phone calls, if you look at that chart   Yes, everything on that solid line is an official change   Well, that's what Don said I asked him; every consultation that was a policy change is on that solid line   Yes; that's what a policy change is   You're talking about the chart--the top of the chart   Top chart   What is a policy change if it's not a change in borrowing?   Well, that's fine; but Don is suggesting in his paper that $50 million to $100 million variation--   I don't see how that would be the case   But you say that's not a policy change Why wouldn't it be a policy change? "
194,1988-03-29," I just wanted to ask a question about the models and the natural rate What do they say about the kind of pressures that develop for wages as you approach the natural rate? I assume you get a lot of wage pressure after you pass the natural rate, but wouldn't you expect a good bit of pressure as you approach it?   I'm just suggesting that if we were, in fact, at the natural rate, you would expect to have seen a lot of compensation pressures as you approached it The interesting point is that we have not really seen a lot of upward pressure as we reached the 57 percent rate So it could be the capacity level I think we were starting to see some of those pressures maybe earlier last year before--   But that would suggest a lower natural rate   If they are fearful of their jobs in this environment, that means the natural rate is lower   I think that just about everything has been said I second what Frank Morris just said that if we are going to keep inflation under control, we're in a situation that requires taking some risk with policy ahead of the ball game, rather than waiting until the pressures start to show up I think everybody has already said what is obvious to me, too that the economy is doing better than most people would have thought after the stock market crash and that there probably are some significant risks that things could pick up and we would be close to some sort of inflation threshold I think those risks are there  However, we have seen since the stock market crash some pretty good improvements in the inflationary-expectation environment, although most recently we've seen some trends back the other way I don't know whether what we have seen over the last couple of weeks is simply a washing out of the recession forecast out of the market I tend to think that is what we are seeing Analysts and traders are looking at the situation now and are just scratching the recession forecast from their outlook, and the financial markets are reflecting that some But we have had, after all the major improvements in financial conditions since the stock market decline, some trend back toward firming up Long-term Treasury yields have gone up about 50 basis points relative to the funds rate, and some additional downward pressure on the dollar is starting to develop Commodities are sort of a mixed picture some are strengthening and some are not; oil prices are jumping around; the broader indexes are sort of flat, but some narrower measures of commodity prices are showing strength I don't really know what to make of this--whether everybody's breathing a sigh of relief that we're not heading for a recession or whether this is the beginning of some pressures that we need to worry about One thing that is clear to me, though, is that the stock market does not appear to be settled I think last week was a pretty harrowing experience again with the stock market losing 100 points So, I still don't get the impression that things are back to normal in the financial markets  I think that tells me that we're sort of on a knife edge, policy-wise We can make the mistake on the downside or the upside here But we have to take some risk My personal view is that there may be more upside risk, in terms of the beginnings of some pressures indicated by conditions in the financial markets and in the other real economic data But I think we ought to be very cautious at this point, because there are downside risks, as has been pointed out I think the stock market is very uneasy about the situation "

231,1988-05-17," I'm sort of following up where I left off on the tail end of the last discussion I'd like to throw my hat in the ring and concur with what the Chairman just said When I came into this meeting, I guess my feeling was even a little more moderate than that; although I generally tend to be-- When I walked into the last meeting I was for no change and the discussion convinced me that we needed to move This time, I came into the meeting basically feeling that we just had voted for a $100 million increase in the borrowing average at the last FOMC meeting and we have made another $100 million increase in the borrowing average, which has just occurred And the markets have really just absorbed this move, I think It would be unusual, and probably a little risky, to immediately hit the market again here at this meeting with another $100 million or more, or something like alternative C, just as the market has absorbed--and I think favorably absorbed--our last move So, I guess where I was prepared to come out was something like no change, with asymmetric language that provides the flexibility to move toward a tighter policy of maybe another $100 million increase in the borrowing average during this next intermeeting period, which I think would probably be likely The important issue would be the timing I still tend to favor that approach, although I guess I could actually support a $100 million move now But I still think that it would be important to have the discretion about the timing on filtering that into the market rather than moving immediately at this meeting since we've just now absorbed a $100 million move on borrowing I would be strongly against going for alternative C for a couple of reasons One, I think this would be a shock to the markets; they are not prepared to absorb that, and I think they would even wonder what they're missing that we know I think we have better information, but I don't see the kind of evidence that supports that kind of move Secondly, I think it would raise immediately in the markets an anticipation of an imminent discount rate move Going up $200 million on the borrowing from this point-- taking borrowings up to a $600 million average, which would take the funds rate up probably into the range of 7-1/2 percent plus, maybe 7-3/4 percent--would immediately raise expectations of a move on the discount rate That's something I would like to avoid I'm not against ultimately moving on the discount rate if we have to, but I think the discount rate ought to be used mainly as an extra piece of ammunition, as an important symbol for an even more serious situation, if it arises I would prefer that it not be simply a technical adjustment to what has already taken place in the markets Then we lose the effectiveness of what we might want to do with a discount rate move later So, I would prefer not to create those expectations of an imminent move in the market We have leeway to do that still, but I think that we have to be very cautious    5/17/88  So my preference, once again, would be no change, with asymmetric language and the understanding that there probably would be an imminent move timed sometime within this next intermeeting period But I'd leave it up to the Chairman and the Desk to determine that A $100 million move now would be reasonable, but I would still prefer that the Desk remain very sensitive to how that was filtered into the markets, given the fact that they've just now absorbed a $100 million increase in borrowings in the last few days I don't know exactly where that puts me in terms of ""A"", ""B"", and ""C""; maybe I should say that it's probably somewhere around ""B"" Although I guess my preference is ""B"" with asymmetric language, I could live with a ""B"" that would involve a $100 million borrowing move, with some sensitivity on the Desk's part   Before we do, [please read the sentence]   We could be surprised The subjunctive is right; that's correct   It did mine   We can certainly clarify that   $100 million is not enough?   It's possible to have $200 million within the intermeeting period   But that's with [unintelligible] any contingency And we want to keep in some contingency; it's not very likely, but there is a contingency   There's not enough difference between any of them to matter much   Yes, I thought it was The way that statement reads there's a lack of contingency in there, but I may have missed something   Yes, he read ""initially"" the last time   Yes   Well, okay   Well, as others have said, I sympathize with the goal that Tom's seeking If we had a vote today on the price stability goal, we'd probably get a much larger consensus I'm not sure if anybody wants to take that, but I think it's critical that--   Well, what I was going to follow up with is that there's a much more difficult technical issue Even if you agree on the goal--if we had 100 percent consensus that price stability is what we all wanted, and I think probably almost everybody would say that today--you'd still have a whole lot of disagreement about what that means Agreeing on the goal is an important first step, but then you'd run into all kinds of problems, like Does that mean that we should jump with both feet on every big relative price swing? If there's an oil price shock, which is one big relative price in the economy obviously as it flows through, it's going to have some temporary effects But what do we mean by temporary? It might have a two-year effect on the price level as it works its way through What are we going to do about that? Does that mean every time one big relative price shocks the general price level on a temporary basis that we run out there and stomp it to death? We would get into all kinds of discussions about timing, about what price stability means, and what we would accept in the form of relative price effects that could affect the general price level for a while But if you run out and try to deal with every relative price effect--like import prices, which we've obviously agreed to absorb to some extent--what are you going to do? If you deal with every one of those, you're going to be chasing your tail, I think If you tighten up against a relative price shock, then you're going to potentially overshoot; as that filters through the economy, then it's going to create an overreaction on the downside at some point, and then you're going to be trying to work it back up  So, to me, price stability means a long-run concept And that may mean that you're never actually experiencing a perfect level of price stability where prices are hovering around zero It has to mean that the mean is somewhat around zero; but even then you'd have  -27-    5/17/88  to admit that you want to accept periods of deflation And I guess we could debate whether people think we ought to go through periods of deflation in order to keep the mean around zero You can get into all kinds of difficult debates about what the proper measure of price stability is Is it a broad index such as the CPI, PPI, the deflator? What is it? It's a difficult problem But I still think that a goal of price stability, rather than, say, trying to improve the unemployment rate or maximize real output growth, is a step in the right direction I think there was a time, probably, when that wasn't clear; some people would have said there was a Phillip's curve trade off and some acceptance of permanent inflation was worthwhile I don't think that's true anymore, but I still think there is a difficult problem  Before I get too hung up on the goals, I do want to say on this specific proposal, though, that I think it would succeed in damping the volatility of the base Having upper and lower bounds or constraints, I think, would cause monetary policy to adjust early as you're approaching the bounds rather than deal with big roller coaster effects, and would probably damp the volatility of the base growth You'd have a much more stable growth in the base; I think it would succeed in that But the question would be whether that gets you anything I think the ultimate issue as to whether this specific proposal would be worthwhile rests on whether the base is a better instrument of intermediate policy than any other aggregate or anything else we have Don had indicated that the statistical properties of the base make it somewhat equivalent to M2, although Bob Parry's people debate that My view is that even if you look at M2, you have serious money demand problems associated with M2 My big problem is that I am not convinced that money demand is stable, even in the long run Look at what we have experienced over the 1980s And there have been statistical studies in the past that have found long-run breaks in the trend in the money demand in the postwar period All you have to do is look back earlier than the postwar period; there were decades when monetary velocity was actually on a declining trend It only turned up in the postwar period And there have been several detected structural breaks in it even since the postwar era Nobody can predict when those breaks will occur, and that's the difficult problem You can feel very satisfied about the statistical properties of the base and all of a sudden there could be some structural adjustment--a long-term adjustment in the trend rate Even though it may stabilize around this new trend rate, you might go two years trying to detect it So, I think there is this fundamental problem with monetary aggregates But, in saying that, I think the goal of people who want to target the monetary aggregates is a highly desirable one That's why my preference has been to try and look at indicators like the interest spread, in conjunction with commodity prices and exchange rates These are financial market indicators but they provide a similar type of goal to what people wanting to target the aggregates would want I'm interested in the interest rate spread because I think that, especially under our operating procedure, that's how money is created and that's how liquidity is provided to the system It's basically the spread between the funds rate and other rates that creates the lending incentives that take place, and of course, that determines, to some extent, the expansionary effects of money It creates additional credit in the markets and that feeds back on the base The way we do it now, we change the funds rate through the borrowing target, which changes the interest rate spread,  -28-    5/17/88  which creates new loans and feeds back on the base through reserves And, you know, I think that that gives you some idea about the thrust of policy I think that approach--   Yes   Sure I guess all I would say is that, yes, the yield curve might change Obviously, as you got close to the constraint, long-term rate movements would probably be damped   It could, but I think still the question is going to be whether that aggregate-- You know, you can get all kinds of yield curve relationships associated with that You might get much better behavior on the long end of the market But it's not hard to get long bonds to behave well We could run the fed funds rate up to 20 percent today and I can assure you we'd get very good performance on the long end of the market I think it's pretty predictable; if you create expectations of a recession, you can invert the yield curve quite nicely But I don't think that's the ultimate goal, unless what you want is a level of expansion consistent with price stability-- whatever that is, exactly I don't know exactly what yield curve determines that, but it's not a negative slope It might be close to flat but who knows exactly I don't know where that leaves me, except that it requires a lot of discretion at the moment It really requires filtering a lot of information I think getting the goal right, and maybe even having further debate on fleshing out these goals, would allow this process to work even better You're always going to have differing opinions when you have 19 people sitting around a table But I've been amazed at how well this process sort of filters all that information into a pretty good consensus So where do we need to go? If we could get the goals down a little better, we would probably do all right   I don't disagree with that either  -29-    5/17/88   What I'm saying is that it's a proxy; that's always been the intermediate target to get to price stability, or whatever the goal was Money growth isn't an end in itself; it's only an intermediate step toward what your ultimate goal is I'm just saying that there are a lot of potential intermediate approaches to use to achieve the same end result If we all have the same end result, we could have a slightly different view about what the intermediate steps ought to be but still reach a consensus on policy that would probably make us all happy The base would probably perform better; my own indicators would perform better; Wayne's commodity prices would perform better I think we would all generally be happier   The problem is you would never get the market's response to the changes   The behavioral adjustments that would take place are not there that way   You could at least see when you would be faced with a decision   Yes, I do; I think it might be  -34-    5/17/88   I don't know I mean, you have to tell me what's happening on the demand side   If you make that assumption, I agree with you completely But I'm saying that's one hell of a big ""if"", because that's not what it has been doing the last few years   Well, it has been a long way from zero   Yes, if you go back--   No doubt about it   Don, since when has it been doing better? It's been what--a few quarters, right?   Can you predict the interest rate movements? Because if you can't, you're in big trouble   It just gets you into interest rate forecasting   No That's my whole point That's why I'm saying I've been looking at these other indicators that seem to do a better job than prices   How long did that one last? "
270,1988-08-16," What is the average in terms of dollar transactions per day?   Dollar transactions per day?   Well, worldwide   You don't know?   I think [theirs is] very large relative to what [we] do   I have sort of a technical question I'm not a purist on intervention either, although I think there are times when the signal is useful and there are times that it's useful for reasons of international cooperation, even regardless of the substance--   But the one thing I have been worried about recently is--this is a question I guess for Joan Lovett and Don Kohn and Sam Cross--when we are doing consistent interventions and it's working in the other direction from our open market operations, it does run the risk I think of confusing the federal funds market as to what our reserve needs may be If we have a larger drain need--say it appeared when we are tightening--if the market is not aware of our intervention actions to sell dollars, they may not know specifically or may considerably underestimate the draining requirements of the Open Market Desk And that can lead to some strange behavior in the funds market, it seems to me How do we deal with that? It seems to me that we don't want that kind of uncertainty in the funds market Maybe we want the two-way risk on the foreign exchange market, but we don't want this uncertainty in the open market operations   Seven days, though, can be important   But truly that's just as big   A good example, though, is this yen trans- action that we are doing, which is not constructed to be noticed I think   And that's reported with a 7-day lag?   Okay   I'll move "
271,1988-08-16," I wanted to ask Mike a question What percentage of the GNP growth rate is investment demand considered to be in terms of the components of the growth rate? Is that a big factor?   It's pretty significant   How big of a factor is PDE in that?   The reason I'm asking is because I was struck by the presentation to the Board yesterday and talking with Charlie Schultz earlier who made a comment I thought was kind of interesting He said that a lot of that PDE growth--correct me if I'm wrong--is the deflator The decline in prices for producers durable equipment is generating a lot of the real output side of that If you apply a fixed-weight deflator to PDE, I don't know that you get a totally different result, but what does it do?    8/16/88   Computers   I was noticing yesterday it was down about 3 percent, or 2-1/2 percent   It's not the whole show Well, say you apply the fixed-weight deflator though, how much would that take out of the growth in PDE?   Okay that, then   I'm not suggesting we should, but I'm saying I think that's a relevant measure But--   Okay But you're suggesting, though, that the potential number changes with the way you look at the deflator?   But you can't look at the fixed-weight on one side only It seems to me that you've got to be consistent And like you say, if you believe the deflator issue is important on the growth side, then you should be looking at the implicit deflator otherwise--   Well, it's almost an apples and oranges problem, though   Yes Okay, I will stop   That's right It doesn't change the overall story, but it does around the margin That's okay   They were waiting for the phone  -24-    8/16/88   Depends on which one you look at   Yes   It's the same with the Journal of Commerce But there are a couple of them that are much higher; there are a couple that are no change   Depends on what you weight it by, too   I don't know if it's relevant, but I've got a comment I think everyone has laid out the risks pretty well Almost everyone agrees that the risks are on the upside, and that's the way I feel I think the risks are tilted more toward the upside, although I don't think they're zero on the downside either We've seen that even with a half point change in the discount rate--it went from 6 to 6-1/2 percent, relative to where the funds rate is now And in the scheme of things, you wouldn't think that would be a big factor, but you see nervous ripples in the financial markets when you do that We've all seen over the last year or so how expectations can change fairly dramatically And I think we have to be cautious about that So, I think we should be concerned about the magnitude [and] the timing of the actions we take   Okay, I'll get away from that But the other thing I wanted to say on the overall view, in terms of actions that we've taken in the past and depending on what we do in the future I don't think it's going to be that easy to manage the adjustment process by the actions we take I think our moves, in the past, have had an effect of strengthening the dollar, and they would continue to do so They're going to affect both domestic and overall demand Either the exchange rate flows through and it weakens our competitiveness some, or foreign central banks try to stabilize the dollar and you're going to get a weakness on the foreign demand side I know Ted pointed out there are some lags But eventually that'll take place So I'm not sure we should believe that we can get the adjustment process at the same time we get the slowing down I think most of what we are seeing on the adjustment process is a result of where the exchange rate has come to this point We've had a substantial adjustment on the discount rate; we'll have lagged effects for some time to come But I think a price-stable economy here is consistent with a fairly large current account deficit I don't think you can get them both down unless you have--I don't know, maybe a major recession would do it But I'm not sure that's in our interest to do  -27-    8/16/88 -28- "
272,1988-08-16," Wouldn't you see that in bills? I don't think you've seen that in the spread of bills over the funds rate You've had a little bit of upward pressure, I think, because of supply conditions, due to the suspension of the long bond But you don't see a big spread developing in bills over the funds rate   But, Ed, don't you think if you have asymmetric language that the Chairman could just as easily choose to move the funds rate as he could a borrowing number?   I just can't comprehend that, I'm sorry   Yes   But you're saying the Chairman would somehow have illusions himself that a $50 million change in the borrowing is not moving the funds rate?   I think the Chairman said it; his statement is clearly consistent with mine As I said before, I think that the risks are still on the upside I think we need time to see how the market digests this discount rate change, but I think we should be prepared to move [on the basis of] the economy's performance-- especially if the inflation indicators continue to show pressure But I think at this stage, the appropriate action is to support asymmetry in the language and maintain the $600 million borrowing with the discount rate where it is Let's see how those winds blow   On Governor Angell's point, I wouldn't mind advancing the aggregates in the list a little bit if we all agree that they're behaving a little better But inflation pressure I think is number one, the major issue I'm sort of agnostic on whether the M2 demand is behaving that much better I somewhat agree with the possibility of what Governor Heller suggested--that M2 velocity has something to do with the stability--, the prediction accuracy on T- bills and short-term interest rates, to some extent So, I'm satisfied with where it is, but I can support moving it up; I'm sort of indifferent   [Unintelligible]   Because people believe that's what we are saying "
319,1988-09-20, Second   No matter what 
320,1988-09-20," Mike, what did you say your federal funds rate forecast was? Lee asked, and I forgot Did you say 9-1/2 percent?   Yes, I know   And you're saying about a proportional move up in the long-run rate to 10 percent?   The only question I have about that is that we haven't seen that kind of trend with our moves on the funds rate this year We've had a 1-1/2 percentage point increase in the funds rate and actually a sharp flattening of the yield curve Long rates stayed about where they were, maybe going up some, but much less than proportionally I think the yield curve has flattened from about    9/20/88  2-1/2 percentage points down to less than 1 percentage point What if that trend continues? What would the forecast say if the move to 9-1/2 percent on the funds rate was not accompanied by a proportional move in the long bond? What kind of differential effects would that have?   No, that's okay   I understand What I'm saying is, let's assume it's inflationary expectations being adjusted, and that's why the long rates haven't gone up Say that continues to be the case, but the funds rate goes up to 9-1/2 percent without much change in the long bond due to improvement in inflationary expectations or something like that What would be the differential impacts of that?   Okay, entirely, let's say, to debate the extreme   Your view is, though, that these expectations will be revised in the near future and that the long bond will move back up?   And if that's the case, then the long bond would be surprised into further upward moves   I really don't want to add much to any of that I think everything has been said We've seen recently some signs of slowing as everyone has pointed out That seems to have had a moderating effect in the financial markets and I don't know whether that's going to continue or not All I know is that it looks pretty good right now and certainly doesn't lend any weight to overreacting So I support what others have said "
321,1988-09-20," I agree with the recommendation I'll just add a response to what Don was saying earlier about the financial markets and some of the caveats that go with it I think that's right I think to some extent that the good behavior of financial markets has a lot to do with the credibility that we've established with our actions And I think that if there are signs of market wavering-- thinking that we are not credible on policy--then it'll show up and that's the time when we should consider further actions But I think now the signs look good, and we don't want to lose that credibility we've established with the financial markets I think clearly this is the right type of policy for now "
378,1988-11-01," What he means is, if you take it out far enough, you could probably wash all that out But the point I'm just making about this is that some people think it is a shorter period of time to [get full] adjustment and smoothness, but I have to think that in the short run it could be a very, very tumultuous situation This is very good in terms of the long-run picture, but in the long run, we're all dead   100 years   Our great grandchildren!   I was just going to make a comment on what Governor Heller said earlier It's interesting that last year we had the weakness in the dollar, and it appears we had a strong economic situation, stronger than some people saw at the time I think that led to feelings that the trade deficit wasn't going to improve-- imports were going to be strong--and that policy was going to be geared toward further dollar depreciation to the point of protectionist pressures So, there was a definite fear, I think, in the market of an orchestrated decline in the dollar and that tended to feed on itself But this year we have seen something different The deficit has improved, and the dollar started turning about the time we started seeing trade improvement And it has improved consistently up to recently On top of that were the expectations of rising interest rates because the economy remained strong and everybody anticipated a tightening monetary policy action Now, you've got a bit of a different perception I think the markets see the economy as not as strong as expected earlier and believe that rates may not have to go as high as anticipated earlier and that's taking the pressures off the exchange market And I think they've seen some slowing in the trade improvement It may be just an aberration, but all of that I think is sort of leading up to a weaker trend in the dollar I don't know where that takes you exactly, but that is how I would characterize the way things have developed   There may be some of that [unintelligible] feeling, but there also was a strong feeling that aside from that we'd do anything necessary, or the perception was that we want to maintain dollar stability It also was a perception that the central bank might be a source of the political cycle, too I don't know how you weigh those two out And they could balance each other   Well, I think it's a combination of the perception of things; they're all intertwined, with the perceived relatively weaker situation in the economy and the trade numbers are alll tied up together Although it's hard for me to-- What do the models show when you have a relatively weaker economic situation? I thought you'd get more on the import side than you'd lose on the export side   How does that fit into your view about inflation?   I think all those criteria for primary dealer- ships sound good except for two that Mr Sternlight mentioned--the number limitation and the geographical I assume that's just politi- cal reasoning on your part, but I can't see any other reason why you have those Maybe that's the right thing to do but that seems to invite criticism from parties that are perfectly qualified except for the fact that you've hit the number limit and the fact that they may be concentrated in some geographical region I'm not sure why you'd argue you are excluding by the limit basis   But I'm saying if you can insure these other criteria, which I think are good criteria, why would you use those other factors? If they are perfectly qualified by those criteria, why would you impose these quotas?   Sure   It seems like a way to do that would be just to tighten your criteria further   That's what I was getting at   But I'm saying that's the maximum number you can have "
379,1988-11-01," I just have one question that bothers me a little Those were good explanations, but one basic thing bothers me about the Greenbook forecast I've mentioned it before I'll refer to it again What bothers me is the fact that we put short-term rates up about 1-1/2 percent--the federal funds rate Yet long-rates are lower today than when we started that tightening move The Greenbook assumes sort of a parallel shift in rates And yet the economic data that we've seen, even though I think close to the Greenbook forecast, are definitely slower than what I would have anticipated at this level of interest rates, especially long rates I'm having trouble accounting for that How would you reconcile that kind of situation-- the fact that your interest rate forecast had one thing in it and yet the economic performance has been even more modest than you may have anticipated because you would have assumed the higher level of long  -24-    11/1/88  rates and maybe even a higher level of short rates? I have a lot of trouble reconciling this   I guess what you still haven't quite dealt with--I'm trying to look backwards at where we've come I agree that all those things could happen going forward; that's just prospective; it's something we don't know about But looking backwards we haven't had a move upward; as a matter of fact we've had a slight move down- ward in long rates at the same time the funds rate moved up You say that the long-rate effect may involve a longer lag than I'm giving credit for, but what's going to be the effect of that?   Now, you're getting into something I think you're saying that because the yield curve has flattened out and long rates haven't gone up that that's going to have a longer stimulus with a lag?   So you're saying real rates have actually fallen on the long end?   So you'd have to agree though that if that's the case, there has been some decline in inflationary expectations   And you're just saying it's temporary and ill conceived?   I agree that all those expectations are quite [unintelligible], but we've had almost a year in which those long rates have had a chance to wash out or adjust expectations and they really have held   That may have occurred earlier; I don't know about now The tax bill is passed I think that's [not affecting the long] end of the yield curve now Anyway, I don't want to address too much of this It's just that we've had this event over the last year and clearly it either has to be a decline in inflationary expectations or a decline in the real rate of interest And since we don't think it's the decline in the real rate since we've been tighter, then it has to be a change in inflationary expectations I know that can all change going forward, but at least I think you have to say at this point that's what the market thinks   You don't mean unit labor costs, you mean--   Can I just make a couple of remarks? I'm not sure where we're going from here Like everyone else, I think things look pretty good at the moment; whether it's good fortune or our good sense, it's hard to tell, but I'll take either one The situation does look fairly good at the moment, but where we're headed and what we'll be faced with is a little difficult to tell I guess I'm a  -41-    11/1/88  little more optimistic about the future--just on the basis of how well we have done in keeping domestic demand relatively modest Whether that's going to be enough, I don't know If foreign demand surges while we're so internationally competitive, we could put more stress on the manufacturing sector, but that's not evident Domestic demand abroad has at least been reasonably good, but if both Germany and Japan take some modest tightening action--Germany perhaps more than Japan--I don't see demand for our exports being out of control by any means And there's some evidence on the trade side of a slowing of exports, so I don't see that source overtaxing our capacity Growth of our gross domestic purchases, which is I guess the broadest measure of domestic demand, has been very modest--around 1-1/2 percent The other measures which are a little narrower, have been higher but they've been trending down And this paper that was presented today, and the comments about the loan situation, how much growth can you get out of that kind of a M2 picture? You can't get a lot There's only so much, even if you make some fairly optimistic assumptions about the kind of velocity growth you could get from M2, which has a long-term zero trend You can't get some sort of disaster out of that, and so I see the long run looking fairly good That may mean that pressures surface later to some extent, and if that happens we'll have to move Right now, things look pretty good "
380,1988-11-01," I want to follow up on your comment about oil prices I agree with a lot of what you said about that, but with that kind of increase in real disposable income, it might have an effect on demand that you wouldn't necessarily want to validate fully However, that still may mean that nominal rates would fall, even though you're saying that you wouldn't let real interest rates come down as much   Well, that's what I'm thinking, but if there were a real plunge in prices from this level, and they seem to be viewed as more permanent than this [unintelligible]   Yes, I'm just saying, though, I agree if we didn't appear to be trying to accommodate every bit of it you could expect that that still may mean that you would accommodate some of it  -44-    11/1/88   Well, that's the question I think Well, I think what he's saying--   That's the decoded part of it!   I also support this directive I think I can support the directive as long as over the next intermeeting period we're not likely to be confronted with any possibility of easing And I think that's probably a very good possibility But I do have a little sensitivity to what Tom Melzer said, because I don't think the probability really is zero that some unforeseen event might surface; and I think we may be living a little close to the edge, although part of it may be statistical aberrations The Chairman pointed out that the farm situation is subtracting from fourth-quarter GNP and adding to first-quarter 1989 GNP; I think estimates are for about minus 1-1/4 percent or something like that from the fourth-quarter growth rate And given the third-quarter starting point, the economy must grow a lot over the next three months to exceed the third-quarter's midpoint And I'm concerned that we might find ourselves, at least statistically, in a situation that would not lead us to change policy but certainly could create some perception problems Statistically, we could end up with a flat or slightly negative quarter in the fourth quarter with the drought adjustment; but I don't think that result will be anything fundamental and will be made up in the first quarter I'm comfortable with asymmetric language, but I think if we found ourselves in a situation where there was a need to ease--even if it were only a slight easing--it would be uncomfortable given that language So maybe we ought to consider that possibilty seriously, if things don't change by the time of our next meeting But I can live with asymmetric now "
439,1989-03-28," This is the meeting when officer nominations are usually made So, I'd like to open the meeting by asking for nominations for the Chairman of the FOMC and then the Vice Chairman We're open for nominations   Let's get on with this   All right We have nominations for Chairman Alan Greenspan and Vice Chairman Gerald Corrigan All those in favor?  SPEAKER(?) Enthusiastically   I think it goes without saying that we have some outstanding nominations We're ready to proceed, Mr Chairman   Second    3/28/89   I'll second that   So move   Second   I heard what you said, Sam, about Germany but that explanation still doesn't strike me as justifying completely why they have been so reluctant to move A lot of people seem to be scratching their heads about Germany's behavior relative to inflationary pressures and the fact that they have been sitting back and letting the mark depreciate I know it has been pretty stable over the intermeeting period in general But I think the feeling has been What's going on in Germany compared to their previous behavior?   But isn't it, though, just the Danish that are down there? The lira--   It just still seems strange, given that nobody paid too much attention when the Italians were way below the band and just hovered there for heaven knows [how long]   Well, it was a special arrangement    3/28/89   Not to prolong this, but what's rotten in Denmark?   They probably believed the long-term rates were going to rise   I don't know that you look [unintelligible]   Well, by definition a hedge is a hedge It  just depends [on whether it was] something they thought was a hedge "
440,1989-03-28," A couple One Just looking at the forecast, which has been revised since last time although it's not dramatically different, you have real GNP slowing significantly by the third quarter of 1989 It averages about 12 percent from the third quarter of 1989 through 1990 We have gotten into these arguments before about what potential is but I think everybody agrees that that's well below whatever anybody is thinking of as potential And that's for a fairly significant period of time Yet we don't see any improvement on the inflation side The lags are longer I guess than would show up on here But exactly what do we expect, ultimately, on the inflation rate from a forecast that has that kind of slack built into it over a prolonged period? Clearly, it's not showing up in the numbers here When does it show up?   I know, but there's a year of that kind of slack And I just wondered--   But if you're just saying that we're moving to the natural rate why would you get below potential growth on that?   Yes, I know I'm--  -12-    3/28/89   Again, what happens ultimately? What is the ultimate inflation path that we get out of this scenario?   There is one other point I wanted to ask I asked this last time but I'll ask it again I was looking at our forecast compared to the Bluechip consensus I know what was circulated showed some other forecasts besides the Bluechip one, but those are all contained in the Bluechip so I'm comparing that one with ours We have very similar forecasts on real GNP and inflation But once again they expect a decline in short-term interest rates by the second quarter whereas we're saying they need to go a percentage point higher Any comment on that?   I don't really have much to add We got a rash of weaker indicators for the month of February, where almost across the board all of the data suggested a weakening But we don't know  -31-    3/28/89  whether that is weather-related or not because of the strong data for January There certainly are some signs of slowing I agree it's too early to assess whether things are significantly slowing or whether this is establishing some sort of trend Real personal consumption expenditures seem to have been on a modest track for more than just one month and the order books on capital goods seem to have been moving at a moderate pace for several months now So, I think those are promising signs But I don't think there are any indications of things going overboard on the weak side Or, at least if they are starting to slow down quite a bit, we only have one month's observation It's too early to make any judgment one way or the other on that I think the inflation news recently has been disappointing; but at the same time we knew these lags were built in Those forces were set in place long ago and we've got to look forward So the question is whether we have put in place strong enough policy that, with a lag, we're going to get the results we're looking for That's the key question I don't think anyone knows this for sure; but we have moved quite significantly over the last intermeeting period and we will just have to see Economically, I think we are in an uncertain period "
441,1989-03-28," Just one On the Hoey survey, was that last survey taken before or after our discount rate [action]?   It's a February survey number   Okay That's all I need   I'd just follow up on that, Mr Chairman That's pretty much the way I see it As I said in my statement just before the coffee break, I think there are certainly some signs of slowing but not enough to feel that a clear trend has been established, although I think we have enough observations on new orders and in the real consumption area to suspect that things are at least slowing or moderating Whether that will be sufficient is  -34-    3/28/89  certainly not clear at this stage But, given the fact that we have just recently moved fairly significantly on policy, I think we at least ought to wait a while to see how those lags work out I think it's probably still true that the risks are somewhat asymmetric, so I can certainly go along with an asymmetric policy position in terms of our pause "
504,1989-05-16," Sam, you mentioned that one thing that may be driving this is the expected capital gains, given the anticipation that the peak in interest rates is close You may be right, but I guess one of the things that bothers me a little about that explanation is that the bill market and the bond market have been anticipating a turn of events for a while That's why long bond rates are below short rates, or the funds rate, right now; and bill rates have drifted down on the expectation of lower rates I guess my question then is Are the capital gains already there? They are already taking capital gains; would there be a further advantage that would cause people to rush into bonds at this point?   So move   Just one, related to the intervention activity You may have mentioned it and I just missed it but have all the dollar sales had much of an impact on our open market operations?   I guess what I'm asking is Has that added any uncertainty to the market in terms of what our reserve need is?   Okay   So move  SPEAKER(?) Second "
505,1989-05-16," Mike, I can't resist asking this question again that I've been asking every time I'm not just looking at the Blue Chip forecast but I'm reading the financial markets and what they seem to be saying They have been giving us a slightly different picture for some time now and I've been asking this question You have been saying basically that you think the market will come back to the  -13-    5/16/89  forecast--that the market is probably wrong and that you are sticking to your forecast I just wondered if you're still willing to say that; it sounds like you're hedging a little more The Blue Chip forecast has the funds rate peaking this quarter and then going down, but they have about the same GNP forecast You suggest that the data available recently are showing maybe a slightly weaker case, although what will happen over the next few quarters is uncertain, of course But I just wondered if you feel any differently about the market's reading of the outlook as compared to the forecast?   Yes As a follow-up to that, I think maybe you're a little less concerned that this slowing relative to the forecast is a permanent feature You think it might bounce back some and, therefore, you've got this further rise in interest rates built into your assumptions But--   I think I know what your answer would be, but let's just assume that the economy is running below your forecast It seems to me that an additional 75 basis points or so on the funds rate, if you project that against this weaker forecast, puts you in the recession category Now, I don't know what you think, but it seems like that would clearly tip the economy over; maybe it wouldn't   Sure I'm simply suggesting that if the data continue to come in weaker than the forecast, I think your interest rate scenario would go with a stronger interpretation  -14-    5/16/89   But that interest rate scenario would be, I think, somewhat tougher to follow   I'd like to associate myself with those people who generally view the current environment as satisfactory The evidence clearly is showing a slowing in economic activity In my opinion it has gone beyond the stage where this might be a temporary situation I think it is [likely to be] sustained And I think the slowdown in domestic demand or consumer spending is a desirable feature that we've been looking for Like Governor Angell, I think getting that excess demand out of the economic system with our policy frees up our capacity for other uses in our export sector and capital goods, which is something we've desired The inflationary picture looks more promising than we might have expected, although I don't want to make too much of any one month's number But going beyond just the April CPI, I think the wage patterns are better than what we might have expected, even taking into account the Bethlehem Steel [settlement] I've seen some reports--as a matter of fact I asked the  -28-    5/16/89  International Division to report on this because I wanted to know if the VRAs had anything to do with the wage pattern The report I got back was generally ""no""--that basically this wage settlement involved some catch-up on big productivity increases in the past and some of the very slow wage growth or even give-backs that had been imposed earlier So I think there are some one-time features in there The actual change of the wage base, I think, is very small At least the report I got back was that that was not a discouraging wage negotiation There are a lot of good signs The April PPI, of course, was a real positive feature If you add that one month in, the trend in the PPI, excluding the [volatile] components like food and energy, so far this year is below last year I think that's an encouraging sign At the very least you can say that ex-food and energy the underlying producer price growth is not accelerating It may even be a bit more modest than last year  As others have said, the risk has certainly shifted from being on the up side to being more balanced I put myself in that camp and maintain more of a neutral position at this point But I do want to emphasize what Governor Angell and others have said It would be a risk to perceive a neutral policy, and one that is balanced, as one with a steady funds rate To me the great success of our actions last year in achieving what we wanted has been our ability to move the funds rate Some people want to talk about this in terms of the aggregates; but my view is that our willingness to be flexible on interest rates and to move them subject to changing conditions has been the reason we have been able to stay ahead of this process and contain inflationary pressures That means that we show flexibility with respect to interest rates rather than targeting some interest rate level And I think that is important to keep in mind That means that a neutral policy in a weaker situation or a slowing situation is not a steady interest rate, just as steady interest rates weren't the answer when we were restraining policy We need to keep that in mind because as credit demands start to slow we could easily see maintaining the same level of interest rates as a drain on reserves and ultimately on the monetary aggregates--if you want to look at it from the point of view of the monetary aggregates Anyway, that's my point of view "
506,1989-05-16," Don, that was an interesting briefing What did you say in the beginning about the yield curve? I didn't quite hear that   Is that the dotted line?   Oh, I see I'm sorry  -30-    5/16/89   Okay I've got you   Wouldn't you say more that they're expecting some easing?   Okay Also, one other thing on these inflation expectations measures those were April surveys?   So they don't really contain any of the April data?   Okay   Yes, I see   Okay, thanks   I have a technical question, though, that I need to ask as a follow up on what you said Going back to the open market operations report and looking at the borrowing, we've been operating under a $500 million [borrowing assumption] for a while and borrowings actually have been running close to $600 million since mid- April Is that right?   The weekly averages here are $612, $612, $582, and $581 million What I'm saying is If we didn't concern ourselves with the borrowing target then, why should we be concerned about it now? We ran at $500 million and didn't worry about it [coming in higher]   All right Just for the record I wanted to make it known   That's what the markets say   '87   Oh, '88   I have some sympathy for what Tom is saying However, I certainly support the Chairman's view for symmetric language My concern is also Exactly what does no change in policy mean and what do we really mean by symmetry? But I basically support ""B"" Again, I'm not hung up on the borrowing number whatsoever I would define ""B"" as a 6-3/4 percent funds rate--I mean 9-3/4; I hope that's not a Freudian slip--a 9-3/4 percent funds rate and I would like to be more clearly focused on centering it there rather than letting it edge towards the upper end of that I am concerned about this neutrality issue; if bill rates and other short-term interest rates stay down over the intermeeting period and don't show a tendency to bounce back toward the funds rate, I certainly would think that trying to remain neutral would imply bringing the funds rate more in line with those rates I would like to think that symmetric language would mean that the Chairman would have the discretion during the intermeeting period to make some adjustments there I certainly think that that fits into a symmetric and neutral policy But for the purposes of listing my position it would be ""B;"" 6-3/4--rather 9-3/4 percent; and symmetric I wrote that 6-3/4 percent down for some reason! "
559,1989-08-22," All of Europe is on vacation   Second    8/22/89   But [unintelligible], I think, is the issue   Compounding "
560,1989-08-22," At least two   Following up on that Do we know how much of that authorization has been borrowed already?   I think borrowings may be $5 or $6 billion Is that where it--  -13-    8/22/89   Yes, I understand, but I mean relative to what you had expected   Yes   Difficulties and errors   I'd wait 'til the end of the day   Just a couple of things First, you mentioned that you thought demand was going to be rather buoyant, and I'm having a little trouble with that I see it picks up somewhat in the second half of the year and I think some of that is auto related--certainly, the third quarter is Then you have it coming off in durables in the fourth quarter, but nondurables are much stronger relative to the past What's causing that nondurable consumption [growth]? It has been trending down and all of a sudden it leaps up in the second half   But that's a level adjustment You were talking earlier about unchanged growth rates, and I'm wondering why that would affect the growth rate   Okay, I see it   It's jumping all over the place   Yes, thanks   Now, let me ask What is the difference between gross domestic purchases and just the private domestic final purchases? Is that taking out imports?   Okay Another question I had was on your mention of housing starts and some potential pickup There have been some really marginal upticks in [starts], but permits have continued to trend down Even with the Board staff's adjustment, they're still somewhat below starts I just wondered, with permits continuing on that trend, whether starts would show a turnaround I know they are both sort of contemporaneous indicators but I would think that starts would adjust to permits, not vice versa   That's what I meant to say, statistics   No, except that they haven't shown any turnaround   Well, that's sort of what I wanted to follow up on, Mike I can understand what you're saying, looking at the permit trends and realizing that you've got a turnaround in starts and  -20-    8/22/89  housing investment, but in the broader picture on total investment-- even when you take into account some of the revisions on orders--the orders data are very weak And when you look at the fact that long- term interest rates have been down for quite some time now and have been trending down over a fairly long period--I guess they peaked out last August, about a year ago--   Right But there certainly has been no expectation of long rates rising more than expected They had been trending down gradually, and then more recently declined more, I guess Yet there is no sign of a pickup in orders or anything that looks like that's having [an effect], forward looking, on investment demand   The level is about the same   Regardless of the zigs and zags, if you just look at the current level--even taking today's numbers into account--I remember that the level looked about the same as it was 8 months ago There has been some volatility month-to-month, but the fact is that the level is roughly unchanged over a half a year   Yes, well--   Yes If you look at it over a long period of time, I think you can run a regression right through the turning points and get a nice upward slope But the point is that we have to worry about the [turning] points   True; and I don't disagree with that Now, I have one other question, for Ted You talked about the widening of the current account later on, and that leaves some of the reason for the dollar depreciation assumptions out With the revisions, the current account and the trade numbers are dramatically down with the deficit I just wondered Why doesn't that really work in the opposite direction and support a stronger dollar over the horizon?   All I'm saying is, if you take that seriously, that we would have hoped the models were predicting 110 on the yen a year ago or so   Yes But I would say that the perceptions created by numbers like that [are one of] the reasons why interest differentials have worked one way and the dollar is going the other way to some extent It's surprising I think everybody has been grasping for reasons why the dollar has continued to hold up this well and even strengthened when interest differentials were working against it And I would venture to say that improvements on the current account both in actuality and prospectively may be a major factor in that; rather than working against the dollar it may be one of the things supporting it   No, all I'm saying is that you may be at a point where people say Hey, this thing is ultimately financeable now How the financial burden, if we proceed--   The current account deficit   Yes, that's what I was alluding to   However big it is, Ted, it's a lot smaller than what people thought it was earlier, I think   Well, it's smaller So what I'm saying is that the market people see the financing requirements as less than they did before   Well, if you play that scenario out you come up with all kinds of [unintelligible] But I think it matters what it's being used for, what you're doing with it There are plenty of countries that finance that quite easily as long as it's going for sustainable private-sector investment   But it's all relative to the return on the investment   The recent revisions of some elements of the lagging data suggest that things certainly have been decelerating as much as would have appeared earlier I'm comforted by that; it made my vacation a little easier knowing that the situation looked a little better than I had expected But even taking that into account, all the forward looking data still are pointing toward a further decelerating situation--not that I think it's decelerating at an accelerating rate As a matter of fact, I think it may even have slowed its pace of decline But my view is that the forward-looking data still show [a deceleration] except for maybe the growth numbers in M2 recently, which have shown some turnaround I think that is interesting and positive, yet the reserve aggregates and the base don't really show that kind of turnaround; there's some uptick but not very much at all So I just wonder how much noise there is in terms of shuffling of accounts in the M2 numbers and the response to the change in opportunity costs from the recent decline in the funds rate  But I am generally encouraged by the situation We have been seeking moderation in the pace of domestic demand and I think we are seeing that It's what we want, and I think that over the longer run we're going to see the inflation results I'm more optimistic that we're going to see that in the intermediate term and not have to wait quite as long as in the Greenbook forecast But if we're going to see that we're going to have to remain in a fairly restrained monetary policy posture My major concern, though, is that we still may be in too restrained a posture The yield curve is still inverted; the commodity prices are starting to shift sides and breaking on the down  -37-    8/22/89  side; the dollar is continuing to show strength My basic concern is that as long as the funds rate is the highest rate in town we're going to continue to run into weakness on the expansion side as we continue to absorb money and credit, at least in base terms Credit aggregates are continuing to decelerate As I said earlier in my questions, I still don't see any real signs of a pickup in investment on the horizon I don't see signs of a turnaround; there may be a temporary pause and some slowing of the deceleration My worry is that that will continue on I guess the good news is that we have more time to think about that than we did in the past But we still have to be vigilant on that front "
561,1989-08-22," I totally agree with that and my sentiments on policy directly relate to that The biggest mistake we could make is to get ourselves into a situation where we are over-stimulative with monetary policy and end up aggressively easing But, I have a slight preference--well, I shouldn't say slight--I have a preference for asymmetric policy toward ease I agree that alternative B is the right stance for now I base that mainly on the notion that I still see our policy as relatively tight The funds rate is still well above other rates If you look at the movement of other market rates that react to expectations of future funds rates, as Don and Peter and others reported, the market is still anticipating some easing of policy based on the existing data that they have seen, including the recent revisions Now, those expectations have been postponed, I think, from the immediate future out to one or two months ahead But  -42-    8/22/89  those expectations still clearly fall in the intermeeting period So, my concern is that the market is still poised for some easing rather than a neutral policy And I think it's basing those expectations on the data [market participants] have seen on the economy and what they think appropriate policy would be Not that that's always right; obviously, the markets are wrong from time-to-time But I do think that the markets, including the stock market, are poised for what they expect to be lower future funds rates; and as Don pointed out I think, they are expecting to see that some time during the intermeeting period We could easily cause the markets to back off If the data come out suggesting that that's the appropriate policy, that's okay But I think the stock market and the bond market would be somewhat vulnerable if those expectations are frustrated with no change in the trend in the daily [unintelligible]  So, my concern is that the economy is still gradually winding down and that that requires an asymmetry There are some slight downside risks and we need to be prepared to be flexible during the intermeeting period, in my opinion, to lean toward an easier policy By all means I want to stress that I don't think we should be aggressive in that I think we are not running a neutral policy now, but a relatively tight policy, and that's still going to have lagged effects on the economy I would like to get us to a neutral position, one where we're not stimulative but we're certainly not restraining the economy at these levels What we see now looks very good, but I think the trend is still headed down So, my preference is asymmetry; but if the consensus is for symmetry I certainly wouldn't vote against that   Yes, I'd like to hear the language one more time   No, the progress toward--   Yes, I know I wanted to hear it just one more time   Okay "
622,1989-10-03," Sam, there were a couple of things that I thought didn't come through quite clearly in your report First of all, the G-7 Communique said it looked like the dollar was out of line with existing fundamentals I certainly disagree with that, but I guess one could debate that point But what the Communique also said, specifically in follow-up language, was that the G-7 would consider it counterproductive if the dollar rose above current levels or fell sharply In terms of exchange rate strategy, my understanding was that there was certainly no implication in there about a concerted attack on the dollar You mentioned that the strategy was generally to resist upward pressure, but there were times repeatedly when there was a concerted effort to drive the dollar lower and then, as it ratcheted down, to hammer it when it even started to show any upward pressure from lower levels So, I think it's a bit of a semantic issue to talk about resisting upward pressure when in fact it was a clear strategy to ratchet down the dollar Even though there were not massive levels of dollars sold, that kind of strategy--especially when we've never participated in Far Eastern markets on a regular basis--in my opinion was just grossly destabilizing I thought it was a scary event, and I can't see us condoning that sort of a strategy I think it's potentially very, very dangerous    10/3/89   Well, let me ask a question Is there any kind of technical agreement within the G-7 on a targeted band on exchange rates now? I'm certainly not aware of any And if there is, what is it specifically?   There is no quantitative understanding about ranges?   Well then, how did you know where you were going?   What was your objective?   But where?   Just put yourself in the position of somebody in the market If the market concluded that what the Communique meant was that the G-7 wanted a lower dollar, that is [not the same as] resisting [a rise] from current levels So they're trying to figure out where the fundamentals are; what is the target that goes along with the fundamentals? It sounds like even we don't know There is not even an understanding about where the dollar ought to be   Well, since there was no notion on where the dollar should be but there was a commitment of dollars, what would have happened if the dollar had collapsed and yet you'd only spent a third of your commitment?   You would just keep spending it?   But where do you stop?   Well, if that's the case, I think it's even more dangerous than I thought it was when I first started this conversation We spent $400 million and we intervened five times in the market yesterday with the dollar down to around 139 for the yen and 187 on the D-mark, and yet we don't know where we're going   Well, up a fraction   Hearing this description, I think there's a risk that risk premiums are going to continue to grow With as much uncertainty as there is in here, you can imagine the uncertainty that might be out in the market if we can't even figure out what's going on   Well, I realize there is a resistance to a lot of the [intervention] strategy here [among Committee members], but I think we ought to step up that resistance   The market thinks so   I don't say that I recognize that there are imbalances The question is whether they can be financed or not; nobody knows The market is deciding they can and we are trying to second guess the world economy--   But why should central banks be participating in this exercise? First of all, we've been making statements about price stability now to the point where I think we have almost been a ""johnny-one-note"" on that issue And people, I think, are starting to believe us For us to be countering that with this ridiculous approach just doesn't make sense; [it introduces] a potential doubt out there If central banks continue to participate in this kind of strategy and show even a compromise on it, I think to some extent the markets are going to say this is a joke--in fact, they are balancing the goals of the current account versus price stability Now, my position is well known in wanting to go gradually on this goal; but I sure don't have any current account goals ahead of our goals on price stability And I think we'd be announcing to the world that we are at least equally concerned about bringing the international current account into balance as we are about conditions of domestic inflation   But that is the question   Let me say, Bob, that if that's the case, I think we're going through a silly exercise in approving limits What's the FOMC meeting on this issue for? Why do we even care about it? Let's just turn over open market operations on foreign exchange to the Treasury What are we going through this silly exercise for if we don't have something to say about it?   But it is just--   Well, we have an account in which we acquire exchange reserves and we are supposed to have authority over that account As Bob Black said, we certainly we have a responsibility to serve as agent for the Treasury in their actions on foreign exchange And the last thing I would want to do is question that authority We can certainly do what they instruct us to do on their account; I would    10/3/89  never resist that But acquiring exchange reserves on our account when we are totally opposed to the direction of policy that takes implicates us in the policy, I think Now, I'm not for confrontation either As a matter of fact, I consider myself to have been simmering a long time on this issue because I've generally been approving these things all along both at the Subcommittee level and at the higher FOMC level I have never felt that dealing with disorderly conditions or resisting pressures in one direction or another was something worth fighting over It was worth cooperating and maintaining this whole atmosphere of coordination and cooperation But when I perceive that we're getting to a point where we are literally taking risks and we are moving in a direction counter to our whole philosophy, it seems to me that we've got to stand up and be counted here This whole thing runs the risk of implicating us in something when we are out there saying we are standing for price stability Now, I think we can have a debate here about how fast we want to go toward that goal; but it's going to take even longer if we participate in these kinds of activities And I just think that at some point we have to give a clear message on what our point of view is on this Continuing to acquire exchange reserves and exposure on our own account is really risky, especially given what I know about people over there running things at the Treasury I don't think it's Nick Brady myself I think you have a green-eyeshade person in David Mulford over there who doesn't know what he's doing And I think it's very risky to turn over policy to somebody like that I think Secretary Brady is capable of being brought around on this issue and maybe that's where [we should go]; I know the Chairman has been effective in talking to him before I wouldn't be making these points if I wasn't worried I think this strategy that we are pursuing is very risky and it makes us look bad   What do we do if this continues?    10/3/89   But what if they don't? If they don't, what are you going to do?   I agree with that, but I can't buy the scenario in which that's going to happen in a credible way Is the Treasury going to go to the Congress and say that somehow we are acting against the national interest of the country?   But how is that going to work, Ted?   I'm just asking How is that going to be an effective argument?   Well, as I said, I think confrontation has its risks too You have two scenarios one is that we confront the markets and we can say interest rates are going to be higher than what we forecast because the Fed is going to confront the Treasury And they are going to resist with interest rates any attempt that the  -10-    10/3/89  Treasury makes on the dollar Now, I'm sure that that would throw some heat into the markets   But it certainly would [give] comfort on the price side   I don't understand Look, the markets have a right to be concerned if the Treasury and the Fed can't coordinate policy That's what it's all about here   I don't disagree with that   But I do think there is a risk for us that we're going to be implicated in talking out of one side of our mouth about price stability goals and yet agreeing to constantly flooding the market with dollars trying to get the dollar below where the fundamentals are taking it with relative interest rates Now, you can argue about relative real interest rates--   You can still get there with Treasury pursuing what they have been pursuing, but at much higher interest rates--   --and much lower growth, and even a recession Maybe that is what we will pursue   They can go on forever, Roger, when we keep warehousing their currency   That's good  -13-    10/3/89   What about the Canadians? They are not happy about it either, are they?   Well, as a matter of fact, I am going to be out of town I'm going to be hiding out   Yes, that's what I mean  -14-    10/3/89   Sure, but--   And all I'm saying, Jerry, is that I don't know; I don't think anybody knows It's a debatable issue But to try and say beforehand that the dollar has to be at some level that some committee decides--   But it's not; it's the same  -15-    10/3/89   A committee is a group of people   Well, since I dissented [before] I don't know how I could-- How do I vote in favor of previous transactions?   I think Sam has done his job very well   Okay   Yes It was very good in mechanics, but--   All right Well, I certainly want to make sure that that is the way it's written and the way it's understood   What does the sentence say again--in terms of what we're voting for?   Well, how about the manner in which you conducted the transactions? Really, that's a different statement   Yes, but I voted against that   But I abstained on the warehousing [vote] as well   I'm still trying to understand what this is all about   Okay, is that the way it reads?   As long as that's the way it reads, I agree that there is no problem   Okay   So move   I think we ought to [respond] as the FOMC   Plus, it seems to me that there has always been a [unintelligible] definitions which has to be addressed as well You could probably go around this table and find half a dozen different views about what price stability is I know I have one   How about Bill [unintelligible] might testify? He had-- "
623,1989-10-03," You mentioned that you expect some stimulus to the housing market but you are forecasting weakness in investment Earlier, in previous FOMC meetings, you had said that declines in long-term interest rates stimulated investment in the housing market Yet this hasn't seemed to occur How long do you expect the lags to be after a decline in long-term interest rates before you see something in the investment in housing? You mentioned that the level of houses for sale was revised up But I don't see any pickup in housing And nondefense capital goods orders, excluding aircraft, seem to be at a lower level in the third quarter than the second quarter I just see nothing out there that points to a pickup in capital spending and yet we have had this decline in interest rates   Okay, I agree with that, I think But what you're saying, though, is that this decline in long-term interest rates hasn't had a stimulative effect on this   I want to follow up on one last thing that I was talking about yesterday in the Board room when we were discussing [unintelligible] and I still want to try to understand this You indicated then at the beginning of your presentation the need for some slack to get inflation down further in the economy But I'm still trying to understand conceptually how that works to some degree If monetary policy maintains nominal demand at potential output or at the full employment unemployment rate--say it maintained nominal demand consistent with potential output growth--is the need for slack because of the rigidities in the system? Does the adjustment process cause you to get more inflation mix than a real mix temporarily?   Okay I want to understand what you're saying, though Is it that even if we bring nominal demand in line with potential output, that actual output has to slow for a while relative to potential because of the contracts [and other] rigidities in the system? Okay, that's the--   Yes, well I can't either But I'm still trying to get--   Everybody understands that we have nominal demand that is greater than that; that's why we have 4 or 5 percent inflation in the market But if you were to work nominal demand down  -21-    10/3/89  gradually in line with potential output and you maintained it there, I guess I would have a little trouble understanding why you would necessarily have any inflationary experience   As I say, if you were to lower nominal demand-- just lower it, even if it's currently above potential output--why doesn't that lead to some slowing in the inflation rate even though the real economy might be slowing but still not performing relative to potential?   Well, I think the historical record does show that if you reduce nominal demand there is a mixed effect--that you get a little of both   The more flexible the markets are, the better the mix   I'm just saying that, given all that, it's still not clear to me why the economy can't grow around its potential rate while you're restraining demand even though the mix does [unintelligible] I think that's a central debate   I don't disagree   On the real economy, growth seems to be continuing at a fairly modest rate as compared to what looked like a slippage earlier So, as far as the economy's performance, there is some inertia there that is satisfying, I think I don't see it much different than the Greenbook has in terms of the pattern that may be developing Did you say, Mike, that manufacturing inventories were coming out this morning?   As opposed to a stronger--   And that is a good sign  -31-    10/3/89   Well, that's a good sign in that the bulge in inventories in July did not carry forward   Right, but there was some uptick even ex autos, if I remember, before July   Yes In spite of all that, I still see it like the Greenbook forecast--some winding down in the economy I don't see any signs of acceleration, taking all the regions on balance; I still see some gradual slowing going on So, I perceive a little more downside risk than upside risk But I want to associate myself with Gary Stern and others who earlier indicated a little optimism on the inflation front--that inflation seems to be looking better and it seems to go beyond just the food and energy components But as even Mike Prell said, a lot of the ex food and energy improvement seems to be associated with the dollar, to some extent I'd be quite alarmed if we continue to contaminate the environment we have for improvement with a drop in the dollar I'm not saying we ought to be targeting the dollar, but given the fact that we are at high capacity levels, we don't have a lot of fudge room there unless the economy were to slow further and we could absorb some decline in the dollar So, that is a big, big worry And even though I think the risks are still toward the down side, the current environment is not very promising for any flexibility on policy   I wish I had said all that That's good "
624,1989-10-03," Yes, I'd like to associate myself with that view I'm not sure I'd explain it the same way My major concern right now--even though I think there is a downside risk and we ought to be prepared to use our flexibility to ease at some point--is that the atmosphere is not right I think there are still some questions going forward and we ought to wait and look My major reservation at this point is what is going on with the dollar and the fact that any attempt to ease now, even if we thought it was the right thing to do, would have great risks because the perception [would be] that our goals were associated more with some dollar level than our view about inflationary risks And I really don't want our policy tied in with that So, I prefer to maintain our flexibility going forward "
680,1989-11-14," But a year ago, Sam, their producer prices were running minus 5 to 10 percent; now they're running plus 3 or 4 percent   Did that improve? "
681,1989-11-14," I graciously point out that your forecast was accurate, but under a different interest rate scenario And since I ask this every time, to the extent that I follow them What reasons would you give as to why the forecast will stay on course with a much different interest rate path? What would you say are the major factors?   By rising rates do you mean the funds rate?   But long rates didn't rise, really; they bounced around a little but they generally trended down, I think   Yes So, it was the dollar mainly And what was the other one?   That's what I thought   One other point I'd like to raise is about profits Corporate profits, of course, have been reported as weak I was wondering How closely does the profits picture compare this time to, say, 1984--I don't know if you have this at your fingertips--when I remember we had a similar sort of picture developing in that we had a weakening situation occurring in manufacturing, and I think profits were weaker in that same period; a similar type of squeeze occurred The funds rate had been raised up until mid-1984, or something like that, and then eased off   So you'd characterize this as a much weaker profit situation?    11/14/89   Well, some of the things I wanted to say have been said But I'll say a couple of things I made that point about the forecast because a couple of things still trouble me about it even though I think the Greenbook forecast has been on track pretty well In terms of the overall [picture] I don't think it's just the dollar that's the difference; if that were true, I think you'd expect to see most of the weakness in the exchange rate sensitive sectors In fact, even though interest rates have been much lower than the scenario that we've been forecasting, interest sensitive sectors of the economy are the ones that are quite weak Housing is down; automobiles are weak Generally, the domestic interest sensitive sectors are part of the weak sectors in the economy So I don't think it's just the fact that the dollar is strong; as a matter of fact if the dollar was that strong you'd expect more import demand than we're seeing as well, with the interest rates as low, and we're not seeing that either So I think real interest rates at least are high enough to be causing a general slowing and that is feeding through to the inflation rate I know it's not dramatic progress, but if you look at the core inflation rate changes, the CPI excluding food and energy was 47 percent in 1988 and it's running about 4 percent this year The PPI ex-food and energy was about 48 percent last year and it's running about 4-1/2 percent so far this year Intermediate prices ex-food and energy were 72 percent last year and are down to 17 percent so far Crude materials are about the same Those are all positives I think the question is really how much risk we want to take It's true that labor costs have not done as well as some of the improvement on the overall inflation rate Labor costs seem to be running at about the same pace as last year When I look at total compensation in nonfarm business or in the whole private sector area, that is running close to what it was last year both in the goods producing and the services components But that's what's causing the profit squeeze and, as was pointed out, profits are falling significantly And I think that's part of the process that has to work to hold the line on prices and actually get the benefit on inflation that we want Again, I think the key question is really how much risk we want to take and what kind of timing we want for the improvement We could get it all at once, but I'm not sure that's a risk we really want to take   I was just quoting the numbers ex-food and energy If you look at the totals it's not quite as clear "
682,1989-11-14," I agree with the Chairman's proposal for ""B"" with asymmetric language I think that's really where we are The risk is clearly on the down side and I don't mean just on the real economy If I didn't personally think that we weren't going to make better progress than the Greenbook has indicated on inflation, I wouldn't want to tilt that way As the Chairman said, we're at the stage where we have to be very cautious and not risk tipping the economy into a major recession because I don't believe the general public is going to understand our causing a major disruption to get a percentage point or two out of the inflation rate when we're already around the 4 percent range So, I'm a gradualist in that sense and I wear that band pretty proudly I think we ought to be very careful and try to make gains in a sensible way I don't think we have much more easing to do; I agree with Governor Angell on that point What we're seeing in the economy now is the result of policy months ago and I think we're getting closer to where we ultimately want to be Clearly, when the funds rate got down close to 6 percent in late '86 or early '87 it was too low I think a lot of us thought oil prices were going to stay down better than they did So I don't think we want to return to those types of interest rates But at 8-1/2 percent on the funds rate we've still got a ways to go; and the markets are certainly anticipating that we have a ways to go, but not a lot though And I think that's the point The longer we wait, if the economy deteriorates on us, the more we're going to have to move And that's something we ought to try to avoid [We ought to be] seeking out where we ultimately want to be, getting there early enough, and then letting the lags work their way through I think we're close to that stage but we ought to be positioned to make another modest move because I don't think there is any upside risk to that I think that's where we should be "
740,1990-03-27," Second  SPEAKER(?) It's too early to tell!   Jerry, don't we have a legal authority to set terms and conditions for primary dealer status when they do business with the Fed?   So, if they don't want to be part of that club, they don't have to   So it's not like we have regulatory authority; they don't have to be a primary dealer and buy and sell securities with the Fed    3/27/90   Is there any legal issue about the terms and conditions we might set for a dealer to do business with us? Legally, could we say we don't like the rest of your business and we're not going to do business with you?   I don't know if we ever have I'm just saying, as Peter pointed out, that as far as our business relationship with the dealer goes, I think we could probably set any conditions we wanted to   But of course they don't have to do the business   I was just looking at those credit data yesterday What's interesting is that everybody talks about the contraction going on in real estate financing, but in fact from what the data show that hasn't slowed down at all It's really just the business credit that is slowing down, which is quite disturbing That is the source of the credit slowdown; it's not in the real estate area   Until they're all drawn?   I think I was looking at both, but it was the total that I was talking about   I know I looked at both of them But I was thinking of the most aggregate numbers If I remember, those numbers    3/27/90  were still clicking along at 15 to 25 percent annualized growth and it was business credit that was really slowing down   Right What's real estate doing there?   Yes, I was wrong; it's about 10 to 12 percent annualized   Yes, it could be That doesn't show any sign of deceleration, to me at least There is that weak January relative to trend but February is as strong as ever in there   Okay   Yes   [Unintelligible] the current account deficits will make it work the other way? [Unintelligible] selling dollars with a large current account deficit   I think in fact it can complicate the sterilization process Technically, we can definitely do it, but we already have found that we had some collateral pressures Now, I know we could suspend that and reinterpret our collateral, but that complicates the process Also, in my opinion, at times it can create a significant amount of uncertainty about policy in the open market because if the market doesn't know the degree to which we have undertaken exchange rate intervention then it can confuse the market's understanding of what the reserve need is on any given day That can add volatility in the market and it can confuse the market at least in the very short run   Yes, absolutely; because it comes out eventually in the reports But I think it could have a substantive effect if we ran into serious collateral problems If we try to change our definition of collateral and expand what we consider collateral, we could open up a whole Pandora's box of questions about the substance of our policy   Well, I'm saying we still have to change it [even if] it was self-imposed   You could raise a lot of questions about that   I couldn't agree more All I'm saying is that it can complicate the sterilization process Tentatively, that's true  -50-    3/27/90   It could quickly become an issue if it looked as if we were bailing out the currencies of other countries   Mr Chairman, that raises a very important point along the lines of what Ed Boehne was talking about initially It seems that there ought to be some understanding in the Committee about where we cross over the line from just providing intervention to resist disorderly conditions and at what point we decide that it has gotten out of control and the fundamentals are really working against us It seems to me that if we accumulate $20 billion in foreign exchange reserves over a relatively short period of time, that's a signal that we've crossed over the line   I guess the question is What do we do, if they keep doing this? We have $20 billion of a $45 billion total What if they keep wanting to sell dollars?   Okay   Well, that may be true as an empirical matter; but the potential is certainly there for it to create mysterious volatility problems, especially if we're intervening in large amounts I concede that empirically that may not have been the case so far, but potentially it clearly could be And that's something we should take into account But I think we ought to go back to what Bob Parry was saying I wouldn't worry so much about this whole thing if I thought it was totally ineffective I think generally sterilized intervention is grossly ineffective But there are times--and I think even this research shows that--when it can be effective at least in the short to intermediate term The time that it is effective, at least temporarily if not even into the intermediate term, is when there is concerted multilateral intervention, which basically gives a signal to the market that there's a coordinated effort by all the major industrial countries to achieve some exchange rate level Now, whether they ultimately achieve it or not, it creates in my opinion potential turmoil in the market in the short to intermediate term And it can even change the psychology of the fundamentals in my opinion   Well, I can cite you an example that I have cited before You can argue both sides of that I think there have been times when we have been effective playing the game and there have been times when we have been totally ineffective A good example is from my experience when I was at the Treasury I have mentioned this to Ted and others before When I was at the Treasury, Beryl Sprinkel was Undersecretary and there was a policy of non-intervention Yes, there was some modest intervention at times when the Treasury decided that it was useful, but only when they decided it was useful The Fed's views during the whole period were completely shut out From my experience, I don't remember any cooperation or any plea by the Fed during that period having any effect whatsoever   Yes   Sure What I'm saying, though, is that you probably could cite other times in the past where playing the game has not gotten us anywhere And there are times where you have to draw  -53-    3/27/90  the line and say you're going to make a stand I would completely agree that playing the game up to a point is a practical thing to do The question is What are the guidelines as to where we draw the line and when we decide to make a stand?  SPEAKER(?) Can you know a priori?   I think we can have some guidelines to say in general what kind of intervention we find acceptable No, I wouldn't tie anyone's hands It ought to come to this table and there ought to be a discussion once we cross over some threshold we consider to be outside the frontier of what we thought was reasonable We ought to decide it, though   Well, I'll be honest My view is that we've had considerable influence standing firm The fear at the Treasury of the Fed pulling out of this process in my opinion has been as strong a disciplinary force as anything else   Well, there are several things we can do I'm not saying I would prescribe these, but we have a lot of tools One is that we don't approve any further intervention limits or intervene on our account We say, okay, Treasury, you have independent authority to intervene as a matter of Treasury policy and you can do it for your account But the other point is that we also have the authority to approve their warehousing of foreign currencies Now, they can warehouse, as the Chairman says, in other places possibly I'm not sure where   Other central banks?   But I can't conceive of the BIS doing that   But the point is there are tools First of all, we don't have to do it for our account and that becomes clear to the market We don't have to warehouse their foreign exchange reserves Those are basically the disciplinary tools we have And I think before the Treasury would risk confronting that, they would listen to us But we've got to be willing to use those tools or we're not going to get them to listen The Chairman has been very effective in my opinion in getting them to listen at times, but I think you would concede that they have been pretty stubborn    3/27/90   Messrs Mulford and Sprinkel fall in the same category   But I feel that it was the fear of our pulling out of the process that scared them more than anything else   But then I think it would become clear to the market if we got to that point If I were a market participant and I were sitting out there seeing the Federal Reserve talking about price stability and yet selling massive amounts of dollars, I think eventually I'd decide that was a joke as a policy It seems to me that our policies have to be reasonably complementary and that we have to make some stand ultimately if the amount gets beyond the point of reason I'm not saying that within a range we should not participate and act in a practical way on disorderly markets, as Ed Boehne said But what do you do when you build up $50-$60 billion of foreign exchange reserves?   The Bundesbank would be happy   No, I agree with you   But, Jerry, there is still the question Say that that was the trend, that the dollar was rising toward 200--  -59-    3/27/90   Let me pose this question to you Look, I don't disagree with that, but I think the question is What are we in for? Let's say that the yen was weak for whatever reason--I could name half a dozen reasons why the Japanese may have continuing problems--and the dollar does continue to strengthen against the yen It could turn around tomorrow But say it [weakens] and we already have $8 billion of yen reserves   All I'm saying is that the Chairman should be able to go into a meeting like that with some demonstration to the Treasury and the G-7 of where we [unintelligible] acceptable path   I still want to finish this example just as an illustration of what we might be faced with Let's just assume that the yen continues to weaken against the dollar and we already have $8 billion or more of yen reserves And let's just say that the reasons  -60-    3/27/90  the yen is weak are internal to the Japanese market they're not confronting inflationary pressures; they have a weak government, without much credibility; their stock market is overvalued I could name off a few others Let's just say they have all those problems and yet they don't want to confront those problems They want us to help them on the foreign exchange markets What do we say if, let's say, the Treasury wants to go along with that?   All right, you've answered that But what if the G-7 wants a multilateral concerted effort to drive the dollar to lower levels?   You've answered my questions There's where you draw the lines   You're talking about monetary policy cards, though   The historical work shows that it wasn't until 1962 that we even got involved in intervention   Why do they want us in?   No That's what scares me   It's one thing to hold that view, which I think is an acceptable view in terms of the theory, but it's another thing to try and force it to happen with exchange rate intervention If you believe in theory that it's going to happen, not--   But if you believe that that equilibrium adjustment has to take place, you wouldn't believe that intervention can change that   I agree that there are But reconcile for me this notion of the belief that the current account deficit requires some equilibrium adjustment and that intervention matters   Okay   But I'm saying If you believe it's got to happen why would you intervene? Why don't--   Maybe I'm missing something Is there some simple mathematics on the size of the debt that you're talking about?   But, Ted, I still want my question answered about why the Treasury wants us involved   Well, but that's the question Why do they want us involved?   But that just tells me that that's the reason we should be worried They want us involved because they want us to be partners in this crime   Protect the gold stock   May I ask one question, though?  -69-    3/27/90  [CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN] Sure   I would feel a lot more comfortable with that proposal if it had one extra provision, which would be related to what Jerry was saying about where we draw the [line] What do we say if there were an effort for concerted intervention to put the dollar at lower levels? I'm not saying that would happen, but what do we say?   Okay I'm for it   Well, I agree   We could win that Exactly   But I can tell you we'll have hearings There were hearings over this G-7 exercise last September when the foreign exchange reserves had built up after that I had to testify right after David Mulford and Mulford was roasted in both houses of Congress over that very issue So I can tell you on the political front, the Chairman is right Taking the position of [not] debauching our currency is something that we can win every time   Mr Chairman, may I just ask Ted Truman a technical question on warehousing?   In the past has there normally been some sort of maturity associated with a warehousing instrument, similar to a swap agreement?   I was just asking what the history was   How far would the $25 billion put us over, Peter?   By when would you say?   The thought of holding Argentine australs as collateral against the dollar--well, who can say? Eventually, one day it might be--   But who knows in 10 years   It's the most important part of-- "
741,1990-03-27," I just want to follow up on some of the comments on the international side First of all, responding to what Bob Parry said, I agree that the trade-weighted dollar is still--I don't know if it's down but it may be down slightly It depends on what point you're talking about but--   From when?   Okay You're right; one can play those base games But what struck me was the trade-weighted dollar going back to the end of this huge swing in the dollar When I pull out that chart and look at the long-term trend in the dollar in the last three years, since 1987, it looks like noise It just looks like little fluctuations around a flat or maybe gradually upward drifting pattern Pull out a long-term chart of the trade-weighted dollar sometime and you'll be struck by what you see; in the last three years it looks like just a little fluctuation And it looks a little soft, too I can't believe that anything can result from those kinds of fluctuations one way or the other But going forward, I think there is a shift, at least in the atmosphere, along the lines of what Ted Truman indicated At least it seems so to me But what that tells me--and I'd like a response on this--is that there is a trend of upward pressure on the dollar, and maybe it won't materialize, for the following reasons But as you said, Ted, there's serious doubt now about the deutschemark being the anchor for the EMS They seem to be willing to accommodate the unification in Germany at the expense of some inflation I don't know how much, but the fact that they haven't moved rates relative to expectations already is raising some serious  -15-    3/27/90  doubts And the DM has even weakened; the dollar was at 164 and now it's around 171 from the low point If you look at the Japanese situation, obviously, there's a lot of turmoil going on There are a lot of expected inflationary pressures, financial market problems, governmental weakness--all those kinds of things When I look at that setting, it's really hard for me to see the trade-weighted dollar depreciating in that scenario Even if rates rise there, as you pointed out yourself, there's a good chance that those will be nominal rate moves that aren't even keeping up with inflationary pressures And we've already seen that nominal rate differentials have narrowed dramatically against the dollar and the dollar hasn't weakened There has been a rise recently in the trade-weighted dollar, but that's mainly because of the DM The fact is that the dollar has come down against the DM over the period [since] last fall, but other EMS currencies have been tied into that to some extent Looking forward, as long as we maintain our anti-inflationary policies, I can't see anything but upward pressure on the dollar Explain to me how the dollar is going to depreciate in this environment   Yes, but I would argue that that effect has already taken place That's why the dollar is down about 15 percent or so against the DM, from 19 to 17 But going forward, if they're going to have an inflationary experience out of this, then--   I can see it's definitely uncertain I would say that's one plausible scenario; what seems to me equally plausible is that the dollar becomes strong from this point on   I certainly agree with that in the short run   Just trying to create a little noise   One last point, just following up on what I think Governor Angell was suggesting--I'm not sure if it's in the [vein] of stirring things up again--on what might be the way to go about this since everybody, I think, is frustrated with the price numbers they keep seeing in your scenario Why not take an improved price scenario and tell us what kind of interest rates and economic performance go with it? And then let us make a decision about whether that's an acceptable risk or not  -19-    3/27/90   [Unintelligible] that people want to see some improvement in this period of '90, '91, and '92 and they don't see it And the fact is that they want to know what the cost is of achieving it They basically are saying ""Look, this is what goes with no progress What goes with the progress?""   I agree with that, but the problem is--   I'll comment Actually, I've been impressed too that the economy hasn't shown signs of slowing to the degree that people had forecast earlier It's still a little hard for me to tell at this stage how much of that can be attributed to our luck with the weather and how much is really a pickup after smoothing through those kinds of seasonal--unseasonal I should say--developments Nevertheless, when you do smooth through it, you still have a picture that looks like sustained growth at a lower rate that doesn't look particularly scary  I also hear these stories--as a matter of fact, I'm bombarded by such stories--of a credit crunch I have hosted at least three or four different state bankers associations here over the last couple of weeks and have been besieged by people saying that that is going on But it's very hard to find evidence in the data that that is in fact the case You hear a lot of anecdotes about it and that's what they bring to the table, but you don't see any kind of general credit crunch going on I agree with others that there is clearly a commercial real estate overhang It's all over the country; a contraction is going on there I'm sure because of the S&Ls that there is a lack of availability of credit from the S&L industry to developers; you hear that everywhere But actually, that's healthy; that's not something to be afraid of That consolidation really has to take place There still may be something in the pipeline on this credit crunch; it's just not obvious in any data that we see Our quality spreads surely don't show it on interest rates In fact, you would expect, if there were some sort of pullback in banks' willingness to lend, to see upward pressure on bank rates If demand were still there and the supply was being restricted, why wouldn't short-term market rates come under upward pressure? It certainly doesn't look like there's any dramatic upward pressure relative to the funds rate On the other hand, you don't see a tendency for demand to be that weak either because you don't see these short-term rates falling against the funds rate either Things actually look fairly stable around the short end and quality spreads actually look very good--unless you're trying to find some junk bonds that aren't quoted in the market Compare those to AAA corporates and I'm sure they don't look good  So, I think the economy is doing okay, at least in the period that we can see ahead I don't have any disagreement with the Greenbook; I think it's about right, although I wouldn't want to project anything beyond six or eight months from now just because it's  -33-    3/27/90  too uncertain On the inflation front, as I said, it's a little disappointing that there hasn't been more progress, although I do attribute most of the short-run pressure that we have had to seasonal developments I think the effect that the cold weather had on food and energy costs in the December period is the primary factor on the total CPI and PPI numbers If you actually look at the producer price index excluding food and energy, you do see some progress In fact, the 12-month rate for the PPI excluding energy is now down to 37 percent, which is better than previous 12-month rates in the PPI What is disappointing is the consumer price index, which doesn't show any signs of easing off; even excluding the food and energy components that still seems to be strong As a matter of fact the [increases for the] last two months, at 6 and 7 percent, are very troubling You can always find some special factor like apparel or something else that has had a major impact, but there's always something I can live with separating out the food and energy components because those are volatile elements that are somewhat beyond our control in the shorter run But as for these other factors, you have to draw the line somewhere The fact is that the CPI doesn't look all that good It makes me wonder, though, since the PPI seems to be improving, if there is just a lag before it eventually shows up in the CPI; I don't know  The economy looks stable, although there's this atmosphere of concern about debt, a credit crunch, and things like that But international events are developing, it seems to me, in a positive way You can question how slowly or how fast [the changes in] Europe will develop, but unless the political climate changes dramatically-- say, the Soviet Union gets tremendously tougher--in the longer run and maybe in the most immediate short run, that has to be positive I don't know But I'm convinced that East Germany is going to boom because West Germany is going to make it boom; they're going to throw money at it So I think that is a positive in terms of external sources of economic pressure Japan doesn't seem to be weak from a productivity point of view and I think their major problems are that they have been pushing the edge of capacity constraints and they have had a speculative bubble and all that is sort of fermenting over there along with the weak government But I don't see external evidence of sources of depression coming from outside of the United States So that should be positive And the inflation picture seems to me to be somewhat stable but not improving I don't know what that says for the immediate term for policy, but I think it does say that if we want to make progress in the upcoming period, we're going to have to have a tough look at that "
742,1990-03-27," Today?   Yes; that's why I was curious   Well, my preference was for something along the lines of ""B"" asymmetric for some of the same reasons that already have been mentioned by Roger Guffey and others But I can certainly go along with the Chairman's suggestion for symmetry I don't feel that strongly; I have a mild preference for asymmetry There are a couple of things on my mind along the lines of what Lee said If we didn't have to worry [unintelligible] quite so much, then I think it would be a great opportunity to gain some credibility by shocking the foreign exchange markets But in fact, I can see a lot of difficulties with that; I can see that that would be a difficult problem that we need to be more sensitive to Along with what Don Kohn said earlier, I interpret what has happened to long-term rates as mostly real rate  -44-    3/27/90  pressures from some pickup in the economy, although in my opinion it could be because of some of the events that have taken place worldwide and not just domestically It could be improvement in potential output and something like an increase in the net real return on capital And if that is the case, the current funds rate would be a relative easing of policy Although if it's an increase in potential, that wouldn't necessarily create a long-run inflationary problem But it's impossible to sort all that out It's just theoretical reasoning We have to look for the data as they come in I wish we did have a political setting in which to enjoy the advantage of having a strengthening dollar here and be able to get more bang per buck at this stage with some firmness But I agree that it's not in the cards We do live in a political economy, not a simple abstract situation So, I can go along with ""B"" symmetric "
800,1990-05-15, Second 
801,1990-05-15," Did the recent numbers change your outlook any? I gather that you put a lot of this together before the most recent numbers   The other question was on the budget You implied that strong action on the budget would restrict the economy Is that assuming that what goes with it is a drop in real interest rates? I just wonder Wouldn't that be a source of stimulus to some degree too? How are you coming to this restraint view?   Could this trend also be in addition to the improved efficiency? That would be a good sign on the inflation expectations side It could imply that the real cost to carry is pretty high and that there's no speculative inventory built in That would be consistent with--   Actually, I feel a little better today about the inflationary risks than I did maybe a couple of weeks ago, with some of these more recent data But once again, you can't tell much from one or two months of numbers I still am generally concerned about the outlook, but these recent numbers cloud it up a bit Consumption has been fairly modest, but the first-quarter real GNP number looked stronger than I would have expected We see investment plans running at 7-1/2 percent, which is pretty strong; I don't know if that will actually materialize, but the plans are running fairly strong My concern is that with inventories fairly low--and I realize  -23-    5/15/90  that there are incentives to keep them that way--demand seems to be sufficient both on the investment side and the consumption side that the economy is poised to pick up if demand pressures develop And my concern is that they might develop from external sources I didn't hear too many people that concerned about export demand, but having just been overseas and having talked to people there I still have some concern about that I feel more comfortable that the Bundesbank is going to deal with the inflation risk in Germany Still, we see rates coming down in France and other European countries; and in fact, even though I think East Germany and other east European countries are going to be facing recessionary-type conditions, I think all their consumption is going to turn to the West Even if it's lower than in the past, they're going to be buying goods The outlook for the Soviet Union is grim because I don't think they're going to be able to sell anything They may be able to barter a few things and they will be able to sell energy and some of their raw materials, but nobody is going to buy any consumer goods from the Soviet Union All industrial countries are strained in terms of their productive capacity Japan is still growing strongly in spite of their financial shake-out And Europe continues to show signs of strength So, I'm fairly optimistic about our export prospects and the improvement in our external position But I do worry about what kind of pressure that's going to put on the inflationary situation going forward So, I do think there are some risks Some of the financial indicators suggest it Even though long-term interest rates have come down more recently--almost a half percentage point from where they were--they are still up over the intermeeting period And as Governor Angell pointed out, commodity prices have been under some upward pressure They look a little milder now, depending on which index you look at, but still they are up What worries me the most is that the trade-weighted dollar is turning down Even though the dollar had shown strength against the yen, a lot of that has changed recently As someone reported, the trade-weighted dollar is down 14 percent from its peak last year If that kind of trend continues, we may be faced with some pretty significant external strength, and I don't know how much room we have for that So, that's a worry  I'm not as concerned about the credit crunch issue; I have heard a lot of anecdotes and I think it is a potential risk, but just listening to what people have said around here it seems like some of that is [unintelligible] The aggregates have turned weaker, but I would argue that that has to do with some portfolio shifts that have occurred with the change in interest rates more recently, and I think that will subside and we will see a return to more significant growth So, I think we have to be very watchful and cautious I think the risks are on the inflation side, but given the more recent data I don't know if it's worth pressing immediately "
802,1990-05-15," My preference is for ""B"" asymmetric But I certainly wouldn't make a big deal over that, given your preference for statements in the policy record showing our concerns It's splitting hairs to make that point However, like Dick Syron, I'm a little worried that if over the intermeeting period we get a few stronger numbers, our credibility could slip rapidly I was very concerned for a few weeks before this meeting that we were right on the edge of totally losing our credibility when we got the CPI and purchasing managers' survey results; all the data were coming in strong Of course, the more recent numbers have to some extent bailed us out Maybe that's an indication that there was an illusion in the data Still, even if we go for symmetric with a slightly stronger record of our concerns, we should be prepared--if these numbers slip in the intermeeting period--to be able to swing all the way to an intermeeting move I think we're in a situation where if, say, the credit crunch concerns start to dissipate and all of a sudden we get one or two strong numbers, we may not make it to the next meeting with our credibility intact We ought to be flexible enough to be able to react to that   I understand, and I agree   The facts  -31-    5/15/90   Sure   Sure, I understand That's why I'm saying I agree with what you're proposing "
3548,1998-11-17," I had a conversation with a fairly high-level staff person at the Bank  of Mexico They are still persuaded that it is useful for them to have this swap line They  believe that the market sees them in a different light from the other industrial central banks The  language that we are going to use, suggesting that the long period of disuse and the changed  character of international financial markets makes the swap lines no longer necessary, does not  apply to Mexico They would like this swap arrangement to continue "
3549,1998-11-17," As we stated in the Greenbook, our forecast this time for the external sector is not much changed from that in September We have chosen not to assume that the depreciation of the dollar during the intermeeting period will be significantly reversed As a consequence, our path for the dollar going forward is about 3 percent lower in the near term, and about 2 percent lower toward the end of the forecast period, than last time  Such a change in our outlook for the dollar by itself would tend to stimulate exports and restrain imports Offsetting this stimulus for exports to some extent is a somewhat weaker projection for real output growth in our trading partners  By far the biggest downward revision in our outlook for growth abroad has been to our view on Japan We now expect that the trough in real output will not occur until sometime in 2000 This more negative outcome is expected despite injections of fiscal stimulus of about 1-1/2 percent of GDP next year We are thus expecting continuing declines in private domestic demand, particularly business investment, with little or no help from the external sector Since the Greenbook was published, we have learned some additional detail about the latest fiscal package proposed by the Japanese    11/17/98  government The package contains 6 trillion yen of personal and corporate tax cuts, an estimated 6 trillion yen of ""real water"" expenditures, and an additional array of measures that are expected to provide little direct economic stimulus Accordingly, the actual stimulus contained in the package is probably not more than half the 24 trillion headline value and is broadly in line with the Japanese fiscal assumptions in the November Greenbook Given the lags in implementing these packages, we expect that the effects of these measures will be felt during the second half of 1999, as the effects from the April 1998 package, which we think are now becoming visible, begin to wane  The other country of particular interest in this forecast round is Brazil In putting together the forecast, our strategy has been to assume that the international rescue package for Brazil succeeds in the sense that no abrupt change in the exchange rate regime is forced upon Brazil, and no contagion in that respect spills over to Argentina or elsewhere Real GDP in Brazil is expected to decline this quarter and through 1999, but the trough is now projected to occur in early 2000, and some recovery begins that year This contraction results from the high interest rates already in place, which are projected to ease some, and the fiscal restraint that is part of the policy program Brazil has announced We have built into the forecast some contraction of output elsewhere in South America as well  There are many pitfalls in the months ahead that could put the Brazilian program off track In the near term, Brazil and its private creditors must reach an understanding such that most, but not necessarily all, of the short-term external credits to Brazil are maintained Domestic creditors also must refrain on net from moving capital out of Brazil The fiscal agenda must proceed; in particular, the Brazilian Congress must enact crucial proposed measures so that an IMF review planned for February 1999 will be successful We recognize that it is far from certain that all this will proceed smoothly In the Greenbook, it seemed to us more useful to present in the baseline the implications for the foreign sector under the assumption of ""success,"" as at the moment that outcome is being actively pursued by officials in Brazil and at the IMF We did include as an alternative scenario, a model-based version of the impact of ""meltdown"" in Brazil and contagion elsewhere in the region In that event, with no policy adjustments here, US GDP growth would be reduced 1/2 to 3/4 percentage point in 1999 and in 2000  On balance, we look for the external sector to subtract nearly 1 percentage point at an annual rate from US GDP growth this quarter and about half that in 1999 and 2000 This is a bit less than we had been thinking in September, particularly for the current quarter    11/17/98  We would now be happy to take questions   You might remember that the US economy is growing much more  strongly than many of these overseas economies, and that is supporting profits and growth of  M2 One might think that shipments to these countries have risen some but that they just have  not risen as much as demand for currency in the United States has risen That is not the  benchmark that would determine them   The standby encompasses different ways of financing the sum of  money involved A substantial portion of the initial tranches will be done under what is called  the SRF, which is actually a facility that was created at the time of the Korean crisis Now there  is a variant of that under discussion, which would have contingent elements to it It was referred  to in the G-7 communique and has been discussed in the press and elsewhere The contingent  element was not really in play for Brazil because events overtook the debate, so to speak, but the  characteristics of the SRF part are that it will be at a penalty rate and it will be disbursed in large  quantity initially in an effort to discourage contagion and speculation and so forth But that is  under the umbrella of the standby arrangement The term ""standby"" can refer to financing this    11/17/98  way or financing through some of the other devices at a different pace In that sense, it is not  absolutely new But, yes, this option will be used for Brazil   Yes   They will The first tranche will be disbursed upon the vote of the  executive directors of the IMF, and that money will come immediately The conditions of that  first tranche have already been met They were set and they had to do with some of the items in  the fiscal package that were already announced and actions that the Brazilians have already  taken, so that is a given The next tranche will come up for review in February of 1999   I certainly take your point The 8 percent number was somewhat  unexpected We have not really had the opportunity to look into it, and it is hard to do so with  China because we don't get a lot of detail and can not get behind the scenes I am skeptical but I  can't cite good reasons for that skepticism other than that we know Asia as an economic area is  in trouble, and it is hard to believe that China is escaping as it would seem We will certainly  view this as something that we should look into and get more information through various  channels and give it to the Committee   Yes, capital controls and the like We expect them to be able to  maintain the present exchange regime into 1999, something we had assumed previously with  some trepidation, and it seems to be happening But I think we probably do need to question the  sequence of events and the policy choices they are making and ask some hard questions about  that We will try to do more about it   While you're at it, the timing as well! [Laughter]   I think the next three weeks are crucial for at least the initial success  of the Brazilian program The time between now and the signing of the letter of intent, which  will be on one of the first days in December, is the first hurdle that has to be gotten over People    11/17/98  even less cynical than I might think that chances are that what is needed to get a positive vote at  that first hurdle will take place because it is in the interests of many parties to have that happen  The critical feature is whether or not the private creditors of Brazil, both those within the country  and external to the country, appear to be carrying their fair share If so, the governments that  have money to be extended both through the IMF and through bilateral mechanisms will feel that  it is appropriate to vote ""yes"" and the program will go forward So, one might think that that will  happen, although I would not characterize it as 100 percent sure by any stretch of the  imagination But it certainly is still possible that things will unravel between then and February  of 1999, and one way it will become obvious that things are unraveling is if Brazil again starts to  lose reserves rapidly  I would guess the likelihood that the baseline Greenbook scenario will occur is in the  neighborhood of 50 percent, maybe a little more We thought it had a good chance or we would  not have given it any credence The meltdown scenario is a fairly contained one; it has spillovers  for Argentina, it has some implications for Mexico, and it would be messy Exactly how this  would take place is not clear It might include a combination of some unilateral actions on the  part of Brazil, some forced exchange rate adjustment, and then a return to the IMF and an  attempt to restart negotiations--all of which would certainly play out over some period of time I  guess I would give this scenario a big chunk of the remaining probability So, if the probability  of the Greenbook scenario is 55 or 60 percent, this alternative may be another 25 to 30 percent  But there is at least a 5 to 10 percent probability that Brazil could fall so hard that  Hong Kong, for example, would become threatened again, a possibility that is not in this  scenario Hong Kong is the other fixed exchange rate regime that has been tested repeatedly  since this crisis began If Hong Kong is forced off of its peg, then the progress that we have seen    11/17/98  to date in Korea and Thailand might be called into question because capital markets would again  become skeptical of their viability, and the citizens of those countries would begin to feel that  they should move their capital elsewhere That could trigger a worse scenario that I would not  give a lot of weight to, but one whose probability is not zero by any means "
3612,1998-12-22," We received October trade data after the Greenbook forecast was prepared, so I would like to start by describing the implications of those data for our understanding of the foreign sector during the current quarter Both exports and imports surprised us on the upside, but the surprise was significantly greater for exports In terms of trade categories, exports of machinery--other than computers--and industrial supplies both surprised us by the size of their increases The miss was not in aircraft or other items where large-size transactions can introduce noise into monthly data This surprising strength in exports may be a signal that recovery is proceeding a bit more rapidly in some parts of the world than we have allowed for in the forecast, but we have no direct evidence of that yet and hesitate to put too much weight on one month's trade data  The October data nevertheless lead us to expect fairly robust growth of exports in the fourth quarter, after three quarters of decline Combining stronger exports with a small revision to our outlook for imports results in a downward revision to our estimate for the quarter of the negative contribution of net exports to US GDP growth from 07 percent at an annual rate to 03 percent For 1999 and 2000, we still look for the drag from net exports to ease from about 1/2 percentage point next year to close to 1/4 percentage point in 2000 after an estimated 1 percentage points for this year as a whole  Our expectation that the drag exerted on real GDP growth by the external sector will diminish over the forecast period depends importantly on the modest rebound of exports that we are forecasting The impetus for that rebound lies partly in the waning effects of past dollar appreciation and partly in the strengthening we anticipate in average foreign output growth, which has been exceptionally weak in 1998 In the Greenbook, the recovery in foreign growth entails a return to low but positive growth in the developing countries of Asia, some slowing in Latin America but not collapse, and a substantial reduction in the rate of decline in output in Japan For each of these regions, our forecast is relatively conservative in that it is less optimistic than is the latest consensus forecast  As in November, our outlook for developments abroad incorporates the assumption that the international financial package put together for Brazil, including successful implementation of the macroeconomic policies laid out in the IMF program, restores market confidence As a consequence, although real activity in Brazil declines sharply, the Brazilian exchange rate regime remains in place and contagion to other economies in the region or elsewhere is kept to a minimum As we indicated in the Greenbook, we    12/22/98  view the risks to this baseline forecast of a less favorable outcome in Brazil as somewhat greater now in light of the failure of the Brazilian Congress to pass all the elements of a public sector pension reform package put before it earlier this month Moreover, capital continues to flow out of Brazil on a net basis most days  Last week, Brazil made an initial drawing on both the funds available through the IMF program and the funds available on a bilateral basis, for a total of just over $9 billion These resources have been added to Brazil's international reserves The Brazilian government has announced its intention to resubmit to the Congress next year the measures that did not pass in December and to proceed to implement the other elements of the IMF program We look for those steps to put a halt to private net capital outflows and to contribute to improved financial market conditions, but we recognize that a return to crisis conditions in Brazil, and spillover to Argentina, Mexico, and other emerging markets, is still a distinct possibility For that reason, we again included in the Greenbook an alternative scenario that incorporates a more pessimistic projection for Brazil, including a break in the exchange rate regime and the spread of contagion in Latin America That scenario implies that US real GDP growth would be 1/22 to 3/4 percentage point lower in 1999 and 2000, respectively  Mr Prell will continue our presentation   Yes, but not by much The import equation has been doing fairly well    12/22/98   Not convincing evidence yet, no The thought is in my mind, given  the enormous changes in potential GDP growth everywhere The fact that we see potential in the  United States going up--and we certainly have written down the potential for Japan and other  countries a great deal--suggests that whatever the deeply embedded fundamentals that give rise  to these elasticities are, they may be changing, too We can look at that question again, but there  is nothing about the past six months or so of data that would cause one to think that that must be  happening "
3666,1999-03-30," The basic picture from the external sector is very  similar to that in the January Greenbook We expect net exports to  continue to be a drag on GDP growth, but to a diminishing extent going     3/30/99 8   forward In the very near term, exports are a negative factor as some  elements that boosted exports strongly in the fourth quarter of last year are  unwound That combined with the upward revision to US activity and  thus to import growth results in a more sizable drop in net exports for the  first half of this year than we expected in January Exports should rebound  in the second half of this year and grow moderately next year, even after  we take into account the somewhat stronger level of the dollar that we now  see as likely   Two developments in particular since January inspire some  confidence in our positive view toward the prospects for exports One is  the move in Japan to significantly more aggressive monetary ease, coupled  with signs that financial sector reform is proceeding Although we  continue to have activity weakening in Japan through the middle of next  year, we now are looking for an upturn to begin during the second half of  2000 Financial market participants seem to have applauded the latest  policy moves in Japan more than we would, and ample downside risks  remain there Nevertheless, there are reasons to see developments in Japan  over the past two months as movements in a positive direction   Recent developments in Brazil have also lent credence to the view  that meltdown can be avoided in Brazil and, therefore, that the risk of  contagion to its neighbors is limited As a consequence, we have revised  slightly upward our outlook for Mexico The Brazilian real has retraced  some of its decline in terms of the dollar, even in the face of a reduction in  the overnight interest rate by the central bank of Brazil Thus far, support  among Brazil’s bank creditors is holding up, and last week one Brazilian  bank was able to return to the global market and raise voluntary funds with  a one-year maturity The reform program still faces many hurdles, and  success is not assured, but events in the past several weeks have been  encouraging   There are still places in the world where new economic crises could  erupt We have seen one such case in Ecuador, but so far it seems  contained, with no signs of further contagion A potentially more serious  case is China, where major domestic problems would no doubt have greater  implications for its neighbors We see real output growth slowing this year  in China and have built into the forecast a gradual move in its exchange  rate next year A more severe deceleration, or a more abrupt change in the  exchange rate, would threaten the signs of recovery now evident in the  developing countries of Asia and could risk another round of financial and  real macroeconomic turmoil in emerging markets Finally, there is now the  possibility of the events in Kosovo triggering some financial market  reaction or undermining consumer or business confidence sufficiently to     3/30/99 9   affect economic activity, particularly in Europe At the moment, any  economic consequences seem very limited, but further escalation of the  conflict could change that    The compromise forecast of a basically flat nominal dollar-­  or an upward tilt in the real dollar, which is what matters in the forecast--comes about   primarily because US inflation is projected to be slightly higher than the very, very low   inflation we expect to see in most other industrial countries So in some sense, we are   forecasting a generally flat nominal dollar as the offset of forces whose size we can’t   really project Therefore, the notion that the dollar will likely be flat is somewhat of an   agnostic forecast rather than one in which we have great confidence   On the one hand, we see the European and Japanese economies as still quite   weak We expect monetary conditions in Europe to be eased at some point and we   expect Japanese monetary conditions to remain very, very aggressively easy The sense   that the US economy has experienced positive surprises that are not going to end   abruptly vis-à-vis the monetary easing that we expect abroad might actually have led us   to forecast an appreciation in the dollar What stopped us from moving that far is our   concern about the ongoing widening of the external balances So we have put together   those factors--one likely having positive effects and one likely having negative effects-­  and have tried to come up with a neutral compromise by positing a flat nominal dollar   and a rising real dollar In fact, we even have the euro coming back up some on the   grounds that weakness in Europe is not so pronounced and that our external deficits will   become a more important factor     3/30/99 10    I have posed the essence of your question to a lot of people   The question I have pondered is If technology, productivity, computers, internets, or   whatever are the fundamental explanation for why the US performance has been better-­  not just for 1998 but for about the past three years--why is it that we don’t see it   elsewhere? One might expect to see it especially, say, in Canada, where we see it a little   but not a lot We actually are looking into how much of it is apparent in Canada When I   ask this question of Europeans, I get answers that have a lot to do with the well-known   structural problems that beset the European economy, but I also sometimes hear   surprisingly optimistic accounts that at the micro level people are beginning to see a   change I have even had similar accounts about Japan from people who have been to that   country recently and to whom I have posed this question   My contacts say they have heard stories from people they talked to last week   or last month that suggest that at individual firms and in selected industries this   phenomenon is beginning to make its way into the economies of Europe and Japan That     3/30/99 12   makes some sense in that we know from studies of past major innovations--the   introduction of electricity to replace steam, for example--that the actual economic impact   came long after the invention It took a very long time for people to figure out how to do   things differently and how to exploit the particular advantages of the new technology as   opposed to just mimicking the old technology Given the structural problems in Europe   and the degree to which risk-taking and mobility are limited there, it is not implausible   that it would take longer in Europe than it might take in the United States I honestly   don’t know how much credence to put in the stories that, in fact, there is something   bubbling under the surface and that a global technology event really will become visible   But it is at least a little reassuring that, in some micro-type anecdotes, there is an echo of   what we see in the United States that suggests there is hope for Europe  "
3763,1999-08-24," Yes Dave Howard has been a member of the Board’s Division of   International Finance for almost 25 years and has worked in several of the areas of the   division Recently, owing to the passage of time and the departure of some people, he was   promoted to Deputy Director of the division He has a PhD from the University of   Virginia, is very well rounded in open economy international macro issues, and is a very   thoughtful economist I think he would be an asset to the Committee and I recommend him   to you  "
3764,1999-08-24," There are two elements of the external picture that I  believe need to be highlighted this morning One is the shift in our  thinking toward the view that recovery among many of the crisis  countries has taken hold; our outlook for output growth abroad for the  rest of this year and next year is now stronger than we previously  thought This more optimistic tone is present in the Greenbook, but I  think it merits some comment, including some cautions Second, since  the Greenbook forecast was finalized, we have received the trade data for  June Those data showed more imports than we were expecting, and we  would shade our forecast of the external sector just a bit from that in the  Greenbook as a consequence   Additional data showing very strong real output growth in several  developing countries have convinced us that activity in some of these  countries is rebounding sharply from the depressed levels reached last  year For several important Asian economies, including Korea and  Malaysia, we have raised our estimates of the level of output reached in  the second quarter and have extrapolated firmer growth over the forecast  period There have been positive surprises with respect to some Latin  American countries as well, in particular Mexico and Brazil, and we have  revised upward the average growth we expect for that region but less  markedly than we did for Asia Taken together, these upward  adjustments imply output growth for developing countries that is 3/4  percentage point stronger at an annual rate during the second half of this  year and a percentage point stronger next year than we had in June   Although we now read the signs of recovery in many emerging  economies as more persuasive, downside risks remain that should not be     8/24/99 37   underestimated In Asia, the economic and political situation in China is  clouded With output growth slowing and deflation continuing, market  talk of an imminent devaluation of the currency has resumed We are  anticipating a gradual decline in the nominal value of the renminbi during  next year If, instead, there is an abrupt adjustment, financial stresses for  other economies in the region could result Given China’s substantial  holdings of international reserves and capital controls, we believe that  officials are in a position to manage this decision, but we cannot rule out  that circumstances could force their hand   Downward pressure on the Brazilian real over the past four weeks  appears to be a sign of heightened market concern Despite very strong  real GDP performance in the first half of the year, progress on permanent  fiscal reform is questionable, with both court challenges and political  commitment continuing to pose problems The government of Brazil has  struggled to normalize access to global financial markets The agreement  of Brazil with its major bank creditors to maintain their lending positions  is about to expire, and Brazilian authorities have announced that they  have no plans to draw on the third tranche of their IMF or bilateral  support funds However, with the external accounts still in deficit, Brazil  is dependent on attracting foreign capital; a further loss of market  confidence could trigger a swift resumption of contractionary forces  Financial markets in Latin America are generally somewhat skittish The  recent announcement by Ecuador that it may miss a payment due shortly  on its outstanding Brady bonds had a moderate effect on spreads  elsewhere in Latin America and could lead to further volatility if talks  with the IMF make no progress   Although we see the situation in some parts of the global economy as  still fragile, the overall picture is nonetheless considerably brighter than  in June With the significant positive revision to the forecast for output in  the developing countries and a small upward adjustment to that in the  foreign industrial countries, we have output abroad growing at 3 percent  over the forecast period, about the same as forecast for the United States  Stronger growth abroad should boost exports some, and we have raised  their projected growth accordingly   The nominal trade deficit in June, which was released after the  Greenbook forecast was final, revealed slightly more exports and  significantly more imports than we had incorporated into the second- quarter estimate All categories of imports were buoyant, and no special  factors or statistical anomalies seem present We are inclined to adjust  the level of imports--and exports--in the second quarter, but to retain our  path for quarterly growth rates over the forecast period The higher level  of imports in June implies that the negative contribution of net exports  remained substantial in the second quarter Going forward, with foreign     8/24/99 38   output growth solid, and the path for the real exchange value of the dollar  trending down slightly, as we have in our forecast, the negative  contribution of real net exports should diminish   The positive surprise to imports of capital goods in June suggests that  the level of PDE in the advance second-quarter release should be revised  up somewhat Taken together, these data revisions imply an annual  growth rate of 15 percent for second-quarter GDP, compared with 19  percent in the advance release  "
3816,1999-10-05," The basic message from the external sector this round is  that economic activity in the rest of the world seems to be strengthening even more  than we--and most other forecasters--had expected There were several positive  surprises concerning activity in the second quarter, such as small, positive real GDP  growth in Japan and double-digit growth in some emerging market economies in  Asia Some signs to the contrary--for example in Brazil the recent weakening of  production and court decisions just announced on Monday that appear to be at least  a partial set-back in the fiscal reform process--have tempered our optimism  Nonetheless, on balance we have raised our projection for foreign output growth  through next year and we expect additional firming in 2001   As described by Peter Fisher earlier, the yen/dollar rate fluctuated quite  widely during the intermeeting period In part, these fluctuations reflect swings in  views on the current cyclical position of the Japanese economy and its outlook for  growth over the rest of this year and next The positive change in second-quarter  real GDP reinforced the impact of the very large first-quarter number and  contributed to a general reassessment in asset markets and among forecasters,  including the staff Moreover, some indicators that have been released since the  Greenbook was completed suggest that we may still have been overly cautious in     10/5/99 11   our thinking about the very near term for the Japanese economy During August,  industrial production surged and housing starts posted an unexpectedly strong  rebound from July’s steep decline Unemployment edged down in August   However, the Tankan survey of business confidence, just released yesterday,  seems to have partly disappointed the markets Whereas there was a sizable,  positive swing in sentiment for large manufacturing firms, outside this sector and for  the total index the shift was much less Importantly, firms in the survey continue to  plan large cuts in fixed investment expenditures, consistent with their outlook for  negligible sales growth   On balance, we judge our upward revision to the forecast for real output  growth in Japan to be appropriate and we might even shade up the numbers for the  rest of this year and both 2000 and 2001 in response to the additional data  Nevertheless, we retain the view that expansion will slow from its rapid first-half  pace to around 1 to 1½ percent over the forecast period That assessment reflects  our continued serious concerns about the underlying strength of Japanese domestic  demand, particularly private investment, given headwinds from corporate  restructuring, persistent difficulties in the financial sector, and possible loss of  confidence as a result of yen appreciation over the past year   There have also been some additional positive indicators for near-term  activity in Europe and Canada in the past few days Canadian production in the  third quarter appears to be above expectations The latest survey data for the United  Kingdom and the euro area reinforce the upward revisions that we made to their  forecasts and suggest possible upside risk for real output growth in Europe   This recent evidence confirms a stronger picture for prospects in the industrial  countries and complements the substantial upward revision we made to the  Greenbook forecast for the Asian developing economies With foreign output-­ aside from small fluctuations owing to Y2K--set to grow somewhat below the  extremely rapid rate of the first half of this year but at a robust pace over the forecast  period, we see US export volumes expanding at rates much above the pace of last  year and the first half of this year   The change in the relative cyclical positions of the United States and our  trading partners is one of the factors behind our thinking in incorporating a  depreciation of the dollar into the forecast With other global problems attracting  reduced attention, we expect that the large and expanding US external deficits will  contribute to market sentiment for declines in the dollar as well With no basis on  which to predict the timing of an abrupt dollar change, we have projected a  moderate move down in real terms of the exchange value of the dollar spread over  the forecast period This dollar depreciation should add to the projected  improvement in our export performance As a consequence, we see the external  sector as continuing to subtract from GDP growth, but at a much reduced pace, over  the forecast period     10/5/99 12   We’d be happy to answer any questions    Well, I think the directions are consistent Generally speaking I would   attribute it to expectations about the interest rate consequences of stronger activity in the one   economy, not necessarily weaker activity in the United States The relative change is all that is   needed If the rest of the world begins to operate closer to capacity, those countries will experience   a rise in interest rates owing to demand effects and to possible monetary policy responses that will   come We’ve already seen rumors in the markets about action by the European Central Bank, with   some people even speculating that it will come as early as Thursday That seems to be very early   in the process of some strengthening in Europe But it’s that expectation of relative monetary   policy moves and relative interest rate changes that would feed through into the exchange rates    Well, more important, less important The current account goes the same   way in that such a move in exchange rates would tend to lessen surpluses that are apparent in   Europe and Japan and remedy to some extent deficits in the United States So in that sense these   factors are not in conflict but are just reinforcing one another    In our view, the Chinese authorities will make a discretionary decision   about the renminbi Because of their very strong reserve position and the fact that they are still   running surpluses, we don’t see market forces triggering an event there So the decision that they   will make at some point in time to introduce some flexibility in their exchange rate is something     10/5/99 13   over which they have more control than some other monetary authorities might have Even so,   they may decide to make a one-step adjustment We are not presuming to rule that out It is just   impossible for us to know whether that could be their choice and when they might actually act So,   for forecast purposes we tend to put in a smooth adjustment, but in no sense does that mean that we   are betting that that is the way it will necessarily happen and that it will not happen in one or two   steps It is the political process within China that might lead to a quicker reaction, as slower   growth creates pressures on employment and standards of living and political support for different   factions in China As the effort to continue reforms for the state-owned enterprises is in conflict   with that--and to create a source of demand to offset perhaps the spillovers from the dilemmas with   the state-owned enterprises--I think they would choose at some point to introduce some exchange   rate flexibility But exactly when and how is more than we are prepared to take a position on    I hesitate to attempt to do the arithmetic on the spot My guess is that we   would probably say that 10 percent is too large an estimate of the output gap in Japan, in part   because a whole decade of largely reduced capital accumulation has had a bearing on the size of   that gap And with labor force growth essentially zero at this point, we see Japanese potential as   radically different from what it had been in previous decades-- perhaps as low as 1½ to 2 percent or   something like that But let’s say for the sake of argument that Japan could grow at 5 percent, the   gap is 5 to 6 percent, and its rate of growth could rise steeply It could be 2 or 3 years before they   close the gap Japan’s propensity to import is not as strong as that of some other countries, and I   think it is probably unit elastic on income That would be my guess, so an increase in imports   could well occur The dilemma is that to the extent Japan can close the output gap, that feeds   through and no doubt has a positive effect on the US economy Indeed, our stronger export   picture in this Greenbook does lead to our net export contribution becoming almost zero by the end   of the forecast horizon But for Japan, the greater vigor that such a scenario--growing at 2 to 3   percent for three years, closing the gap, and then growing at potential--would impart to the   domestic economy, would make Japan a much more attractive place for Japanese investors to   invest than the United States Thus, their investment in the United States would slow So even   though there is a reduced current account surplus, each and every month Japan will have to make   net investments in the rest of the world And that will fight the tide, as it were, of a Japan that   seems to be the place that is gaining cyclical vigor but where interest rate and exchange rate   adjustments nonetheless make it look like a good idea for them to invest abroad So while it is true   that these adjustments through the income channel in some sense add to the capital account   problem, there is a need for interest rate and exchange rate adjustments that attract money out of   Japan despite its cyclical strengthening How all that balances out will depend a great deal on risk   premiums, expectations, and investor preferences And we do not claim that the number we’ve   written down is in any sense the result of a truly analytical calculation We have tried to indicate   what we think is the general direction and we put a magnitude in there that will show through But   the econometric art of balancing these things and their effect on the exchange rate is in the Dark   Ages somewhere    Right     10/5/99 15    Of course, that attracted much attention over the weekend of the G-7   meeting and the preceding week and was a factor in some of the buffeting of the yen/dollar rate that   occurred At the moment they apparently have no plans for intervention Just today, for example,   a Japanese official--I’ve forgotten exactly which one--was quoted as saying that if the yen were to   stabilize in the 105 to 106 yen/dollar range, intervention would not be necessary So that was the   latest statement from them And that’s perhaps indicative of the fact that their propensity to talk is   higher than might seem constructive   We see fiscal policy coming through with a supplemental budget large enough to yield the   forecast that we have put in the Greenbook We have a view of when it will happen and how much   it will be, but that is designed to give us the forecast that we have here We believe Japanese   authorities have committed certainly to an additional supplement this fall And we believe that   they will have another next year, given the huge negative shock that would occur were that not to   happen We think that such a policy will have smooth sailing   The Bank of Japan seems to be considering some alternative monetary policy measures in   order to get reserves out into the economy more effectively than with their present procedures; the   latter leave a lot of excess reserves in the banks and in these broker firms called Danchi who just   tend to sit on them In their mind that practice is futile There is no point in adding to those   reserves; they are not doing anything And the Bank of Japan has stated on several recent   occasions that it does not want to do that So they have suggested that they are considering some   alternatives that might be available to them should they decide they need to find a way to ease even   further They have discussed perhaps doing foreign exchange swaps, which would be to some   degree focused on the yen/dollar exchange rate But those actions would be at the discretion of the   Bank of Japan and its policy board as opposed to a decision of the Ministry of Finance   In the last couple of days, they have been leaving 1½ trillion yen in excess reserves in the   system instead of 1 trillion yen, which is something they said they would not do or did not see the     10/5/99 16   point of doing And they have been explaining those on the grounds of seasonal factors relating to   the end of the half fiscal year So in principle they could leave in 1½ trillion instead of 1 trillion   yen or maybe decide to implement some of these additional tools I think they are at least trying to   give the market the impression that there are other possibilities They are stepping back a bit from   the statement they made on September 21st that suggested there were no options and they were not   thinking about any options There will be another meeting of the policy board on October 13th I   don’t know that we will get a statement from them that soon, but we might get one indicating that   they are prepared to take certain actions if needed That’s what I would look for At the moment   the market seems to think that such a statement or such a modification in their policy course is a   possibility  "
3865,1999-11-16," The news about the global economy that we have received  over the intermeeting period has generally been quite favorable The signs of  strengthening activity, particularly in Asia, that we saw earlier in the year  continue to be confirmed, and positive developments in real output growth now  appear to be widespread across other regions of the globe as well, including  importantly the other industrial countries  Taking into account what production  data we have so far for the third quarter, along with indicators for the remainder  of the year such as orders figures and confidence measures, we have revised up  our estimate for total output growth in the rest of the world during the second half  of this year from about 3¼ percent in September to 4 percent in the current  Greenbook     11/16/99 9   In updating our forecast, we had to wrestle with the implications for 2000  and 2001 of these signs of more robust activity abroad Embedded in them likely  is some boost from transitory precautionary demands reflecting Y2K concerns on  the part of households and firms abroad Present also, at least for some countries,  is the spurt of activity that can come in the initial phase of a cyclical rebound as a  result of swings in inventories, the release of pent-up demand, and the stimulus of  favorable financial conditions Some moderation from the initially very high  growth rates is normal under these circumstances More fundamentally, some of  the robust indicators we are now seeing no doubt signal strength in underlying  demand Moreover, to the extent that confidence is bolstered by the current  strong growth, demand may expand further in the future   We have balanced these factors by revising up the near-term level of foreign  output to reflect the positive indicators of the past several weeks, but we are  projecting only very slightly higher growth than in the previous Greenbook on  average over the remainder of the forecast period As a consequence, the level of  foreign activity is higher throughout this forecast than in September The near- term upward adjustments are spread throughout the industrial and developing  countries in the forecast  The small upward changes we have made to growth in  2000 and 2001 are notably in China and Mexico among the developing countries  and in Japan and Canada among the industrial countries   With the dollar still projected to depreciate somewhat in real terms over the  forecast period, we are looking for a rebound in the growth of real exports of  goods and services from the low rates experienced in 1998 and the first half of  this year The upward revision we have made to projected foreign activity implies  a rebound in exports that is just a touch stronger than what we expected in  September   There is clearly a risk that these recent indicators of strength are not the result  of transitory or cyclical factors In that case, we are probably being too cautious  in not extrapolating more of the recent good news from abroad into our forecast  for foreign activity and for US export growth over the next two years To get a  handle on the magnitude of the effect of a possible miss on our part, we included  in the Greenbook a simulation of the implication for US real GDP growth of  expansion abroad that is 1 percentage point stronger at an annual rate, sustained  over the coming eight quarters, than what we have in the baseline Such an  extremely buoyant outlook for foreign activity would raise projected US real  GDP growth by about ¼ percentage point in 2000 and ¾ percentage point in  2001 At the same time, it would raise the rate of US core inflation by nearly ½  percentage point in 2001   Of course, even the cautiously optimistic outcome in the Greenbook baseline  forecast is not assured Considerable uncertainty remains in the foreign outlook  Among the most important unfavorable risk elements are renewed weakness in  Japan, perhaps as a consequence of withdrawal of fiscal stimulus; a premature end     11/16/99 10   to the expansion in the euro area should tightening by the ECB prove excessive  and/or confidence falter; and additional upward pressure on world oil prices from  further OPEC production restraint or severe winter weather   Alternatively, the risk of a greater downward move in the value of the dollar  than we are projecting, either by itself or in conjunction with pressures on other  US asset prices, cannot be ruled out Such an exchange rate change would  stimulate export demand more and result in additional upward pressure on import  prices    I think we have done two things We have recognized the fact that   we were wrong about the second half of this year In fact, everybody was wrong; even the   Japanese are continuously surprised by the strength in the numbers they are producing   Secondly, we have widened enormously--although it is obviously not written down anywhere in   the Greenbook--the confidence intervals that we are putting around our forecast for 2000 and   2001   If there is a locus of uncertainty anywhere, it is centered on Japan, at least in my mind   On the one hand, we are getting stronger indicators, at least to some degree, regarding what is   happening now Although we have not seen a private investment response, we were certainly   surprised by the private consumption numbers we saw Strength in the rest of Asia has helped   Japan as well, and the combination has produced GDP numbers that are much larger than we   were expecting Earlier this year we had expected a negative offset to the very strong first   quarter; we did not get that We now are expecting a fairly substantial positive number for the   third quarter Yet one does not get the sense that domestic demand has become self-sustaining in   Japan Officials from the Bank of Japan in the statements they have made recently talk about   having seen the trough and having seen a pickup Yet they talk about demand perhaps not yet   being sustained and say that for that reason they are prepared to keep the zero interest rate policy   in place   So, we are looking at their fiscal policy and at what is happening in the rest of the   world The announcement of the 18 trillion yen package probably had a smaller share of “real   water” spending than these packages have had in the past We often use a rule of thumb of one-  half as the estimate of real spending in the fiscal programs that are announced by Japanese     11/16/99 15   officials, and we think this one does not come up even to that Common assessments are more   like 6 or 7 trillion, which is a number on the order of one-third as opposed to one-half of “real   water” spending But even that amount would not produce the forecast that we have written   down So, embedded in our GDP forecast for calendar year 2000 is the assumption that when   they decide on the budget they will put in about another ¼ percentage point of stimulus through   the fiscal channel That is not a certainty No doubt the medium-term concerns about the size of   the outstanding debt and even short-term concerns about financing problems--as they have been   struggling with the issue of who is going to buy the Japanese government bonds and so forth-­  might lead them to take a less aggressive fiscal posture And that would reduce their growth to   less than we have forecast Even so, I think we have a very cautious forecast--one that suggests   still a lot of problems in the Japanese economy and growth that is going to remain very low   There are other forecasters around the world who see the acceleration of Japanese   activity proceeding, as opposed to falling back the way we do I think the basic answer is the   one I gave you There are upside risks and downside risks The confidence interval around any   forecast on Japan has to be far wider right now than would ordinarily be the case  "
3928,1999-12-21," In my remarks I will first say a few words about the  October trade data that were released after the Greenbook was completed  and then will review what we perceive to be some of the risks confronting  the global economy   In October, the US nominal trade deficit in goods and services  reached $259 billion, a new monthly record Exports were about  unchanged from their level in the previous two months, as increased  exports of industrial materials about offset decreased exports of  machinery, including computers The value of imports jumped in  October, with the largest increases registered in consumer goods and  machinery   The October number was very close to that embedded in the  Greenbook forecast By themselves, these data suggest a fourth-quarter  outcome of real net exports that is slightly weaker than in the Greenbook  However, in combination with small adjustments to some domestic  components of GDP in response to these data, they imply little net change  in our estimate of current-quarter GDP growth   Once again we have slightly revised upward our Greenbook  projection for real output growth abroad during 2000 and 2001 This  brings the total revision for 2000 to about plus ¾ percentage point since  June and plus 1¼ percentage points since last December Our stronger  outlook for the coming two years rests in part on the positive surprises in  recent months for economic activity during this year for most regions of  the world It rests also on the likelihood that fiscal policy will be less  contractionary in several regions while monetary policy remains generally  accommodative abroad The one major exception to the generally bright  picture I am painting has been Japan, where although we have revised  upward our forecast for next year, projected growth remains quite low,  and we are somewhat pessimistic   Together with the stronger view for the U S economy that Mike just  reviewed, the staff forecast now calls for a substantially more robust  global economy over the coming eight quarters than seemed probable a  year ago One risk to this upbeat picture is that we, and other forecasters,  are still not fully taking into account the mutually reinforcing positive  impulses that can be shared across countries during a simultaneous  expansion We may be underestimating the upward momentum in  individual countries that can come from the interaction of improved  confidence, higher capacity utilization, and wealth effects For the global  economy, we may be failing to allow for generally stronger export demand  everywhere as spare capacity is reduced in many economies at the same  time     12/21/99 12   One class of markets where early indications of such growing  momentum might become evident is global non-oil commodity markets  As yet, we do not see an indication that demand is putting severe pressure  on supply in those markets While prices have begun rising, it is from  previously very low levels Going forward, we will need to pay particular  attention to those markets for signs of incipient inflationary pressures   At the same time, we need to be open to the possibility that the  factors causing accelerating productivity in the US economy are  beginning to have similar effects in other economies, especially the other  industrial economies In that event, the global economy would be capable  of faster growth without inflation risk than was previously the case  Provided foreign officials do not unnecessarily limit output growth from  achieving its new potential, such a development could result in stronger  demand for US exports and more balanced growth in the global  economy Such a scenario is one version of a so-called soft landing   It now seems very likely that 2000 will see higher interest rates and  more profitable investment opportunities abroad that could decrease  demand for US assets and raise the risk of downward pressure on the  dollar Such developments could in turn cause disturbances in other  global financial markets as well However, for the first time since the  Asian crisis began in 1997, we need to be alert to the possibility of  generalized global upside economic pressures and the challenges for  policy that such a development would pose  "
3987,2000-03-21,"  The wide dispersion of economic performance   by regions that has characterized global economic activity in varying  degrees since 1997 appears to be coming to an end  With the notable  exception of the Japanese economy, positive economic developments  are now widespread in Asia, Latin America, and Europe  These  regions have joined North America and the United Kingdom in  returning to sustained, sometimes exceptional, rates of real output  growth     For the most part, the strengthening of economic activity abroad   has been accompanied by sounder macroeconomic fundamentals   Inflation remains contained almost everywhere despite higher energy  prices   In many countries, official interest rates have been raised to  counter the effects of stronger activity and the rise in oil prices  Last  Thursday, the ECB raised its official rates another 25 basis points,  confirming our guess in the Greenbook that additional tightening  would come soon That Greenbook outlook includes further increases  of official rates among the industrial countries this year and a bit more  next year, moves that will moderate the rate of expansion somewhat  and keep growth abroad at a projected annual rate of about 4 percent       Fiscal policies generally remain sound as well  The improved   cyclical positions of many countries are lowering actual deficits, and  gains in structural fiscal balance are also being made in many  countries  Within the euro area, several countries are now in surplus  or near fiscal balance, and all those countries are expected to have  deficits no wider than 2 percent of GDP this year  Among key  developing countries, higher oil prices are improving the fiscal  position of the Mexican government, and past progress in Brazil has  left it in a healthier fiscal situation, although more progress is still  needed                 - 32 -     On the whole, one could say that in terms of macroeconomic  performance, again with the exception of Japan, much of the rest of the  global economy is moving toward growth at respectable rates with  some characteristics in common with recent US experience  At the  same time, many global financial markets are displaying volatile  behavior and raise some concerns that risks of disorderly conditions or  abrupt fluctuations could threaten the otherwise sanguine outlook that  we presented in the Greenbook       Equity prices abroad are beginning to pose puzzles similar to   those in the United States  During the intermeeting period, stock  prices rose at double-digit rates in Canada and Mexico, although they  fell at comparable rates in Thailand and the Philippines  Since the  start of the year, stock prices have moved up strongly in Canada,  Germany, and, to a lesser extent, France  In many foreign stock  markets, as in the United States at least until very recently, the prices  of shares in the technology sector have risen extremely rapidly, on  balance, and account for much of the rise in the overall index  The  similar movements that we observe in equity markets in Asia, Europe,  and the United States raise the odds that a major correction in one  region could trigger large price movements in the others       Foreign exchange markets also contain hints of possible risks to   our baseline picture of convergence toward potential growth rates  abroad  Although ECB officials denied a causal link, persistent euro  weakness was at least in their minds when they reached the recent  decision to tighten  However, this increase in their official rates had  no perceptible effect on the value of the euro in terms of the dollar   With firm economic growth only now being established in some parts  of the euro area, particularly Germany, there is risk of premature  tightening of monetary policy preventing sustained expansion Yen  strength triggered two episodes of exchange market intervention by  Japanese authorities since your February meeting, but with no lasting  impact on the exchange rate  Renewed yen appreciation might risk  derailing the recovery that is beginning in some components of  Japanese demand     There are other risks to sustained global expansion  Structural   problems were identified in many of the countries that experienced  crises in 1997 and 1998  The rebound in activity may lessen the  energy devoted to addressing these problems and foster a return to  complacency  In Europe, high unemployment rates continue and are  evidence that further reforms to introduce flexibility in labor markets  remain essential  Lack of market confidence in the reform process in  the euro area appears to be one of the factors weighing on the euro              - 33 -       Despite the rebound in activity abroad, we continue to project a   widening external deficit in the United States that in turn will require  ever larger amounts of foreign savings to finance  Since the  Greenbook was finalized, we have received two additional bits of data   The balance of payments for the fourth quarter contained revisions to  real exports and imports  A more positive outcome for service exports  relative to imports than in the previous data accounts for the upward  revision of fourth-quarter growth in US GDP to a pace above 7  percent  This morning, trade data for January were released  They  show a new record for the monthly nominal deficit  Taken together,  these data imply, all else equal, a downward revision of several tenths  for first-quarter GDP growth, but only a small change to the current  account balance this year and next        We would be happy to answer any questions       That is why in fact we have little tilt either way  There are factors   on both sides  Looking forward, in some sense we see the US economy slowing--at least that is   the maintained hypothesis in the Greenbook and in so many other forecasts of late--and we see   the rest of the world getting stronger and stronger  So on those grounds, I’m not sure that the   edge in a relative sense--in terms of the pace of activity and the exploration of new opportunities              - 34 -     and the capacity to attract investments so to speak--doesn't still lie abroad   Granted, that’s a   relative-type comparison rather than an absolute one  On the one hand, the slowing in the US   economy that is depicted in the Greenbook arises largely from higher interest rates and a   tightening of financial conditions more generally  Because those are the driving factors, one   might argue that we should continue to attract capital inflows  On the other hand, those higher   interest rates could achieve a stock market outcome that seems less rewarding to capital inflows    In essence, we don't have an answer as to which of these many competing elements will   dominate and over what part of the forecast period  We've chosen an almost flat, though not   quite flat, outcome for the dollar just as a means of saying that we can identify forces going one   way and we can identify forces going the other way  "
4082,2000-08-22,"  After the Greenbook was finalized last week, we   received trade data for June  The figure for the trade balance surprised us a  bit  Both exports and imports grew more rapidly than we or BEA had  penciled in for June, with exports showing the larger upward revision  We  would now project second-quarter GDP growth at a 51 percent annual rate,  rather than the 49 percent in the Greenbook     The strength in June exports is consistent with the basic message in the   Greenbook regarding the global economy Economic activity in the rest of  the world is expanding vigorously on average  Many industrial and  developing countries have gone a long way toward closing output gaps--in  some cases eliminating ones that had opened widely during the crisis years  of 1997-1998  Inflation pressures, while for the most part not too far  advanced, are beginning to threaten in some countries  In response, central  banks in several industrial and developing countries have already increased  official lending rates; and our Greenbook forecast incorporates the  assumption of further tightening moves       23    One notable exception in this generally favorable picture is Japan,   although some signs of economic recovery have emerged there as well  So  far, that recovery has largely taken the form of expanding private investment  spending, and it seems fragile to us   Japanese household consumption  spending remains restrained, although recent signs are positive  Fiscal  stimulus is likely to diminish next year, as some of the elements of the  supplementary package from nearly one year ago finally have their effect  but quickly run their course in the near term and others lapse without ever  being acted upon  We see real output in Japan continuing to grow, but  weakly  The Bank of Japan moved recently to end its zero interest rate  policy, amidst controversy with other government officials over whether the  conditions for such a move had yet arrived We judge that the pace of  recovery in Japan will not warrant further moves in the near term, and in our  forecast we have assumed no additional measures by the Bank of Japan over  the next six quarters     The projected strength of foreign output is an important factor   underpinning our outlook for continued robust growth of exports Another is  the moderate rate of decline we have again forecast for the exchange value  of the dollar, starting next quarter  The fundamental reason for this  expectation is the growing net international indebtedness of the United  States and the associated rising total of claims on the US economy in  foreign portfolios  But as the last few years have clearly shown, we have no  way of determining when the foreign appetite for dollar claims will stop  expanding  As long as foreign investors judge US investment  opportunities to be more attractive than those elsewhere, capital inflows will  respond, and the dollar could well remain strong  One argument in favor of  an early adjustment in the dollar is our expectation that further monetary  tightening moves abroad are likely in the near term, especially by the central  banks of key foreign industrial countries, whereas the Greenbook path  assumes an unchanged US federal funds rate until later in the forecast  period   The projected depreciation of the dollar also acts to slow import  demand in the Greenbook forecast         Because our path for the dollar has a sizable impact on the staff   outlook, we included in this Greenbook an alternative scenario using the  global model in which the dollar continues to strengthen throughout the  forecast period  In particular, we simulated the outcome under the  assumption that the dollar continues to trend up and by the end of next year  reaches a level about 8 percent above its second-quarter average  In that  case, the staff model suggests that both GDP growth and core inflation  would be about 1-2 percentage point lower in 2001 than in the current  forecast             24    It certainly is a reason why we thought this was the right time to include   that alternative as opposed to some other alternative  Nevertheless, it’s not unlike the problem   David described with respect to the stock market  Will 4 percent growth in 2001 come as a big   surprise to everybody?  In that case, a range of asset prices might adjust, including the US stock   market as well as the dollar  Will it come as a surprise to some but not to others, and will it have a   differential impact on assets?  We can’t rule that out in some sense  We’ve often seen news move   the bond market and stock market in ways that don’t seem entirely consistent     To be honest, I don’t know  I can tell you that most of the public forecasts that I’ve seen   do not have US net exports in the current account widening the way we do in 2001  And when I   look to see why, it’s because those forecasts have much lower US growth than we have  So I have   to believe that outcome, if it materializes, is going to be a surprise to some forecasters  But whether   it will be a surprise to investors is something we really have a hard time judging at this point     Let me answer the question in two halves  Under the assumption that   the same rules apply as have for years, I think in the face of rising inflation pressures--largely, if you   will, from spending shifting up in these economies--foreign central banks will bring about some,   though perhaps limited, increase in real interest rates  They aren’t just going to keep pace with   inflation, they are going to try to constrain it and they will have small increases in real interest rates   That is in effect what we were referring to when we said we see some increases even perhaps as   soon as two weeks from now  The market seems to think the ECB will act again that quickly,   although today’s news may have changed that  Today there was a weak survey number from   Germany     The question of whether or not the types of technological changes that have driven the   US secular and cyclical experience over the past several years are emerging abroad--and if so   where and at what pace--is consuming numerous researchers around the globe  And that includes   the people who work here in the International Finance Division  The clearest evidence is in   Australia, if we want to cite a foreign country as an example  The Australians see it happening, we   see it happening, and the world sees it happening in Australia  In other places people are looking as   carefully as they can and they are remaining skeptical  There are some small places in Europe where       28  we can see this sort of thing happening  Finland, oddly enough, is one and it’s not just Stolichnaya,   their vodka!  But, as I hinted in the Chart Show six weeks ago, we were looking in various countries   for venture capital spending, we were looking for the composition of investment, and we were   looking for the behavior of their stock markets  We were looking everywhere we could for evidence   of it  It should be there at some point  One can make arguments about why features of certain   economies may make them slower or less likely to incorporate technological change to their   advantage as quickly as we do  But it’s hard to believe that any of those constraints could actually   keep it from happening  Could the electrification of Europe have been suppressed by some kind of   bad structural policy three generations ago?  I doubt it  I don’t think technological change can be   completely suppressed now, even with some bad policy  So we are very alert to this  The fact is that   in putting together the Greenbook forecast, we were not able to find enough concrete evidence of it   happening yet that we felt we should try to factor it in systematically    I would point out that if I thought it were happening, I might be more aggressive in   lowering the dollar, in the sense that the attractiveness of investment opportunities in the United   States has been cited as one of the more important factors influencing the dollar  So, if those who   were doing the saving in the world came to believe that investments at home were on the cutting   edge, so to speak, I think they’d be only too happy to invest at home  And that could cause the   dollar to fall more rapidly than we’ve portrayed in the tiny depreciation we have in the Greenbook     It would benefit, yes     It does, although on the whole, given that our current account has   worsened and yet the dollar has risen, we’re inclined to explain that by saying the investment   opportunity mechanism has been more important for the United States over the last three years  "
4129,2000-10-03,"  As Dave noted, the extension of our forecast through 2002  provides an opportunity to consider some longer-term issues and risks  In  particular, the longer forecast horizon allows the implications of our projections  for foreign activity, the exchange value of the dollar, and, importantly, global  oil prices to be clearly evident in the outcome for real exports and imports  The basic picture we have presented for the rest of the world remains one of  robust growth with inflation that is largely contained  As always, a few spots  on the globe merit some concern on our part  Argentina has yet to achieve  sustained recovery from the recent crisis despite the rebound in growth in its  Latin trading partners  Some Asian economies, for example the Philippines and  Indonesia, still are struggling with the economic implications of what are  fundamentally social and political problems  And the picture remains  somewhat mixed among the transition economies of Eastern Europe   Nonetheless, to the extent we can discern such things, the risks in these  countries appear to be country-specific and not likely to trigger broader crises  and contagion should trouble erupt     In putting together the baseline forecast for the foreign outlook, we too  grappled with the issue of how best to frame the questions raised by the recent  shift up in spot and futures oil prices  We continued with our practice of relying  heavily on these market prices in specifying the path for global oil prices that is  incorporated in the outlook The view implicit in the futures curve that oil prices  are likely to come down over the near term as some elements in demand ease  off and supply remains steady seems reasonable  But the higher level for the  entire path relative to that in the August Greenbook reflects our agreement with  market sentiment of greater uncertainty about the balance of global supply and  demand over the forecast period than seemed to be the case six weeks ago   Nevertheless, we recognize that there are circumstances that could cause oil  prices to fall more rapidly than we have now in the forecast as well as others  that could generate further upward pressure in the short term     In the baseline Greenbook forecast, the implications for foreign real  economic activity of the more elevated path for oil prices vary--depending on  whether a country is a net exporter or importer--and are generally quite small   A small impact is consistent with the substantial reduction in the energy  intensiveness of real output in nearly every major country over the past thirty  years  In addition, we see the current upward pressure on oil prices resulting to  a significant extent from the strength of global demand  Global oil production  is now above the level reached before OPEC implemented supply restraints in  the spring of 1999  However, that supply has not been sufficient to keep prices  from rising in the face of the increased demand  Under these circumstances, we  do not anticipate that the elevated energy prices will have the negative effects  on business and consumer confidence that characterized previous oil crises        29  With oil inventories apparently low and supply disruptions still a  possibility, we included in the Greenbook an alternative scenario for oil prices   The particular path that we simulated is that of the price of oil rising to $40 per  barrel and remaining there over the entire forecast period  This alternative is  not the most likely path for prices in the event of a supply disruption  But it  does have the property that the oil price is high enough for long enough that our  models would show noticeable effects on real activity from the direct impact of  higher energy costs  For the United States, the assumption used in the model  about the response of monetary policy determines whether the impacts of higher  oil prices are almost entirely on prices--the outcome when the fed funds rate is  kept at the Greenbook baseline--or almost entirely on output, the outcome when  monetary policy is tightened in response to the increase in oil prices  Clearly,  intermediate outcomes with some effect on both inflation and output are  possible for monetary policy choices that are between these two     For the rest of the world, our model suggests that the impact of this higher   oil price path is noticeable, but not severe  The particular impact varies from  country to country, depending on its oil production status and on the strength of  links to the US economy and the US monetary policy response  Secondary  effects are transmitted across countries through relative exchange rate changes  that in turn depend upon the monetary policy responses to higher oil prices   Our model results suggest that over the next two years the impact on weighted  average foreign GDP growth could range from negative 01 to 03 percentage  point  The effects on US real exports and imports depend on the particular  US monetary policy assumptions, but on balance US real exports are boosted  because of the relatively large share of US exports to the oil-exporting  countries such as Mexico, Canada, the United Kingdom and OPEC  In nominal  terms, the higher cost of US oil imports swamps effects on our exports and  non-oil imports; accordingly, the US nominal trade deficit and current account  deficit widen significantly in response to the sustained higher oil price     As in the Greenbook, we did not put into this simulation additional   influences on private investment or consumption that might arise from  confidence factors  Such effects clearly could generate a more negative  outcome than this model simulation suggests  But any judgment on our part of  how large to make these negative effects under current circumstances would be  totally arbitrary     On balance, we are left with the conclusion that the effects of higher oil  prices per se are not likely to threaten our quite positive outlook for the global  economy  More negative outcomes are possible, but they depend importantly  on where the shock arises and how it is transmitted into the global economy     As a footnote, I would like to report on the Japanese Tankan survey for the  third quarter that was released overnight That survey showed a bit more  positive change than the markets or we were expecting  Most of the positive      30  news relates to responses from large manufacturers; small manufacturers and  non-manufacturers continue to lag somewhat behind  We continue to be  skeptical about the strength of the recovery in Japan and look for real GDP  growth there to remain positive over the next two years, but at annual rates of  growth in the 1 to 1-1/2 percent range      We’ll be happy to answer your questions           I don’t see that in the balance of payments data either  We’ll get Q3   data with some lag and then we’ll get the foreign direct investment numbers  It’s not until we   actually have the balance of payments data for the quarter that we get the FDI     We have portfolio numbers  I think there are hints in that but I   wouldn’t say there’s anything convincing one way or the other  But the Europeans, who on their   side may have more data by country that aren’t yet published, say this to me      If there is a slowdown, it’s not dramatic yet, that’s for sure  But the   Europeans seem to be of the view that there has been, and it may just be that they’re counting the   numbers associated with the mergers and acquisitions that are going through because in some sense   that is what has triggered some of the most visible flows  But that’s a very volatile series and it’s   hard to see whether a trend has really emerged in it       I might be bold enough to add a thought regarding domestic refining,   and that is the issue of maintenance  There is some question as to how much refining capacity will   be shut down for routine maintenance--whether or not that might be postponed a little  That could   give us some leeway to get a bit more product into inventory before the maintenance occurs   With respect to refining capacity overseas, the information I have is that the refineries are   operating at fairly high levels of capacity, but not at what one would describe an absolute maximum    So, there is a small amount of room there  As to whether in the end that would result in product      33  trades that we wouldn’t ordinarily see happening in the United States, I think there is some scope but   not much scope  And any accident in a refinery, or any type of unexpected shutdown, could   certainly change that picture quickly  "
4224,2000-12-19,"   Let me first update you on the implications for   our outlook of the data we have received since the Greenbook forecast  was finalized  Last week the balance of payments data for the third  quarter were released, and this morning trade data for October became  available  The nominal trade balance narrowed slightly in October to  $332 billion, with exports and imports both decreasing from their  September figures  On balance, these data released since last  Wednesday imply small changes to our outlook for the external sector  that net to essentially no change from the net export projection we  presented in the Greenbook     In putting together this forecast, we revised down our projection for   growth in our trading partners, with the downward adjustment averaging  about 3/4 percentage point at an annual rate in the near term but  diminishing over the forecast period  The extent of revision varies  across countries and regions  Still, real output growth abroad should  remain moderately strong and rebound a bit from the 3-1/4 percent pace  that we project for the near term to around 3-3/4 percent by the second  half of 2001 and during 2002       Three different sets of factors have become more visible over the   intermeeting period, leading us, as well as others, to become less  optimistic about the global economy  First are the direct effects of  slower growth of the US economy on the rest of the world  These  effects are strongest on our closest trading partners such as Canada and  Mexico but are significant elsewhere as well  In this set of factors I  include the projected impact on exports and imports that the improved  competitiveness of US products in all markets that results from the  change in the value of the dollar is projected to have       A second set of factors relates to the indirect effects of recent   developments in the US economy that are transmitted through global  financial markets  These include widespread equity price declines,  higher spreads for emerging market debt, and generally reduced  willingness to bear risk  To some degree, these shifts are happening in  global markets as investors react to changed perceptions about the US  economy and earnings prospects and rebalance their portfolios in order  to reduce overall risk or respond to major valuation changes  Less  optimistic expectations for the high-tech sector in the United States and  the pace of “new economy” investment translate into reduced profit  projections for industries in that sector globally, and the equity prices of  those firms have been depressed in most markets  These financial      16  market channels in turn have an impact on business and consumer  confidence and wealth abroad that lessens the outlook for domestic  demand in those countries       Finally, a third set of factors relates to developments in the global   economy not associated with recent US developments that imply a less  robust pace for foreign output growth  In principle, there are similar  factors that would boost foreign growth, but the last five weeks do not  seem to have yielded many of these  In this category belong financial  pressures in Argentina and in Turkey, which have become urgent   Although right now it appears that with the support of the IMF these  countries will avoid financial collapse and a forced change in exchange  rate regime, their prospects are darker than in November  In the case of  Argentina, the effects of this crisis on other emerging market countries  in the region have led us to reduce our forecast for output growth in  Latin America a bit more than we would otherwise have done  Political  stresses in some Asian economies, including the Philippines and  Indonesia, are an additional negative factor  In Japan, consumption  remains weak and the recovery has not succeeded in becoming  established  These developments are largely in line with our prior  expectations, which have been more pessimistic than consensus  forecasts  However, the prolonged failure of the Japanese economy to  rebound makes adjustment in the Asian emerging economies all the  more difficult     We have no precise way to separate and measure these three sets of   influences on foreign activity  The indicators that we rely upon to guide  our near-term forecast, such as orders data, confidence surveys, and the  elements of production, reflect all of these channels at work  The staff’s  global econometric model tells us that a shock to US investment  demand spills over to reduce average foreign GDP growth after four  quarters by about one third of the total impact on US GDP growth  when US monetary policy responds according to a Taylor rule  The  effects are strongest on Canadian and Mexican GDP growth, as would  be expected  This corresponds to what I have termed above the direct  effects of weaker US growth     In revising down our outlook for foreign growth by more than this   one-third rule of thumb would suggest, we have given some weight to  indirect effects not captured in the model  In particular, we think several  developing Asian economies rely heavily on the electronics industries  and will be hit hard, including through indirect financial channels  In  addition, a combination of wealth effects and blows to consumer and  business confidence are expected to reduce the growth of domestic  demand somewhat in several other industrial countries   We have no  illusion that we have gotten this just right  Clearly, we can imagine      17  “worse case” outcomes in which a global cycle of reduced demand,  diminished prospects for profits, asset price declines, and some further  reductions in demand spiral sharply down  But we think there are  macroeconomic safeguards out there, particularly in Europe and Canada,  that will moderate the deceleration in economic activity abroad and spur  an acceleration later in 2001 and 2002  Important among them are  planned fiscal stimulus and reasonably favorable credit expansion  conditions     While I cannot point to significant positive developments that   would have worked to offset those pointing to downward revision, there  are some steadying influences that at least kept our pessimism in check   Real output growth in China remains solid and should help to support  activity in Asia  Global oil prices still seem poised to decline  significantly going into next year  And growth in Europe, while  moderating, should remain sound     We would be happy to answer any questions   "
4270,2001-03-20,"  I’m going to cover some of these developments in my   briefing, so we might want to wait to discuss that  Actually though, I think there is some   uncertainty about both of those reports     Oh, Mr Murphy is definitely out and Mr Cavallo is in   Originally, Mr Cavallo had been named cabinet secretary or chief  Now it appears that   the current cabinet secretary might stay and that Mr Cavallo will take the economy   ministry post  But my guess is, whatever way it ends up, that he will have broad powers   indeed  "
4271,2001-03-20,"  Developments in the global economy are   moving quickly and not always in a welcome direction  This  morning I will comment briefly on developments that have emerged  since we prepared the Greenbook  They include the latest news  from the Bank of Japan, the further upward drift in the exchange  value of the dollar, the January trade data that were released this  morning, and developments in potential crisis countries     On Monday, the Bank of Japan announced a set of measures   that effectively reinstates the zero interest rate policy and that  changes its operating procedures  This move is in response to a  growing perception that the Japanese economy is in danger of  sliding into recession and that the problems within the Japanese  financial sector have become critical  Markets were expecting the  return to zero interest rates, but were surprised by the scope of the  changes announced by the Bank  The Bank will now implement  policy by targeting the outstanding balances that private financial  institutions hold with it rather than aiming for a particular overnight  interest rate  The proposed increase in those balances from the  current 4 trillion yen level to 5 trillion yen should lower the  overnight interest rate to zero  In an effort to convince markets that  short rates will remain there, and thus to induce lower rates farther     3/20/01 13  out the maturity spectrum as well, the Bank pledged to keep these  balances elevated until year-on-year CPI inflation stabilizes at zero  or above  Moreover, the Bank also announced its willingness to  purchase additional JGBs, if necessary  With Japanese markets  closed today for a holiday, we have few direct readings on market  reaction to the announcement  Long-term interest rates, which had  moved down to 116 percent through Friday, have edged down  further in London trading since the announcement      The move toward additional monetary ease is part of a broad set   of initiatives announced by various Japanese officials in recent  weeks  These announcements have included plans to achieve a  more complete resolution of non-performing loans in the banking  system, to put in place mechanisms to provide support for equity  prices, and to change taxes and regulatory provisions so as to  increase liquidity and trading in the real estate markets       In the Greenbook forecast, we had anticipated that the return by   the Bank of Japan to zero overnight interest rates would come soon  However, we remain somewhat skeptical about the commitment to  effective reform by the Japanese government, given contradictory  statements by various officials and the lack of strong political  leadership, with Prime Minister Mori apparently on the verge of  stepping down and no other politician coming forward to lead the  reform effort  As a consequence, we revised down our Greenbook  forecast for real output growth in Japan this year to minus 1/2  percent  The Bank of Japan’s announcement makes us slightly  more optimistic  But much depends on how market expectations  change and whether other elements of the needed reforms proceed,  especially those for the financial sector  Overall, we now see the  situation as better balanced, with some upside risk as well as  substantial downside risk to our baseline forecast      The series of disappointing data releases and yet more policy   announcements were accompanied by further depreciation of the  yen; over the intermeeting period, the yen moved down more than 6  percent in terms of the dollar, with much of that occurring last week  and early this week  The dollar gained as well against the Canadian  dollar and the euro  On balance, the staff’s index of the dollar in  terms of the currencies of other major countries has risen more than  4 percent over the intermeeting period  This greater strength of the  dollar at a time of significant slowing in the rate of growth of US  output and further downward adjustment in US equity prices is  somewhat puzzling  One possible explanation is that market  participants share our view that the slowing in the US economy  will prove to be short lived and that the perceived rate of return on     3/20/01 14  US assets over the longer run remains relatively attractive   Indeed, the market may be reflecting expectations that ECB  officials will be reluctant to ease as their economies slow, further  impairing the attractiveness of European assets  There may also be,  as Dino mentioned, some safe-haven incentives contributing to  flows into dollar assets, as asset markets globally have become  more volatile      January trade data were released this morning  The nominal   deficit on goods and services was $333 billion, little different from  our Greenbook projection and about in line with market  expectations  In January, both exports and imports moved up  slightly from December but remained below their fourth-quarter  averages  On balance, these data for trade, in conjunction with the  balance of payments data for the fourth quarter that we received late  last week, would not change our forecast significantly from that in  the Greenbook     Finally, some emerging market countries continue to attract our   attention and the attention of markets as well  On Monday, Turkey  and the IMF announced the framework of a new IMF program of  financial support, following floating of the lira on February 22  The  Fund signaled that it has no immediate plans to offer new money   For this program to succeed, difficult policy measures will be  required of the Turkish authorities  Without serious effort by them  and the maintenance of confidence on the part of private creditors,  there is a risk of failure  Currently, markets seem to be awaiting  more information about the specifics of the program       In addition, Argentina is again experiencing political stress   related to its economic policy agenda  Last Friday, Economy  Minister Lopez Murphy announced a set of fiscal measures that  implied serious fiscal restraint in order to come close to the  performance criteria established in Argentina’s IMF program  This  announcement triggered the resignation of several members of the  cabinet who represent the left wing of the coalition  Since then,  former Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo has agreed to join the  government, while last night Lopez Murphy resigned after only two  weeks in office  The implications of these moves for the course of  policy remain uncertain, although it may be that the fiscal restraint  will be lessened  On Monday, S&P put the ratings of Argentine  borrowers on credit watch with negative outlook, and asset markets  reacted adversely  Both the political risks and the economic risks in  Argentina remain high       We’d be happy to answer any questions     3/20/01 15         I think they came as close to inflation targeting as they could   comfortably, given what they had said publicly not too long ago about it being   inappropriate at this time  I see the announcement in some sense as a grand compromise,   an attempt to be a little something for everybody  The people who have been advocating   inflation targeting or other kinds of expectations adjustment steps got a statement that   reserves will remain at this elevated level until deflation had ceased, until it is at zero or   slightly positive  So that is implicitly, I think, an inflation target of zero or a small   positive number     Had they announced a higher number, I think it would not   have been credible  So in my view they made a reasonable compromise on that score    Those people who have been arguing for some kind of liquidity-based, unconventional   steps got a switch to reserve targeting instead of the current policy of interest rate   targeting  They got promises that the government might indeed buy more JGBs--not a   commitment, but at least an open door to that idea  So the people who have been pushing     3/20/01 16  in that direction got a signal that the government is prepared to do that and will in fact be   doing that to some extent    So the answer to your question is yes, but not exclusively  They have shown   flexibility to all of these options that have been in the air now for so long  But as they   pointed out themselves, and as I think is understood by most of the people in Japan, these   steps are not in and of themselves going to move the Japanese economy into recovery    They will facilitate the success of other measures, but they are not sufficient by   themselves to bring about a real turnaround     In that vein, the talk of Hayami having to resign if Japan moved back to a   policy of zero interest rates seemed to have evaporated about a month ago  I have not   heard any suggestion that his resignation is imminent  In fact, the talk that they were   reluctant to make that move because it would lead to his resignation is now all in the   background  That may be because of the increased urgency we’ve seen in these various   announcements in the past month or so and the heightened perception of the trouble   they’re in       It’s a skepticism about their ability to accomplish it, not   about their perception that it’s necessary  I think the biggest problem facing Japan right   now is political  They are simply politically very weak  The LDP doesn’t seem to know   what to do  There are a few persons in the past six months or so who have articulated   some strong views but they do not seem to have been able to build a sufficient political   base to carry the day  The fact is that Prime Minister Mori is still in office  There is talk   about moving up the day on which somebody else will take over the LDP but then   denying that that’s a resignation  The issue of the upper house election in July is a kind   of hurdle for the party  If they had a strong person, they would have dumped Mori and   put that person in  There’s a vacuum of political leadership, not a lack of awareness of   what the problems are  The LDP is not in a good position in the sense that the problems   that need fixing are basically in the areas of the private sector where they have gotten   their greatest support over the years  Let me add a footnote to what I just said  I think   the leaders of Japan understand  I don’t think they believe the people they rely on--the   businessmen and the local officials--understand  The leaders believe that if they take the   steps necessary, those people will not support them, maybe out of pure self-interest or   maybe from a lack of awareness  So they are caught because they can’t turn on their own   supporters until everybody understands that that is the only alternative, and they aren’t   quite there yet  At the level of public officials, the problem is more a lack of political   will than anything else  Our giving them a carefully reasoned argument isn’t going to   change anything  That is not the problem       3/20/01 18    I have been in Tokyo very seldom and I don’t pretend to   have close contacts, but it’s certainly my impression that the population in Japan does not   act as if the country is in crisis  They do not act, after 10 years in which these problems   have plagued the economy, as if they are prepared to do anything in an effort to solve   them  They get up and go to work  They seem resigned to the present situation and not   terribly unhappy with it  So in that sense I think your point is valid  But I read into the   events of the past two months a heightened awareness of the bigger picture on the part of   the people who are in a position to do something  They understand that the financial   sector was put at such huge risk by the declines in the stock market  They understand   that there is a serious probability that the economy will slip into an outright recession   again, which would put further pressure on asset prices and could cause a real financial   crisis  I think that awareness is not generally appreciated  Both the insurance companies   and the financial intermediaries have very serious problems  A further downward   movement in stock prices is only going to aggravate those problems  There is an urgency   here  But you are quite right that the man in the street does not seem to feel that sense of   urgency     But only maybe!     There is no interest rate arbitrage condition that is going to   give you that one!     Yes, I suppose  We’ve actually done some research on that    We’ve taken a sort of kitchen sink approach and put everything we can think of on the   right hand side of the equation and sorted through the most recent data  It did not yield   any real breakthrough  It didn’t give relative growth rates quite as much of a major role   as one might have thought, although the usual things appear in that equation  Our   research did not suggest that we have to throw out all we think we know, but the data   didn’t fit very well either, frankly     I’m a bit reluctant to get entirely on this relative growth   bandwagon, even though I think market participants see the ECB’s constant statements   that they are somehow not very vulnerable to the rest of the global economy--that they’re   going to do just fine and therefore don’t need to ease--as worrisome  I believe that’s   weighing on the euro, and that’s why I put that sentence in my remarks  But you know,   up until a year ago we all thought a primary factor was relative stock markets  The talk     3/20/01 20  was that somehow once the US stock market began to go down, that was going to be a   major event for the dollar and, in fact, that was perhaps the biggest reason to worry about   the stock market  Never mind the economy, never mind the wealth effect, a decline in   our stock market was going to cause this enormous disruption in exchange markets  We   all believed that until it didn’t happen  So it makes me a little leery of getting too   enthusiastic about this notion that relative growth is really the story  There is a kind of   market confidence, in a long-term perspective, with respect to investing in the United   States as a business opportunity that dominates other business opportunities  Japan   certainly doesn’t offer that opportunity and apparently Europe doesn’t offer it  And in   this game of there being only three major currencies, that notion seems to prevail despite   cyclical events     That certainly could be  The fact is, even though the   volume is reduced, that we still have a plateful of merger and acquisition announcements   and so forth on the table  In that vein, we received one unexpected bit of information   from the fourth-quarter balance-of-payments data  Many of the elements of the data are   already known before the actual tables are produced, but we don’t know anything related   to direct investment  And one surprise out of the fourth-quarter data was a big reduction   in the flow of direct investment payments abroad  That is, people holding direct   investments in the United States took a real beating in the fourth quarter and got much   less income than they might have expected from their investments  That’s no doubt   reflective of where the US economy was in the fourth quarter and, hopefully, it will   bounce back  But if that’s a big part of the picture and earnings that people make on their   foreign direct investments in the United States disappoint again, that could produce some   changes     Well, I’m just thinking that in retrospect some people--the   Japanese no doubt--didn't really think some of the investments they made in this country   in the 1980s were such a good idea  And it’s possible some of the Europeans will come   to that view about the 1990s  "
4314,2001-05-15,"   Yes  I think your comments summarized the situation  I would just   add that the Mexicans want the ending of these swaps to be part of a series of actions they are     5/15/01     8   planning, having to do with some internal reforms they’re attempting  Their hope is to get a   CCL relationship established with the IMF, which would be a very logical and natural point to   end the swaps with us rather than have their demise hit the markets out of the blue as an isolated   event  The Mexicans are not yet at that point, but we’re agreed that that is where they are headed   and, hopefully, they will get there fairly soon     We don’t have a firm commitment from either the Mexicans or the Canadians on   discontinuing the swaps  So in some sense it’s not a done deal  But there’s a shared objective  I   think it’s simply a question of getting it done as opposed to trying to persuade them to do   something that they fundamentally don’t want to do       I think it differs among the various people involved in the Canadian   situation     Well, from the point of view of those in the central bank who were   described to me as having at least paused when this was suggested, the swap could be a useful     5/15/01     9   instrument  If they never used it, that was fine  But the view was  Why give it away if they   don’t have to?     I wouldn’t lay it at his feet  As I understood it, the hesitation came   more from the operational people--those who carry out policy--rather than those who make   policy     They see the swaps as an extra source of funds they can use if they   ever want to, so why give that up?  I don’t believe there’s really any thoughtful resistance  "
4315,2001-05-15,"  Our outlook for real output growth abroad this time   has been revised down, particularly in the very near term, as data for  several key regions suggest more weakness than we had previously  incorporated in the forecast We still look for the projected rebound in  US real GDP growth, along with past and prospective stimulus from  macroeconomic policy abroad, to contribute to strengthening growth  later this year and next in other regions of the globe      There are important differences in the risks we see in our forecasts   for several countries or regions, and my remarks this morning will  highlight the vulnerabilities we see as looming in some cases and the  upside risks we see in others     The staff’s forecast for Japanese real output growth remains   pessimistic in this Greenbook  The latest indicators of economic  activity, including industrial production, machinery shipments, and new  car registrations for March, suggest that the Japanese economy is  stalling  The momentum necessary for strong private investment to be  sustained has not developed, and the March Tankan survey showed  further declines in business sentiment, especially in the manufacturing  sector  Consumption spending has shown some resilience, but not  enough to spark real recovery in domestic demand  With global demand  softening, the outlook is for export growth to remain weak until late this  year or next year     That said, there are developments in Japan, both on the economic and   political fronts, that we are uncertain just how to factor into our forecast   The spate of bad economic news triggered yet another round of policy  announcements by Japanese officials, including the moves taken by the  Bank of Japan on the day before the March FOMC meeting  And public  support for reform appears to be the reason for the surprise election of  Koizumi as the new head of the LDP and prime minister  He faces a  daunting challenge in moving the LDP and the government bureaucracy  to embrace and actively implement aggressive reform  With an Upper  House election looming in July, he appears to be pushing for the reform  agenda but has yet to provide details of what is to be done and when      5/15/01     16   Meanwhile, we remain of the view that the measures announced by the  Bank of Japan will not by themselves boost growth securely into the  positive range soon  Overnight interest rates have returned to zero, but  the BOJ is experiencing difficulty injecting its targeted level of liquidity  through repo auctions  With banks underbidding the desired repo  quantity, the BOJ will have to consider using outright purchases more  intensively       We do not see these latest political developments and policy plans as   providing any basis for a significantly more optimistic forecast for  Japanese real GDP growth over the next year and a half  And we have  revised our outlook for the quarterly pattern this year while leaving  growth on balance in 2001 near zero  In 2002, it strengthens slightly   However, Koizumi’s arrival on the scene does widen the confidence  band about our outlook  On the up side, progress on reform might now  be more likely and, in turn, could spark a revival of confidence on the  part of households and firms, encouraging them to spend  On the down  side, aggressive reforms, when implemented, would force bankruptcies  and restructuring that over the forecast period could yield an even more  negative outcome for Japan than we now project  The direct beneficial  effects from any reforms will no doubt take some time to appear     We have revised down our outlook for near-term growth of real GDP   in the euro area, as weaker confidence measures and declines in orders  confirm that the global slowdown will not leave the euro area unscathed   The surprise cut of 25 basis points in the official lending rate of the ECB  last Thursday was a bit sooner than what we had incorporated into the  Greenbook forecast but not so soon as to require a revision to our  forecast  European stock markets showed considerable volatility as  equity prices, particularly for the high-tech sector, came down and  earnings expectations in that sector plunged  Nevertheless, the output of  high-tech industries is such a small portion of total production in the  euro area that we do not expect the global weakness in high tech to have  a major effect there  Although we have adjusted down the numbers for  Germany a bit, we still see euro area growth next year as rebounding to  about 2-3/4 percent from about 2 percent this year     Among the emerging market countries, the greatest uncertainties   surround the outlook for Argentina  A new understanding has been  reached with the IMF for proceeding with the existing support program;  it is scheduled for approval by the IMF Executive Board next week  In  the meantime, Argentine officials have been working toward a proposed  swap of around $20 billion of outstanding debt with the private sector in  order to lengthen the maturity of government obligations and to create a  more sustainable amortization time profile for 2002 and beyond  Market  indications raise serious concerns about whether the swap will be     5/15/01     17   workable, given the high levels of interest rates currently  The rating  agencies have downgraded Argentine government debt and banks in  recent days  The latest tax revenues have disappointed on the low side,  despite the new tax on financial transactions that was just introduced       We see the Argentine situation as precarious  It is not hard to   imagine a sequence of events that would force some discrete response,  perhaps default or some kind of unilateral debt restructuring, perhaps  devaluation, or perhaps both  It is impossible for us to know just when  such events might occur or precisely what their implications will be   Recent exchange market pressure on the Brazilian real suggests that  Brazil is vulnerable to some contagion  To date, Mexico seems much  less vulnerable  We have not attempted to incorporate a breakdown in  the Argentine situation into the Greenbook forecast, but we have posited  weak growth in Argentina throughout the forecast period and have  revised down somewhat our growth outlook for Brazil, owing to a  tightening of monetary conditions by the central bank in response to the  inflation risk posed by the exchange rate pressures       Some progress has been made in Turkey, but serious doubts remain    Agreement on a Letter of Intent has been reached with the IMF for a  revised program  Together the IMF and World Bank will provide an  additional $10 billion, for a total of $19 billion  Success in arriving at  terms for privatizing Turk Telecom has been achieved, but at  considerable political stress  The current government seems to be less  than secure  With the extent of fiscal restraint contained in the program  substantial, it is easy to doubt whether the fiscal objectives can be  reached  As of now, it does seem that the spillover effects from yet  another failure of the Turkish support program would be limited, with  little effect on our outlook for the US economy        Well, as you saw in the Greenbook, we think this deflation will   continue for at least the six quarters that remain in our forecast horizon  There aren’t too many   more steps that the Bank of Japan could take in a monetary policy sense  And I am impressed by   the fact that they have basically driven the cost of liquidity to zero in that economy  We could   see that in many different ways  One avenue, of course, is the exchange rate  That is, this   liquidity could have as a consequence further declines in the yen, which could at some point help   in this respect  We got a bit cautious I suppose--or took a middle course--in thinking about the   dollar this time and we have basically extended both the yen and euro at a fairly flat rate  We are   just very reluctant to put into our forecast at this point a big appreciation of the dollar and a big   depreciation of the yen because there are so many reasons why that shouldn’t happen  On the   other hand, from the point of view of the Japanese economy there are many reasons why it   should     It seems largely caught up in market expectations on the one hand   and the politics of the situation on the other  And the politics extend not just to the dollar/yen   and US/Japan relationship, but to various trading partners and the concerns they express from   time to time about what a big depreciation in the yen would do  We still see the fundamental   problem in Japan as a need for serious reform on the structural side of that economy  We would   like to see those reforms in some respect bring relative prices in Japan, particularly between   traded and nontraded goods, back in line with the levels we see elsewhere--and yet for that to   occur without furthering deflation because that does have consequences  But I don’t have really     5/15/01     22   specific answers to offer you in terms of a solution and how they could bring that about  The   banking system, consumer spending, and household incomes are all negatively affected by the   ongoing deflation  We still see statements by Japanese officials that they can’t do certain things   or they can’t do them quickly or they can’t do them one way, they have to do them another way   because of what they view as political constraints on the options they face  So, basically, I am   inherently still pessimistic about how this will play out  "
4405,2001-10-02,"  In trying to come to grips with the implications  of recent events for the forecast, we were confident that we knew in  which direction to revise foreign growth as a result of information  learned since the August Greenbook down But it was much less clear  to us how to assess the magnitude of that revision for individual foreign  countries and for foreign growth on average   Our downward revision to the forecast for foreign growth has  three components  (1) incorporation of the news about economic  activity in the second quarter and some indicators for July and August  that have become available since the August forecast was completed;  (2) assessment of the implications for foreign economies of the new  outlook for the United States; and (3) consideration of the extent to  which the events of September 11, through asset prices, confidence  factors, and key global prices and industries, will influence real output  growth abroad in addition to the direct impact transmitted by US  demand for imports from the rest of the world  The difficulties we  confronted stemmed from our lack of information about real economic  activity in the days since September 11 and the inherent uncertainty of  prospective effects in the rest of the world as foreign consumers and  business firms react to events that, at least so far, have occurred within  the United States   As we reported in the Greenbook, the economic data that had  become available in recent weeks suggested a more depressed global  economy than we had expected  This was particularly the case for the  emerging Asian economies  There, the news was most negative for  those whose exports of high-tech products were linked to investment  spending in the United States and in other industrial countries   However, there were disappointing data for other countries, including  such industrial countries as Canada and Japan  Incorporation of this  information accounts for a significant share of our downward revision  to foreign growth   As has been evident in the global slowdown to date, a  substantially weaker outlook for US real GDP has clear implications,  in the same direction, for real output growth abroad  Those effects are  largest for our principal trading partners, such as Canada and Mexico      10/2/01 20   However, for other regions of the globe, such as Europe, the  consequences of second and third round effects through multilateral  trading relationships are far from negligible  Should we be further  surprised by developments in the US economy, either positively or  negatively, there would be a significant reinforcement of that surprise  as output in foreign economies responded to the changed demand from  the United States   My third category of factors includes the host of reactions within  the foreign countries and in global markets to the events of September  11 We have seen net declines in stock markets abroad as large as 18  percent Our research and that of others suggest that the effect on  consumption of such changes in wealth will not be as large abroad as in  the United States, but the reaction will be significant  Similarly, we  expect that confidence of consumers and businesses will be impaired by  varying degrees across the rest of the world  We have a few bits of  partial information from surveys that included responses after  September 11 that confirm substantial drops in confidence  The latest  Japanese Tankan survey, released on Monday, fell more than expected  to its lowest level since June 1999 for the overall index  At this point,  we can only guess how widespread the reaction of confidence abroad  will be, how long it will persist, and how much it will contribute to  lessening domestic demand in foreign countries      We also have incorporated into this forecast available information  from global markets  With respect to oil prices, the spot price of WTI  has moved down, on balance, more than 15 percent since September 10,  and futures prices call for it to move down slightly further  Market  participants seem to be anticipating that reduced global demand for oil  will be met by only limited supply cuts by OPEC  The recent  international meeting of oil producers ended with no agreed reductions  in production quotas despite the fact that spot prices were below the  target range for OPEC’s basket   The global market for high-tech products in general, and  semiconductors in particular, is an important element behind our  projections for the emerging Asian economies  Weakness in this sector  underlies the significantly greater-than-expected declines in output that  were recorded in the second quarter in Malaysia, Singapore, and  Taiwan We have little hard information about inventories or  production beyond August Our projection that output in the region  will recover next year depends upon some improvement in this sector   We asked ourselves in which foreign countries scope might exist  for additional policy response to the further downward pressure on  demand  Among the industrial countries, monetary policy has been     10/2/01 21   broadly eased during the first half of this year, and eight major foreign  central banks cut rates further following your action on September 17   Our forecast assumes that additional easing moves will be taken in  Europe and Canada by year-end Some emerging market central banks  had been easing as well, as the global economy slowed and demand  weakened within their economies  However, we expect that external  financing pressures will likely intensify, in particular for Latin  American countries with external deficits, making it less likely that  monetary easing will be enacted there    Within Europe and in Canada, fiscal policy should be somewhat  supportive of growth in 2002 as tax revenues fall and deficits widen; we  do not expect significant discretionary easing measures  In Japan,  however, the long-standing problems within that economy and the  agenda of the Koizumi government to implement fiscal reform are  expected to result in moderate fiscal contraction during next year  Most  emerging market economies have little scope to increase expenditures  or cut taxes One important exception is China, where continued  government spending is expected to support growth during the second  half of this year and next year Other East Asian developing countries  announced some fiscal stimulus measures earlier this year   The downside risks to this forecast are distressingly clear  The hit  to confidence from the terrorist attacks, coming at a time when output  abroad was already decelerating, could set off a mutually reinforcing  cycle of production and employment cuts, downward earnings  revisions, lower asset prices, and additional drops in confidence  Our  expectation of a rebound next year is based primarily on the projected  turnaround in the United States, recognition that monetary stimulus has  been implemented in the major countries, and our judgment that  inventory adjustments abroad should be nearing completion by then   There is no evidence as yet on which to base resolution of the timing  and pace of recovery   That said, we may be too close to the events of September 11 to  judge how countries more distant from those events will respond  We  were aggressive in our reaction to the economic data and world news  since the August Greenbook It is possible that the effects of the attacks  on growth abroad will be even more muted in comparison to that in the  United States than we have projected  The possibility of such an  outcome constitutes upside risk to our forecast                 Well, to be honest I did include them in the eight because   they cut what they call the overnight discount rate, which is a kind of Lombard rate    Technically it’s an official lending rate of the Bank of Japan and they reduced it, so I said   okay, they are one of my eight  And I think they intended, both from the timing of the   announcement and the way they expressed it, to indicate that they were going to do what   they could along with their brother central banks to weather the storm of this particular   financial crisis They wanted to be supportive, in the sense of aiding short-term liquidity   and market functioning and so forth in the immediate aftermath of the attacks   I think this period is somewhat of a crossroads for them  I interpret the   intervention that they did and their decision to let the reserves stay in the system as an   opening Perhaps they are thinking of deliberately using transactions in the exchange   markets--a concept they had resisted for some time--as opposed to operations in the   domestic money markets as a way of getting more liquidity out there  The combination   of circumstances created an appropriate meeting of the minds between the Ministry of   Finance and the Bank of Japan with regard to undertaking these transactions  They   responded in the way we’ve all urged them to respond  I took that to be a fairly positive        10/2/01 25   sign It remains to be seen what they will do going forward, because at least today, for   example, the yen has softened and has not moved up from its low  It’s possible that a lot   of the pressure on the yen has had to do with the end of their fiscal half-year on   September 30th When that is taken out of the picture, I think it remains a completely   open question as to whether the Bank of Japan will revert to its previous practice and say,   “Well, that approach was fine then but it’s not appropriate right now”  I am very   pessimistic that this is a truly long-lasting change in their approach, but I think what they   did in the weeks since September 11th was in the right direction and they could surprise   us They could be more aggressive than they’ve given signs of so far     Prior to September 11th, I think the people in the   International Division who closely watch Japan were trying to talk themselves into being   slightly more optimistic about Japan than we had been for a while, and we’ve been rather   pessimistic all along  We were trying to see some energy in the Koizumi reform,   although what the government has done since the upper house election in July     10/2/01 26   disappointed us because instead of running with the reform and building on it they   seemed to be backing off and hemming and hawing  But there were some shreds of signs   of things possibly not getting worse at least  It’s hard to say whether September 11th will   really change that for them  There are no direct implications for Japan except for the loss   in export potential from the rest of the world and certainly from the United States  I think   they’re so bound up in their own problems that I don’t have a sense--or they weren’t able   to tell us is a better way to put it--of whether the Tankan survey was heavily influenced   by the attacks or not A significant portion of the survey responses were received by the   agency after September 11th, but they made no effort and really had no way to tell how   many had been filled out after September 11th I think we are at risk of that economy   remaining moribund--sitting there more or less doing nothing for quite some time--and   largely for political reasons Now, whether that would spark a real political overturn in   Japan I am certainly not the person to say  Obviously, in most other countries it would   have happened long ago  So it just defies my ability to judge  Personally, I had thought   Koizumi might make a difference but I think circumstances are conspiring against that at   the present time    "
4451,2001-11-06," We revised down our forecast for growth of real  output abroad once again in this Greenbook In part, we were reacting to the  information received over the intermeeting period about production and spending  in foreign economies  In part, we were recognizing that more pronounced  weakness in the US economy in the very near term implied more of the same  for many of our trading partners  We now estimate that real GDP contracted at  an annual rate of about 1/2 percent during the third quarter and expect that a  similar outcome will be recorded for the current quarter  This projection of  prolonged contraction in our average measure of foreign real output reflects  widespread negative growth among the developing countries during the second  half of this year  Among the industrial countries, recession in Japan is ongoing  while the picture elsewhere is mixed Real output appears to have turned down  in Canada, to have become stagnant, at best, in the euro area, but to have  continued to show a bit of resilience in the United Kingdom   In constructing this forecast, we struggled with the need to specify the  intensity and duration of the downturn abroad  The Greenbook baseline paints a  picture of a global economy that is sluggish in the first half of next year and has  clearly begun to rebound by the second half  Although we can identify the  factors that we think will lie behind this path, we would be the first to admit that     11/6/01 14   picking the turning point requires a crystal ball rather than an economic model   In addition, news since the Greenbook forecast was finalized reinforces the  downside risks to the baseline   Our forecast calls for improvement in the developing countries to be  evident early in the new year  For many Asian emerging market economies, this  outcome will depend importantly on an end to the deterioration in the demand  for high-tech goods and the beginnings of a recovery in production in that sector   It will depend as well on continued robust expansion in China, one of the few  countries or regions in the global economy that has not shared in the widespread  slowdown Stability in global oil prices at recent lower levels will help, along  with supportive macroeconomic policy in some of these countries   The widespread recovery of foreign activity during 2002 depends  critically on the rebound that is projected for the United States  Simply put, we  are counting on the range of direct and indirect linkages--through which the  slowing of US growth over the past year imparted downward pressure on the  rest of the world--to transmit positive spillovers  Strengthening of the US  economy will boost confidence, support asset prices, stimulate demand for  exports from our trading partners to the United States, and contribute to a  recovery in investment spending  For the major industrial countries, domestic  policy stimulus of varying amounts is in the pipeline  Since their respective  peaks, official lending rates to date have been lowered 300 basis points in  Canada, 150 basis points in the United Kingdom, and 100 basis points in the euro  area We are expecting another 25 basis points soon by each of these three  central banks, perhaps later this week in some cases, and a further 25 basis points  by the ECB sometime in the first half of 2002  Fiscal stimulus was injected  during 2001 in Canada, the United Kingdom, and several of the major euro-area  countries We expect some additional expansionary measures during 2002 in  Canada and the United Kingdom, where surpluses allow more room for  maneuver        Two spots in the global economy--Japan and Argentina--are especially  troubled by problems that are largely, but not entirely, domestic  The latest  releases of economic indicators paint a bleak picture for real economic activity in  Japan And we see little in the prospects for either monetary or fiscal policy that  could spark a turnaround in spending  The supplementary budget that now  seems on track for passage in the Diet soon will provide a partial offset to what  would otherwise be a large contractionary impulse from fiscal policy  But we do  not see the measures now planned as up to the task of preventing further declines  in real GDP during the first half of 2002 By the second half of next year, we  have projected an anemic return to positive growth as private investment  spending stops falling and stabilizes and as exports swing from declining to  increasing Both of these developments depend importantly on a general  recovery in the global economy, including in the high-tech sector     11/6/01 15   The situation in Argentina is evolving as we speak The chaotic  events of last week have brought into the open the prospect of a sovereign debt  restructuring that now seems inevitable  The scope and terms of such a  restructuring are slowly being proposed  Spreads on Argentine dollar- denominated sovereign debt spiked above 2500 basis points yesterday, as the  market price of the widely watched bond that matures in 2008 fell to nearly 40  cents on the dollar Deposit outflows from Argentine banks, where pesos and  dollars still exchange one for one, have risen over the past week or so and  shipments of dollar currency from US banks to Argentine counterparts have  again jumped    Two “events” appeared to accelerate the downward spiral of the  ongoing Argentine crisis last week  One was the apparent failure of the de la  Rua government to reach agreement with key provincial governors over the  dispute about revenue sharing between the provinces and the federal  government  Some compromise is needed in order for the government to  achieve its stated fiscal objectives  A second bit of “news” was the statement by  an IMF official during a press conference that acceleration of the planned  December disbursements of IMF funds to Argentina was not being considered,  thus quashing widespread expectations that those funds would be distributed  shortly Late in the week, Argentine officials apparently felt the need to  announce something, so President de la Rua made a statement on Argentine  television that included some minor reforms of the tax and pension systems  aimed at stimulating the economy  He also called for a debt exchange, with the  intent of reducing interest costs on the debt, particularly in the near term, but as  of now there is no proposal for additional funds from the IMF or other sources to  support an “orderly” exchange  The government’s explicit position to date is  that there will be no change in the current exchange rate regime     In our Greenbook forecast, we have projected that real GDP will  decline sharply in Argentina during 2002 and then be about flat on balance over  2003 While the actual path will no doubt differ from this, a substantial decline  in output in Argentina is unavoidable over the forecast period  Our current  thinking is that negative spillovers to real output growth of other countries in the  region will be limited  This round of problems in Argentina has been unfolding  for about a year, and financial market developments support the view that market  participants do distinguish both Brazil and Mexico from Argentina  Spreads for  Brazil remain around 1100, with those for Mexico much lower, and both the  Brazilian real and the Mexican peso have appreciated on balance over the  intermeeting period  Thus, despite the imponderables of the Argentine situation,  we see average output growth in Latin America turning positive next year and  strengthening further in 2003, similar to the pattern projected for the Asian  emerging market economies and the foreign industrial countries  "
4452,2001-11-06," Pardon me, but it’s a measurement issue, isn’t it?  The GDP doesn’t   measure increased security; it doesn’t give better security a positive weight  Is there a way to get the   word “measurement” in here?   SPEAKER(?)  Measured productivity  "
4500,2001-12-11," Yes, she is, thank you  "
4554,2002-03-19,"  If I may interject, Mr Chairman?  I would note that the one-year   forward rate yesterday was 48 pesos per dollar    There’s not enough economic activity going on in Argentina to know—   even in domestic trading much less anything that would involve the purchase of imported goods   and the reaction of wages or the pass-through or any of that  Ironically, the situation is so bad   that it may be that what they really should do is let the inflation rip because it would depreciate     March 19, 2002 Page 7 of 117  the real value of outstanding debts that they can’t pay  The stress of trying to protect value and   pay those debts underlies many of their political problems  I don’t know, frankly, anything to   suggest to them  If you sent me down there as the Czar of Argentina, I would not know how to   fix the present situation     The IMF task force that was there has gone home  They were subject   to immense scrutiny in the Argentine press  Even people on the street knew the names of those   on the IMF task force, which is something that is very unusual  The government in power now   continues to blame others for their problems  They blame past IMF policies; they blame foreign   lenders; they blame the foreign banks  They blame anybody but themselves  The public has lost   confidence in most institutions  It’s not clear whether they’ve lost confidence in the central   bank But the central bank is in a very difficult position because if they try now to keep the   inflation rate contained, then this device of basically wiping the slate clean and starting over by   just letting the inflation rip won’t happen  And the political struggle to fight over the crumbs that   are left will continue So in some respects, as outrageous as it may sound, it might be better if   the central bank just looked the other way for a while     Oh, it used to be It isn’t any more  By a stroke of the pen, they have   “pesofied” virtually everything They cannot do that to the debt they owe to foreigners because   foreigners basically will just say “no”     But anything that is circulating internally has been pesofied    "
4555,2002-03-19,"  This morning the trade data for January have just been released   These data show a deficit of $285 billion, somewhat wider than in December and  than we had incorporated in the Greenbook baseline  Compared with the revised  December data, exports of goods and services were about flat  Imports rose  somewhat, just about returning to their November level  When translated into real  terms, these data on balance do not suggest any significant change to the staff’s  outlook for growth in the first quarter, as the slightly lower real net exports than we  were expecting in the Greenbook might easily be offset by a small change in our  forecast for inventories   In line with the positive shift in the outlook for the US economy in the  Greenbook, our forecast for real GDP growth abroad has also been revised up,  particularly in the near term  Indeed, to a considerable extent, the more favorable  outlook for the rest of the world reflects the more buoyant attitude toward current and  prospective activity in the United States  Our optimism, however, is also grounded in  information we have recently received about developments in the economies of some  of our foreign trading partners plus our expectation that significant monetary ease  already in place abroad will stimulate those economies  A rebound in economic  activity has come first and most clearly to the emerging-market economies of Asia   This development appears to reflect the start of a turnaround in the global  semiconductor industry and the related electronics sector  Production data for the  fourth quarter and those indicators that we have in hand for the current quarter  confirm that strong gains have been made in those economies that are intensive                          March 19, 2002 Page 30 of 117  producers of high-tech goods  Exports should contribute importantly to sustained,  moderate growth in this region over the forecast period; but we look for domestic  demand to recover as well  Strong growth of real GDP is projected to continue in  China, supported by continued strength in domestic demand and positive  developments on the external front   For the major foreign industrial countries the picture is more mixed  We have  already been positively surprised by the strength of production in the fourth quarter in  Canada Of course, the Canadian economy should benefit substantially from the  projected US recovery; but we also expect that strong domestic sectors within that  economy and the lagged effects of 375 basis points of past monetary policy easing  there will be important factors in an acceleration of economic activity going forward   For the euro area, the fourth quarter on average was one of contraction in real GDP   Although there are signs of improved confidence and increasing production in some  countries, we remain cautious about the speed with which recovery will occur and so  have forecast a gradual return to growth at an annual rate of about 2½ percent in the  second half of this year and near 3 percent next year  A more robust global expansion  should be good for exports from the euro area, but recovery is likely to boost import  growth as well On balance, we look for domestic demand to grow slightly more  rapidly than output during this year and next   The Japanese economy is once again an exception to the pattern of growth that we  see for most of the global economy  To be sure, there have been some positive signs  of late Improved prospects for the rest of the world do imply a better outlook for  Japanese export industries, particularly those in the high-tech sector  And the serious  collapse of the financial system that some had feared as the end of the current fiscal  year approaches now seems unlikely  These developments appear to lie behind the  rather dramatic appreciation in some Japanese asset prices that has occurred in recent  weeks But worrisome offsetting factors remain  The banking system still has not  resolved its nonperforming loan problem, and its true capital structure is dangerously  weak The inspections now being conducted by the Financial Services Agency will  likely refocus attention on these problems once their results are released  Total  bankruptcies continue to rise Domestic demand and recent production indicators  show further contraction Accordingly, we have again written down a forecast of  further declines in GDP during most of this year and only weak growth thereafter  In  such an environment, deflation should persist throughout the forecast period in Japan   We have struggled to assess the risks now confronting our Latin American  trading partners  Our best judgment currently is that financial markets will continue  to distinguish among those countries, particularly in regarding Mexico as more  closely tied to the United States and Canada than to its Latin neighbors  We expect  that the projected recovery in US manufacturing will provide stimulus to the  Mexican economy and that we will see a moderately strong turnaround in that  economy this year  We also expect positive growth to return to Brazil, but the risks  there are greater and the ties to the US economy are weaker  For Argentina, we  have projected further sharp declines in output this quarter and for the subsequent                        March 19, 2002 Page 31 of 117  four quarters But it is impossible for us to have any confidence in that outlook as   Argentina’s problems are as much political as economic, and the resolution of those   problems is not yet in sight  Moreover, there are additional risks to political and   economic stability in other South American countries, such as Venezuela and   Colombia  The direct effects on the US economy of developments in South   America are not likely to be large, but a clear downside risk to our forecast is that   these problems might result in greater turmoil on international financial markets than   we now envisage I should add, however, that developments in global oil markets   could have substantial effects on the US economy, and oil prices have moved up   noticeably over the intermeeting period  Additional instability in Venezuela could   add to the forces putting upward pressure on oil prices    With the stronger outlook for the US recovery operating as the driving force  behind greater optimism about the global economy, it may seem surprising that in  recent days the dollar has come off its highs of late February  In part the explanation  is a stronger yen, which is due to some factors that are likely to prove transitory given  the unresolved problems in that economy  Indeed, yesterday we saw some retracing  by the yen But in part the move down in the dollar may also reflect some further  attention by market participants to the US external deficits and the controversy over  trade policy and the Administration’s position with respect to the “strong dollar”  policy With the dollar at a very high level and an expansionary cycle set to begin,  during which the United States is widely expected to grow more rapidly than our  trading partners for some time, the outlook is for widening US external deficits  At  some point, the rising mountain of debt created by those deficits may lessen the  appetite of global investors for dollar-denominated assets  The baseline combination  of stronger US growth and tightening by the FOMC suggests some upside risk to the  dollar that is offset in our minds by the possible reaction of investors to the return to  ever-widening US trade deficits  It is this thought that has led us to incorporate in  the forecast the projection of a stable exchange value for the dollar     It’s certainly true that outsourcing has become a much-discussed   phenomenon in Japan  And many of the foreign direct investment flows into Asia arise in Japan   because Japan is still running a sizable current account surplus  It has funds that need to be   invested, and that goes hand-in-hand with Japan’s strategy to do more of the manufacturing in   lower-cost places  So in some sense I think the answer to your question is “yes”  The Japanese   economy for some time has not reacted to its export sector the way it did, say, back in the 1970s    Many people would still argue that, given the condition of the Japanese economy, a falling yen   and a consequent easing of Japan’s deflation pressures, on the one hand, and a boost to its export   sector, on the other, constitute the only salvation that they can envision for the Japanese   economy  So I think it’s a question of degree Yes, it is perhaps less than it was some time ago         March 19, 2002 Page 34 of 117  But it’s still true that the export sector and investment in the export sector are what has to happen    in Japan to get the rest of the economy going  Therefore, I think many people would anticipate   that we will see strengthening abroad turn into the difference between further contraction versus   very slow growth—not a boom by any means but at least a difference of that much—in the   Japanese economy     True It’s certainly possible  But for example, the components that   we’ve written down behind the scene so to speak—which give us a forecast of very low growth   in 2003 rather than the contraction that we’ve projected for 2002—have to do with a combination   of inventories plus exports working in that direction to get the Japanese economy to stop   contracting    Germany is in the awkward position of being the weak link in the euro   area, which certainly changes the nature of the debate within Europe from that prevailing in the   final stages of the pre-EMU period  Both of those economies are in the throes of an election   cycle, which is certainly complicating events this year  The Germans are in the midst of a wage   round, which is getting a little ugly also, with threats of strikes and disagreements being made   public and so forth So on balance I still see the French economy as showing a bit more   buoyancy and vigor than the German economy  That had tended to be the case in 1999-2000    Oddly, the French economy was looking better than the German economy and showing more   flexibility, which is certainly something the French had not been viewed as possessing before    That’s still on balance true         March 19, 2002 Page 38 of 117  We just had a summit on the part of the EU that had been billed as the one in which   structural reform was supposed to be the key  The tone coming out at the end of that summit was   a sense of disappointment  Part of the explanation of that was this election cycle  Schröder, at   least based on views of colleagues that I see when I travel to Europe, is thought of as having   failed And the CDU is actually rising in the polls, which presents an interesting notion of what   might happen next in Germany     So on the whole, nothing terrible is happening in either country, but they’re not   succeeding in solving the problems they claim to recognize that they have  On balance, France   probably is doing a little better than Germany in terms of the basic macroeconomic dimensions   that we usually track  "
4609,2002-05-07," As we reported in the Greenbook, we have revised up slightly  since March the outlook for real output growth abroad over the remainder of this  year For some of our foreign trading partners, we were reacting to the most recent  evidence that had surprised us on the positive side  For others, we interpreted the  changes made in the outlook for the US economy as likely to pass through to faster  growth abroad over the forecast period  In our analysis, the rebound in the global  economy hinges on the projected strength in US economic activity  Past easing of  monetary policy abroad is also an important supporting factor  In a few cases, with  Canada being the most important example, foreign central banks have started to  withdraw some of this stimulus as the pace of activity improves   With somewhat mixed feelings and a good deal of worry, we found the courage to  lower our projected path for the exchange value of the dollar from that in the March  Greenbook We continued our recent practice of a “straight-line” approach for the  dollar path from current values as again we see roughly offsetting upside and  downside potential for the dollar over the forecast period But a review of the factors  that led us to adjust down the dollar about 2 percent for the weighted average and  against several of the major currencies should convince you that we did consider  alternatives   First, market developments since the March FOMC meeting have varied across  different currencies but have generally been in the downward direction for the dollar   The nominal index for the major currencies has fallen about 2½ percent  Within that  set of currencies, the dollar has depreciated the most (about 4 percent) against the  Swiss franc, which seems to be attracting safe haven flows, and the euro (more than  3½ percent) It has declined least against the Canadian dollar (less than 1½ percent),  despite strong economic data for the first quarter in Canada  In terms of our broad  index, which includes our other important trading partners, the dollar has depreciated                                      May 7, 2002 14 of 81  much less; but that result includes a very sharp drop in the nominal value of the  Argentine peso In addition, the dollar has risen more than 4 percent vis-à-vis the  Mexican peso over the intermeeting period   Revising down the projected path of the dollar fits a “random walk” strategy and  is consistent with the long, sad history of analysts, including ourselves, failing to find  structural explanations for exchange rate determination that outperform a random  walk But I think we were reacting to more than just the actual market moves  In  recent weeks, a tone in the market has surfaced that perhaps the dollar has turned a  corner and that investors are now less willing to add to their dollar holdings than they  have been over the past few years Perceived pressure from the US manufacturing  sector and the decision on protection for the steel industry have raised doubts about  the Administration’s commitment to the so-called strong dollar policy  Secretary  O’Neill’s testimony last week was the occasion of additional market reaction and  downward pressure on the dollar  The large US external imbalances seem to be  drawing renewed attention, although market participants have not been reacting to the  trade data per se Indeed, the employment report of last Friday and the implication  that the US economy is less robust than previously thought was a greater cause for  dollar weakness than the latest trade releases had been   After years of raising warning signs about the unsustainability of the US current  account deficit, it would be easy for those of us in the Division of International  Finance to exaggerate the significance of these recent market developments   However, we have tried to guard against doing that as experience has made us wary   The intermeeting movements of the dollar have generally only retraced its gains since  about November in terms of nominal value against other industrial country  currencies  Our forecast calls for US real output growth to exceed average foreign  growth substantially If US productivity growth remains high and asset values are  sustained, global investors could continue to regard investment opportunities here as  superior to those elsewhere   Lastly, we have trouble writing down a significant depreciation in the dollar  because we have a hard time identifying against which currencies the dollar might  move sharply A 10 percent appreciation of the yen in terms of the dollar would  move it beyond the levels at which Japanese authorities not long ago indicated their  concern by intervening In our view, the present state of the Japanese economy is not  consistent with significant yen appreciation as it would remove the scope for some  stabilization and then improvement of production in the Japanese economy  We  cannot picture how market forces would come together to push the yen up under  current circumstances  The upside potential that we see in the dollar is importantly in  terms of the yen; the unresolved problems within the Japanese economy could well  lead to a return of yen depreciation   There would seem to be scope for appreciation of the euro  But there have not  been many positive surprises coming from the euro area recently  Demands from  labor in Germany and Italy seem to be worrying markets  And there are still no signs                                 May 7, 2002 15 of 81  of an acceleration in productivity similar to what we have seen in the United States   So we believe that the euro could equally well move up or move down from its  current value   On balance, we have taken a cautious approach  It would seem foolish not to  acknowledge the recent market moves, but it would seem rash to extrapolate them  into the future We remain convinced that an adjustment of the US external balance  will become necessary at some point  The capital inflows needed to finance  prospective deficits cannot continue to expand forever  It seems probable that an  external adjustment will entail some decline in the value of the dollar  But whether  we are now seeing the beginnings of that process, we do not know   Let me conclude by briefly updating you on developments in Argentina   Negotiations with the IMF are effectively at a standstill, although President Duhalde  has again appealed for international assistance  The Argentine political process has  been unable to date to resolve the major issues that IMF officials and others insist  must be addressed before a new program can be considered  These issues include  reform of the bankruptcy law, repeal of the economic subversion law, and a binding  agreement to substantially reduce provincial deficits and halt the printing of scrip to  finance those deficits Structural reforms of this kind are needed as fundamentals  before a sustainable economic plan can be formulated     After a week-long bank and foreign exchange holiday, Argentine banks reopened  a week ago Monday The legislature had passed a measure making more complicated  and presumably more time consuming the legal steps necessary for depositors to  withdraw their money under the rules of the corralito  This occurred after a proposal  to convert bank deposits to government bonds, termed Bonex II, failed to be approved  by lawmakers, and the Economy Minister Remes Lemicov resigned in protest   Argentina remains without a functional banking system, the payments mechanism is  hobbled, and economic activity continues to contract  Pressures are being directed at  the foreign-owned banks to inject more funds into their Argentine affiliates  So far,  foreign banks, including a major Spanish bank, have rejected any calls for additional  capital; they maintain that no additional funds will be provided unless the government  can assure them it will abide by established and reasonable laws with respect to  property rights   The new Economy Minister, Roberto Lavagna, has assembled a new team, but  little has yet been accomplished  Relations between the provinces and the federal  government remain part of the ongoing problems  Some of the provincial governors  are quite strong politically and have their own ambitions  Popular opinion is against  the banks—as well as the government—and popular demands call for softer terms for  debtors but the return of deposits at full value   In sum, there is no direction to policy and no prospects that any difficult decisions  will be made any time soon  To date, no major evidence of spillover to other  countries has appeared, and market analysts seem to regard Argentina as a distinct               May 7, 2002 16 of 81  case However, sovereign bonds issued by Uruguay have just been downgraded, and   that country is certainly suffering some economic distress as a result of events in its   close neighbor Brazil is also showing some signs of stress on international financial   markets, although most analysts attribute this to uncertainties arising from its   upcoming presidential elections  That completes our remarks  We’d be happy to   answer questions      We don’t, but we could  The interest differential is available, I think,   for all the pieces  We look at the forward euro, and we look at the forward yen; I think we could   do that for the other major currencies     Right    But as you well know, the yen is going to be an issue because the   interest differential is going to say that the market expects the yen to appreciate a lot    I thought you asked me for forward rates            May 7, 2002 17 of 81    But it’s identical at the horizons of the interest rate differential     We can use the futures market, yes    But there’s no way that the arbitrage opportunity of trading in the   futures market and then long-end and short-end bonds—      We’ll construct one    That’s my point If we know the interest differential, we know the   forward rate            May 7, 2002 18 of 81    We can take that number, but what I’m saying is that the existence of   the arbitrage opportunity would lead some people to go around the block if that were profitable    So I think you can be certain—    I understand that, too What I’m saying to you, though, is that other   people do want to make a profit and therefore we can assume—      We will map the forward rates and future rates and look at them  "
4656,2002-08-13," As we tried to convey in the Greenbook, the staff outlook for  the global economy over the remainder of this year and next is a bit weaker than last  time and less certain  The factors behind this change in tone with respect to global  prospects can be grouped into three categories (1) recent developments that are  broadly global in nature, in particular global financial market developments;  (2) consequences for key foreign economies of the downward revision to our forecast  for US real growth; and (3) developments that essentially are external to the US  economy and are being driven by economic and political shocks abroad     The sharp decline and heightened volatility in equity prices over the intermeeting  period was a common feature across most global stock markets  European equity  prices were particularly hard hit  As in the United States, the effects of the resulting  loss of wealth on total spending are partially offset by the declines that have occurred  in many long-term interest rates  But long rates in the other major industrial countries  generally moved down less than did those in US markets  Although foreign stock  markets seemed to take their cue primarily from movements in US markets, issues  of corporate governance and accounting accuracy have also arisen with respect to  some large foreign firms  And a general reduction in the willingness on the part of  investors to bear risk seems to be widespread  Certain sectors, such as European  insurance firms, have been particularly penalized in the current market environment     We expect that these less favorable financial conditions will weigh on confidence  and spending abroad Indeed, we have some early readings on confidence that  indicate such a reaction Negative wealth effects are to be expected particularly in the  United Kingdom and Canada, where our research tells us that consumers are quite  sensitive to wealth changes  The contractionary effects of these financial market  developments should be cushioned, however, by the absence of monetary tightening  on the part of most major foreign central banks in the near term  Although in June we  had incorporated such tightening into the forecast, we share the view currently  reflected in short-term interest rate futures that monetary policy will remain generally  accommodative into next year in the major foreign industrial countries   As we noted in the Greenbook, several of the regions that evidenced strength in  the first half of the year, in some cases more than we were expecting, depended for  that strength on their export sectors This was the case in Japan, in emerging Asia,  and to some extent in Europe  For Japan and emerging Asia, a significant part of the  rebound in exports was in the high-tech sector  Continued recovery in that sector                           August 13, 2002 15 of 92  depends broadly on global developments But a key risk to ongoing expansion in  these export-dependent economies is a negative surprise in US output growth   The downward revision made to the outlook for the US economy fed directly  into our less optimistic outlooks for Canada and Mexico  Canada has been something  of an outlier among the industrial countries during the first half of this year, recording  rapid output growth in both quarters and strength in final domestic demand  In  response, the Bank of Canada has raised its policy rate a total of 75 basis points since  April We expect Canadian growth to slow to a more sustainable rate, and we have  edged projected growth down a bit more to reflect the somewhat weaker path for US  real GDP this time than in the June Greenbook  Similarly, we are looking for  recovery to become established in Mexico, the one bright spot in our outlook for  Latin America  However, we have shaded our projection for Mexico in light of the  less favorable US projection   Finally, a series of developments in the past several weeks in a few foreign  countries, importantly several in South America, have cast significant gloom over the  foreign outlook To some degree, problems in these countries have interacted to  reinforce the negative effects being felt in each and to raise the risk of a serious  collapse in economic activity and stability in the region  Because of the size of its  economy and the extent of its participation in global financial markets, Brazil is  arguably the most important of the potential crises brewing in South America     The proximate cause of Brazil’s current financial distress is concern on the part of  investors, both domestic and foreign, about the future course of economic policy in  Brazil as a result of the election to be held in October  The current government has  generally followed policies since the January 1999 crisis that have met with market  approval But there is nothing that this government can do to ensure the continuation  of such policies And statements alone by the candidates have not been reassuring to  markets, especially in light of the long-standing differences in political positions and  sources of support of the three principal candidates  Spreads on Brazilian dollar- denominated debt rose from 1,500 basis points to around 2,400 basis points over less  than two weeks, as political news swayed markets  Reports circulated that  international banks were withdrawing trade credits and similar short-term lines    After the Greenbook was finalized, the IMF announced an extension and  enlargement of Brazil’s existing IMF program that will total about $30 billion  One  important feature of this new program is that only $6 billion is to be disbursed this  year, with the remainder slated for 2003, after the new government is in place  Thus  the program should create strong incentives for the new government, regardless of  who wins, to follow policies consistent with the program in order to obtain those  funds Market participants now understand that those incentives are in place and that,  because of the IMF commitment, the Brazilian government could have sufficient  resources to manage its sovereign debt in 2003                        August 13, 2002 16 of 92  To be successful the program has to result in lower spreads and improved   exchange rate stability for Brazil following the election and perhaps much sooner  To   help in that regard, the program gives Brazilian officials more scope to use their   existing reserves to provide liquidity to bond markets and to intervene in the foreign   exchange market Although the program is large and designed to reassure markets, it   is something of a gamble  Enough capital needs to remain in Brazil for the private   economy to function reasonably between now and the election  After the election,   market-compatible policies need to be followed—either because of the incentives   created by the IMF program or because, once elected, the new president will have to   weigh election rhetoric against the cold light of reality in making his choices    Following the announcement, spreads first narrowed sharply and the real appreciated   However, investor enthusiasm for the loan package is already waning  The real has   subsequently more than reversed its post-announcement gains, despite intervention   support for the currency, and spreads have backed up to more than 2,300 basis points    The Greenbook baseline forecast is for Brazil to weather this storm  Output is   expected to stagnate during the rest of this year, as turbulent financial conditions and   heightened uncertainty disrupt economic activity  But low growth is projected to   resume next year as financial conditions improve  However, the risk that financial   conditions will instead deteriorate further and force some kind of debt standstill   and/or capital controls before the election even takes place is certainly present  In   that situation, the incentives for the new government, once elected, to follow market-  compatible policies would be greatly reduced  If that is the course followed by   Brazil, the pressures on other South American countries and their financial systems   will intensify and prospects for even low growth of economic activity in the region   will be sharply reduced  That concludes our report  We’d be happy to take any   questions     Well, first of all, they are industry data  There is a good apparatus for   monitoring developments that is generally industry based       Yes In those economies, high-tech exports are such a large part of   what is going on that it is a focus So I think in some sense, yes, it might be an early reflection of   the orders of their principal purchaser, the United States     I think it is close  "
4708,2002-09-24," Mr Chairman, I do      I have a chart of Japanese corporate versus government debt spreads    The AA has been a little choppy, but the spread is about 15 basis points; the BBB is around   50 basis points Both have been spiky, up and down a bit, in the last week or so    There is no discernible trend     Right I can’t tell you what issuance has been, so I have no idea if this   is a reflection of no issuance and no trading and so forth  Actually, the spread has been trending   down a bit in the BBB from the middle of this year to most recently  So there is no sign here that   spreads are blowing up or even widening  "
4709,2002-09-24," The staff outlook for real economic activity in the rest of the  world is slightly darker than that we presented in the August Greenbook, as some of  the recent data have failed to meet our expectations and have disappointed markets   In response, we have revised down a bit our outlook for foreign real GDP  We still  believe that the most likely outcome will be that output growth abroad will generally  strengthen in 2003, and we have now added some further projected acceleration in  2004 But downside risks seem to predominate, and the rebound from global  weakness in 2001 remains uneven and still a bit elusive   The occasion of the IMF and World Bank annual meetings later this week  prompted me to look back six months to their spring meetings to assess how  economic and financial developments over that interval compared with our  expectations at that time and to look for factors at work during that interval that will  have implications for activity abroad during the forecast period  In March our  expectation was for a general strengthening of output growth abroad throughout 2002  that on average characterized both the industrial countries and the developing  countries Not surprisingly, the actual course of economic events was less smooth  than that Foreign growth surprised us on the upside in the first half of the year,  particularly for the industrial countries Nevertheless, we now see real GDP growth  in the industrial countries in the second half of this year and the first half of next year  as likely to be weaker than in our March projection and below that now reported for  the first half of this year   The reasoning behind our projection of near-term weakness in the industrial  countries differs importantly for Canada on the one hand, and for Japan and the euro  area on the other In Canada, real GDP growth during the first half of the year was  exceptionally vigorous at an annual rate of more than 5 percent  Growth at this pace  is not sustainable and poses the risk of triggering inflationary pressures if it were to  continue Accordingly, the Bank of Canada has raised its policy rate 75 basis points  since March—a pace of policy tightening that exceeded what we had incorporated  into the March Greenbook The effect of these higher rates on both consumption and  fixed investment should become evident over the next several quarters  In addition, a  swing in inventory behavior made a substantial contribution to growth in the first half                         September 24, 2002 18 of 115  of this year but should prove to be transitory  Finally, the pattern of US real output  growth is of particular importance for Canada  Taken together, these factors paint a  picture of moderate, rather than blistering, growth in the near term that continues over  the forecast period   In contrast, Japan and the euro area both appear to have experienced some good  fortune in the first half of this year after negative real GDP growth in the fourth  quarter of last year But both have as yet failed to develop any momentum that would  sustain demand and lead to a firming of recovery  In Japan, double-digit export  growth more than accounts for the rebound in real GDP over the first half, as  domestic demand again contracted on balance  Much of the increase in exports was  to other economies in Asia, and we do not see the scope for export growth to continue  at its recent pace Given the ongoing problems in Japan of financial sector weakness,  monetary and fiscal policy inaction, and moderate deflation, we expect that domestic  demand will not expand enough to result in anything other than weak growth over the  forecast period   In the euro area, the expansion in the first half was the result of improved net  exports and a boost from reduced inventory liquidation  In our forecast, we have  these factors continuing to contribute, albeit at a reduced rate, along with some  rebound in final domestic demand to yield relatively weak real GDP growth for the  next several quarters Subsequently, acceleration in fixed investment and  consumption should boost growth to between 2½ and 3 percent during the second half  of next year The continued listless performance of the German economy is a major  factor behind the subpar outlook for the euro area  Declining equity prices and global  financial market volatility over the past several months have undermined business  and consumer confidence in the euro area  German stock prices have fallen further  over the intermeeting period as European insurance companies, in particular, have  been hit hard by portfolio losses and high claims     With output growth in the euro area remaining weak and showing no sign of  rising soon, the ECB has left rates unchanged since November 2001  This contrasts  with our previous expectation of an increase of 50 basis points during the current  half-year Long-term interest rates have responded by moving down about 90 basis  points since March, of which more than 20 basis points have been since the August  Greenbook Automatic fiscal stabilizers are providing some support to demand, but  the deficit limit of 3 percent of GDP set by the Stability and Growth Pact is  constraining fiscal policy in Germany  On balance, we expect that recovery of euro  area output growth will firm by the middle of next year but recognize that currently  there seems to be little upside risk for such a forecast   Among the developing countries, the emerging economies in Asia and Mexico are  projected to show strength and to experience a return to vigorous growth by the end  of the forecast period, although the pattern is expected to differ across these countries   Elsewhere in Latin America, financial and political stresses are likely to keep growth  significantly reduced for some time  Economic activity in China, which did not           September 24, 2002 19 of 115  slacken significantly in 2001, has provided some stability and strength to the Asian  region throughout this year  In several of the emerging Asian economies, including  Singapore, Malaysia, Taiwan, and Korea, rebounds in high-tech production and  exports have been important elements in sustaining expansion during 2002  Although  domestic demand has provided a boost to output growth in some Asian economies—  particularly China, Korea, and Taiwan—we see this region of the global economy as  vulnerable to a downturn in the global high-tech sector and to reduced demand for  their exports to the United States and other industrial countries  Accordingly,  continued expansion in emerging Asia would be threatened should the pace of growth  on average in the industrial countries over the next few quarters be weaker than we  now expect Similarly, our forecast that the recent bounceback in Mexican output  will prove durable is especially dependent on the path of output and demand in the  United States   Overall, the slightly gloomier tone to the staff outlook this time does not arise  from a judgment that the global high-risk spots, such as Brazil, are now more likely to  experience severe crises or to cause greater spillover effects on other countries   Rather, it is that, among the major foreign industrial countries, only Canada has  experienced a robust recovery The failure to date of the euro area and of Japan to  move beyond sluggish growth to a pace that reduces excess capacity and triggers a  revival of investment spending is reflected in the small downward revision that we  made to our projection for near-term foreign growth And it is a negative risk factor  for our expectation that, later, output abroad will move closer to its trend rate of  expansion That completes our remarks  We’d be happy to answer any questions    To be honest, I don’t I sincerely hope that there are many people who   for other reasons are paying a lot of attention to immigration controls in Canada  But it is not   something that has been raised in the context of the economic debate about the reasons that   Canada has led the way in this recovery They have had a housing boom in terms of house prices   and housing starts And part of the story is that they have had an auto boom that is, I’m sure, to   some extent a part of and derives from the US auto boom  They have not had the same degree   of capital overhang that we have experienced, and for that reason they see themselves as having   a recovery that has fewer headwinds In reality they have been out in front of us  I wouldn’t rule   out the thought that immigration has something to do with it I just honestly don’t have an   answer for you    No, and I think that is a good point  I appreciate your mentioning it   The industrial country that on the whole did the best through the recent downturn and the upturn   is Australia I’ve asked myself over and over again why it is that Australia has done so well    And now in terms of the recovery, Canada is coming right behind them as an economy that is   outpacing ours and outpacing those of all the other industrial countries  Some people when they   talk about both of those countries, but mainly Canada, point to the fact that their exports in   particular are commodity based But it goes against everything I think I understand about the   global economy to believe that during a downturn those economies would fare better rather than   worse They typically are hit harder as manufacturing falls elsewhere; there’s an accelerated   effect on the demand for their exports  It usually makes them more vulnerable rather than less         September 24, 2002 26 of 115  But both Australia and Canada are economies that have had substantial currency depreciation    They have allowed that to happen—have not resisted it by tightening monetary policy—and have   not suffered particularly on the inflation front as a consequence for a host of reasons that we’ve   talked about before We’ve discussed, for example, whether the global economy is more   competitive and so forth and whether inflation targeting per se has helped to make that happen    They have enjoyed some relative price advantages  Canada is an energy exporter, or at least self-  sufficient in that regard, and that may help to some degree in this environment as well      Well, I’m always the one who is sitting around worrying about the   current account deficit and our net external indebtedness  It’s not that I don’t think the US   economy can be maintained at full utilization of its resources either way  But I think that in the   long run some dollar depreciation is a necessary step, so I don’t regret it when it comes along     I am skeptical that the Canadians, because they are the tail and not the dog of North   America so to speak, can sustain such strong growth any more than Mexico can sustain strong   growth when the US economy is not performing well  So for those reasons we do expect to see   the Canadian economy conforming more to other industrialized economies and experiencing   growth closer to their long-term average, more along the lines of what ours is doing     I will say that one Bank of Canada analyst whispered the word “productivity” in my ear   not too long ago And I have suggested to some of our people that we look to see if we can find   some answers there because that is the one area we thought the US experience might most   readily be replicated in Canada  So maybe they are beginning to experience the initial stages of   some of the developments that occurred in the US economy three or four years ago  No doubt           September 24, 2002 27 of 115  it’s a mixture of all these things—some exchange rate depreciation, some success in getting their   inflation rate down, a housing boom, an auto boom, and in general a working out of the   inventory cycle and less perceived overhang of capital—that together add up to the stronger   Canadian performance  "
4764,2002-11-06," The contour of the staff forecast for the rest of the world  mirrors that for the US outlook—a downward revision in the near term relative to  last Greenbook, followed by some acceleration in 2003 and 2004  We are expecting  the swing in growth abroad on average to be somewhat damped relative to the US  pattern We see foreign growth slowing in the current quarter, but exceeding US  growth this quarter and during the first half of next year, and then strengthening over  the remainder of the forecast period, but falling short of US growth in 2004  The  similarity to the US path in part reflects the implications of developments in the US  economy for other regions of the globe but in part also reflects our reading of signals  from within those regions of changes arising there    A significant contribution to global slowing arising abroad is that from the euro  area A variety of recent indicators, including industrial production and consumer  and business sentiment, have persuaded us that output growth in the euro area is  slowing rather than edging up, as we had projected in September  The disappointing  pace of activity in turn is adding to the problems posed by the fiscal stance in several  of the EU countries, including France and Germany, and the standards for fiscal  deficits set in the Stability and Growth Pact  Weaker-than-expected activity is  reducing tax revenues and adding to the actual government deficits, including pushing  the German deficit above the 3 percent limit  Understandably, the national  governments do not wish to take procyclical fiscal policy actions that would slow  their economies further  At the same time, ECB officials, having stressed the  importance of fiscal discipline for each member of the euro area, are faced with the  choice of easing monetary policy despite rates of inflation through September above  their 2 percent ceiling The debate has raged publicly in Europe, and it now appears  that the needed structural adjustment of some budgets will be pushed off into the  future Nevertheless, the staff forecast incorporates the assumption that fiscal policy  in the euro area will remain mildly contractionary over the forecast period  However,  with the economy softening and future inflation likely to recede, we have  incorporated into the baseline forecast the assumption that the ECB will cut its policy  rate by next spring   On balance, the picture for the euro area is one where domestic spending has  failed to establish any momentum, as investment spending contracts further and  consumer spending expands only slowly  Uncertainties about near-term prospects for  oil prices, the global economy and so export demand, and geopolitical tensions  continue to weigh on confidence Fiscal policy is caught between agreed medium­                             November 6, 2002 12 of 122  term goals and the macro policy needs of the near term  And monetary policy for  now appears to be on hold Going forward, business spending should start to expand,  with inventories now well below last fall’s peak and capital overhang less of a  problem in Europe than here  As global oil prices come down and euro area inflation  drops, consumer confidence should firm, and clear scope for monetary easing should  emerge  But we readily admit that, whereas evidence of current weakness is clear,  our forecast for a rebound next year is far less certain   Our outlook for Japan is another instance where we have revised down the  forecast based importantly on developments within that economy  Some signs of  strength earlier in the year reflected demand for Japanese exports  But that stimulus  has so far failed to result in positive investment spending or to boost the pace of  consumption spending, as had been widely expected  In addition, new uncertainties  have been created by the appointment of Takenaka as head of the Financial Services  Agency and by the roller coaster nature of the announcements concerning his plans  for more forceful handling of the problems of the financial sector  In light of the  repeated postponement of making public specific details of what will be done, we  have put only very marginal, negative effects from the set of recent policy initiatives  into this forecast  We judge that the near-term effects of an ambitious reform  program would be, on balance, even more negative; but we are not persuaded by what  has been revealed to date that such a program will in fact be implemented  In light of  new data and the diminished prospects for Japanese exports, we have revised down  our outlook for GDP growth in Japan but have retained a slight upward trend in  growth starting by the middle of next year   The emerging economies in Asia have been leading the recovery in global  economic activity, and economic expansion in that region remains robust  We have  adjusted down a bit our projection for output growth there during the second half of  this year, but that change largely reflects developments elsewhere and some  moderation of the very rapid pace of real output growth recorded for the first half   Domestic demand in those economies remains solid, but many of them are  importantly dependent on exports, especially from the high-tech sector  Accordingly,  our baseline forecast is for growth in that region to remain quite strong, outpacing  that elsewhere around the globe Should activity in the United States or the global  economy more generally falter, however, emerging Asia is vulnerable  The resulting  loss in export demand would likely undermine domestic investment spending as well  and result in significantly weaker growth of real GDP   Canada and Mexico remain strong performers on the global scene, and domestic  demand in their economies has been robust  Nevertheless, their ties to the US  economy, including through such important sectors as autos, are so strong that we see  them as largely reflecting or sharing in US developments   Finally, let me mention South America  Events there are clearly driven by  economic and political developments within the major countries, especially Argentina  and Brazil but also Venezuela and others Market reactions to those developments,               November 6, 2002 13 of 122  however, do depend in part on global appetite for risk and general concerns about  uncertainties more broadly  Following the election of Lula as president of Brazil,  markets have initially tended to move in a favorable direction as his statements and  actions to date have been reassuring  However, spreads on dollar-denominated  Brazilian debt remain above 1,700 basis points, and the interest rate on roughly half  of the government's domestic debt now stands at 21 percent At such interest rates,  the debt burden in Brazil will eventually overwhelm the economy  Both the private  sector and the government will need to access financial markets for sizable amounts  of funds in coming months  Thus it seems premature to draw any conclusion about  whether Brazil's government will avoid a need to restructure the terms of some  portions of its debt over the forecast period  It appears that spreads would have to  decline further and that the currency would have to strengthen for a truly benign  outcome to occur  In Argentina, meaningful resolution of economic policy and  progress on restoring growth seem to be on hold until elections are held next March   And even that date for elections is clouded as a dispute continues over conducting  primaries  In the meantime, negotiations with the IMF are proceeding in an effort to  prevent an actual default by Argentina on its obligations to the international financial  institutions The deadline for avoiding a default is the middle of the month The IMF  and major creditor governments have asserted that they will not approve a flawed  program, so some basic issues need to be resolved with Argentine officials  That may  or may not prove possible  Although we regard the situation in South America as  serious, with important implications for the economic and political stability of that  region, we do not judge the stagnation or low growth in the region as having a major  impact on real output growth elsewhere  South America is vulnerable to slowdown in  the United States and the euro area, however  And a major financial disruption in  Brazil could have repercussions on global financial markets  That completes our  remarks  We’d be happy to answer any questions  "
4817,2002-12-10," As we reported in the Greenbook, the staff did not see the  developments since the November FOMC meeting as indicating a need for any major  revisions to our outlook for economic activity abroad or for the US external sector   Some new information did prompt marginal changes to our forecast for particular  countries, but these small adjustments were largely offsetting The challenge  confronting us as we put together this forecast remained that of ensuring that the  overall strengthening in the global economy that we have again presented is  consistent with the extent of stimulus we see outside that present in the US  economy   We have become slightly more pessimistic about the outlook for the euro area and  have written down real GDP growth in that region by 03 percentage point in 2003  and slightly less in 2004 Most, but not all, of that revision is accounted for by the  change in our outlook for Germany  We see the obstacles to growth in Germany as  looming larger than we had previously thought  German fiscal policy is constrained  in the near term by the failure to have made more progress over the past several years  in achieving the medium-term goals set out in the Stability and Growth Pact  The  momentum for structural reform within Germany seems to have faded, perhaps  because of the politics of the election this year  There are particular problems in the  German banking system that raise questions about the efficiency with which capital is  being allocated and that may be impeding a return to more dynamic growth  And the  general weakness in business spending on new capital in Europe and elsewhere works  to the disadvantage of Germany’s manufacturing industry—the core of the German  economy   Slight upward revisions to our projections for Mexico and for some of the  emerging-market economies in Asia essentially offset our less favorable outlook for  the euro area These small positive changes were driven by some recent data, which  confirmed solid expansion in Mexico and Korea, and by the stronger outlook in this  forecast for the acceleration in real output in the United States over the forecast  period These regions are extremely vulnerable to any weakening in US activity or,  for Asia, to any faltering in the recovery of the global high-tech sector  We have built  into the forecast the consequences of the current-quarter slowing now apparent in the  United States and elsewhere But our slightly more optimistic projection for output  growth in 2003 and 2004 in Mexico and emerging Asia reflects the boost to US  growth expected from your move at the last meeting  It is not the consequence of any  significantly stronger domestic demand now evident in those foreign economies   Last Thursday, the ECB Council lowered its official lending rates 50 basis points,  bringing the minimum repo rate down to 275 percent  Ahead of the meeting date,  members of the Council had signaled the likelihood of this step, and we had  incorporated it into the Greenbook forecast  We are not looking for any further  reductions by the ECB and do not expect them to begin moving up rates until mid­ 2004 We view rates at the current, rather low, level as necessary for the moderate  recovery in growth that we expect will begin next spring                      December 10, 2002 12 of 87  The underlying factors that are the basis of our expectation for moderate  acceleration in the pace of activity abroad are similar to those for the US economy   Monetary policy is stimulative in several of the major industrial countries, although  its effectiveness in Japan remains a concern  Inventory cycles abroad are well along  and, to varying degrees, we expect will be adding positively to the change in output  over the forecast interval The restraining effect of lower equity prices on spending,  either because of hits to confidence or direct wealth effects, should be waning  And  lower oil prices will reduce headline inflation, boost confidence, and support  domestic spending  Domestic demand has been buoyant in a few cases—such as  Canada, the United Kingdom, and Korea—and appears to be firming in others  These  factors point to only a moderate pace of recovery in 2003  Such an outcome should  allay concerns that now weigh on spending and support further recovery in growth to  more vigorous rates in 2004 Except in Canada, this projected path for real activity  still leaves the level of output below potential in the major foreign industrial countries  even at the end of 2004   We are concerned that there is limited scope outside the United States to react to  any new negative economic developments that might arise  In both Japan and the  euro area, options with respect to fiscal policy are severely limited  But most  countries do have room to maneuver with respect to monetary policy should the  recovery go off track In South America, even a very favorable outcome would not  generate positive spillovers elsewhere; at best, we are looking for no major  deterioration in Brazil and so no negative contagion problems within the region  In  emerging Asia—the region that has so far displayed the most resilience—there would  be some scope for absorbing some external shock to the real economy  Continued  robust growth in China is a stabilizing factor in that region  Nevertheless, we judge  that, were US real GDP not to accelerate as projected in the baseline forecast, the  projected strengthening of activity elsewhere in the global economy would be  undermined as well  David and I will be happy to answer any questions  "
4870,2003-03-18,"  No, nothing that would go out far enough to answer the question  "
4871,2003-03-18,"  In putting together the baseline forecast for the rest of the   world, the staff in the International Finance Division grappled with the same issues  that confronted those forecasting the domestic economy, but spread over a wide range  of countries  With the outbreak of war perceived by many to be likely and soon, a  host of indicators and market variables abroad implicitly reflect the weighted average  of market expectations as to the timing of the onset of hostilities and the implications  of subsequent events for economic activity around the globe  Of course these  variables also reflect developments in the underlying economic fundamentals, which  no doubt have changed somewhat since we prepared the January forecast       The clearest instance in which market expectations have provided answers to   critical questions that we otherwise were at a loss to answer is the assumed path for  oil prices in the forecast  As in the past, we have incorporated into the baseline  forecast the futures path for crude oil as observed in the market at the time the  Greenbook forecast was being finalized  That path starts with the price for West  Texas intermediate at an average value of $3523 for the current quarter and has it  dropping more than $550 by the end of this year and nearly another $500 dollars by  the end of next year  Although some volatility in oil prices in the very short run is to  be expected, a sizable decline in global crude oil prices from current levels, starting  by midyear, is an essential factor in our baseline forecast for global growth That  forecast has some continued near-term weakness giving way to growth at an annual  rate of about 3 percent on average in the second half of this year and 3½ percent next  year  The implications of less favorable developments with respect to oil prices vary  somewhat, depending on how long the price of oil remains elevated and whether a  given country is an oil exporter or importer  We reviewed the staff model’s  assessment of the effects of some alternatives in January during the chart show  A  sharp spike up in oil prices that persists for two quarters, what we termed the limited  embargo case, by itself implies negative effects this year on GDP growth in the major  foreign economies that range from negligible to a reduction of ¾ percentage point    March 18, 2003 15 of 101    Alternatively, oil prices could fall further or faster than implied in the futures curve,  with positive effects on growth     A second major factor underlying the forecast is the state of business and   consumer confidence that is incorporated in the forecast, but we cannot quantify these  variables in the way that we can for oil prices  In recent weeks, confidence has  reacted both to the changing prospects of the onset of war and to news about  economic fundamentals  As we reported in the Greenbook, consumer confidence  surveys have moved down further recently, particularly in Europe  We are also  looking for very sluggish or declining domestic demand in the euro area and Japan  during the first quarter  Nonetheless, our projection for an acceleration of activity  abroad over the forecast period includes a strengthening in domestic demand in many  countries that, in turn, is consistent with a moderate and sustained improvement in  confidence  A quick and pronounced move in confidence in either direction,  triggered by geopolitical events, could produce a significant deviation from our  baseline outlook  Sharply higher oil prices could well combine with a fall in  confidence  The version of such joint developments that I included in the January  chart show implied reductions in growth rates of 1 to 2 percentage points in the  foreign industrial countries this year  A positive bounce in sentiment abroad is a clear  upside risk to our forecast, and foreign real GDP has considerable scope in most  countries to grow faster without threatening capacity constraints or heightening price  pressures     We have incorporated specific assumptions about monetary policy actions in the   foreign industrial countries, which support the recovery of economic activity in our  baseline view and are broadly consistent with market expectations for rates  We  expect that the ECB will lower its official rates another 50 basis points by midyear, as  falling oil prices, considerable slack in the economy, and strength in the exchange  value of the euro contribute to improvements in inflation performance  We have  assumed that the Bank of England will move rates down another 25 basis points later  this year as UK inflation also diminishes  In contrast, we see the Bank of Canada  keeping its official rate at its present level through the end of this year, as the  Canadian economy remains near potential and inflation declines from elevated rates  thanks to lower oil prices and some exchange rate appreciation       Should developments surprise us and the markets and the outlook for activity   diverge from our baseline, there is some scope for monetary policy abroad to react   Clearly, lower oil prices, stronger confidence, and more-positive prospects for growth  would imply stronger activity  Such a development might result in the major foreign  central banks choosing not to ease further  On the downside, persistently high oil  prices, even weaker confidence, and reduced growth prospects might elicit immediate  easing and more cumulative easing than we now assume  With rates now at  25 percent or higher in the euro area, the United Kingdom, and Canada, the central  banks in these economies do have some room for maneuver on the downside  The  Bank of Japan, which we assume will keep rates at essentially zero throughout the  forecast period, has been caught up in the problems posed by the zero bound for some   March 18, 2003 16 of 101    time  The Swiss National Bank has recently reduced its target rate nearly to zero, so  it has little room to ease further using that tool     Our crystal ball is least able to help us anticipate the reaction of the foreign   exchange value of the dollar to coming events—a circumstance in which we often  find ourselves  In the days just before the Greenbook forecast was completed, the  dollar reacted to downward pressure that appeared to relate, in part, to heightened  risks for war in the near term  We reacted to market developments by adjusting down  slightly our path for the real weighted-average broad dollar index  Since Greenbook  day, however, the nominal dollar has rebounded somewhat—with the broad index  rising more than ½ percent in nominal terms, apparently on news that action in Iraq is  imminent  I hesitate even to offer a guess as to which way the dollar will move in  reaction to future good news or bad news on events in Iraq  To the extent that the  dollar turns out stronger than we have projected, exports will be restrained and  imports encouraged  However, these partial effects could be offset by effects on  exports and imports from growth outcomes here and abroad that differ from the  baseline       We received data for the US balance of payments in the fourth quarter after the   Greenbook was completed  Those data confirm that the ex post components of the  financing of our current account deficit shifted during 2002  Private foreign net  purchases of US securities slowed from their record pace in 2001, and foreign direct  investment inflows fell sharply  These smaller private inflows were offset by a drop  to zero in the appetite of US investors for foreign securities  Balancing these  changes and the larger current account deficit was a sizable increase in foreign  official acquisition of dollar assets  These shifts reinforce in our minds the judgment  that market participants are unlikely to be willing to continue to add indefinitely to  their claims on the United States at current exchange rates  So we continue to put  into the forecast a slight downward tilt to the path for the real exchange value of the  dollar  However, we recognize that over the forecast period the dollar could in fact  rise at times, and even on balance, as the host of geopolitical and economic risks now  present in the global economy are resolved       My final observation is that the projected recovery in US output growth remains   among the most important factors underlying our baseline forecast for growth abroad   We see various idiosyncratic economic fundamental factors in the individual foreign  economies as shaping our outlook and as conditioning the reaction abroad to near- term geopolitical events  Nevertheless, any developments that would significantly  change the outlook for US economic activity would have major repercussions  abroad  David and I will gladly try to answer your questions    "
4920,2003-05-06,"  In constructing our outlook for the rest of the world this time,   the task we faced was basically the same one we confront each Greenbook  We  needed to determine to what extent the information we had received over the  intermeeting period was consistent with our forecast in March and to what extent it  represented unexpected developments that appropriately required some adjustments  to our projection for this year and next  Although the task was familiar and routine,  the challenge was particularly difficult this time as so much of what has happened  since your meeting in March was driven by the extraordinary events in Iraq  For the  last three to four weeks, since the phase of major hostilities in Iraq wound down,  global financial markets appear to have responded to fundamental economic news  more than was the case earlier in the intermeeting period  Nevertheless, we have little  hard evidence on developments in the real sectors of foreign economies since the  most acute geopolitical risks substantially abated      May 6, 2003 13 of 115    Developments in global oil markets are the most straightforward to evaluate   Relative to our forecast in the March Greenbook, we are now projecting the average  spot price for WTI oil in the current quarter to be $9 lower  The same comparison for  the fourth quarter of next year yields a difference of less than $1  Thus events have  largely pulled forward in time a reduction in world oil prices that had been expected  to occur but more slowly  The most direct effect of that change is on the total cost of  imported oil for most countries, including our own, and we have visibly reduced the  US external deficit this year and next year accordingly  For major US trading  partners who are also oil exporters, such as Mexico, we have incorporated a negative  hit to their trade balance and to their aggregate income       The indirect effects of the lower path for global oil prices are less straightforward    We judge that confidence on the part of consumers and businesses abroad should be  boosted by the rapid fall in oil prices and the consequent benefit to real disposable  income and business costs  That difference should be greatest in the near term  To  date we have limited evidence on confidence abroad since the end of hostilities, and  what we do have presents a somewhat mixed picture  On balance, we saw the lower  oil prices as a moderate positive for consumer and business spending abroad,  particularly for the rest of this year     The foreign exchange value of the dollar fluctuated somewhat widely in the days   just before and following your March meeting, mostly in response to developments  within Iraq  Since early April, however, the dollar has trended down on balance and  in terms of the index of major foreign currencies has recently moved below its  March 12 low point  No doubt more by luck than any forecasting skill we might  have, fluctuation of the dollar–euro rate left that pair about in line with the path we  wrote down in March  We have adjusted down the US dollar in terms of the  Canadian dollar and the Mexican peso  In contrast, we have adjusted the dollar up in  terms of the yen  Taken together, these changes imply a slightly weaker level for the  real value of the dollar in terms of our broad index of trading-partner currencies, but  the rate of change from here through the end of the forecast period is projected to be  about the same as in our previous forecast     As in the United States, stock prices in most major foreign economies have rallied   in recent weeks  Equity prices are now up for the year in many European markets   The average across Europe represented by the DJ Euro Stoxx price index is back to  no net change for the year, after reaching a low of 20 percent below its late December  level on March 12  Stock prices are up on balance this year in major Latin American  emerging-market countries also, including Mexico and Brazil  For those countries,  EMBI+ spreads on dollar bond rates are down substantially as well  We interpret  these favorable developments in financial markets as consistent with an improvement  in confidence over time and a strengthening of real GDP growth  For now we judge  these developments to be in line with the pace of strengthening that we projected in  March but not a reason for revising upward our growth outlook for these countries      May 6, 2003 14 of 115    Stock prices in Japan and emerging Asia are the exception to the general picture  of rising equity values  In Japan, stock prices touched new twenty-year lows on  several occasions during the intermeeting period  Although some prices rebounded  near the end of the period, the major stock price indexes remain well below their  values at the start of this year  We attribute the downward trend in Japanese stock  prices to the domestic concerns that continue to dog the Japanese economy, plus some  possible spillover from rising tensions with respect to North Korea and the effects of  SARS on Japan’s major trading partners in the region  The latest data have left us  slightly more optimistic about the pace of economic activity in Japan this year, but we  do not detect any evidence that would call for a major revision to our outlook for  economic activity in that country     One new element in the global economic picture since your March meeting has   been the emergence of SARS as a major economic threat to most of the emerging  Asia region  Even though we have no expertise in anticipating the course of the  disease, construction of the Greenbook baseline forecast required that we make a set  of working assumptions about its implications for economic activity  As we reported  in the Greenbook, we incorporated into the forecast the likely consequences of SARS  based on the information known at that time  In large part that involved limiting the  effect of SARS primarily to key service sectors such as travel and entertainment and  positing that its adverse effects would be felt mainly in the current quarter  We have  added some small positive payback later this year and in early 2004 as the lost travel  and sales are partially recouped  This approach yielded an estimate of a downward  revision to growth this year in developing Asia that averaged about 05 percentage  point owing to the SARS outbreak  Based on the information we have to date, we see  the effects as largest for Hong Kong, somewhat less but still quite visible for China  and Singapore, and much smaller for various other Asian emerging-market  economies     The end product of our attempts to incorporate these various developments   into the baseline forecast is a projection for total foreign output growth of  about 2 percent in the first half of this year—¼ percentage point lower than  we had in March—followed by growth of 3 percent in the second half of this  year and about 35 percent next year  As is the case with the domestic  forecast, despite quite favorable outcomes of many events related to the Iraqi  conflict, we have revised down the path of foreign GDP  Most of the  downward revision is due to our estimate of the near-term effects of SARS on  global growth  The weaker projection for US real output growth is a factor  as well, particularly for Canada and Mexico  The more favorable oil price  developments and some buoyancy in global financial markets provide a small  offset  That concludes our remarks  We’d be happy to answer any questions    "
4972,2003-08-12,"  Well, I’d say that the improvement that’s apparent in Argentina—  whether it will be long-lasting is a different question—no doubt has had an impact in getting   people to use the domestic currency there  "
4973,2003-08-12,"  The staff outlook for real GDP abroad in the current Greenbook   is little changed from the one we presented last time  Again this round we are  looking for real growth in the rest of the world to strengthen on average from less  than 1 percent in the first half to about 2½ percent in the second half of this year and  to nearly 3½ percent during next year  With the calendar now telling us that we are  well into August and thus about halfway through the third quarter, you might  reasonably expect that evidence of such an acceleration should be emerging in the  data for real activity abroad       For July, we are mostly limited to survey data for evidence on production and   demand  But it is encouraging and consistent with our forecast that euro area and  UK PMI reports and euro area consumer confidence figures for July show  improvement as do readings on UK business confidence and Japanese business  conditions for small and medium sized enterprises  We have a wider range of data on  real economies abroad for the second quarter, and I scrutinized these data for  developments during the quarter that supported our projection of accelerating  economic activity  After showing weakness in May, German manufacturing orders  moved up strongly in June  French industrial production fell significantly in April  and May but then rebounded in June  UK industrial production also strengthened in  June  At least in part, both of these indexes reflected a jump in energy generation that  may have been tied to the very hot summer weather  The preliminary figure for UK  second-quarter real GDP shows a rebound in growth from the flat first-quarter  outcome  Canadian employment moved up strongly in June but slipped back a bit in  July  In Japan, machinery orders rose in May and June, and housing starts ended the  quarter with a sizable increase  Among the Asian emerging-market economies,  export orders expanded in Singapore in July; and industrial production in June  rebounded or strengthened further in several, including China, Taiwan, Korea, and  Singapore  But to be honest, some indicators signaled deceleration over the quarter,  with drops in June in industrial production in Germany, Italy, and Japan  Japanese  GDP, released this morning, reportedly grew more than 2 percent at an annual rate in  the second quarter, surprising us and most other forecasters, particularly with respect  to exports  All in all, my list of confirming data seems far from conclusive, and  indicators from Germany and Japan appear to be mixed  Nevertheless, although we  detected no basis in these data for an upward revision to our forecast, we saw no need  for a downward revision  So we have maintained the same positive trajectory for  total foreign GDP that we had presented in the previous Greenbook     Our reading of financial market developments over the intermeeting period is that,   on balance, market participants have become somewhat more optimistic about near- term activity abroad, confirming our basic view and leaving financial conditions  generally supportive of recovery  Since the June FOMC meeting, euro and sterling  three-month eurocurrency futures rates have shifted up, removing from market rates   August 12, 2003 16 of 110    expectations of further easing on the part of the ECB and Bank of England We see  positive market reaction to the most recent indicators, along with statements by  Japanese officials and the ECB about more-favorable prospects in their respective  economies, as consistent with our expectation that economic activity abroad is  already recovering from the sluggish pace earlier this year      Further gains in equity prices in the major foreign industrial countries over the   intermeeting period reinforce the view that market participants see stronger activity  and improved corporate earnings as likely in the near term  Moreover, greater total  stock market wealth should have some positive effect on household spending and  should provide some stimulus for business capital expenditure  The Japanese TOPIX  index rose sharply in early July as foreign investors reportedly augmented their  holdings of Japanese equity  Although some of those gains subsequently were  retraced, the index is up about 5 percent since the June FOMC meeting  Stock  indexes are also up on balance over the period in the euro area, Switzerland, the  United Kingdom, and Canada  All of these indexes remain well above their recent  lows in March       Ten-year government interest rates have risen as well, with rates in the major   foreign countries reaching a low in mid-June and climbing rapidly since then  Market  commentary linked movements in foreign rates to those for dollar rates, as discussed  by Dino and David, and most foreign rates displayed volatility similar to that for US  rates in recent weeks  This co-movement at least in part reflects shifts in demand by  global investors as expectations for future monetary policy here and abroad evolved  and as returns on dollar securities rose  However, long-term rates abroad, particularly  those in Europe, moved up significantly less than did US rates  With the exception  of Japan, long-term rates are now back about to where they were in late April and  early May  Japanese ten-year rates, after falling to less than 45 basis points, have  jumped back to about 90 basis points—their level in late December  We see these  higher rates as lessening a bit the favorable character of financial conditions abroad   But the magnitudes of the increases are not large, and the effects are widely seen,  even in Japan, as more than offset for many in the private sector by the rise in stock  prices     For many of our foreign trading partners, the expected recovery in real output   growth in the United States and the associated rebound in the global high-tech sector  will be critical factors in any acceleration of output  Accordingly, we wrestled with  the issue of whether the downward revision for next year in the staff’s forecast for  US real GDP growth should be reflected in a similar revision for foreign growth   Although adjustments were made for some countries, on balance these were  offsetting, leaving our figure for average growth during next year unchanged     Two of the elements tending to bolster growth abroad are the intermeeting rise in   the exchange value of the dollar and somewhat more expansionary fiscal policy now  expected for Germany and France   We have raised the projected path for the dollar  over the forecast period in response to its recent step-up  Although we still project a   August 12, 2003 17 of 110    slight downward trend in real terms for the weighted-average dollar, the stronger  value of the dollar—and thus weaker value for foreign currencies—now projected for  each quarter relative to the June forecast implies some boost to activity abroad  In  Germany, where real GDP growth was likely negative for a third consecutive quarter  in Q2, the government has announced its intention to inject some fiscal stimulus, and  we have revised up our forecast for 2004 as a result  France is expected to use the  German stimulus as cover for its own somewhat smaller fiscal expansion      All in all, the data that have become available since the June FOMC meeting, the   financial market developments over that period, revisions to the US forecast, and  macroeconomic policy shifts, both actual and prospective, resulted in our making  many marginal adjustments to our forecasts for individual foreign economies   However, those minor adjustments left the average for real output growth and  inflation abroad very similar to that in the June forecast  Such an outcome, along  with our slightly higher path for the dollar, yields an arithmetic contribution to US  real GDP growth from net exports of about zero for the second half of this year and  about minus 2 percent for next year  For the remainder of this year, a rebound in  exports to a moderately positive growth rate is crucial for the external sector to have a  net neutral effect on US expansion  For next year, we see imports responding  strongly, as historical experience suggests, to the projected strengthening of US  economic activity  Thus, although we anticipate that export growth will remain solid,  the external sector on net should again subtract slightly from US real GDP growth   That concludes our remarks, and we’d be happy to take questions    "
5051,2003-09-16,"  May I have a choice?  The United Kingdom is running a current   account deficit  As the UK economy has outperformed the Continent, it has come to be a bit   like the United States in worrying about its external situation and its external deficit  If a risk   premium is built into the market for the possibility that the exchange rate will have to depreciate,   that would push the long-term interest rate up     Right  "
5052,2003-09-16,"  Since the Greenbook forecast was completed, we have received   additional data about the US external sector—the figures for July nominal trade,  August prices for internationally traded goods, and second-quarter balance-of- payments statistics  The nominal trade deficit in July was a bit smaller than we had  anticipated, mainly owing to stronger exports  We were pleased to be a little  surprised in the positive direction by exports, and we read the July data as consistent  with our forecast that real exports of goods and services will rebound during the  second half of this year after a very weak performance since the fourth quarter of last  year  In July, both exports and imports of services continued their recovery from the  contractions in spending on travel and related categories that we saw in the second  quarter as a consequence of the war in Iraq and then the SARS outbreak  All in all,  the changes to our forecast suggested by the July data are small and only slightly alter  our view of real net exports in the near term  The prices of non-oil merchandise  imports and merchandise exports both declined marginally in August  The decline in  the price of natural gas from its previously elevated level continued to hold down  prices for imported goods  The balance-of-payments data for the second quarter were  also close to our Greenbook projections  Private portfolio inflows remained very  strong in the second quarter, with especially strong demand for Treasuries and  corporate debt securities  Nonetheless, official inflows picked up from their  extraordinary first-quarter pace as intervention purchases of dollars increased  The  one relatively weak spot on the financing front has been direct investment inflows,  which have languished with the dearth of merger activity     These data, along with those that became available over the intermeeting period,   increased our confidence that the pace of economic activity abroad is accelerating and   September 16, 2003 19 of 106    led us to revise upward somewhat our outlook for the second half of this year and for  next year  We see foreign financial conditions as reflecting positive developments  across a range of countries and as contributing to the conditions that will support  further strengthening of business and consumer spending  Stock prices moved up  noticeably in most foreign countries since the August FOMC meeting, particularly in  Japan and in some emerging-market economies  These price increases should ease  some financial sector vulnerabilities by strengthening the balance sheets of Japanese  banks and lessening somewhat problems at pension funds and insurance companies  abroad  Higher share prices should lend support to domestic demand through  household wealth effects and business willingness to invest  Yields spreads of  emerging-market sovereign bonds narrowed as well, reflecting an improved access to  capital more generally in several of these economies       Market participants have interpreted the stronger signals of recovery as implying   no likelihood of further monetary easing by the major foreign central banks  For  example, near-term futures curves have priced out expectations of additional cuts  that, in some cases, were there earlier in the summer  We generally agree with this  inference and have incorporated into the September baseline forecast a prolonged  period of unchanged official rates  Nevertheless, market participants may be  expecting tighter conditions to emerge sooner than we—or the relevant central  bank—now envision  The Bank of Japan has taken action with respect to the tenor of  some of its discount and repo operations in an effort to reinforce the view that it will  not be raising the overnight rate anytime soon     Although the more optimistic tone of financial markets is shared by some   improvement in confidence readings and survey results, hard data on actual  production and spending rebounds remain limited  Some third-quarter figures for  production in emerging Asia are encouraging, and we have revised up our forecast for  developing Asia from 4½ percent to about 6½ percent for the second half of this year   To be honest, that revision reflects in part the fact that second-quarter declines in  those economies most damaged by the SARS outbreak exceeded our expectation and  set the stage for a somewhat stronger rebound  The emerging-market economies in  Asia should also benefit from gains in the global high-tech sector and from the  recovery projected for the US economy  They stand to benefit as well from the  strength of domestic demand in China and from spillovers from China to its trading  partners, as China has increasingly become a source of net trade stimulus to its Asian  trading partners, including Japan     We see the Latin American emerging economies, particularly Mexico, and the   other industrial countries as poised to recover as well, although less vigorously than  emerging Asia  Broadly supportive monetary conditions and fiscal stimulus in a few  cases should support some acceleration in domestic demand  The strength of activity  in the United States will be particularly important for Canada and Mexico  Although  we have projected only a gradual acceleration in euro-area real GDP to rates of about  2½ percent by the second half of next year, we expect euro-area domestic demand to  grow somewhat faster, reaching nearly 3 percent in 2004H2   September 16, 2003 20 of 106      Overall we see a global recovery that is somewhat unbalanced, with momentum   concentrated in the United States and the Asian emerging-market economies  But  most of the major regions of the global economy should benefit from the spillovers  from these regions and from more-favorable global market conditions  Of course,  one consequence of relatively strong income growth in the United States is a further  widening of our external deficits, with the current account deficit on track to reach  about 5½ percent of GDP by the end of the forecast period     In addition to the data already mentioned, since the Greenbook was distributed we   have learned about some progress with respect to Argentina’s negotiations with the  IMF  An agreement was reached and Argentina eventually made the payment that  was due on September 9, thereby avoiding the problems that would have followed  from a technical default  The program includes a commitment to a primary fiscal  surplus of 3 percent of GDP in 2004 and greater independence in the implementation  of monetary policy going forward  However, several of the contentious issues that  had delayed the negotiations were resolved only in general terms, with specifics to be  determined later  That concludes our prepared remarks  We’ll be happy to take  questions    "
5108,2003-10-28,"  Well, I’m foolishly going to offer to say something on this subject!    [Laughter]  The dilemma with the arbitrage reasoning that you have accurately laid out is that   one end or the other of the term structure of exchange rates implied by it needs to be nailed down   in some way for that by itself to tell you where the spot rate should be  Regrettably, that’s the   piece that is missing  It’s not that the arbitrage conditions fail, and it’s not that the respective   interest rate differentials don’t give you a whole term structure at some level of movement in the   spot rates  The problem is that nowhere is it attached to a level       But the magic term is “aggregate supply”  What pins down the   aggregate supply of a currency?     In real time on a given day, at a particular minute, a certain supply   exists and the price equates demand to it, yes       But in an attempt, based on theoretical reasoning, to determine what   shocks should do to that system or what the future rate should be and so forth, the issue is that   the supply of a currency has no economics behind it  The supply could be anything     There are no parameters of a supply curve that are driven by incentives   as there would be, say, if we were talking about the price of lumber in a year  For example, one   can think about the reasoning behind the actions of the people who buy lumber and of the people   who sell lumber  And one could, rightly or wrongly, write down curves that describe that   behavior and thus predict a price based on them       But recall that each exchange rate involves two currencies  So in the   case we’re discussing, one is implicitly talking about the supply of dollars and the supply of yen    While a certain supply exists in calendar time at this moment, nothing predetermines the supply   of either currency going forward  Both of those variables might move in a way that markets   can’t predict  So the arbitrage theory—     Wise suggestion  "
5109,2003-10-28,"  As we reported in the Greenbook, the information about   economic activity abroad that we have received since the September FOMC meeting  has confirmed our view that foreign real GDP growth has rebounded from the weak  pace of the first half of the year  Based on various indicators from a variety of  countries plus the more robust estimate for US third-quarter growth than had been  projected in September, we have revised up our best guess of average real growth  abroad last quarter to 3½ percent from the 3 percent we had projected     The upward revision to the GDP growth figure for the third quarter is due in part   to a recovery in some previously strong countries that were weak earlier in the year  for transitory reasons  The primary explanation for this outcome is the SARS  epidemic, and the countries in question are China and other emerging-market Asian  economies  But we have also revised up forecasts for countries such as the United  Kingdom, where the most recent evidence suggests a stronger pace to real activity  than we had expected     Looking ahead for 2004 and 2005, we see continued average growth abroad at   about the current pace as most likely, similar to our September outlook although we  have fiddled a bit with the projections for individual countries  Sustained growth at   October 28, 2003 16 of 126    3½ percent would be a welcome improvement in foreign economic performance, and  it would go some way to closing the relative growth differential between the United  States and its trading partners  Our baseline projection calls for that gap to narrow  from over 1½ percentage points this year to about ½ percentage point in 2005  Such  an outcome would lessen the sense that the global economy is overly dependent on  the engine of US growth, although I hasten to add that a surprising shortfall of US  growth from that projected in our baseline would have negative implications for  growth abroad as well     Among the foreign industrial countries, we expect that Canada and the United   Kingdom will continue to record the most successful performance  Domestic demand  within those economies continues to be strong, and financial markets as well as we  are now expecting the Bank of England to begin raising its policy rate soon in  response  In our baseline forecast, growth in the euro area firms over the next year  and achieves a pace of about 2½ percent in 2005  In contrast, we are a bit skeptical of  the signs of recovery in the Japanese economy and have written down positive, but  still low, real GDP growth going forward for that country  All in all, the picture for  the industrial countries is one in which the expansion remains somewhat uneven but  is shared by all the major countries       For the developing countries, the projected improvement in growth over the   forecast period is more dramatic, as both the Asian and Latin American countries  recover from various idiosyncratic problems this year to achieve significantly more  vigorous growth next year  We anticipate that China will continue to outperform all  other countries with respect to reported real GDP growth, although we expect the rate  to moderate a bit by 2005  Elsewhere in Asia, strength in the global high-tech sector  should provide support for rapid output growth of production that in turn will  underpin incomes and domestic demand  In Mexico, sustained expansion of output  depends upon a rebound in US manufacturing that in turn stimulates Mexican  manufacturing  In general, we see dispersion of real output growth lessening across  the developing countries as global recovery becomes more firmly established in 2004  and 2005     Our projection that growth rates will return toward trends in most countries results   in part from our sense of the normal working of macroeconomic forces and in part  from our natural reluctance to project any major new shocks to the global economy   We do believe, however, that we can detect in current data the basis for such an  optimistic outlook     One shock that might be of particular interest and relevance is a more substantial   decline in the value of the dollar than we have incorporated into the baseline  Such a  development might seem a possibility in light of the nearly 5 percent drop in the  nominal value of the dollar in terms of the other major currencies that we have  experienced during the intermeeting period  In addition, the continued widening of  US trade and current account deficits, even as foreign growth recovers, might  heighten concerns on the part of global investors about taking on increasing amounts   October 28, 2003 17 of 126    of exposure to US assets  Accordingly, we included in the Greenbook an alternative  simulation in which the real exchange value of the dollar declines an additional  20 percent by the end of next year  This alternative continues to assume that China  and Malaysia peg to the dollar but posits a one-time revaluation in that peg so that  these countries share in the adjustment to a weaker dollar  Foreign monetary  authorities other than those pegging are assumed to implement policies according to a  Taylor rule, so that they do take steps to mitigate the consequences of exchange rate  appreciation for their domestic macroeconomic performance  However, with the  exchange rate shock phased in and the usual lags in monetary policy effectiveness,  such policy responses cannot prevent significant effects on real GDP growth and  inflation abroad  As reported in the Greenbook, the implications in the staff model of  this large and rapid decline in the dollar for US real GDP growth are plus ¾  percentage point in 2004 and 1½ percentage points in 2005  Core PCE inflation is  increased about 1 percentage point     For foreign economies, our model predicts the greatest decline in growth by year-  end 2005 in Canada because of its dependence on exports to the United States   However, in the near term, the largest negative impacts fall on Mexico and the  developing countries of Asia  These economies are also quite open and trade- dependent  In the simulation, the largest reductions in inflation also occur in Canada,  Mexico, and developing Asia  In response, the Taylor rule calls for very large  reductions in short-term interest rates by their respective officials  Under our  assumption that the shocks to exchange rates are comparable across all of these  trading partners, the negative consequences for growth in the euro area and the United  Kingdom are relatively mild and slow to develop  For Japan, the option to ease rates  in response to further appreciation is not available and so the consequences for real  growth are somewhat larger than in the euro area but less than in the other regions   This particular simulation suggests that significant and broadly felt dollar  depreciation would have its greatest effects on output in two of the regions of the  global economy where performance is now strongest, Canada and emerging Asia   Further into the future, in response to monetary stimulus, those economies should see  domestic demand offset the loss in external demand  With J-curve effects actually  increasing the nominal value of US imports following declines in the dollar, our  trade and current account balances initially worsen and then subsequently begin to  adjust  By the second half of 2005, the US trade deficit would begin to narrow   That completes our prepared remarks  David and I will be happy to answer your  questions    "
5171,2003-12-09,"  If I may?  I would note that the mechanism by which the 95 percent are   tied to the dollar is in some sense the willingness on the part of the holders of those currencies to   provide the financing  So the job left for the other 5 percent to do would be considerably smaller   than in another set of circumstances     December 9, 2003 8 of 133      Right, but as I said, the financing need would be so much smaller    "
5172,2003-12-09,"  With respect to economic activity abroad, our basic message for   you this meeting is that the rebound in activity that we have been forecasting for  some time has been confirmed in production and spending data for the third quarter   Indeed, we were sufficiently surprised by the strength of this rebound, primarily in   December 9, 2003 15 of 133    emerging Asia but also in some other regions, that we revised up our outlook for  foreign real GDP growth in the current quarter about ½ percentage point      The list of countries reporting double-digit real output growth in the third quarter   includes China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Singapore  No doubt these remarkable  magnitudes reflect a bounceback from the contraction of output in the second quarter  in those economies and the fact that the SARS epidemic, by its nature transitory,  accounted for the declines  Nevertheless, real GDP reached levels ranging from  about 2 to 9 percent above one year ago  Robust growth was also experienced in  Korea, Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines  Vigorous expansion in the global  high-tech industry has boosted growth in many of the emerging Asian countries  although other factors, such as strong expansion of domestic demand in China, have  also been important  Trade within the region has helped to spread demand broadly  across a number of countries, including Japan  Japanese exports, particularly to  China, have contributed substantially to the strong growth reported in recent quarters   Although some measurement issues raise concerns that the reported Japanese real  GDP data overstate the true pace of output growth, sustained positive growth has  occurred, in part because of stimulus from elsewhere in the region     Among the other foreign industrial countries, the euro area was another region   where growth came in noticeably stronger than we had expected in October  Of the  member countries, France and Italy have provided some positive surprises, whereas  Germany continues to perform at a subpar pace  Even in Germany, however, survey  data and some recent indicators show signs of coming improvement, and we again  have forecast an acceleration of economic activity in 2004  To be fair, I should admit  that there were some important exceptions to the generally optimistic outcome in the  third quarter  Real GDP growth in both Canada and Mexico, two very important US  trading partners, came in below our October projections  We think that, at least in  part, the reasons for their weak performances will prove transitory, and so we expect  a rebound in growth in the current quarter  All in all, we read the most recent data as  consistent with a rise in the growth rate of aggregate foreign output from an annual  rate of about 3½ percent last quarter to 3¾ percent this quarter  Although we do not  think the very rapid pace that was recorded in several countries for the third quarter  can be sustained, we see the recovery in production in many regions, the favorable  developments in labor markets in some cases, and the strength of domestic demand in  several key regions as confirmation of our forecast that average growth near the  current rate will continue over the forecast period     For the most part, developments in global financial markets are consistent with   and supportive of ongoing economic expansion abroad  Stock markets are generally  up over the period and since early in the year  Foreign monetary conditions remain  accommodative  Official rates were raised by the Bank of England and by the  Reserve Bank of Australia  In the other major foreign industrial countries, policy  rates were left unchanged, and long-term interest rates are little changed to up slightly  on balance since the October FOMC meeting  The generally positive news about real  economic activity abroad was about matched by the indicators released for the United   December 9, 2003 16 of 133    States, yet the dollar depreciated further on balance over the period, a trend that  seems to have intensified since the G-7 meeting and communiqué in Dubai in  September  As Dino reported, some recent events seem to have spurred market  participants to exert downward pressure on the dollar, including the emergence of  new trade frictions with China and renewed geopolitical risks associated with  violence in Iraq, Turkey, and elsewhere  Yet it is the also the case that dollar  weakness over the past few months has coincided with reduced private capital inflows  into the United States  As we reported to you in the Greenbook supplement, the  October data on international financial transactions revealed that private demand for  US securities remained weak  These data are confidential until their release on or  about December 15  The dollar moved down when market participants reacted to the  information that in September private foreign investors sold on net US Treasury  securities, agency bonds, and corporate stocks  Treasuries and equities were again  negative in October; agencies showed only small net purchases  In contrast, private  foreign demand for US corporate bonds remains healthy  Ongoing demand on the  part of US investors for foreign securities has added to the financing need for  foreign savings to balance the international accounts      The reasons for the reduced inflow are unclear  Relatively low US interest rates   could be one factor  A perception that the Administration is less committed than  previously to a strong dollar could be another  As market participants come to expect  near-term dollar declines, the incentive to reduce dollar holdings rises, creating the  risk of yet more selling pressure and price drops  We do not have a complete picture  of financial flows in the third quarter  To some extent foreign official purchases of  dollar assets have taken the place of private purchases  Significant foreign official  acquisitions of dollars continued in October and, according to data from FRBNY  custodial accounts, in November  Data on foreign direct investment are not yet  available  In the months preceding September, private foreign demand for US  securities had been quite strong  Data for two months are not sufficient to convince  us that a major reversal is under way     Accordingly, in the December forecast we have adjusted down the starting point   of the projected path for the real foreign exchange value of the dollar to reflect  exchange rate developments over the intermeeting period  As one more bit of  evidence that our crystal ball is a bit cloudy where exchange rate fluctuations are  concerned, the dollar has weakened further since we committed to that path in the  Greenbook  The nominal index in terms of major foreign currencies is already about  1 percent below the Greenbook projection for the first quarter  The projected path  remains tilted slightly down as we judge that, over some extended period, the  pressures exerted by the need to finance a widening current account deficit and  growing net international indebtedness likely will result in some further decline in the  dollar  But we recognize that the dollar is likely to fluctuate up as well as down at  times  Moreover, the current Greenbook assumption that you will begin to tighten  somewhat earlier than was incorporated into the previous Greenbook lends support to  possible upside pressures on the dollar in the coming year  That concludes our  presentation, Mr Chairman    December 9, 2003 17 of 133         I cannot answer the specific question regarding oil consumption in   Europe, although I will follow up on this  We do judge that there is an exchange rate effect in   the market determination of oil prices in the sense that the demand for oil reacts to local currency   prices everywhere on the globe  So as those currencies fluctuate against the dollar relative to a   relatively sticky dollar price for oil, they see changes in the relative price of energy, and they   react to the changes in those relative prices  That feeds back, on a short-term, day-by-day basis,   onto the demand for oil in the spot market, and it shows through to the oil price  I honestly don’t   have in my head a number in terms of how strong it is, but it’s not zero  Of that I’m quite sure     Now that’s a different question from the strategy of OPEC, which might shift the band as   a consequence of seeing a reduced international value of the dollar that is eroding somewhat the   price OPEC is getting for its oil  What we’re seeing now are fluctuations that are staying high in   the band partly as a consequence of exchange rate developments  If that persists and if the dollar   were to fall further, we might see the band shifting so that OPEC puts the spot market price back   in the middle of the band   December 9, 2003 18 of 133      Yes, I think $2 is the number we usually cite  So both of these factors   are at work  We think we see the exchange value of the dollar showing through to the gold   prices, for example, and we think we see it in some commodity prices  It certainly comes   through to oil in the sense of where the demand curve is  There is the larger question of whether   OPEC might change its strategy as well     Well, for places where one looks the hardest, say Europe, I’m not   aware that people see it as a data problem  I believe it’s still the case that what we would call a   Phillips curve analysis is not well confirmed in empirical estimates for most major foreign   industrial countries, with maybe one or two exceptions  People keep trying to find a relationship,   and I think in some sense if you want to believe one exists, you could find some evidence for it    But the evidence is not sufficiently persuasive that the relationship has become an accepted   characteristic  It is true, given that these are poorly fitting equations with big standard errors and   a tendency to go off track outside of sample and so forth, that there is probably a bit of evidence   supporting speed effects for some of these countries  As Dave just commented, that differs from   the situation in the United States in terms of the speed effects here  Most of the rhetoric about   December 9, 2003 19 of 133    speed effects comes from colleagues outside the United States  Central banks outside the United   States point to these issues as a problem, and they usually explain it in the context of a wage   determination process  So I think in fact econometrics hasn’t really answered the question of   how prices are determined in many European countries and in Japan too  Japan may be the   biggest puzzle of all, given that there is probably as much evidence for speed effects as there is   for gap effects in that country  That has opened up the door to this ongoing debate and some   behavior responses on the part of foreign officials     It was somewhat the story of the 1980s  That’s when a lot of this work   went on and where the word “hysteresis” came from  I think people do look to labor markets for   the explanation  I can’t say that I’ve seen studies that have revisited this question the way it was   looked at in the ’80s and have concluded that nothing has changed  I think things are changing    France is a country, for example, where a lot has changed by way of labor market regulation and   December 9, 2003 20 of 133    the like  Nonetheless, the process of wage setting is certainly more political in Europe than it is   here, and the capacity of the unemployed to matter either politically or in the markets seems   enormously less in Europe than here  That’s perhaps a reflection of the fact that most Europeans   have a more generous safety net than is typical in this country, so the unemployed may be   exerting less pressure  Moreover, the deck seems stacked against them a bit in that the European   labor unions don’t cry many tears over the unemployed outside their own particular union  The   political process is responsive to some degree, but the answer from the political arena seems to   be to provide much more in the way of safety net solutions as opposed to better working markets    There are other countries—Canada, for example, or Australia or New Zealand, with tremendous   regulatory changes—where we might look for the sort of phenomenon you’re talking about  I   don’t think the issue is black and white  It’s not that the phenomenon exists only in the United   States and nowhere else  There is a gradation  But the econometric analysis doesn’t really   provide a clear answer; the relationships are murky     To be honest, I haven’t checked what the private-sector forecasts are   saying, so I can’t comment on that  It’s certainly not the case that the projection for the dollar   has not shown through to our forecast  In fact I tried to suggest in the Greenbook that we’re   finally at the point now where past dollar appreciation has exited the very long lagged term,   particularly on the export side  So the consequences of the dollar depreciation since its peak in   early 2002 are now more or less fully coming through without being moderated by some of the   lingering effects of past dollar appreciation  In the export equation in particular we are seeing   some significant effects from the fact that the dollar is lower and going forward is projected to   come down  Now, in all honesty, in our forecast we don’t have a lot of dollar depreciation yet to   come  So it’s mostly a backward-looking effect of relative depreciation that we already have   experienced that is showing through to exports  We have export growth rebounding to   something like 10 percent  A significant portion of that is due to the exchange rate effect, and   some of it is due to the improved outlook for foreign economies that I talked about this morning   On the import side, it’s a little more difficult to say exactly how the dollar’s decline is   having an effect because import prices have been surprising us  We haven’t gotten the increases   in import prices that the econometric relationships would suggest we should get  So with that,   December 9, 2003 31 of 133    we have been chipping away at how much of a given dollar change we are willing to put into the   import price change  It’s only through import prices that the dollar is going result in imports   being restrained by the falling dollar  If import prices don’t rise in response to the dollar falling,   then the effect of the dollar’s decline doesn’t show through to the relationships that guide the   way we project imports     All in all I think we have fairly vigorous import growth here  As a consequence, we have   net exports becoming yet again a drag on output  We’ve had positive contributions from the net   export sector in somewhat anomalous ways during the slowdown because, while we had exports   falling, we had imports falling, too  Going forward, everything reverts to its usual sign  Exports   contribute positively; they contribute about 1 percentage point on average over the forecast   period in most quarters  But the contribution from imports rises to about minus 1⅓ to minus   1½ percentage points  So we get a net drag from the external sector reemerging, as is usually the   case, if I may put it that way   Now, how powerful is the dollar to do this?  We have the usual elasticities in our   equations  I don’t think our trade relationships differ greatly from those used by most of the   other forecasters that I know of  What is usually the culprit here is the fact that imports are so   much bigger than exports  What happens to imports really, really matters  The fact that we   aren’t seeing the depreciation of the dollar reflected in import prices may be a source of   difference between what we’re forecasting for net exports and what others are forecasting  We   would have slower imports and stronger GDP if we had the pass-through to import prices   occurring more quickly in the forecast     If I give Dave any more GDP he’s not going to buy it anyway!       I guess I’d say “no” as a short answer  It’s certainly true that some   other central banks comment from time to time on their sense of monetary accommodation  But   there are other central banks with a different position  For example, the Bank of England has   already raised rates, and the Reserve Bank of Australia has raised rates twice  But I think the   notion in international financial circles that the global economy has turned and it’s time to start   raising rates—there was even a time when people somehow thought the Fed would have to go   first—is not prevalent  We occasionally might hear in the press about worries voiced in other   countries that, if the Fed doesn’t act, how can we act?  But it turns out that we don’t have to go   first  The Reserve Bank of Australia can certainly go first, and it did       Well, that’s certainly a piece of it, although both of those banks I think   quite legitimately see themselves as having a zero output gap  The Australian economy has   December 9, 2003 36 of 133    performed remarkably strongly  So they need to have their policy rates much closer to   equilibrium than we do       Well, I would use that language even if they don’t  And I would say   that they are growing—      SPEAKER(?)  With speed limits     For various reasons their economy has been growing around 4 percent   at times and rather consistently  Now, in England, I think there is an enormous tension over the   housing prices on the one hand and other prices on the other  Not all prices are rising  There’s a   sense of the service sector of the economy versus the manufacturing sector of the economy  One   monetary policy just won’t do for the United Kingdom anymore, but of course, they can have   only one monetary policy  So there is a certain tension there  But I think in the international   setting it has become clear that, depending on the inflation situation and the macroeconomic   picture more broadly, some central banks need to be acting now and some do not have to yet    But I have not detected a sense that the reason the dollar is being sold is that we’re failing to   address an emerging inflation problem  I have certainly heard often—and Dino may confirm   this—that the Australian dollar is one of the currencies that has appreciated the most against the   US dollar, so just the interest differential in the normal course of transacting is looming in   people’s conversations  "
5225,2004-03-16,"  The staff forecast for economic activity abroad this year and   next is one of moderately robust growth and contained inflation  This favorable  picture reflects the rebound in the global high-tech industry as previous   March 16, 2004 15 of 107    overinvestment has been worked off; the positive spillovers to the rest of the world of  the expansion of the US economy; and the fruits of the accommodative policy,  particularly monetary policy, that has been in place in many foreign economies for  some time      Expansion abroad is no longer just prospective  Although foreign growth during   the second half of last year did not match that in the United States, it rebounded  sharply from the troubled outcome during the first half of the year, with total foreign  real GDP growth averaging more than 4¼ percent  To be sure, there were substantial  differences across countries, with those in emerging Asia charging ahead and those in  the euro area only inching forward  Nevertheless, by the fourth quarter of last year  the expansion was widespread and becoming more firmly established  Indicators for  the current quarter confirm that this process has continued  In some economies where  growth was unsustainably strong, such as Japan and China, we are looking for some  moderation going forward  And we expect that output in the euro area will accelerate  a bit further this quarter and next to come closer to the potential rate of growth for  that region     Of course, I would not be doing my duty to you if I did not look for the black   cloud among all this sunshine  Two issues seem to merit further discussion  recent  developments in oil and other primary commodity prices and concerns about the ever- expanding need to finance the US external deficit       Despite persistent forecasts of declining oil prices, spot prices for WTI have risen   from about $30 per barrel to $37 over the past six months, including a $3 per barrel  rise since your January meeting  To some extent, the higher oil prices have been  muted abroad as many foreign currencies have appreciated against the dollar   Accordingly, the balance of demand and supply in the global oil market would tend to  push up dollar oil prices at a time of general dollar depreciation  Other factors  supporting spot oil prices are the current low level of inventories, OPEC production  policy, the risk of instability in some oil-supplying countries, and the strength of  demand as the global economy expands  Nevertheless, futures markets continue to  expect declines in the price of oil going forward  Were any of several possible supply  disruptions to occur, the resulting spike in oil prices could threaten the global  recovery and put some upward pressures on prices more broadly       Nonfuel global primary commodity prices also have risen sharply in recent   months  Utilizing spot and futures prices, we project that these commodity prices  will increase at an annual rate of nearly 50 percent in the current quarter before  decelerating sharply and even reversing a bit later this year and next  Such sharp run- ups in commodity prices have occurred previously  This forecast applies broadly to  all the categories of nonfuel primary commodities  Thus the outlook is that the very  rapid rate of increase in these prices will prove transitory, in part because of supply  factors and the expected supply response to strong demand       March 16, 2004 16 of 107    Some have expressed concerns that the inflation in commodity prices is a leading  indicator of rising inflation pressures more broadly throughout the global economy   Within industrial countries, however, primary product prices are a very small input  into the determination of prices for final products  And a relative price change in  favor of primary goods will only partially retrace a trend against their relative price  that has been ongoing for some time  Nevertheless, particular bottlenecks for some  products could arise if demand for primary products remains strong, supported by  continued rapid output growth in China and elsewhere       Debate about the risks to the global economy posed by the large and growing US   current account deficit has been rising in volume as global recovery proceeds  Two  data releases to the public since the Greenbook was distributed—the TIC data on  January capital flows and the balance of payments data for the fourth quarter— provide some information on how that deficit has been financed in recent months   The TIC data were discussed in Part 2 of the Greenbook as we had that data before  Thursday  As was the case in November and December, foreign private net  purchases of US securities were quite strong, reversing the sharp reduction in those  purchases seen in September and October  Financial market concerns that these data  might be signaling a major shift in foreign preferences away from US assets appear  already to have abated  When these data were released on Monday morning, there  was little market reaction     The balance of payments data contained new information on US net investment   income in the fourth quarter That figure came in significantly more positive than we  had been expecting and implied a current account deficit in that quarter about  $25 billion less than in the Greenbook  This positive revision is entirely explained by  higher income receipts on US direct investment abroad, which in part is due to the  depreciation of the dollar and the resulting higher dollar value of recorded foreign  profits  In response to these data, we have narrowed our projection for the current  account deficit this year and next by about $20 billion and $10 billion respectively   These data only add to the mystery of how the world’s largest debtor country can earn  significant net income on its foreign investment position     The balance of payments data also reported the complete picture of capital   inflows and outflows for 2003 and gave us our first look at the foreign direct  investment figures for the fourth quarter  For the year as a whole, the major  components of foreign private capital flows to the United States, securities purchases  and direct investment, remained very large—around $450 billion—and were not  much changed from the figure for 2002  Yet much has been made of the increase in  the foreign official holdings of dollars  These net purchases doubled between the two  years from around $100 billion to a bit over $200 billion Two items in the balance of  payments data reconcile these facts  First, US investors switched from being net  sellers of foreign securities to net purchasers and at the same time US foreign direct  investment abroad remained strong  So US capital outflows experienced a swing of  about $100 billion to about $220 billion  Second, the current account deficit itself  widened about $60 billion  Thus capital inflows faced a larger financing hurdle in   March 16, 2004 17 of 107    2003 than in 2002  Looking ahead, we see the current account deficit continuing to  present a moving target, reaching $600 billion by the end of next year  Capital  outflows are particularly hard to forecast, but our projection calls for them to rise  slightly over the forecast period     Our forecast for only a slight downward tilt in the foreign exchange value of the   dollar implies that some combination of private capital inflows to the United States  plus increases in foreign official holdings will willingly finance the expanding deficit  plus the outflows that occur at exchange rates near those of today  This may seem  like a major challenge  But I point out that the foreign private net purchases of US  securities in December and January, when expressed at an average annual rate, by  themselves come to nearly $650 billion  Dave and I would be happy to take your  questions        I asked my staff if they could make that decomposition, and I basically   got “no” for an answer  [Laughter]  The dilemma is that we’re talking about looking at this   across all the different currencies and all the different—      I understand  And that is shifting a bit when this valuation effect   shows up and when there were offsetting gains on the one hand versus losses on the other    Remember we’re talking now about US earnings abroad, not foreign earnings here  At any rate,   the staff did not seem hopeful that they could disentangle the earnings in euro, yen, Canadian   dollars, and pounds and the exchange rate effects as reported in these data  We know the general   tendencies, but we don’t have enough data to do the actual accounting that would disentangle   that     I raised that question  I think what we’d have to do at this point is to   look at annual reports or something  At some later point we may have those data     Right     Back to their foreign currencies     And we would have to do it over time in order to track foreign earnings   versus the imputed exchange rate effects that we would have injected into that calculation  "
5277,2004-05-04,"  We don’t have any actual real-time data on inventories at that level     Copper prices are down     Well, they’re off their peak  When we put the Greenbook to bed, they had   come down from their peak level, and they have come down another 10 cents, I would say, since   then  That was largely on news of the macro monetary policy coming out of China rather than on   news about real economic activity or inventories or anything else  So, it was in some sense an   inference—in effect, that if China’s boom cooled, copper would become less viable—on the part of   those who trade in futures markets rather than a direct read on what was going on  Now, over the   same interval—since we put the Greenbook to bed through Friday, which is the last date for which I   have quotes—lumber prices, for example, both spot and in the futures market, went up not down    That’s partly because what is driving the lumber speculators or purchasers or hedgers or whoever is   US homebuilding as opposed to Chinese construction  And these market players thought they   were getting different signals, so the futures curve shifted the other way  Soybean prices, which are   being driven by expectations of the beginning of harvesting, also have gone up a bit since the   May 4, 2004 11 of 112       Greenbook rather than down  But cotton is down a lot off its peak; copper is down noticeably from   its peak; and wheat is down from its peak  So a more informed and discriminating shifting seems to   be going on, but it is tied to what people perceive to be news about the factors that are driving   demand in these markets     Right  And for metals, I think the story isn’t necessarily the same for all   of them  But copper in particular was thought to be driven by developments in China     I have a less detailed picture in front of me regarding aluminum  It   appears to have stopped rising as opposed to falling       Yes, but copper has already started moving down  "
5278,2004-05-04,"  One element of the external forecast that may be of greater   interest than usual is the recent and prospective behavior of import prices, and I  thought that I would begin by looking at some of the factors driving changes in those  prices  The advance release last week reported that the deflator for total imports of  goods and services rose at an annual rate of 10 percent in the first quarter, after  increasing only a bit more than 2½ percent over the four quarters of 2003  A large  part of this upsurge reflects the upward move in oil prices over the quarter, with the  prices recorded for computer and semiconductor imports providing some offset by  declining, but less than in the past on the part of computers  In part, the rise in import  prices also reflects continued increases in the prices for service imports, which rose  quite strongly in 2003 as the dollar depreciated  For the remaining import items,  which we term core imports, the annual rate of price increase in the first quarter was  66 percent, a bit less than we had estimated in the Greenbook but substantially more  than the 18 percent recorded last year       Among the components of core goods, the commodity-intensive categories of   foods and non-oil industrial supplies recorded the greatest jumps, with the latter rising  at an annual rate of nearly 24 percent  This development is consistent with our model  analysis, which suggests that the two most important factors behind the rapid inflation  in core import prices last quarter were the exchange rate and commodities, including  natural gas       Looking ahead, our forecast calls for deceleration of core import prices to an   annual rate of about 3½ percent over the remainder of this year and to about  ½ percent next year  This slowing importantly reflects the recent and projected path  for the nominal exchange value of the dollar, which paused starting around the turn of  the year following a two-year period of depreciation, has risen slightly on balance so  far this year, and is projected to decline only marginally over the forecast period  The  lagged effects of previous dollar depreciation were still evident in core import prices  in the first quarter, but our projection for the dollar implies that the contribution of the  exchange rate will be a small negative to zero starting with the current quarter       We expect that commodity prices will continue to exert significant upward   pressure on import prices over the rest of 2004, largely because of lagged effects from  previous increases, but then will hold down import price inflation in 2005, owing to  declines expected on average and in most categories  Our index for nonfuel primary  commodity prices rose nearly 50 percent in the first quarter, and our model finds that  the effects persist for four quarters  Prices in all four categories of commodities— food, beverages, agricultural raw materials, and minerals and metals—rose in double  digits in the first quarter, but some have peaked and begun to decline  Among the  individual commodity prices that rose most rapidly are those for copper, which have  already come off their recent peaks  Similarly, prices for soybeans have stopped   May 4, 2004 17 of 112       rising; futures prices call for spot soybean prices to fall sharply at midyear as new  crops are harvested  Thus although our forecast incorporates a rather abrupt change  in the course of nonfuel primary product prices, we believe that the signs of that  reversal are already evident  Accordingly, we believe that our forecast for significant  slowing in import prices is balanced, with risk on both sides     The extremely rapid increases in commodity prices during the fourth quarter of   last year and the first quarter of this year, particularly for minerals and metals, are  linked to the rebound of real output growth in some regions, especially emerging  Asia  Within Asia, the pace of growth in China, which has averaged nearly  15 percent over the past three quarters, is seen as a major reason for the strong  demand for commodities  Chinese authorities have taken steps to tighten monetary  conditions and to slow the rate of growth of bank credit in order to counter concerns  about domestic inflation pressures and excessive investment in some sectors  Our  forecast sees these efforts as successful, with growth slowing to a moderate  7½ percent rate but not collapsing as some fear  At the same time, we see inflation in  China lessening as the rapid increases in food prices abate  Elsewhere in emerging  Asia, we expect expansion to continue at a vigorous pace, depending importantly on  continued global spending on high-tech goods     Bolstered by rapid growth in Asia and continuing strength in the US economy,   we look for global output to grow at near its current pace over the remainder of this  year and to decelerate only slightly next year  Some parts of the global economy,  such as Canada and the United Kingdom, should continue to show firmness in  domestic demand  In Japan, we look for domestic demand, particularly private  investment, to be a source of demand stimulus, but net exports will be an important  element in maintaining real GDP growth at around 2½ percent through next year      The outlook for the euro area is more troubled  We expect that exports will   respond to the improved global economy and grow moderately  But given the past  appreciation of the exchange value of the euro, imports should rise as well  On  balance, we anticipate that the external sector will be a neutral factor and that real  GDP in the euro area will expand at about the same 2 percent pace as domestic  demand  Such an outcome will not allow for much progress in addressing the  macroeconomic problems, such as high unemployment rates and excessive budget  deficits, confronting many of the large euro-area countries  It should result in a small  tick down in euro-area inflation, permitting the ECB to delay any rate increase until  2005       Overall, our forecast for real output growth abroad is favorable  When combined   with our projection for slight depreciation in the real exchange value of the dollar, it  yields a rebound in our forecast for growth of total exports of real goods and services  to more than 10 percent over the remainder of this year and only slightly lower next  year  Both core goods and services should respond to foreign GDP and relative  prices and bounce back from rather weak first-quarter figures to moderate growth on  average over the forecast period  In nominal terms, export growth should about equal   May 4, 2004 18 of 112       or exceed that of imports, notwithstanding the strong performance of the US  economy  Nevertheless, the trade deficit is expected to widen further this year and  next, reflecting the extent to which imports already exceed exports  Accordingly, the  current account deficit is expected to move above $600 billion in 2005  Dave and I  will be happy to answer any of your questions       Well, if China’s growth fell below, say, 5 percent, I think we’d see fairly   significant spillover effects  Seven percent used to be a sort of “target” rate of growth; then it   became 8 percent and then it was around 10 percent  But China growing at 7 percent would be a   return to what we had seen for quite a few years in the 1990s, which would probably allow for a   better allocation of resources than growth of 15 percent is likely to be generating     The fact that China is not in fact a fully market-based economy is, I think, the bad news and   the good news  The bad news part is that it probably is leading to a misallocation of resources and,   therefore, to the risk of some over-accumulation of certain items—and the sudden redirecting of   effort because somebody may well wake up eventually and realize that the warehouses are full of air   conditioners, say, that aren’t moving   May 4, 2004 19 of 112       On the other hand, it’s partly good news because there are no phenomena like CEO risk   aversion or tendencies on the part of markets to overshoot or the need for depreciation or balance   sheet corrections to work their way through before companies make decisions  If the authorities in   China decide that too many resources are being used to produce air conditioners and what they   really want are snow blowers, the desired reallocation of resources will happen pretty quickly  So,   to my mind, the risk in China is more that resources are being wasted  And given that standards of   living in China and much of the world aren’t as high as we’d like them to be, that’s a very   significant and important cost  But I don’t think that involves the same systemic cyclical behavior   yet that a truly market economy would have     That said, if the Chinese run into economic problems in terms of their ability to meet the   demands of the population for rising standards of living and jobs—or if they fail to deal in an   orderly way with the transition from a mostly rural to a more industrialized economy—I don’t know   what the effects would be  If those efforts hit a rough spot, I don’t know that I have any special   expertise to suggest what might politically happen in China or how that situation would resolve   itself  I do think the spillover to the rest of Asia would be very severe—at least as bad as in the late   1990s     And in places such as Korea and a few other countries, we’re not seeing   the current account deficits and the need to attract capital; so if the capital were to stop flowing, it   May 4, 2004 20 of 112       wouldn’t have exactly the same consequences  On the other hand, outside of China, domestic   demand is not really the driving force in Asia; it is export demand  So in a macroeconomic sense,   the Asian countries are vulnerable to development in China and in the United States   "
5327,2004-08-10,"  As David has discussed, it now appears that the pace of US   economic activity in the second and third quarters has been and likely remains  somewhat less robust than we thought in June  Such a development naturally leads us  to question whether we should reduce our forecast for activity abroad, as the strength  of demand arising in the United States is an important factor for many regions of the  global economy  However, the data we have in hand for the second quarter and the  indicators we have received for activity abroad this quarter do not suggest any major  revisions to our outlook, and our projection for foreign economic growth is little  changed this time from that in the June Greenbook  The possibility of some spillover  from the softness in US activity remains a risk, however      The view that the foreign expansion remains moderately vigorous is consistent   with the fact that we were surprised on the upside by real growth of US exports in  the second quarter  Although we still lack monthly nominal trade data for June,  stronger-than-expected exports in May and positive revisions to April have led us to  project that exports of real goods and services expanded almost 12½ percent at an  annual rate in the second quarter—a full 5 percentage points higher than we were  forecasting in June  The nominal data show strength across most categories,  particularly capital goods and industrial supplies  By destination, they reflect the  second-quarter weakness in economic activity in China, with nominal exports to  China plus Hong Kong declining from the first quarter  We expect that real GDP  growth abroad, particularly in the major foreign industrial countries, will moderate on  average over the remainder of this year and, accordingly, that real exports will  decelerate some through next year     Our story is a bit less satisfactory with respect to real imports of goods and   services  Although US real GDP growth for the second quarter came in below our  expectations, real imports of goods and services also surprised us on the upside  A  higher figure than anticipated for May and an upward revision to April imply second- quarter real import growth of about 9½ percent, about 4 percentage points above our  projection in the June Greenbook  The strength in imports is widespread across  categories  For the second half of this year, when we incorporate the weaker outlook  for US GDP growth including the information from last Friday’s employment  report, we now expect real import growth to slow some, to an annual rate of   August 10, 2004 13 of 103          9 percent, about ¾ percentage point weaker than the figure in the current Greenbook    For 2005, we expect further deceleration in imports, to an annual growth rate a bit  less than 8 percent      With our outlook for import growth slightly diminished, we see the arithmetic   contribution of net exports to real GDP growth as moving to about minus  ⅓ percentage point in the second half of this year and averaging about that much in  2005  We have also shaved a bit off our projection for the current account deficit and  expect it to average 5½ percent of GDP next year     In addition to the less positive near-term news about the US economy, the other   major global economic development over the intermeeting period was a further rise in  oil prices  In line with futures prices at the time, we had expected the spot price of  WTI to begin moving down; and for the few days between the Greenbook release and  the June FOMC meeting it did just that  However, since June 29, the spot price has  moved up nearly $9 per barrel, to close above $44 yesterday  Our forecast for the  average spot price of WTI this quarter has been revised up $5 per barrel  Although  we and the futures markets still expect the price of oil to move down over the forecast  period, our projected path shows a decline of only $4 per barrel from the current  quarter to the fourth quarter of next year      Sorting the mix of demand and supply effects is made difficult by the limited   availability of very current data  OPEC raised its production target 2 million barrels a  day for July and an additional 05 million b/d for August and has continued to  produce above its announced quotas  Excluding Iraq, OPEC produced 269 million  b/d in June, an increase of about 1½ million b/d from April  Much of that increase is  due to Saudi Arabia and the Emirates; and other than Iraq, no OPEC member reduced  production significantly over the last few months  On August 4, Saudi authorities  announced that they had started production from two new fields three months ahead  of schedule       Nevertheless, there have been some negative supply factors over the intermeeting   period  The most important has been the Russian government’s virtual attack on  Yukos  In the guise of taking steps to collect unpaid taxes, the Russian government  has taken actions that seem intended to gain control of Yukos production assets  Both  the rapid reversals of some decisions made in the past several weeks and the  ambiguity of whether production will be disrupted in the near future have heightened  uncertainty in oil markets  In Iraq, intensified violence in recent days has threatened  oil exports from the southern ports on the Persian Gulf  Other sources of supply  concerns have been conditions in Nigeria and Venezuela plus questions about  refinery capacity and short-term refinery disruptions  These developments have  combined to put upward pressure on prices and to increase volatility      With spot prices rising even as reported supply has increased, it seems clear that   strong global demand for oil has contributed importantly to the run-up in prices  In  early July, the International Energy Association (IEA) revised up its estimates of   August 10, 2004 14 of 103          world oil consumption in the first and second quarters  For the first half of the year,  world oil consumption is estimated at 81 million b/d, up 3 million from the same  period last year  Global consumption is expected to rise slightly further during the  second half of the year  US demand for oil has risen over the past year, but much of  the increase in global demand is attributable to China, where demand has moved up  noticeably both last year and so far this year  IEA estimates put global production in  excess of global consumption in the second quarter, implying a considerable build in  inventories—more than is normal for that quarter  Such a development is only partly  evident in data on OECD inventories, which have increased but remain at low levels   If IEA data are correct and no supply disruption emerges, then inventories should  build further in the current quarter, with downward pressure on prices a likely result   This expectation seems to be priced, at least in part, into the futures market, which, as  mentioned earlier, yet again calls for prices to move down from their current highs   The current IEA data may be misleading, however  Recent upward revisions to  estimates of demand raise the possibility that demand is even stronger than now  estimated  The elevated level of the entire current path of futures prices suggests that,  in response to the intermeeting developments such as the Yukos events, traders have  become less sanguine that production will meet or exceed consumption going  forward       With strong global demand for oil a major factor in explaining the high spot   prices, the implications of the higher prices for our outlook for foreign growth are  complex  For individual countries, the consequences of high global oil prices might  be the same whether those prices result from supply restrictions or from demand  arising elsewhere  But on average, absent significant disruption, we judge that only if  global economic expansion remains strong will these prices be sustained  The data do  not suggest that we are reaching a global supply constraint  Accordingly, with no  major supply disruption yet occurring in oil markets or assumed in our forecast, we  have adjusted the growth and inflation forecasts for individual countries, but we  continue to project a sustained expansion abroad at a pace close to, but slightly below,  that experienced in the first half of this year  Dave and I will be happy to answer any  questions         But it matters if demand is being underestimated      That is where all the anecdotes about China come in, I think  Our   information about what is really going on in China is poor, at best  We know, for example, that the   electricity grid in that country is not up to the task of meeting current demands, and China’s   economy is growing rapidly  And we know that, in response to that, many manufacturers or other   producer units—or for that matter households, for all we know—have purchased generators  But   August 10, 2004 16 of 103          the use of numerous small generators burning kerosene or heavy fuel oil or whatever they burn is a   very inefficient way to supply electricity  Their use is lowering, if you will, the average efficiency   of producing electricity to support economic growth in China, perhaps in an important way      The story, though, is that to build capacity you need to stock it with an   original endowment and some of that is happening      Right, but we don’t know  All these anecdotes are out there, but no one   has real data     Well, certainly in the intermeeting period, not only the spot price but I   think the farther-out futures have reacted enormously to the Yukos story, which is not really about   production today  Actually, it might be about production today because overnight the Russian   authorities seized control of a big production unit of Yukos, which only added credence to the view   August 10, 2004 17 of 103          that the Russian government was trying to re-establish control over those assets or wanted to gain   some perceived political benefit by selling them at below true value to favored purchasers      It is hard to imagine that they would allow that to happen for any period   of time, but I’m sufficiently skeptical about their business competence that I wouldn’t assume that   they can do all this shifting and achieve their political aims and not disrupt supply temporarily  But   there is certainly no incentive for them to cut back production      To exert some leverage over the rest of the oil producers or for a host of   reasons      Well, you’re asking someone whose expertise in this matter is more   limited than I wish it were  It’s normal for this curve to display a downward slope, but it’s not   always the case that it does  There have been times when the front portion of the futures curve has   sloped up; that would not be considered an unprecedented event by any means  Oil is costly to   store  So that figures into the value of buying now to meet a future demand versus buying it in the   future     I’ve expressed to the people who study this market in great detail my frustration about the   fact that this curve slopes down all the time and rides up to the actual spot price  I’ve asked why it   is that the people in the futures market always continue to believe that the oil price is going to start   coming down “tomorrow” despite six months’ worth of evidence that that hasn’t happened  Those   who analyze the oil market confront me with this supply and demand story  They say that as best   they—and I assume all the people trading in the real markets—can tell, the data they have available   suggest that the current supply exceeds consumption  Now, we may someday learn that these data   were just wholly inaccurate, and that may explain what was misleading all of us  But the people   trading in the futures markets have the same data, and they, too, believe that current production   exceeds consumption by a comfortable margin  So they are always expecting that supply–demand   imbalance to show through to the oil prices     Now, these people have become a bit battle scarred  And the curve, at least to my eyes, has   flattened a little from some of its previous shapes  I think that’s because, even though the   production data, taken literally, suggest that production exceeds global consumption, people are   pricing in either some expectation of a Russian foul-up of one sort or another, or a terrorist event, or   August 10, 2004 19 of 103          the Venezuelan situation getting ugly, or something of that sort  So either they are attaching some   probability to supply being below global capacity in the future, or they have come to believe that the   data aren’t entirely reliable  Something, however, has caused them to bid up the far futures more   than a straight reading of what the market’s knowledge of demand and supply would create but not   so much as to take away completely this notion that inventories must be building somewhat and that   it’s going to show through to prices at some point      Pickup, yes     Or it will come down just with the passage of time  If among those   purchasers are people who envision some reason for using oil, they don’t need to buy in the spot   market because they will have already bought forward  If they are just speculating, as it gets close   to the time when they’re going to get delivery of this oil that they don’t really want, they’re going to   sell it spot  Ultimately, it’s only the people who actually consume the oil who can sustain the price   August 10, 2004 21 of 103          That’s what makes this global demand story have to be the context in which this trading is taking   place      And somewhere out there are alternative energy sources—tar sands, other   kinds of materials, or whatever  They often used to be cited as putting a limit on how high the oil   price could be      Even ethanol looks good      But if one imagines that the citizens of India and China, which would total   about 3 billion people, raise their per capita consumption of energy to, say, half the average of that   in industrial countries—     That would result in an altogether different picture of the long-term   energy supply–demand balance in the world  And the effect of that has to feed back at some point    Now, if that were really what was driving everything, one might think that investment in the energy   sector would just be taking off, and I don’t see that either  And part of it is because this miserable   curve slopes down all the time  In the short run it always seems as if the price of oil is going to fall   August 10, 2004 22 of 103          any day and, therefore, that such investment is not really going to pay off  There’s a certain   inconsistency in that, I realize      It’s certainly true that the role of Saudi Arabia as the swing producer was   a deliberate and explicit policy adopted by the Saudis  They would restrict production or they   would expand production in an attempt to set a sort of horizontal supply curve for oil at a specified   price  That has just broken down  It has broken down for a variety of reasons  What I think we’re   seeing is the transition to some new structural pattern in global oil and related sources of energy that   hasn’t really settled out yet  And it’s not clear exactly how it is going to settle out   "
5377,2004-09-21,"  The baseline forecast for real output growth in the rest of the   world is little changed from that in the August Greenbook  This is the case despite  substantial market volatility of, and much media attention to, global oil prices  The  primary reason is that despite the intermeeting fluctuations, the path of oil prices  implicit in futures prices showed little net change from the path incorporated in the  August Greenbook  We did look very carefully at the question of how the effects of  elevated oil prices are likely to be distributed across foreign economies  And there  are differences among industrial countries, emerging-market economies, net oil  importers, and net oil exporters  Nevertheless, the basic common elements of  reduced oil intensity in several foreign countries, especially the foreign industrial   September 21, 2004 18 of 100          countries, and well-anchored inflation expectations in most important foreign  economies, along with the expectation that only a portion of the spike in spot prices  will prove to be persistent, have led us and most forecasters to judge that the output  effects of recent oil market developments will be limited     Our initial projection for growth abroad in 2006 is that foreign real GDP will   expand at about 3¼ percent, a slight deceleration from the 3½ percent annual pace of  the second half of this year  Among the industrial countries, most of the stepdown in  growth is accounted for by Canada and the United Kingdom, countries whose  economies have been expanding particularly rapidly, closing their output gaps, and  that need to bring growth in line with potential in order to avert the emergence of  inflationary pressures  The central banks of both those countries have already moved  to tighten policy, with the Bank of Canada tightening 25 basis points earlier this  month and the Bank of England increasing rates by a total of 125 basis points since  mid-2003  Some deceleration is also projected for the Asian developing economies  on average, particularly in Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan, and Indonesia  Elevated oil  prices are boosting headline inflation abroad, but core price inflation, where data are  available, appears to be well contained  Over the forecast period, we expect inflation  abroad to decline gradually as oil prices reverse some of their recent run-up and as  food prices, which have been a factor in Asia, retreat in response to increased supply,  and as monetary tightening in Brazil and Mexico have some effect     Extension of the forecast horizon to the end of 2006 allows the effects of returns   to near-trend growth here and in most regions abroad to show through to our  projections for real net exports, the nominal trade deficit, and the current account  deficit  The consequences of weakness in activity here and abroad earlier, past dollar  depreciation, and sharp swings in oil and nonfuel commodity prices will have been  pretty much fully felt by the end of 2005  For this forecast, we have projected  slightly more rapid depreciation of the dollar than previously, with the broad dollar  decline averaging nearly 1½ percent in real terms in 2005 and 2006  We judge that  such an outcome in relative income here and abroad and in price competitiveness of  US goods would lead to a widening of the nominal US trade deficit of about $90  billion from its current average through the last quarter of 2006  In addition,  prospective increases in market dollar interest rates, along with other factors, imply  that US net investment income will move into deficit, declining nearly as much as  the trade deficit over the same period  As a result, our projection for the current  account balance widens from about $700 billion this quarter to nearly $880 billion in  the fourth quarter of 2006, reaching about 6½ percent of GDP  In real terms, there is  an equivalent deterioration  The positive contribution from real exports to overall  GDP growth slowly diminishes from more than 08 percentage point this year to less  than 07 percentage point in 2006  And the negative contribution from imports  remains above 1 percentage point, reaching 13 percentage points over the four  quarters of 2006  There is thus a persistent subtraction from US GDP growth that  arises from the external sector and that reaches about ⅔ percentage point in 2006   The slight deceleration in real export growth primarily reflects a lessening of the past   September 21, 2004 19 of 100          impetus coming from relative prices, particularly from the exchange rate  Similarly,  the strengthening in real import growth arises largely from a relative price boost  Of  course, real export growth would have to exceed that of real imports substantially at  this point for real net exports to have a neutral effect on the forecast for US GDP  growth     Only a few forecasters have added 2006 to their outlooks  Although we are not   absolutely alone in anticipating a marked deterioration in the external balance over  the next two years, many forecasters currently call for little change from this year to  next  For example, the average current account deficit polled by Consensus Forecasts  is about $625 billion for both 2004 and 2005  Of course, some of the individual  outlooks in that average call for the deficit to widen, but some actually project a  narrowing  Plus, a number above $800 billion for 2006 seems to be way off the radar  screen of most forecasters     Our view that the current account deficit will widen into rather startling new   territory reflects the large size that the deficit has already reached and our projected  path for the dollar  Trend growth here and abroad is consistent with the deficit  widening further unless relative prices change, and the present large deficit means  that the decline in the nominal balance moves quickly as likely growth rates yield  rapidly diverging exports and imports  This poses a severe challenge to us with  respect to our projection for the exchange value of the dollar in the baseline forecast     For some time we have taken to heart the results of research that we and others   have done that shows that structural models of the exchange rate have little  forecasting power  Accordingly, we have incorporated into the forecast paths for the  real value of the dollar that are nearly flat, with some slight trend at times to signal  features of the maintained assumption about US monetary policy or our ongoing  concern that the financing of the US external deficit would ultimately result in  downward pressure on the dollar  But that strategy now results in the external sector  having a very prominent effect on the top-line GDP path  Moreover, as the numbers  we are writing down get larger and larger, we are beginning to have doubts that  financial markets will be able to manage them easily  However, no clearly better  alternative comes to mind  If we arbitrarily projected a path for the dollar that  minimizes the negative effects coming from the external sector, then we would be  masking an important feature of the US macroeconomy, and that dollar path, rather  than net exports, would become the essence of the international forecast  Because we  do not believe that we truly can project when any major change in the value of the  dollar will happen, in particular whether it will happen within the forecast interval,  we do not see any basis on which we could follow that strategy  For now, we have  used the alternative simulation in the Greenbook to suggest to you what would be the  consequences of a sharp move in the dollar sometime in the forecast period  As  awareness of the looming external deficits becomes more widespread, we may see  more clues in financial markets as to what to expect from them  Dave and I would be  happy to answer any of your questions   September 21, 2004 20 of 100              Well, I like to avoid the words “unsustainable” or “sustainable”   because then you’ll ask me what makes something sustainable and I can’t answer that question       I absolutely agree with everything you said     Yes  And where we saw it most clearly was when it came time to look   at the contribution of those numbers to GDP  In the past, there were those of us, such as myself,   September 21, 2004 21 of 100          who were somewhat of a Cassandra regarding the external deficit, but we were talking tenths of   a percentage point one way or another in terms of the effect on GDP  The notion that the effect   would get swamped by the unanticipated ups and downs that would come along in the forecast   period was always present, and the external sector didn’t seem to be creating a situation that   would strike financial market participants as unmanageable   This time, as we worked our way through preliminary runs of the forecast, the negative   contribution from the external sector got up to be almost 1 percentage point of GDP  Well, we   finally settled on something a bit smaller for 2006  But 1 percentage point of GDP gets one’s   attention; in fact, ⅔ percentage point of GDP gets my attention  So the reason that this seemed   an opportune time to call extra attention to that point is that, when we first extend the forecast   horizon, as we have now into 2006, it gives us a longer time period over which these kinds of   forces are having their effect  This is a very inertial process, so one has to look ahead more than   just a few quarters to see its consequences   We don’t know much else about 2006, so we don’t have information that would lead us   to say, “Oh, a US recession is going to cause imports to fall,” or “A crisis in Asia is going to   cause capital inflows to be particularly high”  We don’t know what kinds of other random   events are going to occur in 2006  All we’re seeing is this long-lasting fundamental process, and   we’re seeing it very clearly  Surely, the numbers we’re forecasting right now for 2006 will not   actually happen; I fully appreciate that  But they will be embedded in what does happen, and   this is an opportunity to see them more clearly before the outlook gets complicated by other   developments     Unless you happen to have an urn and a few balls that I can select   from, I don’t think I’m in any better position than you are to judge that outcome  When we have   in some previous Greenbook simulations—or in the June FOMC presentation, for example—  added an asset market disruption and volatility as a consequence of a change in the dollar, it is   always just very arbitrary on our part  There’s no systematic link that we’ve been able to   discover in the data between the exchange rate and these other things  A lot depends on the   exogenous shock, if you will, that gives rise to the exchange rate change  So to mimic a world in   which people became less confident about US assets, we put in higher risk-premium terms and   things that drive the stock market, and we get out some disruptive effects  But the dollar could   move as a result of a world in which productivity gains finally started showing up in other   countries—      Yes  But I’m looking at a scenario that would have a net positive   shock to the global economy so that it’s not that our incomes in the future are likely to be lower   but that foreign incomes appear likely to be higher  Foreign assets look as if they should be   valued more highly  The relative differential shows through to cause the dollar to fall, but on   balance, it is a more favorable foreign outlook rather than a less favorable US outlook that   produces that effect You’d get a very different story if the dollar were to fall for political   reasons that could be driven by safe-haven concerns, which would tend to drive down US long-  term interest rates somewhat, as we saw in ’97 and ’98  Alternatively, the dollar could fall for   anti-US political reasons, and presumably people would then be selling US bonds as well as   US dollars  So the mix is all over the map  The dollar itself is just a reflection of what that   underlying shock might be, as would be the case with stock prices and with the long-term   interest rate  We can arbitrarily put those shocks into the model and get out the answers, but   basically we feel why bother the model?  We could just write down the answers  That’s in   essence what we’d be doing, so we’ve shied away from it      Well, presumably that would lead to a step-up in the US saving rate    We would get some benefit from a dollar decline  Remember, a drop in the dollar is a very   expansionary shock to the US economy When we run that shock sort of naked, the way we did   this time, and ask the model what the outcome would be, the Taylor rule wants monetary   tightening  And we still get some more output and some more inflation because it’s a very   expansionary shock  But if it happens in the context of something like a loss of confidence,   September 21, 2004 27 of 100          these residuals that were just being discussed presumably would go up in other countries, too—  ones without all of the attributes of the United States, such as Brazil, Argentina, and Korea     These kinds of shocks tend to be associated not with expansionary macroeconomic   outcomes but with recessionary macroeconomic outcomes because, despite the fact that the   exchange rate gets a relative price boost, these other events cause such havoc and disrupt fiscal   policy and so forth that there’s often monetary tightening to counter the inflationary effects  But   also there’s stress in the financial markets and stress in investment spending, and fiscal policy   gets off track and, all in all, you get a recession movement, not an expansion, despite the   exchange rate shock  So out of context, it’s just very difficult to put these added features into the   equation along with the exchange rate  One could do dozens of these simulations, and I would   have no way of attaching probabilities to them, to be honest     Right     It has some balance sheet effects that complicate the household sector’s   problems and the nonfinancial corporate sector’s problems, and typically there are some balance   sheet effects that threaten the banking system  Now, for sure, we don’t think that a depreciation   in the dollar would have serious consequences for the US banking system  In June I mentioned   that, given the information we had, the balance sheet effects from a dollar depreciation appeared   to be abroad rather than at home  Dollar-denominated assets would become less valuable   abroad, but balance sheets in the United States would tend to be more or less dollar neutral   September 21, 2004 28 of 100          because the dollar is on both sides  It would be a complicated picture  But the confidence   effects and other aspects of the story depend very much on the precipitating shock     The holdings abroad need to be divided into two basic categories, one   of which is the net foreign direct investment story and the other is the portfolio—that is, stocks   and bonds and bank claims  What you’ve described has characterized the foreign direct   investment portfolio  We have, on average, earned higher rates of return on our holdings of   foreign direct investments than foreign investors in the United States have earned on theirs  That   has been a big source, and will continue to be a big source, of net positive income into the US   current account  It is ironic that we’ve become the world’s biggest debtor and nonetheless we’ve   actually been recording, at times, positive income flows  That is because much of the bond   portfolio is dollar-denominated  There are very few—some, but not a lot—foreign-currency-  denominated bonds issued by US corporations; they are mostly dollar-denominated bonds  And   interest rates on those have been quite low  So even though the position has deteriorated—  basically, rather severely—from 1995, the net income actually stopped deteriorating and was   quite flat for a while, owing to the low interest rates  In principle, if the interest rates were   September 21, 2004 29 of 100          actually zero, one could see that that whole part of the portfolio wouldn’t matter at all  So the   notion that we earn more on direct investment is still present in the data and in our forecast  But   as we apply somewhat higher interest rates to the bond part and the bank deposit part, we finally   see the consequences of being a big net debtor starting to overwhelm this direct investment   portion of the position      Well, one of the features in the Greenbook simulation, going back to   the prior question, is the model’s ability to say that foreign policymakers act in a way that speaks   to this codependence  One problem that we face collectively in the global economy is that the   low interest rate environment for all concerned does limit the capacity of foreign central banks to   stimulate domestic demand as they lose external demand  So zero-bound problems become quite   relevant, as we highlighted especially in the paper that we circulated ahead of the June meeting    The most immediate and direct device we have for undoing the codependence is to get domestic   demand abroad stronger and to do that through monetary policy stimulation; but that’s limited to   some degree by zero-bound problems  And when we run these model simulations, we tend to hit   the zero bound, particularly in the euro area, say, where the policy rate is sitting at 2 percent   right now  And, of course, Japan is already in the vicinity of the zero bound, so there’s not a lot   of scope for stimulating domestic demand   If I wanted to, I could tell a happy story  There are plenty of happy stories  We’ve been   through this before—in the 1980s—and we’ve lived through the past decade The world hasn’t   September 21, 2004 30 of 100          stopped turning; even the financial markets haven’t stopped turning  There’s a lot of potential in   the developing world for capital accumulation, either financed out of the high saving rates of   those countries or financed out of foreign direct investment that doesn’t keep flowing into the   United States but goes to China, to the rest of Asia, and maybe even to Brazil and other Latin   American countries  There’s a lot of potential in Brazil  There have been investment bank   articles that I’m sure some of you have seen about how fifty years from now China, India, and   Brazil are going to be the dominant economies in the globe  If that capital accumulation is   realized, that’s domestic demand in the rest of the world  The market economies of the globe   can handle all that; there’s no reason to think that it can’t lead to a quite benign resolution of the   circumstances we’re now in  But that’s terribly complicated, more by politics, property rights,   infrastructure, and those kinds of issues than by anything inherent in this imbalance problem       The essential monetary policy contribution, it seems to me, is to keep   US inflation low and US output as close to potential at a sustainable rate as possible  This is   what you would do in any event     But as a footnote to the 1980s, that was a time when the rest of the   world was growing; it enjoyed a much better macroeconomic performance  Japan was growing   September 21, 2004 32 of 100          strongly  Europe was doing better  The domestic demand contributed from outside the United   States was healthier at that point      Yes       That is the case in our model  However, I’ve been, if anything, a bit   skeptical about that  But when you reduce any component—exogenous government spending,   exogenous investment, a change in the saving rate—you create an opening in the demand–supply   balance that is then going to be filled by something, and you want it filled by exports That   would be the pro-adjustment response    Our model suggests that, as monetary policy eases in response to flagging demand, we’re   more likely to get interest-sensitive components of US domestic demand stepping in than to   induce a change in the exchange rate and get higher exports  But that is all conditional on two   things, one of which is how interest-sensitive that demand is  And if the interest-sensitivity isn’t   as high as we have it in the model or if those components suffer some of the residual problems of   the sort they have suffered lately because of confidence or whatever, maybe US interest-  September 21, 2004 35 of 100          sensitive demand won’t come rushing in  That’s one possibility  The other is that, as far as the   model is concerned, that relationship depends on the model’s ability to tell us what the exchange   rate is going to do because the induced effect on the exchange rate is how that adjustment works    I always start and stop these conversations by saying that we don’t have a good model of the   exchange rate and that’s why we make all our statements conditional  In order to close   models—most models, including ours—we use uncovered interest parity because the model has   to have an exchange rate equation  There has to be something that does that, and that’s what   economic theory says to put in there, so that’s what we put in  But uncovered interest parity has   never succeeded empirically, ever  So that conclusion rests on these two properties  that we   don’t really know what the exchange rate response would be and that we don’t know if our   interest sensitivity is as high as the model says it is     I could tell stories in which that flexibility would all work in the right   direction, but I could imagine at least some factors that could go the other way, in the sense that   every time the world seems to be going through a period of uncertainty and unsettledness—and a   pronounced external adjustment might be such a period—there’s a tendency to see capital flow   into the United States, not out of it  And that would counteract the desired adjustment     But I would just reiterate what Governor Gramlich said a minute ago    If all that happens is that we decide that we’re going to use monetary policy to limit US   domestic demand, that by itself is not going to be sufficient to produce a good result   "
5434,2004-11-10,"  Well, as I will repeat in just a minute, I’m afraid, emerging Asia actually   is faring comparatively less well than the other regions of the world at the moment on two scores    higher oil prices and a perception that at least for a time there’s a bit of a pause in the strength of the   high-tech sector  And these countries see themselves vulnerable to the fact that they import more   primary products than anybody else in some sense  Few of them have primary product resources   November 10, 2004 13 of 107    domestically  So the inflation consequences of developments over the last few months have   loomed larger for them than for others, and I think in that sense they are reassessing how   unfortunate an exchange rate appreciation would be for them  At the same time, their real   performance is impaired as well, so there’s sort of a juggling act involved, as with any negative   supply shock  But I think seeing that they are more vulnerable than most has altered a bit the   calculus of how important it is to stabilize the exchange rate vis-à-vis each other and vis-à-vis the   renminbi  And they probably are more vulnerable than China, if that’s the elephant in the room,   because China is a much larger and much more closed economy and it is domestically able to deal   with some of these issues better than the smaller satellite emerging Asian countries are  "
5435,2004-11-10,"  Over the intermeeting period, news about foreign economic  developments has generally been somewhat disappointing, and we have edged down  our outlook for real GDP growth abroad in response  The downward revision is  largest for the third quarter, 04 percentage point, as growth appears to have been  below our expectations in Japan, Europe, and emerging Asia other than China, where  we were surprised on the upside as we were also to a slight extent in Latin America   For the current quarter and the rest of the forecast period, we have taken an average  01 percentage point off the annual rate of foreign growth     A major factor behind our decision to shave a bit off prospective growth abroad   has been the intermeeting behavior of oil prices  Although the sharp run-up in spot  WTI prices attracted much attention, that price significantly retraced its gains in the  final two weeks of the period  However, the far futures price for WTI rose on balance  $5 per barrel over the period  Accordingly, the entire path of oil futures prices shifted  up  To some extent, the elevated WTI prices reflect the premium now being paid for  sweet (less sulfurous) crude oil relative to other grades of oil, and we anticipate that  this premium will narrow over time as the supply of sweet oil from the Gulf of  Mexico is fully restored, refiners shift their capacity, and demand adjusts  However,  consistent with the futures markets, we now project that oil prices will be higher for  longer than we thought in September, as continued production at current high rates  seems less certain and as demand remains strong     For the industrial countries, small negative revisions to the outlook were   widespread as elevated oil prices have eroded confidence to some extent and  weakened domestic demand  In Canada, an oil exporter, growth has remained strong  although we marked down the forecast a bit in response to changes in the US  forecast  For emerging-market economies in Asia, the prospect of sustained, elevated  oil prices has more negative consequences than is the case for Latin American  countries  The Asian emerging-market economies generally import oil and other  primary commodities  Higher global prices for these goods plus a somewhat dimmer  outlook for the high-tech sector have led us to become less optimistic about these  countries, on average  In contrast, activity so far in 2004 has been strong in Latin  America, as primary product exports and energy self-sufficiency—or better—have  boosted growth We nonetheless revised our outlook down slightly in 2005         We expect that foreign economic activity is rebounding in the current quarter   from the slowing that was evident in the preceding three months, particularly in  Japan, the United Kingdom, and emerging Asia  But we look for average growth  abroad to weaken a bit over the next two years  In part, this projection reflects the  need for some of the rapidly growing foreign economies, such as Canada and the  United Kingdom, to bring growth in line with potential  Monetary policy has already  been tightened in both these countries, and we expect additional moves in Canada  In  addition, we look for growth in China to moderate as officials there use both  administrative and interest rate tools to slow credit creation and the expansion of  investment spending, in particular      The subdued outlook for growth abroad also reflects the depreciation of the dollar   that occurred over the intermeeting period and the further depreciation that we have   November 10, 2004 19 of 107    again incorporated into the forecast  Since September, the exchange value of the  dollar has fallen sharply against many of the other major currencies  In response, we  have lowered the projected path for the real value of the broad index of the dollar  about 2 percent  Currency appreciation should be a factor restraining growth over the  forecast period in the other industrial countries     In our Greenbook baseline, the combined effect of higher oil prices, the lower   dollar, and revisions to output growth here and abroad is a slight easing in the  projected drag from real net exports in this quarter and during the next two years   This quarter and for the first half of 2005 we see the external sector as having a  largely neutral effect on GDP growth, as imports are restrained by moderate US  growth and exports bounce back  Thereafter, the negative arithmetic contribution of  net exports is about ½ percentage point, as relatively strong US growth boosts real  imports while dollar depreciation works to lessen the gap between real exports and  real imports  Nevertheless, the nominal US current account deficit is expected to  widen to nearly $890 billion in the fourth quarter of 2006, about 6¾ percent of GDP   This deficit reflects a higher oil import bill throughout the forecast period than  previously projected, with the overall trade deficit widening about $60 billion at an  annual rate from the current quarter to the end of 2006  In addition, the deficit on net  investment income is projected to widen by a comparable amount as rising US  interest rates and the growing stock of US portfolio liabilities combine to overwhelm  a modest increase in net receipts from direct investments here and abroad       This morning, we received data on trade in September  The trade deficit, at   $516 billion, was noticeably narrower than we and the market had anticipated   Contrary to our expectations for a rise, merchandise imports edged down, with most  of the surprise concentrated in core goods  In contrast, exports came in stronger than  expected, again with most of the miss in core goods  Of note, the surprising weakness  in exports in August was revised into a respectable gain  On balance, this morning=s  data indicate that real net exports made a negative contribution to US GDP growth  of 03 percentage point in the third quarter, considerably smaller than the minus  07 percentage point in the November Greenbook  This revision is pretty evenly split  between higher exports and lower imports  Although it is a bit early to draw  implications of these data for the current quarter, we remain fairly comfortable with  our Greenbook projection  Dave and I would be happy to answer any questions           I guess we’re learning as we go along the consequences of having global   demand push on resource limitations the way it has been  And we are making adjustments of a   tenth here and a tenth there  So, it’s not as if analytically my demand curves are well enough   defined that I can even tell the difference between moving along a curve versus the curve shifting at   this point  I think down deep that strong demand is the central factor in explaining why oil prices in   particular, but commodity prices more broadly, have been high  There is a self-limiting nature to   the price-adjustment process that occurs, but it’s hard to say that those higher prices are then a cause   for weaker growth  It is just a matter of both growth and prices being resolved in the marketplace   But I think that recent events, particularly the events in the past intermeeting period, have   conveyed an awareness that the supply conditions that this higher demand is confronting are a bit   less robust and a little less certain than people previously thought  In the energy case, this mix   between sweet and sour oil suddenly seemed more important  Whereas we often talked—I myself   did—about total production versus total consumption and questioned where the missing barrels   were and so forth, now we need to think about the possibility that the important issue may not be   just total production but the composition of production and the composition of refinery capacity    So it may be that the elements of demand in the different economies are going to determine how   this works out  We’ve learned, for example, that hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico have a much   greater potential to disrupt supplies than we understood to have been the case   So I think this extra   uncertainty and the somewhat greater volatility and risk on the supply side are leading me in an   expected-value sense to say that the outcome of these demand pressures and what I know about   supply may involve a little less growth than I had previously thought     I’m afraid you’ve caught me without an answer  I’m not sure what the   elements of that are     Sure  "
5490,2004-12-14,"  At this time of year, when persons old and young are looking   for tangible evidence of whether they have been naughty or nice during the past   December 14, 2004 13 of 118           twelve months, I cannot resist taking joy in pointing out that some force, perhaps  from the North Pole, has given the forecasters in the International Division the  opportunity to say something that we have been waiting to say for a long time “As  we forecast in the previous Greenbook, global oil prices have fallen on balance over  the intermeeting period”  [Laughter]  Indeed, they have fallen a bit more than we  forecast, with the result that our forecast path for US oil import prices has shifted  down about $3 per barrel in 2005 and $2 per barrel in 2006  One consequence of  recent developments is that the futures curve for WTI prices and our projected path  for the average price of imported oil are flatter than they have been in the past several  months, with only a relatively small further net change expected in oil prices from  now through the end of 2006  At the same time, uncertainty about future oil prices  seems to be quite high  The expected prices for WTI for the January contract and the  June contract for next year are both around $41  But the probability distribution  around the mean price for June is very wide, with the ⅔ probability interval ranging  from $32 per barrel to $50 per barrel     With the projected path for oil prices fairly flat, the implications of global oil   prices for growth and inflation abroad consist mainly of the future effects of oil price  developments that have already occurred  Despite their recent declines, oil prices  remain elevated from their levels one year ago  We judge that the slowing of activity  in several foreign economies in the third quarter is due at least in part to the net  increase in oil prices this year  The negative effects on output growth were relatively  greater for the Asian emerging-market economies, which tend to be more dependent  on imported oil than other regions, although these economies have also felt the  slowdown in the global high-tech sector  Over time, we expect the transitory  influence of the spike in oil prices to dissipate and average real GDP growth abroad  to return to an annual rate of about 3¼ percent  For the industrial countries and the  emerging-market economies, headline inflation will be up a bit in the near term and  then subsequently edge back down, reflecting the path of oil prices     During most of the intermeeting period, the dollar continued the downward trend   that had resumed in mid-September, with the index of major currencies reaching a  point early last week that was 12 percent below its May peak and a nine-year low   Market participants pointed to heightened concerns about the financing burden of the  widening US trade deficit as a major factor driving the dollar’s slide  At the time  that we were putting the finishing touches on the December baseline forecast, recent  exchange rate moves indicated that we should lower the path for the real value of the  broad index of the dollar about 3 percent  However, subsequently the dollar has  significantly reversed its intermeeting move in a sharp appreciation  No particular  data release or event seems to have triggered the climb of the dollar  Market  participants point to incentives for traders to take profits and to eliminate previously  established short dollar positions ahead of the year-end     Our baseline December forecast incorporates the lower path projected for the   dollar directly in US trade prices and volumes and, as a consequence, in the outlook  for domestic activity and inflation in a complex way  Of course, daily fluctuations in   December 14, 2004 14 of 118           the dollar cannot be anticipated and could easily put us back at the December  Greenbook starting level  However, had we not revised the path for the dollar and so  left it unchanged from that in the November Greenbook, our trade equations suggest  that the partial effect of this change alone would have been to increase the negative  contribution of net exports to US real GDP growth about 015 percentage point in  2005 and 01in 2006 relative to what is currently in the December Greenbook  With  such a higher path for the dollar, import price inflation in the baseline would have  been noticeably lower in the near term but little changed in 2006  By the fourth  quarter of 2006, the partial effect of a higher dollar path would be to widen the  projected current account deficit about $35 billion       In addition to the moves in oil prices and the exchange value of the dollar, the   other major feature of the international forecast at this time is that we have again  revised down projected foreign growth, particularly in the near term  As mentioned  earlier, to some degree this reflects the consequences of elevated oil prices  But it  also reflects more-fundamental shortfalls in macroeconomic performance in some  regions—for example the euro area, where we have lowered our forecast for real  GDP growth throughout the forecast period  Persistent weakness in domestic demand  in the euro area is a vulnerability that restrains global recovery and undercuts the  adjustment of US external deficits       Weak domestic spending in the euro area is associated primarily with Germany    One factor that is thought to be at least partly responsible is the extensive discussion  of and, at least some progress on, implementation of structural reforms in the  participating countries  For example, German pension reform appears to be creating  incentives for higher savings on the part of households, as the prospects of less- generous pensions or the uncertainty about how the reformed system will function  increase the perceived need for private assets  Given the very large unfunded public  liabilities associated with social insurance systems in Europe, successful reform and  higher personal savings would be helpful  However, for those savings to be realized  in higher capital stocks and improved German output growth, private investment  spending must also be stimulated  Such a response might require some reduction in  interest rates, led by easing on the part of the ECB, in order to maintain utilization of  macroeconomic resources during the implementation of reforms  Action on the part  of the ECB is made less likely, however, by the continued recording of headline  inflation above the target ceiling of 2 percent  Euro-area inflation is “stuck” at  2 percent in part because governments, particularly the German government, are  turning to increases in administered prices as they seek higher revenue to keep overall  budget deficits from rising even further  On balance, our outlook for the euro area  during the forecast period is slow growth, at about 1¾ percent, as the long-run  positive benefits of the structural reform efforts are either yet to arrive or are  overwhelmed by negative, short-run consequences     We have also revised down our projection for near-term growth in Japan    Recently released GDP data and current indicators paint a picture of real GDP  expansion in Japan that is not as strong as we and the markets had expected  Growth   December 14, 2004 15 of 118           should rebound from less than ½ percent at an annual rate in the second half of this  year to only about 1½ percent annual rate during 2005     This morning, trade data for October were released  The trade deficit came in at   $555 billion, up $45 billion from September and noticeably larger than both we and  the markets had anticipated  The increase in the deficit primarily reflected a surge in  merchandise imports; exports increased only modestly  These data will no doubt lead  us to revise down our projection for real net exports in the current quarter, although  we obviously have not had time to digest fully the implications for the outlook  A  rough, back-of-the-envelope calculation suggests that the contribution of real net  exports to US GDP growth could be revised down enough to bring the negative  contribution in the current quarter to around ½ percentage point  This number should  be taken with a grain of salt, however, as we are reluctant to rely too heavily on one  month’s worth of volatile data  That concludes our presentation  Dave and I will be  happy to answer your questions    "
5548,2005-03-22," One of the most important changes made to the forecast in this  Greenbook relative to that of January is the increase in the projected path for oil  prices That increase reflects developments in global oil markets over the  intermeeting period  Since late last week, spot WTI oil prices have been at new  highs, over $56 per barrel, a bit above the peak price reached last October But there  are some significant differences between market conditions then and current ones   Last October, the spike in rates was particularly sharp for the light, sweet crudes such  as WTI and was, in part, a transitory response to the impact of hurricane Ivan on  supply in the Gulf of Mexico This time the rise in prices is more general  The price  of Dubai, a heavier, more sour crude, has risen nearly $10 per barrel above its level  last October, resulting in a spread between the price for WTI and Dubai of about $9  per barrel rather than the $17 recorded last October 25 In addition, the far futures  price is now more than $49 per barrel, over $10 per barrel higher than in October,  suggesting that markets expect prices to be elevated for some time                                       March 22, 2005 14 of 116  No one factor explains the run-up in prices since late January, but a major reason  seems to be stronger demand in global markets—currently and prospectively, in the  eyes of market participants  This stronger demand is arising from a global economy  in which continued expansion at a reasonably robust pace seems likely, albeit with  some variation across regions  Also, there are currently some supply risks in the  usual trouble spots among oil-producing countries  But over the longer run, the issue  seems to be how projected increases in demand will be met by increased supply  Of  the 27 million barrels per day that global consumption increased during 2004, 30  percent, or 850,000 barrels per day, was accounted for by increased consumption in  China China is now the second-largest oil consumer on the globe; the United States  is first   The staff continues to rely on futures markets for our projection of the spot WTI  price After the first couple of months, the futures curve slopes down and is the basis  of our forecast that, by the end of 2006, that price will be somewhat below today=s  price However, we also need to forecast the US oil import price, and for us the  challenge is to project the spread going forward between WTI and the import price   That spread was quite variable last year, and in January of this year it jumped up  again, to over $9 per barrel We currently expect that the spread will narrow, on  balance, over the forecast period, with the result that the US price for imported oil  will decline only slightly from current levels—noticeably less than the decrease  embedded in the futures curve for WTI—by the end of next year  However, we could  be surprised, and the behavior of that spread is one of the risks to the forecast   The general increase in global oil prices has been cited by many as a reason for  rising inflation expectations and the move up in long-term interest rates across the  major industrial countries during the intermeeting period  Ten-year sovereign rates in  the major foreign industrial countries generally rose about 20 basis points since your  last meeting, somewhat less than the increase in the US rate  The smaller rebound in  rates abroad is consistent with the perception that recent economic indicators suggest  a more vigorous pace of expansion in the US economy than in the other industrial  economies  And foreign rates declined more sharply than did US rates from the end  of last June, when you began your current tightening cycle, to the turning point for  rates in early February   However, it may be that the stronger price performance of bonds denominated in  the major foreign currencies reflects some shift in portfolio preferences away from  dollar assets toward those denominated in the other major currencies  Such an  interpretation is consistent with the 1 percent net nominal depreciation of the foreign  exchange value of the dollar in terms of the other major currencies over the  intermeeting period and the fact that stock market indexes in the foreign industrial  countries generally outperformed US indexes over the same interval     Data for the US current account balance in the fourth quarter were released last  week and reported in the Greenbook supplement  At an annual rate, the deficit                                March 22, 2005 15 of 116  widened nearly $90 billion from the third-quarter figure, with about $60 billion of  that change accounted for by the increase in the trade deficit Of that $60 billion,  more than half represents the deterioration in the oil import bill  Relative to the  figures we put in the Greenbook, net investment income surprised us in the positive  direction That surprise was entirely in net direct investment receipts, as net portfolio  income came in about as expected, around $25 billion weaker than in the third  quarter Direct investment receipts were particularly strong, with the increase more  than offsetting a small positive surprise in direct investment payments  The fourth- quarter increment in the current account deficit was financed by somewhat larger  foreign official financial inflows and substantially larger foreign private net purchases  of US securities, particularly of agency bonds and corporate stocks The rise in  foreign inflows was sufficient to finance a small rise in US net private acquisitions  of foreign securities and an unusual but sizable increase from the third quarter of US  direct investment abroad   Looking forward, we expect the trade deficit to widen further both this year and  next With little change projected in the US oil import price, the oil import bill  should increase only slightly, and most of the deterioration in the trade balance is  expected to occur within the core goods categories—that is, goods less oil,  computers, and semiconductors  Accordingly, in real terms we are looking for net  exports to make a small negative contribution to GDP growth in each of the two  years We expect the widening of the nominal trade deficit to be nearly matched by  further reduction in the net investment income balance, as the negative change to net  portfolio income substantially outweighs projected gains in net direct investment  income  Accordingly, the current account deficit should widen to exceed $850  billion, or 6½ percent of GDP, by the end of next year   We also received February prices of internationally traded goods late last week   Prices for non-oil core imports increased a bit more than we were expecting   February price rises were concentrated in foods, feeds, and beverages and in non-oil  industrial supplies; but for January and February combined, all categories of non-oil,  core goods other than autos registered significant upward moves  These  developments leave us with a projection for inflation of the core import price deflator  in the first quarter of nearly 5 percent at an annual rate, higher than the January  Greenbook figure and higher than our equations by themselves would suggest  We  do not yet have sufficient evidence to conclude that the decline observed in past  exchange rate pass-through is being reversed With the effects of dollar depreciation  in the second half of last year and the recent run-up in commodity prices likely to be  felt through the end of this year, we expect core import price inflation to be about 2  percent at an annual rate during the rest of this year before slowing noticeably next  year, consistent with our outlook for flat commodity prices and only modest further  dollar depreciation   David and I will be happy to answer any questions                                         March 22, 2005 16 of 116   Well, the answer to your first question is that I don’t know the energy   demands of India  I don’t even think they are on my list  I have a table here listing oil   consumption by country, and I’m sure India is not on that list   But the fact that India is expanding mostly in its service-producing sector, rather than its   manufacturing sector, makes me think that that aspect of India’s growth is not driving energy   consumption particularly  But, as standards of living rise in India, presumably households and   the like will start consuming more   What I can say, though, is that we have recognized that India is suddenly getting to be   more important, and we have upped the staff coverage of India  We are going to put India more   explicitly into the forecast and will be covering that country in more detail    Well, I have not read it or thought about it in sufficient detail to truly   answer your question My sense is that, in part, it was a recognition of the inevitable That is, it   was a political solution to the fact that certain realities of life were confronting several European   countries So rather than continue with the political tension at meetings about who was going to                                      March 22, 2005 20 of 116  be penalized and allow the stresses between the larger countries and the smaller countries to   keep playing out in the media, they revised the agreement  They felt that if they changed the   language, they could accept what was going to happen in any event and reduce the damage it   might cause, because countries would be complying in some sense with the revised Stability and   Growth Pact rather than the old one   As for the actual details of the changes, they largely took the form of redefining what   goes into the measures against which targets are set and against which penalties are levied for   violating the targets To be honest, I don’t have the list complete in my head, but one change   had to do with German reunification  For example, certain expenditures get put in a different   category and are not part of the relevant measure of the budget deficit against which they are   supposed to meet the target    Other kinds of restructuring expenditures were included  So there was   an effort made to—    Yes, the pension reform    In addition to sort of recognizing the inevitable, such as the German   reunification piece, many of the other categories that were accorded new status I would describe   as things that everybody agreed should be done They agreed that it would be regrettable if, in   the name of the Stability and Growth Pact, political pressure were exerted to cut back on                             March 22, 2005 21 of 116  restructuring so as to meet the goal  Now, we all know the Stability and Growth Pact was   intended to tell these countries that they should cut other things so they could achieve the target,   but that wasn’t happening   The ECB [European Central Bank] made a guarded statement about remaining   concerned The markets didn’t seem to react negatively  Down deep the problem, in my mind,   is that the way the Stability and Growth Pact was originally structured—and possibly even the   way it is still structured—was appropriate for countries that had already re-centered their fiscal   activity more or less at a zero balance  The various ways that the limits were stated and the   symmetry, and so forth, all assumed each country started from a good place  And then it made   perfect sense Actually, if that had been the case, one would be indifferent to whether it should   be the structurally adjusted balance or the actual balance; that is irrelevant if you’re starting at   zero   Some of the big countries never got there, and that has been the part of the story that has   produced tension ever since 1999, really These reforms didn’t undo that  They didn’t say We   wrote a pact centered on zero and that isn’t working, so we’re going to scrap that and start all   over But they did make these exceptions, which are going to ease the pressures on some of the   big countries So, those countries will not be forced, in a macroeconomic sense, to tighten when   it’s not such a good idea; nor will pressure be put on them not to do some structural things that   they should be doing, because those specifically are the things that have been exempted    No                                         March 22, 2005 22 of 116   Right But by setting aside a class of expenditures that are going to   happen, they have allowed the band, as defined, to embrace the countries  So the fact that they   didn’t change the cyclical thing doesn’t matter so much anymore    That’s correct    Yes But it seems to me what is flawed is not so much the Stability and   Growth Pact as the Lisbon Agenda Despite the rhetoric, the major countries in Europe have not   taken steps to deregulate themselves, to become more efficient and more dynamic, and to do all   the things that they pledged to do in Lisbon Had they done those things, the old Stability and   Growth Pact would have probably been just fine   It’s not obvious to me that the changes they agreed to just recently are going to move us   very far in the direction of the Lisbon Agenda But these changes will at least eliminate the                                                  March 22, 2005 23 of 116  uncertainty that has been out there in the market about whether these countries will actually be   contracting fiscal policy at a time when unemployment is rising, and that kind of thing    Yes And, at some level, Schroeder’s initiatives have been appropriate   and the right thing to do But certainly there’s not a broad consensus among the European   population to go in that direction  "
5597,2005-05-03," The staff forecast for average real GDP growth abroad over the  forecast period has changed little from that in the March Greenbook despite swings  in global oil prices, nonfuel primary commodity prices, and exchange rates, plus a  significant near-term revision to the outlook for US growth  However, the only  minor revisions to our projection for average foreign growth mask significant  differences across countries and regions—differences that reflect the varying  influences of recent developments     In order to explore further these differences, I will highlight those developments  over the intermeeting period that were unexpected and offer our thoughts on their  implications for the outlook abroad and our forecast of the US external sector   Despite continued expansion of global activity, long-term sovereign interest rates in  the major foreign industrial countries have dropped significantly on balance since  the previous FOMC meeting  For example, the German 10-year rate moved down  from about 37 percent at the time of the March meeting to reach an all-time low of  338 percent on April 29 and has remained near that low so far this week  Rates in  Canada and the United Kingdom fell almost as much, and even Japanese rates  decreased nearly 20 basis points Although by themselves lower interest rates might  be expected to raise equity prices, the major stock price indexes abroad have fallen  over the period from 2 to 7 percent   These asset market developments reflect participants’ reactions to the most  recent data, which suggest that the foreign industrial countries have encountered  some additional headwinds that are impeding growth during the current quarter and  likely will do so over the remainder of 2005  Accordingly, we have shaded down  our near-term projections for the major foreign industrial countries  Although we  cannot be certain, we judge that elevated oil prices are taking a greater toll on these  economies than we anticipated earlier  Less favorable news for the US outlook is a  factor as well Both these developments are likely influencing confidence abroad                                              May 3, 2005 14 of 116  Euro-area economic sentiment fell in April to its lowest level in a year and a half   The Tankan survey in Japan dropped noticeably in the first quarter   In contrast, recent developments in the emerging-market economies, although  mixed, are positive on balance, and we have revised up slightly our outlook for  average growth there for this year This outcome reflects the fact that several of the  emerging-market economies export oil and/or other primary commodities whose  prices have remained high  It also reflects the unexpectedly strong first-quarter  growth that was recorded in China We now calculate that China=s GDP grew at a  14 percent annual rate last quarter, almost double our projection in March  Although  we expect some moderation in Chinese output growth over the remainder of this  year, its robust pace should support somewhat stronger expansion in the region than  we previously projected   Exchange market developments also contained some surprises  The dollar  appreciated broadly over the intermeeting period, particularly in terms of the  Canadian dollar and the euro Domestic political tensions appear to be weighing on  the Canadian dollar Although we continue to build into the Greenbook baseline  slight real dollar depreciation, the higher starting point for the current quarter leaves  us with a forecast path for the dollar that is above that in March throughout the  forecast horizon, a change that boosts imports and restrains exports   Particular focus on the Chinese exchange rate regime and the timing of any  modification to that regime emerged at the time of the G-7 meeting in mid-April and  again last week when market participants reacted quickly to a short-lived anomaly in  the renminbi/dollar rate  Since your March meeting, the amount of appreciation  priced into NDF [non-deliverable forward] contracts for Chinese renminbi has risen  at 1-month, 3-month, and 12-month horizons  US Treasury officials have made  public statements calling for Chinese officials to act soon, and the US Congress has  raised the possibility of action on its part if the Chinese do not move  The  heightened public debate appears to have raised the sensitivity of markets to any  indication that something might be happening  In the absence of any reliable  information on when and in what way the Chinese might alter the present regime, we  have not incorporated any such change into the forecast The extent to which other  Asian currencies will move against the dollar when the Chinese do act remains an  additional major uncertainty   Trade data for February were another major surprise for us during the  intermeeting period  Those data showed a second consecutive month of sizable  increases in imports  Part of this increase is accounted for by a jump in the value of  oil imports, but non-oil imports, particularly industrial supplies and consumer goods,  expanded rapidly as well First-quarter national income data reflected the strength  of nominal imports in January and February in double-digit growth of real imports of  goods and services We now estimate that real imports rose at an annual rate of  more than 13 percent in the first quarter, an upward revision of more than 4                                                   May 3, 2005 15 of 116  percentage points from the figure in the March Greenbook  We estimate that real   growth of core imports, non-oil imports other than computers and semiconductors,   was about 18 percent—far faster than historical relationships with US activity and   relative prices would suggest No component among real imports stands out, leaving   us with no special factors that would explain the rapid growth  This quarter, we   look for the pace of core import growth to moderate substantially to one more   consistent with historical determinants, particularly given the downward revision of   projected US real GDP growth to about 3½ percent In addition, on a seasonally   adjusted basis the volume of oil imports is projected to contract sharply    Accordingly, imports of goods and services are projected to grow only 1¼ percent   this quarter and then to expand at annual rates of 6 to 7 percent over the forecast   period    Putting these pieces together leaves us with a first-quarter negative arithmetic   contribution to US real GDP growth from net exports of about 1¼ percentage   points, about the same as in the fourth quarter  With import growth forecast to drop   sharply, the projected contribution swings positive for the current quarter  In the   second half of this year and during 2006, the contribution is small but negative      The near-term fluctuations in imports should be evident in the nominal trade   balance as well By the second half of this year and during 2006, we expect the   trade deficit to widen further Net investment income is also projected to deteriorate   Given current position figures, we see that balance as finally turning negative next   year Together these forecasts imply a current account deficit of more than $900   billion in the fourth quarter of 2006    Dave and I will be happy to answer any questions    Well, we have numbers written down for the pieces, but not ones that I   think are ready for exposure                                    May 3, 2005 16 of 116   A very big chunk of the Q2 story is oil and relates to the seasonal   adjustment procedure that is now in place for describing real oil, which we question  We think that   may not translate into real-time evidence of this sort, because it is, in some sense, a statistical   treatment of the data as opposed to an actual real-world event  Other than that, consumer goods   have been a big piece of the surprise in imports, so I don’t think they would immediately have   implications for US industrial production  There is nothing specific I can point to, and I admit—in   fact, it’s one of the reasons I highlighted this—that a change from double-digit growth to 1+ percent   growth this quarter is a huge drop But that is our best estimate    The people who construct these numbers write down notional placeholders   for the different components for the very, very near term, but I don’t think they would regard them   as grounded in a lot of information  They do that to see if the number they write down for the longer   term is a sensible number    We collect import prices at the border, so to speak  So I can’t speak to the   question of this showing through to retail prices David might want to comment on that; I don’t   know   Import price inflation has been surprising us a bit on the upside, and we have attributed part   of that to higher global commodities prices  It shows up in our case in the industrial supplies types   of categories, but we’ve seen some in the manufacturing area as well  When we break out the actual   data for how import prices have moved, we’re getting contributions from both those pieces into   import price inflation  So, relative to the last Greenbook, we have extended the period of elevated   import price increases into the second quarter and a little into the third quarter because the global   indexes of commodity prices—based on futures at this point for those periods—show the prices not   rising further but remaining high, and we think it will take some time for that to be fully reflected in   our import prices  But one factor that seemed to cause the timing to be off a little bit in our forecast                                       May 3, 2005 25 of 116  last year was that commodity prices tended to be showing up more rapidly in US import prices than   our models would suggest is the historical average  We have that as a second term, in addition to   foreign prices and the exchange rate and so forth   So embedded in our story is that import prices were high in the first quarter and will   decelerate somewhat in the second and third quarters, but not hugely and not as much as we had   thought before It involves a somewhat more extensive pass-through of high global commodity   prices into import prices, and a little bit is probably still the effect of dollar depreciation at the end of   2004 Those things, in essence, go away thereafter, and we have import price inflation dropping   down very much—to less than 1 percent in 2006  That is conditioned on two assumptions the   assumption we have been making routinely for the dollar of late—because we don’t know a better   one to make—which is that it will change only little going forward; and the futures path for   commodity prices  So the projection that import prices will decelerate in stepwise fashion through   the second half of this year and into 2006 is very much a reflection of these two conditioning   assumptions  And we don’t have a whole lot of information other than that  "
5641,2005-08-09," The staff outlook for real GDP growth abroad is little  changed this time from that in the June Greenbook  Economic expansion in our  foreign trading partners has rebounded from its subdued first-quarter pace, and  we expect that it will firm somewhat more later this year and next   Nevertheless, three elements of our baseline outlook this time are  sufficiently changed from the previous forecast that they warrant attention  today first is the very sizable, positive change that recent data have implied to  the contribution to US real GDP growth from the external sector; second, the  long-awaited announcement by Chinese officials of a change in their exchange  rate regime; and third, yet another discrete upward revision in our projection for  global oil prices   We now estimate that net exports made an arithmetic positive contribution  of 14 percentage points to real growth in the second quarter, a figure slightly  less than that reported by the BEA in the advance real GDP data for the quarter   With June nominal trade data yet to be released, both the BEA and we must  guesstimate that number in constructing a second-quarter figure for real GDP   Our estimate of the contribution is now significantly larger than the 055  percentage point that we had incorporated into the June forecast  The nominal  trade data for May surprised us with stronger exports and a bit weaker imports  than we had anticipated These data account for 05 percentage point of the  revision The remainder of the revision to the contribution owes to a markdown  of imports in line with the advance NIPA data, which contained a different  translation gap between the balance of payments data and the national income  data than that for Q1, which in turn had been the basis of our projection     The overall revision to second-quarter imports is somewhat greater than that  to exports We now estimate that real imports of goods and services actually  declined in the second quarter whereas real exports grew at over a 12 percent  annual rate; very strong nominal exports in April were followed by even slightly  larger exports in May   Over the forecast period, we expect that real imports will resume growing,  at an annual rate of about 6 percent  Positive but slowing impetus from US  output expansion largely explains the growth of imports, with relative prices  switching from being a small drag to providing a slight boost to core imports   We project that real export growth will step down in the second half of this year  and a bit more next year, to rates more in line with stimulus from output growth  abroad and diminishing impetus from dollar depreciation over the past three  years All in all, the contribution from the external sector reverts to negative                                 August 9, 2005 18 of 110  this quarter in our baseline forecast and is about minus 04 percentage point  over the next year   The July 21 announcement by Chinese officials of a change in their  exchange rate regime ended speculation about when such a move would come  but left many other questions unanswered  Following the initial 21 percent  revaluation of the renminbi in terms of the dollar, the exchange value of the  Chinese currency has fluctuated very narrowly  Essentially no information has  yet been provided about the composition of the Areference@ basket of currencies  that is now part of the regime  Scope has now apparently emerged for future  moves in the exchange rate in terms of the dollar, but some official statements  have emphasized that such further change will be gradual   To construct our forecast of activity abroad, we needed to make a specific  assumption about the Chinese exchange rate regime going forward  Holding the  renminbi pegged at its current dollar exchange rate seemed to give too little  recognition to the major step we thought was implied by the announcement   But we saw as arbitrary any specific projection we might make of further  bilateral appreciation of the renminbi against the dollar  Accordingly, we chose  to harmonize our treatment of the renminbi and most other currencies  For the  purposes of the forecast, we have projected that the renminbi will appreciate  slightly in nominal terms—at a rate comparable to that we project for the euro,  the yen, the Canadian dollar—and have made small adjustments to other Asian  emerging market currencies as well    This trend nods in the direction of the downward pressure that we judge will  at some point be visible on the dollar as a result of the financing burden of our  growing external indebtedness We realize that when it occurs this pressure is  not likely to be evenly distributed across all bilateral dollar exchange rates with  other currencies  Nor is it likely to occur smoothly and gradually over time   However, we do expect that the real index of the dollar in terms of all our  important trading partners is likely to move down on balance over a reasonably  long horizon because of global imbalances  Adding the renminbi into that mix  has resulted in a slightly more rapid rate of real dollar depreciation than we had  previously been incorporating into the staff forecast    The spot price of West Texas intermediate (WTI) crude oil moved up over  the intermeeting period to exceed $61 per barrel on August 4 as the Greenbook  was completed and has risen further in the days since then  The prices of oil  futures contracts with more distant expirations have surged as well  This most  recent run-up in spot WTI prices has been accompanied by a widening in the  spread between that price and the prices of heavier, more sour, crudes  This  WTI premium is expected to unwind, but not immediately, resulting in a  forecast for the US oil import price that is little changed on average over the  second half of this year but is more than $3 higher in 2006 than we had  projected in the June Greenbook                                            August 9, 2005 19 of 110  Various factors appear to have contributed over the past six weeks to the  upward pressure on oil prices; most of them relate to risks to the available  supply reaching the market  Destruction by fire of a large oil platform owned  by India was particularly important because it provided light, sweet crude  The  death of Saudi Arabian King Fahd appears to have raised political risks in the  world=s largest oil exporter, even though the new king, Abdullah, had been  managing most of the kingdom=s business during the 10-year illness of the late  king Warnings of an unusually active hurricane season have raised concerns  about a possible repeat of the kind of supply interruptions experienced last year   Other issues of regular maintenance or delays in completing new sources of  supply have arisen as well   These various events all occurred against a background of perceived strong  world demand and little spare capacity  Possible political risks are seen as  creating uncertainty with respect to supply from Iraq, Iran, Venezuela, Russia  and other global trouble spots In the event of any serious disruption in such a  trouble spot, there is little scope for other sources of supply to fill the resulting  excess demand  As a result, market participants see little likelihood that prices  will decline in the future The far-dated contract for delivery in December 2011  is up to $59 per barrel   To date, the global economy has absorbed the rise in prices with few signs  that overall economic activity will ease off in response  Higher oil prices have  boosted consumer price inflation in some regions  However, inflation  expectations appear to remain well anchored, and our baseline forecast calls for  CPI inflation abroad to recede a bit next year  This projection depends  importantly on oil prices remaining elevated but flattening out early next year,  as anticipated in the futures curve Renewed upward pressure on global oil  prices remains a risk to the forecast, however, as higher oil prices for consumers  tend to erode domestic demand in importing countries and regions, and oil  exporters take some time before increasing their expenditures    David and I will be happy to answer any questions    With respect to the trend, over the Greenbook forecast horizon, the   dollar is now, on average, depreciating in real terms about 1½ percent, and in previous   Greenbooks the comparable figure would have been about 1¼ percent  So we’ve deliberately                               August 9, 2005 22 of 110  constructed it so that the 1¼ percent embedded the notion that a block of Asian currencies was   pegged to the dollar If we’re going to undo that assumption, it should show through  So it’s by   construction, basically; this is just our attempt to signal this and let the rate of depreciation rise to   1½ percent   I have to say that when we do Greenbook extensions that find their way into background   uses in the Bluebooks and so forth, that rate of depreciation so allows the external imbalance to   explode that we actually have to up it So, any time we do anything that runs longer than the   Greenbook horizon, we put in a number like minus 4, because otherwise the external sector   behaves in such a dominant way that the simulations don’t seem useful  But for the Greenbook   horizon, that period is so short that in all honesty the real dollar could go up and not down at all    So we now have that minus 1½ percent in place as a sort of marker  "
5686,2005-09-20," Thank you, Mr Chairman Spot prices for crude oil were   especially volatile over the intermeeting period, as uncertainty about the   consequences of possible hurricane damage, along with other risks, drove up prices   before Katrina hit the Gulf shore and as evolving expectations of the near- and   medium-term implications of the storm damage induced fluctuations in the weeks   following Katrina In the last few days, concerns about Tropical Storm Rita have   been added to the mix  As has been our practice, we again relied on the futures   markets to sort through the uncertainties about crude oil supply and demand over the   forecast period, and our projection of WTI [West Texas intermediate] prices through   the end of 2007 is drawn from the futures curve as of September 12    The complexities of Katrina=s effect on energy prices are such, however, that   specifying the WTI price still left unanswered a number of questions about related   prices and quantities, both for the global outlook and for the US economy  With   normal US refining capacity only accounting for roughly 80 percent of US   demand, and with four refineries in the region still closed, we have projected a partial   substitution of refined products for crude in US oil imports in the near term  In   addition, with global refinery operations already about at capacity, at least in terms of   refineries capable of producing products that meet US specifications, there is no   scope for US demand to draw upon global supply without having an impact on   price As a consequence, prices for refined products abroad, particularly for gasoline,   have risen We have assumed that all of the refineries will be operational by the   beginning of 2006                          September 20, 2005 10 of 117  US crude oil production in the Gulf remains at about 50 percent of the level  before Hurricane Katrina, with some of this reduction offset by release from the  Strategic Petroleum Reserve  We expect that repairs to the damaged facilities will  occur over time and have incorporated into the forecast a gradual recovery that is  completed early next year  Consequently, we have bumped up our projection for  crude oil imports in the first quarter to account for the transitory shortfall  The net  effect of these developments is that we have raised our projected price for spot WTI  oil by $140 per barrel in the fourth quarter of this year and by $180 per barrel next  year However, in the near term we have raised our projection for the US oil import  price by more, $260 per barrel in the fourth quarter and just below $2 per barrel in  the following quarter, to reflect the change in mix toward imports of refined product  and the rise in product prices as well as crude prices  The net result is a forecast for  the oil import bill that is notably higher in the near term, but is less so by the end of  next year   Other elements of the external forecast that were affected by Hurricane Katrina  include the shipments of non-oil goods into and out of the United States through the  region=s port facilities The immediate percentage impact on exports is judged to be a  bit larger than that on non-oil imports, as imports have greater flexibility to be  diverted to other ports The port facilities are reopening quickly, and these effects,  particularly on a net basis, should be small  In addition, the current account balance  will be positively changed by receipts by US insurance firms of payments owing to  reinsurance abroad and, to a lesser extent, by aid contributions from other countries to  the US economy  These items will appear as transfer receipts in the nontrade  portion of the current account On balance, this range of impacts from Katrina is  expected to be transitory and of limited magnitude     The outlook for foreign growth and inflation is, of course, also influenced by the  change in our forecast for global energy prices and by the changes projected for the  US economy In the near term, these two factors work in the same direction to  lessen foreign growth Over a longer horizon, with US growth projected to rebound  next year, they are partly offsetting  Upward pressure on inflation from energy prices  is a growing concern of central banks and officials abroad  The event of Hurricane  Katrina reinforced the trend toward elevated oil prices that has been unfolding over  the past few years In some foreign countries, particularly emerging-market  economies, officials have controlled domestic energy prices to blunt the effects of  higher global prices As elevated oil prices have continued, foreign officials have  started to remove or lessen these subsidies, with consequent effects on inflation  pressures  David will continue our presentation    Yes They have been around the longest in the United Kingdom and in   the early years indexed securities were very clearly held in response to the tax incentives  So   there was a certain disconnect; there wasn’t a notion that people who viewed those expectations   as differing from their own would trade and the market would settle into reflecting their   expectations on the margin     I’m not aware that people generally view that as a solid predictor, but I would say that we   probably should look into that more  We haven’t done our own independent work on that     Not by us    Yes, a 17-year high I volunteer to run the gold price  [Laughter]     Right    I have not looked at that enough in the last few days to give you an   answer to your question There have been, obviously, over the past year or more, periods of time   in which the nature of trading in the energy futures market seemed to be evolving  Indeed,   energy futures came to be thought of as an asset class for which hedge funds and investment   banks would open up departments and would trade aggressively  It was a profit center, so why   not?  I don’t know that that has ended   But some of the other instances about which people were most concerned died down and   I think the number of contracts that were thought to be noncommercial would ebb and flow as   time went by  The fact that the price came back down helped because there was a time when it   looked somewhat like the Japanese stock market in the late 1980s  It was just about a sure bet   that if you could buy some of the stuff, you would make money  And that went away as the   price developed some two-way fluctuations and so forth   But to be honest, I don’t have the information to give you about whether post-Katrina we   have seen a real change It was certainly startling how quickly the price moved yesterday when   it became clear that Rita was going to cross into the Gulf  That volatility may reflect more   traders of different backgrounds acting more quickly  I wouldn’t interpret that as indicating that                September 20, 2005 26 of 117  somehow those movements are superficial  I think there is a genuine increase in the extent to   which people believe the global supply of energy is vulnerable to random events and has very   little buffer capacity in it Those things, I think, are real   Whether on a given piece of news the trading is mostly done by hedge funds or is mostly   done by people who have a genuine need to hedge in the commercial sense, I don’t think we   know But there is a change in tone People feel that the supply capability both at the refinery   level and at the extraction level is not there to meet the projected demand and that we’re going to   be on a bit of a knife’s edge And they believe that developments on the political side in Russia   or in Venezuela could easily tip the balance  I think that is for real     Well, I can’t speculate on how the domestic politics of this would play   out in some of those countries  The IEA [International Energy Agency] authorized the sale of 60             September 20, 2005 29 of 117  million barrels from the strategic reserves of its members—30 million from us and 30 million   from the others  Most of what we were going to release from the strategic petroleum reserve was   crude; that’s all we store  And in the bidding that took place for that oil, as of two or three days   ago, 11 was the number of bids that were accepted, not 30  So there’s some question in the   minds of our staff experts on this about whether that means a second round and a third round will   be done to eventually work up to the 30 million  Or is the thinking that maybe they don’t need to   do all 30 million?  Of the 30 million that is to be done from non-US stocks, much of that will be   product rather than crude oil, and much of it will simply be sold into the market  The global   market for gasoline just needs more supply  It’s not a question of their targeting it necessarily   toward us   So, I think what we’re seeing is that they have the oil and they have the product  They   could do more than what they’ve done, but what they’ve done so far has not stabilized the price    And there is political resistance in Europe  Now, I think that’s a bit naive in a sense  If they   don’t release more, presumably the price would go even higher, right?  The market is never   going to be fragmented, and they’re always going to feel the effect of our attempt to buy more   gasoline  But there’s the interplay of domestic use versus selling it into the market and there’s   pressure, particularly in Europe, regarding their gasoline taxes And this is where I think the   essence of the fight is being waged right now  Most people who are arguing about the long-run   interests of rational energy policy in the EU [European Union] Commission and anybody who is   a bit above the politics is saying, “Whatever you do, don’t cut the gasoline taxes”  But some of   the actual governments who face the electorate a bit more directly have caved already  Others of   them are going to postpone planned increases  Some of them are wavering                   September 20, 2005 30 of 117  If they go the route of trying to protect their domestic populations by temporarily   lowering taxes and so forth, my guess is that they won’t be putting the gasoline into a   distribution that would appear to be bailing out the Americans at the expense of the French   farmer  That isn’t going to happen  They will try to protect their stocks and they will try to   segment the market  So I wouldn’t count on that as a big source of transitory relief on price   pressure—more than we have already seen—because I think the politics of it is getting very   complicated    Well, regrettably it’s not David’s problem  It’s mine  [Laughter]    Let me take it in two halves  I’ll talk a little about global energy use,   and then we’ll come to the import price part   We model energy demand, energy consumption, energy production, and the implied   change in inventories on a global basis And we do it using all of the information we can muster    But it is understood by the people in that world that there is a lack of good information  There   has been an outcry for more transparency about energy production and energy capacity than now   exists Some of the volatility that President Fisher was speaking to derives from the fact that   when the IEA makes an announcement of a change in their estimate of what demand was last   year it will move the market So, the quality of the information that is available for the global   market is certainly far from ideal  And some of the countries involved, of course, are in rather   troubled political areas where being transparent about anything is not in their interest, so they   don’t provide data So that adds to the complexity     But we have an oil model and we use a lot of judgment—the add factors that David was   talking about—and we attempt to account for total oil production in essence by country  It’s not   that we think any individual number in that mix is going to be right in any sense, but we try to be   consistent through the story So we start with the futures curve for WTI, and we make some   judgments about the spreads on things like Dubai and other oils that loom large in the global   market, and we use the model to infer what the balance of supply and demand would have to be    And given that we have relied on the futures markets—basically for want of a view that we could   do better than the futures market—supply becomes the residual  So we have forecasts of global   demand of GDP  And we have different weights that apply to those that are the oil-using   weights as opposed to the trade weights or the GDP weights that we might use other places             September 20, 2005 32 of 117  Now, part of your question was how often we change those weights and how sensitive we   are to the shifts in production that are taking place in the world  I can’t speak to that specifically,   but in general we revise our weights every year  It’s not as if we have weights from 1970 and we   just keep cranking away using those weights We’ve gone to this variable weight approach as in   the GDP and everything else So, we specifically do at least attempt to take account of how   different countries use energy versus how other things happen  We have a set of energy-using   weights that we apply to world GDP, and that gives us, in essence, a different aggregate for   world growth than if we were doing it for some other purpose, which we do   So we’ve got a price and we’ve got demand, and we back out supply; supply becomes the   residual For example, two years ago when prices seemed to us to be rather high, we were   inferring a need for supply to pull back in order to sustain those prices  And OPEC has played   that role—Saudi Arabia, in particular  Go back and read Greenbooks from two to three years   ago, and we had a story about expecting supply to contract in certain places in order for futures   curve prices to be realized, as oil suppliers target prices, and so forth   That has not been so true lately Indeed, we’ve been tapping capacity increasingly over   the last two years And the notion that global supply was more than enough to explain the prices   we were seeing has flipped to become a question of where we are going to get the extra supply   For a time Russia and the FSU [Former Soviet Union] were a big source of extra non-OPEC   supply That seems to have changed more recently  So, there is a supply story that tries to take   these things into account that matches demand and the futures curve to give a crude oil picture    And it has to account for enough barrels to make that true  If we were to run into a real                September 20, 2005 33 of 117  contradiction there, we would have to go back and say something to ourselves about our   assessment of demand   We take that picture, and for the United States—particularly this time more so than   most—we have to ask questions about domestic capacity to supply the residual part  Would that   have to be imported?  And what would be the mix of those imports?  So we try to make all of   that fit  That leaves us then with an oil import price which can move differently than global   crude prices because of the mix factor  And the oil import price is what feeds into the domestic   economy and then drives the elements of pass-through and domestic production and so forth   Now, in our forecast of import prices the oil price portion is distinct from the non-oil   portion, and it is non-oil import prices that in the projection come down  Those prices have been   kicked around hugely by natural gas and by non-oil primary commodities  We have now   internally, but we don’t put it in the Greenbook, import prices less natural gas as a check on   whether we are fully incorporating what we think is happening to natural gas  But we don’t have   a comparable setup for the supply and demand balance of natural gas that we have for oil, and   the natural gas that would be relevant, obviously, is for North America as an almost isolated   market  There is liquefied natural gas on the margin  There are some imports on the margin    But we are thinking that we might have to do something about the quantity of natural gas   because it’s a hidden uncertainty in the overall non-oil import price, and it’s uncomfortable that   we haven’t been able to have a better control over that   Even so, the non-oil, non-energy primary commodities have been the big story in import   prices; they caused the import prices to move up  And the fact that those futures markets are   telling us that those prices have peaked or are even coming down is what lies behind our forecast                    September 20, 2005 34 of 117  that import prices are decelerating yet again—and to very low levels in 2006 and into 2007  That   outlook is really a combination of what we think the non-energy futures markets are telling us   about commodity prices and the maintained assumption we make about the dollar  Either of   those things could change, and the forecast is completely conditional on them, with the added   wrinkle of this role of natural gas that is embedded in non-oil import prices, but which probably   should be separated out Now, at least in terms of the work we do, we try to do that partially but   maybe we should do it more explicitly  "
5730,2005-11-01," I would say that has been the case since moving out of the recession—since   early 2003 or something like that  We benchmark this correlation from time to time  I don’t know   that we’ve done it quite as a rolling correlation but we easily could, and we will    It is It’s also, though, indicative of the nature of the shocks that are   perceived by market participants  So, to the extent those are idiosyncratic to individual countries, it   tends to cause the correlation to fall apart  To the extent they are perceived to be global, those rates   move together                                                      November 1, 2005 8 of 114  On top of that is the issue of whether or not portfolio holders are holding a sufficiently diverse   portfolio that any adjustment they might make in response to a shock is going to be spread across   markets, because they’re going to rebalance and they’re going to achieve the new risk-return mix   that they’re looking for  And there’s some of that going on  That’s, I think, what you mean by the   term globalization—that portfolio holders, by the way they adjust their portfolios, do some of this    But it’s certainly true that this comes and goes a bit, and we can look to see how the correlation   coefficient has developed    Well, I think these securities were targeted to international investors more  I   find it a little puzzling why it works this way, but it was not the case that these were sold into the   domestic market and happened to be bought by international folk and, therefore, isn’t that a good   sign These were really targeted for foreign investors, denominated in the domestic currencies, so as   to give them the Brazilian interest rate and the Colombian interest rate  It is thought that people   who are searching for yield would want to add these sorts of securities to their portfolios, and they   did    No You are basically taking on country risk and exchange rate risk when   you buy these issues    I’m not sure either  In Colombia’s case, given that there is to a certain   extent a dollar component of their economy—  "
5731,2005-11-01," The staff forecast for real GDP growth and inflation abroad  is little changed this time from the forecast in the September Greenbook  This is  the case despite additional hurricanes, volatile energy prices, and a notable rise in  long-term interest rates in several foreign industrial countries during the  intermeeting period  The futures path for WTI [West Texas intermediate] crude  oil prices retraced somewhat in October  Accordingly, we have incorporated into  this forecast global oil prices through 2007 that are about $2 per barrel lower than  in the previous forecast  Nevertheless, the outlook for global crude oil prices  remains elevated at about $60 per barrel for WTI and is more than $8 above the  level six months ago   Clearly, factors related to crude oil supply have contributed at times to upward  pressure on global crude oil prices In addition to disruptions as a result of the  hurricanes, there are market concerns about the change in leadership in Saudi  Arabia, politics in Iran, Venezuela, and Russia, and reduced production as a result  of violence in Iraq However, the trend increase since 2003 in not only spot  prices but also in far futures prices occurred despite expansion of global oil  production, evidence that underlying global demand for crude oil is also  importantly responsible for the price pressures  This persistent, strong,  underlying demand for energy reflects fundamental robustness in global economic  activity—perhaps more than has been generally recognized  As a consequence,  we have observed during this year further moves up in energy prices and in prices  for nonfuel primary commodities along with average real growth abroad that has  remained moderately strong, although a bit below the rapid pace of 2004   As in September, we are calling for real GDP abroad on average to expand at  about 3 percent in the current quarter, following growth at that pace in the third  quarter, and to accelerate a bit in 2006 and 2007  This favorable picture  incorporates a return to steady expansion in Japan and solid, albeit slightly  moderating, growth in the emerging Asian region  In addition, real growth in  Mexico should recover from a disappointing outcome during the first half of this  year   Our judgment that the pace of foreign economic activity remains firm is  reflected in a range of positive indicators in Canada, including employment,  industrial production, monthly GDP, a rebound in manufacturing orders in  August, and a high pace of housing starts Japan=s Tankan business conditions  index moved up again in September, with projections of capital spending this year  and forecasts of sales and profits all revised up  Indicators for the euro area are                                  November 1, 2005 18 of 114  mixed, but in Germany industrial orders have come in strong and the October Ifo  measure of business climate jumped to a five-year peak  Among the emerging- market economies, Chinese industrial production accelerated through September,  and retail sales growth remained above 12 percent  Korean real GDP growth rose  to 75 percent in the third quarter, and Brazil continues to enjoy very strong export  sales   The mix of sustained global growth and upward shifts in commodity prices,  particularly crude oil prices, naturally heightens concerns about higher consumer  price inflation Headline inflation rates abroad have moved up significantly with  the rise in crude oil prices Our outlook, however, is for these prices to decelerate  over the forecast period given our projection (and that of the futures markets) that  crude oil prices will be about flat next year and edge down in 2007 and given that  the effects of previous increases in crude prices on inflation will wane and then  end Such an outcome depends upon an absence of significant second-round  effects of oil prices on domestic prices and wages abroad  To date, core inflation  in the major foreign countries confirms this is the case   The combination of continued growth and contained inflation pressures  sounds optimistic  Rest assured, we have found numerous risks about which to  worry The elevated energy prices could sap consumer demand more than we  expect, undermining the pace of real growth  In the face of higher costs, business  spending on new capital could falter, particularly in emerging Asia where few  countries have petroleum production sectors  Wage demands could react to the  increase in headline inflation and threaten to ignite a set of second- and third- round effects We do not see evidence of these developments at this time, but it is  too soon to conclude that the danger of such actions has passed   A second feature of the international forecast that merits a few minutes is the  approximately neutral contribution of real net exports to US real GDP growth in  the third quarter, following a positive contribution in the second quarter  The  third-quarter NIPA [national income and product accounts] data released last  Friday imply a slightly smaller, less positive, contribution than we had  incorporated in the Greenbook baseline forecast or in the September forecast   However, in the current quarter, compared with the September forecast, we are  assuming a greater rebound in exports and have reduced our assessment of the  extent to which the external sector will provide a drag on GDP growth   Accordingly, we expect that on a four-quarter change basis, the external sector  will record a slightly positive contribution to US real GDP growth for the year—  the first annual positive contribution since 1995  However, we are not ready to  declare that external adjustment has arrived, and we expect a return to a small  drag on US growth from the external sector in the current quarter and on balance  over the forecast period   On a quarterly basis, both imports and exports are highly variable  Seasonally  adjusted real oil imports impart notable quarter-to-quarter variance to real                                   November 1, 2005 19 of 114  imports  But recently we have experienced weakness in other components of real  imports  During this intermeeting period, imports again surprised us on the  downside, with August data for nominal imports much weaker than expected   This negative surprise included both goods and services, and within goods, it was  particularly the case for imports of consumer goods and industrial supplies  For  the near-term forecast we have included some effects as a result of the hurricanes  and the disruption to general trade they caused  As a result, there is some implicit  payback in the forecast for real imports in the fourth quarter  Nevertheless,  compared with the September Greenbook, we have lowered the growth of real  imports in 2006 and 2007 in response to the somewhat softer outlook for US  activity and to a higher path for import prices   Growth of third-quarter real exports was also revised down, although not by  enough to offset weaker imports Hurricane effects also figure in our estimate for  third-quarter exports More significant has been the recent strike at Boeing  We  judge that the strike had a more pronounced impact on September=s exports than  we previously thought, leading us to weaken real exports for last quarter  But the  rapid conclusion of that strike also led us to strengthen real exports for the current  quarter For 2006 and 2007, we expect export growth will average a bit above 5  percent per year, consistent with our outlook for steady real output growth abroad   In sum, actual trade data through August, our estimates of how the turbulent  weather of recent months has affected exports and imports, and our projections of  global primary commodity prices, particularly crude oil, combine to imply  unusual quarter-to-quarter fluctuations in growth of real exports and real imports   Some of these developments have surprised us since the September Greenbook   Going forward, however, we expect that the transitory weather effects will fade  by early 2006 We look for real exports and imports to expand at similar rates on  balance in 2006 and 2007 With imports substantially greater than exports, this  outcome implies a negative contribution from the external sector of about ⅓  percentage point each year   David and I will be happy to take your questions    Well, that’s always present for a time    But for example, our J-curve effects last for two or three quarters after the   exchange rate changes  People look for this in particular when the dollar is coming down, and the                              November 1, 2005 20 of 114  dollar decline ended last December, roughly  So I would say there is presently very little J-curve in   the pipeline There may be a little bit from the dollar’s rise, but the dollar hasn’t risen so very much    In nominal imports, but it’s sort of going the wrong way  You might say   it’s the effect of six months of slight dollar depreciation; it could be  But oddly, import prices have   been higher than anybody was expecting  So pieces just don’t fit for the J-curve  And I think the   effect of the dollar depreciation that occurred through the end of 2004 has largely gone away    Yes    I take your point    I’m sure Vincent would be prepared to organize a survey and would respect   the Committee’s wishes    Let me make one point, if I may  We have wrestled with the notion of what   constitutes a neutral assumption about the exchange rate, and it is not obvious because we know that   the forward rates implied by interest rate differentials are very, very poor forecasters  Everybody   knows that  So, taking that as an assumption and giving it weight—and having it run through the                                         November 1, 2005 25 of 114  forecast—does not seem attractive to us  But the alternative is an approach that is kind of   “consistent with the other pieces of the forecast and neutral”  It’s a tough call  We have clung to   something that is close to, but not exactly, the random walk version of things for a while now  We   certainly don’t see our exchange rate forecast as having a determining effect such that we’re driving   the forecast by making this assumption  We try not to do that    Okay We appreciate that  I recognize that the outcome in Mexico during   the first half of this year certainly raises questions, because Mexico has not enjoyed the level of   production that would have been consistent with previous relationships to US GDP  So whether or   not Mexico will, in fact, strengthen is certainly a risk in the forecast  "
5775,2005-12-13," This is a longstanding paradox in international economics  When you run   uncovered interest parity and embody the forward rate as the expected future spot rate, you actually    get the coefficient with the wrong sign in those regressions if the time series is long enough  And you   never get it to confirm interest rate differentials related to exchange rates only in the positive direction   and with the magnitude that you expected  There are all sorts of reasons for that  My short one is that   you’re running two endogenous variables on each other and, therefore, the regression doesn’t make   any sense, and so the results don’t make any sense                                   December 13, 2005 7 of 100   Well, there are times when interest rate differentials seem to be the right   story, and this is one of them    In defense of this chart, let’s just say that there are also theoretical reasons   why at times there is this relationship  "
5776,2005-12-13," This is the time of year when folks young and old look forward to  receiving a pleasant surprise or two—and not necessarily something that can fit inside a  single stocking We in the International Division have found ourselves pleasantly  surprised by the strength of global economic activity during the third quarter, which is  now evident in the data, and the indications that some of that strength is continuing   Accordingly, we have revised up our estimate of foreign real GDP growth for 2005 to  near 3½ percent, about the pace we were projecting early last year  The baseline  forecast this time calls for economic activity abroad to continue expanding at about that  pace through the end of 2007     The greater-than-expected buoyancy of the global economy was widespread and  does not appear to be explained by one or two special developments that have limited  implications for future growth  Among the industrial countries, the strong performers  such as Canada had another good quarter, with Canadian Q3 real GDP growth at 36  percent But more sluggish regions, for example the euro area, also did moderately  well, at 26 percent real growth  Labor markets have either continued to improve or  remained solid  And German and Canadian orders data portend continued solid  expansion Among the Asian emerging-market economies, China, Taiwan, Hong  Kong, Korea, the ASEAN countries, and India all performed well in the third quarter   In Latin America, a sharp rebound in Mexican GDP growth raised the average for the  region despite a very weak quarter in Brazil   Some elements of recent foreign activity do raise questions about whether strength  is transitory or will prove more persistent  In the United Kingdom and some smaller  economies such as New Zealand, further increases in housing prices appear to be  contributing to sustained or accelerating consumption  However, an end to the inflation  of housing prices could trigger a sharp slowing of consumption  Euro-area growth  remains dependent on export demand and lacks support from domestic consumption   And the rebound in Mexico was primarily in the agricultural sector and did not include  a significant bounceback in manufacturing  These factors suggest a transitory element                                  December 13, 2005 14 of 100  in the recent data  In contrast, in the major regions of the global economy, inventories  do not appear excessive and in need of reduction  Private fixed investment has shown  vitality in Japan, the euro area, the United Kingdom, Canada, China, and Mexico   These elements suggest the expansion will prove durable   In most foreign economies, financial conditions remain very favorable for growth   Equity prices, in particular, have risen substantially over the year, providing support for  both private investment and consumption  Since the end of last year, equity prices have  recorded double-digit increases in the foreign G-7 countries, with the more than 30  percent gain in Japan being particularly noteworthy  Among the emerging Asian  countries, stock prices in Korea have surged over the year  In Latin America, Mexican  and Brazilian stock prices have risen very sharply  Except for Canada, the major  foreign industrial countries have all experienced expansionary depreciations of their  currencies on balance over the year  For these countries, long-term interest rates  remain low, ranging from about 1½ percent in Japan to 4¼ percent in the United  Kingdom   We interpret the positive surprise in the pace of third-quarter activity as indicating  somewhat greater fundamental economic momentum abroad than we recognized in the  previous Greenbook That momentum, in combination with the generally supportive  foreign financial conditions, should sustain foreign real GDP growth, and we have  accordingly raised our forecast for 2006 slightly  We expect that this continued  moderate real output growth will be accompanied by little change, on average, in  inflation abroad as the flat path projected for global crude oil prices over the forecast  interval should result in some shifts down in headline inflation  Of course, risks of an  acceleration in consumer prices abroad, owing to second-round effects from previous  oil price rises, remain  Both the Bank of Canada and the ECB raised policy rates  during the intermeeting period to counter any upward drift in inflation pressures or in  inflation expectations We expect further policy tightening in Canada in the next few  quarters, more limited additional action by the ECB, and an end of the Bank of Japan=s  policy of quantitative easing some time in 2006     By itself, somewhat stronger activity abroad should work to narrow our external  deficits in 2006 and 2007  But we have also slightly raised the forecast path for the  dollar in this forecast from that in the October Greenbook, and the level of US real  GDP has been revised up as well Together, these last two factors outweigh the effects  of stronger activity abroad and, as a result, we expect a greater US current account  deficit during the next two years, with the upward revision reaching about $50 billion at  an annual rate in the fourth quarter of 2007 About $30 billion of the increased deficit  is expected to be accounted for by a wider trade deficit, with the remaining $20 billion  arising from a downward revision to net investment income  Our outlook incorporates  a deterioration of more than $100 billion in US net investment income from the  second quarter of this year to the final quarter of 2007, with negative net income  expected for the current quarter With the current account deficit soon to reach $900  billion and projected to cross the $1 trillion mark in 2007 and with net investment  income significantly negative, market attention to the burden of the US external                                          December 13, 2005 15 of 100  deficits could increase This feature of the December forecast is not such a pleasant  surprise Given today=s prices for energy, perhaps we would be better off with a lump  of coal   David and I would be happy to answer any questions    Well, two or three things come to mind  No one of them alone would seem   to explain it, but in conjunction they may be a partial answer to your question  One is that following   the Asian financial crisis, and no doubt in part in response to what has been happening in the United   States, particularly since say, ’95 or ’96, most of these countries have been running current account   surpluses and acquiring international reserves  The Asian countries have been doing it to the extreme    They’ve been piling up reserves and protecting themselves from being dependent upon the whims of   foreign investors ever since that crisis  And they’re still doing it, although I noted an article in today’s   Wall Street Journal quoting some Chinese officials as saying that maybe they now had enough  So I   took that to be an interesting sign                             December 13, 2005 16 of 100  The Latin American countries—for many of the same reasons, but without quite the same   capacity—have nonetheless put themselves in a position of an external plus instead of a minus  Now,   the Latin Americans, in particular, and some of the Asians have outstanding debts, so they have   payments schedules they have to meet  It’s not as if they are not in some sense still embroiled in the   consequences of their histories and so forth  But their position vis-à-vis global capital flows has   turned around enormously, and they have never gone back to policies that reflect an attitude of “the   crisis is over, full steam ahead”  They have retained this preference for keeping themselves net   lenders in a flow sense in the international capital flow  There are many reasons to view that as a   problem as much as a good thing, but it explains, I think, why Argentina didn’t have much contagion   effect and why these countries seem to us to be doing better    Well, most of their exchange rates are floating, yes    Yes So very few are trying to peg to an overvalued exchange rate  Even a   country like Malaysia gave up on its pegged exchange rate  So the floating rates have certainly   improved the situation  But, you know, the peso and the real are strengthening vis-à-vis the dollar    So it’s not mercantilist It’s not that these countries have somehow allowed their exchange rates to   become and remain undervalued and that they are benefiting from that  But again, I think the flow   changes the risk character of these countries and their ability to interact with international investors   I think a second fundamental is that Asia, largely because of China but also because of India   to some degree—because of the Asian Tigers, as we used to call them—has become a second   independent source of vibrant global economic activity  It was derailed a bit in the late ’90s, but   actually only a pretty short period elapsed before they were back on their feet  And their capacity to                                December 13, 2005 17 of 100  succeed economically is very great  They are a high-saving, highly productive, strong work ethic part   of the world  And unless something happens to forestall that, they’re going to be an economic region   that’s growing   And, third, they’re becoming more market-based  The orthodoxy, so to speak—the increased   reliance on markets, the additional flexibility, and the more stable macro prices—is paying dividends   in these regions as well  You still get a country like Venezuela that, but for its oil reserves, would be   totally in some tank somewhere  And its politics are leading it in crazy directions, but it’s the   exception at this point; the others are more as I’ve just described    There are still shortcomings, no doubt  It’s still the case that Asian market   capitalism is not Anglo-Saxon market capitalism  And China could still find that the enormous task it   has set itself of changing that economy at a very rapid pace could run into troubles  These are not   guarantees, but I think it’s in some sense a description of where we’ve been  And even all the shocks   that we’ve all talked about so much—9/11, Enron, stock market collapses, et cetera—which were   every bit as much global as they were US-only, have been absorbed remarkably well, not only here   but abroad    Just as a quick answer, we have put assumptions into the Greenbook about   the size of those capital flows, as a financing of our deficit  They don’t influence the current account   because the earnings on US investments abroad are booked as occurring on a flow basis—when they   happen—whether they are repatriated or not  So the repatriation in light of this special tax break that   will ultimately expire would be a financing flow, not a change to the current account  And probably   the numbers are big enough to be meaningful but not huge, not dominant   What we don’t know—probably can’t know—is the extent to which the flows back to this   country are already in dollars in some sense  Are they earned in dollars or are they transferred into   dollars over some long period of time?  If they are sort of sitting there waiting to come back in dollars,   they wouldn’t have any particular role in explaining, say, the run-up in the dollar over the last six   months or so  Without very disaggregated data, we can’t really tell that  And the turnover in the                                December 13, 2005 20 of 100  exchange market is so huge that numbers on the order of magnitude that this tax break involved   would never show up as a sudden outlier in a particular month, or something of that sort  We’ve put   something in there as an assumption, and it’s probably a piece of the story  It’s providing a little bit of   extra ease in financing the current account deficit right now and is, therefore, a bit of support for the   dollar  But I wouldn’t think it is a dominant factor    I certainly don’t dispute that it is useful to know things like the amount of   private versus official financing, and the nature of some of the flows, and so forth  But let me caution   you that, in the end, the actual data recorded for capital flows will conform to the current account   balances There are certain market equilibria that imply certain identities  So the fact that the   numbers are what they are isn’t so important  What matters are the terms on which those flows occur    So things like exchange rates, interest rates, and equity prices will tell you the characteristics of the   returns to assets that had to be realized in order to get the flows to be what the flows had to be  "
