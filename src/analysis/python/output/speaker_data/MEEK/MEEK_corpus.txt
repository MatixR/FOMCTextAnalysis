  [Statement--see Appendix]     6/21/77 - 22 -           Well, our operations in the short run, of course, add to the available supply  of market bills, and in this period they reduced the shortage in the market  Nonetheless, the  shortage of bills in the market has been one of the reasons that the bill rates have been out of line  with other short-term rates during this period     [Statement--see Appendix]      I said 14 to 17 billion  There are even some that are lower than that, but that's   the consensus at the moment  [Statement continued]      To $4 billion      In the period between now and the next meeting of the Committee      Well, I think that is certainly one factor on the part of some investors  The   technical explanation that you alluded to is that in fact money management has attempted in the  wake of the '73-'74 experience to be more sophisticated and to pile up more money in the short end,  awaiting the peak in interest rates  Everyone has been betting on that  Over the course of the  summer, there has been a change of view that one didn't want to miss that peak, and we have had a  sustained investment of long-term funds  I think the next few weeks will tell whether it has run its  course or--       Well, the reserve need that we are now confronting, which is a rise of $5   billion in the Treasury balance from the current statement week to the next statement week, will be  such as to require us to be buying in all sectors of the market  So we'll certainly be in the coupon  market once or possibly twice over the next two weeks, I would say      [Statement--see Appendix]   [Statement continued]   In fact, yesterday there was less demand for matched transactions than we had planned to make So we wound up    7/9/80  doing less than we expected And there is quite an abundance of excess reserves to be mopped up today   Indeed We had considered going in early, but the dollar began to strengthen at about the time we were prepared to go in, so we held off until our normal intervention hour   Yes, I think there has been some feeling in the market to that effect It is a problem we get into when borrowing at the discount window is at frictional levels because it is somewhat indeterminate whether the funds rate will be in the 8-1/2 to 11 percent range The result is that when we put in reserves at 9-1/2 percent, people chose to interpret that as being the top of some range; similarly, it has been quite clear that we have been defending 8-1/2 percent as the bottom of the range It's a box that we tend to get into I think yesterday's action of mopping up reserves when funds were trading at 3-3/4 percent caused the market to pause at first blush but the action was later construed as being consistent with our normal operating procedures   Well, there's always concern in the market about the level of interest rates and the general thrust of policy   I wouldn't say that that is in question   There are two markets that we are talking about here The government securities market is always very obsessed with trying to invent a federal funds rate range if one doesn't exist They react to what we do as though it has significance when it doesn't have any   Of course   It's $3-1/2 billion in the week of June 30   It's right on the edge on our [staff's] estimates The Board [staff] has somewhat lower estimates But it seemed prudent to have adequate room These estimates are notoriously unreliable   Well, $4 billion would be quite adequate, I think   The $3 billion [normal limit] is right on the edge   Yes sir   [Statement--see Appendix]    7/6-7/81   They were about 1770 percent last Thursday and are somewhat lower than that today--about 1750 percent after our operations today, I would say   Through the discount notes mostly   I had a call in today to find that out, but I have not gotten the figures The market says that the rollover is quite substantial   It's pretty widespread What has happened with FNMA, as I said, is that a good many people have taken them off their [approved] list, and it's harder for FNMA to sell anything longer than the four-year issue that they came out with It's a much wider spread than I think lasted for any length of time in 1974 There was a brief period [then] when it got up to 75 to 100 basis points But they have a significant problem The new management of FNMA met with the industry about a week ago and everyone is impressed with their plans and with the kind of appreciation they have of their problems But it's going to take some time to resolve them Basically I believe, as the Fortune article on FNMA reported, that the portfolios are under water by a very substantial amount   When the Committee consulted by phone on the 17th of June, the amount we had lowered [the nonborrowed path] at that point was $180 million, and the shortfall was not all that great We have seen quite a lot of weakness, of course, since that time   No   No, it has not been moved down   Except that there was an adjustment We came out of that Wednesday with the very high borrowing that I mentioned, and there were some spillover effects into the next week, when borrowing also ran high And the overshoot in borrowing in that first week was then disregarded in that sense   I think one has to start with the Memorial Day weekend when there is some suspicion that borrowing was as heavy as it was over the weekend because we were coming toward the end of the quarter and people felt entitled, in some sense, to use the window It was a long weekend and borrowing was quite heavy over that weekend Thereafter, we had a kind of alternating pattern in which borrowing tended to be low and then high in successive weeks, which is not an unfamiliar pattern with banks who tend to bet that the next week is going to be like the [current] week So, if Wednesday is tight, they are likely to figure that out and borrow on Friday That gives a profile for the week of high borrowing before the weekend and low borrowing afterward If borrowing then toward the end of the week tends to be low, which happened in several weeks, and money market conditions are easier, that tends to make banks borrow less before the weekend--less than called for by our path--with the result that by Wednesday the amount they have to borrow is substantially more than the average, and interest rates go up   We've had some very tight Wednesdays And as I [mentioned in my statement], I think [in the days prior to] the Wednesday in the middle of June, the willingness to accumulate deficiencies on the part of the banks reflected a conviction that interest rates were moving lower automatically because the economy seemed to be weakening and the M-1B numbers were coming out weaker The banks assumed, I think, that at the end of the week it would be cheaper to cover their positions than it was at 18-1/2 percent before the weekend That presumption was not at all consistent with our reserve path So, on Wednesday the 17th of June, banks wound up borrowing $64 billion in order to have over $5 billion of excess reserves that day to balance their position   What I was just describing was the conflict between their expectations and our reserve strategy   [Unintelligible] that took place That changes their expectations, you see, and has market effects [such as I] described   I walked in here [directly] from the airport, so I don't know   We did $3-1/2 billion of 3-day repurchase agreements today On Thursday, both the New York and Board staff projections suggested that we should be absorbing reserves this week and, in fact, that was a fairly general forecast in the Street We discovered a big shortfall the next day, and the estimates this morning showed a need to add $11 billion of reserves on our numbers and $19 billion on the Board staff's numbers So we did $3-1/2 billion of 3-day RPs, which would supply about $1-1/2 billion [on average for the week]   Yes, and the banks' Treasury balances [were a little high]    7/6-7/81   I don't think it's perceived that way I have some feeling that with that 18 percent rate it may be a little harder than it otherwise would be for the rate to go much below 18 percent   Well, I would say that during the last week the market has gradually [reduced] its estimates of the funds rate that is consistent with the Committee's objectives to somewhere probably around the 18 percent level from 19 percent or thereabouts The estimates in the market of the numbers that we will publish today range from an increase of about $2 billion to $6 billion, with most of the expectations around $3 billion   It's a little confused   Borrowings were $900 million the week before last and about $1-1/2 billion last week I would think somewhere in the $800 million to $1 billion area   I believe that would be Nancy's intent--that there be a change   Well, I think the market would be quite surprised And I do think that we have enough credibility in the markets that accommodating a July bulge, after the January and April experience, is considered likely by the markets   Well, I think we had the funds rate trading up in the last week largely because of the June 30th statement date and the  -53-    6/30-7/1/82  pressures for banks to dress up their balance sheets for that I would say, with the billion dollar level of borrowing that was our objective, that a funds rate somewhere around 14 percent or a little above was what was indicated; that is about where it was in May before we lowered the borrowing level to $800 million Then the rate went down for three weeks to 13-1/2 percent; but it came back, as funds strengthened, to wind up the period roughly where it was at the beginning  SPEAKER(?) Following the last Federal Open Market Committee meeting, the funds rate dropped from the 14-1/2 percent area down to 13-1/2 percent, and it was there for a period of 10 days or 2 weeks--I forget exactly Was that a shock to the market? How did the market react to that percentage point drop?   Well, the market was encouraged at that point Its expectation in May was that if the economy was weak, in fact interest rates would ease off So dealers and others in the market accumulated positions in the expectation of being able to sell at the higher prices to others in the market We had an abrupt reversal in June, which was not related to the funds rate or to our posture but to the prospect of [a large volume of] Treasury financing coming within a very short period of time The Drysdale and Comark episodes also were factors and the anticipation of a July money supply bulge was a factor But the main thing was that the Treasury expected to raise $50 to $55 billion this quarter And being stuck with inventories that customers weren't buying at lower rates, they had to clean the decks So, interest rates adjusted up quite sharply through the middle of last week--by 100 to 120 basis points at the intermediate and long end of the market and less than that at the short end In the last two days, with the successful sale of the 4-year notes, a little of that ground has been retraced, with the 4-year issue having trouble at 1496 percent and moving down to 1468 percent or thereabouts And the 7-year issue that is being sold today is expected to come out about 40 basis points lower in yield than it was on Monday   I think it would gradually be eased down from above 14 percent, roughly toward 13-1/2 or 13-3/4 percent or something like that   It would be back close to where it was in early June   Let me just say that I think the publication of these numbers, if they hold up, will itself change some expectations in the market about what we're likely to do in July and beyond There could be a substantial sense--   Mr Chairman, if you want to start with an $800 million borrowing level, that is the borrowing level adopted at the May meeting, when the funds rate range adopted was 10 to 15 percent That would be an unchanged--   [Secretary's note Mr Meek summarized the statement shown in the Appendix]   It's in the process of an orderly liquidation   I should say there remains an uncertainty around that firm Whether it's a call on capital through its limited partners will be answered by the partners [if they] put up capital It appears at the present time that there was a shortage of securities They owe customers on the order of $15 to $19 million dollars So, it's possible that some losses could come   [There are amounts] due to some customers from them But I don't think it's anything of a magnitude that would be particularly disturbing to the market as a whole   I'd just add one market factor, which is that the Treasury in the third quarter, for example, will be selling about $60 billion of coupon issues to replace approximately $23 billion that mature We're really getting a lot of supply and the markets are having trouble finding a widening circle of buyers for that supply   I think that $225 million includes about $150 million of seasonal borrowing   Seasonal borrowing is in   Let me mention one other factor that's in that borrowing number We have a lot of nonmember banks that now have access to the discount window; they're borrowing about $100 million The seasonal borrowing is $150 million and there has always been a normal frictional borrowing amount of about $100 million So, you're talking about a $350 million base in some sense   I think $600 million is probably about where we are now, but not in--   I think $600 million on borrowing is somewhere around 9 percent or a little higher--perhaps 9-1/8 percent   Well, I would give a little range there, I think   Well, I think the analysts have one [view] and the traders another I think the traders have voted with their feet and have anticipated not only 9-1/8 percent but something on the order of 9-1/2 percent The analysts are still sorting out free reserves, borrowings, and excess reserves, and lag a bit behind   Yes, very abbreviated [Statement--see Appendix]   [Statement--see Appendix]   My sense is that some of the anxiety that was present in the markets in late June has gone out of the market since then   I think that's a fair statement   Well, it has allowed us to accommodate somewhat the extraordinary demand for excess reserves by the major banks early in the period
