9117,2011-09-20,"2  I am  Thank you, Mr Chairman  In a memo provided to the  Committee ahead of this meeting, the staff presented three options for managing the  SOMA portfolio in order to provide additional monetary policy accommodation  a  reinvestment maturity extension program, a SOMA portfolio maturity extension  program included in alternative B in Book B of the Tealbook, and a long-maturity  large-scale asset purchase program included in alternative A   The intention of each of these options is to remove duration risk from the holdings  of private investors, thereby putting downward pressure on longer-term interest rates  and making broader financial conditions more supportive of economic growth   However, the amount of duration risk removed and the manner through which that  occurs differ across the three options  The two maturity extension options maintain  the current size of the portfolio while shifting its composition toward longer-term  Treasury holdings, while the long-maturity LSAP option expands the size of the  portfolio while shifting its composition                                                     2 The materials used by Ms Remache, Mr Carpenter, and Mr Reifschneider are appended to this transcript  (appendix 2)   September 20–21, 2011 16 of 290              Under the reinvestment maturity extension program, the reinvestment of principal  payments from agency securities is shifted into Treasury securities with greater than  six years to maturity  This policy is assumed to remain in effect until redemptions  begin  As can be seen in your first exhibit, in the top-left chart by the dark blue line,  this policy maintains the portfolio at its current level and leads to only a modest shift  in the path of the SOMA once exit commences  The average duration of the  portfolio, shown by the dark blue line in the chart to the right, moves up to five years  by late 2012, about a half-year longer than in the baseline scenario   The maturity extension program (MEP) of alternative B would involve  $400 billion of long-term Treasury security purchases and a similar amount of short- term Treasury security sales, in addition to lengthening the maturity of reinvestments  of agency securities  Under this alternative, the size of the SOMA would again stay  steady  However, as can be seen in the top-left chart by the light blue line, it implies  a more distinct departure from the baseline over time  The average duration of the  portfolio would increase markedly, reaching nearly 6½ years, as shown in the top- right panel  Because of the longer average maturity, the portfolio would not run off  as quickly during the exit period  Indeed, it would be as much as $450 billion higher  than in the baseline and would take 15 months longer to return to steady state   The long-maturity LSAP of alternative A would add $1 trillion in Treasury  securities to the balance sheet, in addition to lengthening the maturity of  reinvestments of agency securities  The red line in the top-left chart shows the  increase in the SOMA  The average duration of the portfolio moves up, but by much  less than under the MEP  Once exit commences, the SOMA runs off more quickly;  however, given the higher starting level of the portfolio, it reaches its steady-state size  at about the same time   The middle-left chart shows the path of the SOMA in 10-year equivalents—a  measure of the dollar value of duration risk  The chart shows that both the MEP and  the LSAP add a considerable amount of additional duration risk to the SOMA  portfolio, with the MEP operating more by shifting the average duration of the  SOMA and the LSAP operating more by increasing the size of the SOMA  By  contrast, the reinvestment option by itself adds only modestly to SOMA duration risk   As shown to the right, the MEP and LSAP have similar effects, reducing the  10-year term premium by roughly 20 basis points and 25 basis points, respectively   These figures are somewhat larger than the estimated 15 basis point effect of the  LSAP that ended in June  FRB/US simulations suggest that either of these programs  would lower the unemployment rate about ¼ to ½ percentage point and boost core  PCE inflation about ¼ percentage point  Of course, as Brian noted, market  participants place relatively high odds on a maturity extension program, and hence a  sizable portion of the interest rate effect may already have been realized  The  reinvestment option has considerably more modest effects on rates and therefore on  the economy   September 20–21, 2011 17 of 290              The broad contour of Federal Reserve income over the projection period is similar  under the MEP and LSAP alternatives, although there are some important differences  in its trajectory and sensitivity to interest rate movements  The bottom-left panel  shows our projections for remittances to the Treasury under each scenario  Relative  to the baseline, both the MEP and LSAP would result in an increase in remittances to  the Treasury through 2014, driven by higher interest income on Treasury holdings   Thereafter, income would be lower as a result of higher interest expense  In the  longer run, income under these alternatives remains depressed because of the higher  proportion of securities acquired during the current low yield environment  Under all  scenarios, remittances remain positive and trough at levels close to those prevailing  before the crisis   The bottom-right panel examines the results under an adverse rate scenario in  which the FOMC tightens earlier and long-term interest rates run as much as  175 basis points higher than the baseline  In the LSAP scenario, which is the most  adverse, remittances to the Treasury would cease for a period of four years, resulting  in a deferred credit asset on the balance sheet peaking at about $50 billion in 2016   Before closing, I should highlight two additional points about the balance sheet  options presented  First, under the MEP or LSAP, the SOMA would own  approximately 40 percent of all Treasury securities with greater than six years to  maturity, with many securities at our 70 percent limit  The Federal Reserve has never  held such a high proportion of long-term securities, and we think that holdings of this  proportion have some risk to cause a deterioration in market functioning   Finally, it is worth repeating that all of the estimates presented here are subject to  a high degree of uncertainty, particularly those around the market and economic  effects  In particular, we presented results based on a portfolio balance model, which  implies that it is only the overall quantity of interest rate risk that matters in  determining the market effect  If instead there is more market segmentation across  maturity points, then there would be more difference between the LSAP and MEP  programs, as we also purchase short-term securities in the LSAP program  I’ll now  turn it over to Seth to discuss IOER     I think that would be fair to say  "
