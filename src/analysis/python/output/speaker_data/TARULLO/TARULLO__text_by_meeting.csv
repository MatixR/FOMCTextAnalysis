8693,2009-02-07,TARULLO," Thank you, Richard  "
8721,2009-03-17,TARULLO," Thank you, Mr Chairman  Mindful of the fact that I’m now the major   impediment between the Federal Open Market Committee and dinner, I will follow President   Lockhart’s lead and confine myself to comments on the large-scale asset-purchase issue  But   could I ask Trish a couple of quick questions beforehand?  One, Trish, you said earlier something   about the equivalent of absorption capacity, or I guess it’s actually going in the other direction,   the effective limit on MBS purchases   Okay Second, you were working with the half trillion figure for   government securities, which had been put in the Bluebook  Is there a minimum figure below   which a palpable impact wouldn’t be felt?   Okay Thanks So, somewhat informed by those helpful answers, here   are my views as they now stand  First, it seems to me that under current circumstances, for the   reasons many of you have stated, the risks for us are in doing too little, not in doing too much    That leads me to the predisposition towards a large figure, at least as large as the Option A total   that was included in the Bluebook, and, as Vice Chairman Dudley has suggested, perhaps larger           March 17–18, 2009 108 of 266  than that as well Second, it seems to me with respect to the issue of the proper number—how   do we know where we are going, how do we know how much is enough—you all have for some   time been, and now I’m joining you, navigating in waters in which there’s not a particularly good   map to follow, so it’s necessarily a matter of making judgments based upon what appear to be   still seriously dysfunctional credit markets and a serious absence of liquidity and a seriously   underperforming real economy  In those circumstances, I feel pushed towards the larger end of   the ranges that have been identified as appropriate  Third, for the reason that President Evans   stated earlier in the afternoon, my inclination is towards multiple instruments  I’ve been struck   just in my first six weeks here how many times people have commented that correlations or   predictions that people might have expected in normal times are now breaking down a bit    We’re not entirely sure of the effects of the application of a particular policy instrument, and it   seems to me that, under those circumstances, it would be wise to mix instruments that are   essentially directed towards the same end  Having said that, my instinct, if it is possible—and   this is why I asked Trish the question about minimum purchases of government securities—is for   an asymmetric number and an asymmetric emphasis upon the MBS rather than the Treasury   securities Here I’d echo—or steal—some of the points that Vice Chairman Dudley made a   moment ago   Finally, on communications, I have a slightly different, but I think complementary, point   to the one that President Lockhart made  If we go this route of including both MBS and   Treasuries, I hope we could at least consider giving some explanation in the Committee’s   statement about why we’re pursuing both rather than simply stating “here is the amount of each   which we’ve instructed the Desk to purchase”  Thank you   Thank you, Mr Chairman  Not surprisingly, my assessment of the   economy and the financial sector converges with those that have already been expressed  So let   me just quickly make a few additional observations that support the hypothesis of an even longer   period for stabilization and recovery than reflected in the Greenbook forecast and, thus, even   greater vulnerability for the economy for some time to come   I begin with an admittedly speculative point about the domestic labor market, but one that   complements some earlier comments by Presidents Yellen and Evans  It appears to me that an   unusual number of industries will be undergoing major structural adjustments during the course   of this downturn and, as a result, may not rehire at the rate that might be expected in a cyclical   rebound These industries are two groups One consists of industries like construction and   financial services that were directly involved in the asset bubbles associated with the financial   crisis It seems likely that overcapacity in those industries so far exceeded sustainable demand   that the post-recession employment profile will be substantially, rather than just moderately,   below pre-crisis levels A second group consists of industries that, even in the middle part of the   decade, had seen significant pressure on their business models  Companies and sectors as   diverse as autos, media, legal services, and retail were already in the process of consolidation   and/or downsizing This process has clearly accelerated under the weight of the contraction in   real GDP There are good reasons—anecdotal, I admit, but good reasons, nonetheless—to   believe that, to a greater or lesser degree, each of these industries will emerge from this recession   permanently leaner than they were, and some may be fundamentally changed  This observation   is, as I noted, to date unsupported by even raw data, much less by systematic comparison with   earlier severe recessions  But if my intuition is buttressed by such an analysis, elevated   unemployment levels may be stickier for a longer time than we now anticipate  The emergence           March 17–18, 2009 162 of 266  of new firms and industries that might normally be expected to pick up some of the slack will, at   the same time, be hindered by continuing dysfunction in financial markets   I have some very different observations about the international economy, but, I’m afraid,   with similar implications for the shape of the GDP growth curve  The downward revisions of   economic performance abroad do not seem to have been met with a sense of policy urgency in   many countries, particularly with respect to non-monetary policy measures in the advanced   foreign economies  Indeed, my conclusion from my week in Europe was not dissimilar to that of   Governor Warsh I observed, in addition, that there has been a kind of collective decision among   policymakers to put on a relatively happy face publicly, while being unable privately to offer any   grounds for optimism  In formal comments and public utterances, a number of policymakers   made reference to wholly adequate stimulus measures  They discounted the significance of   increased bank CDS spreads, or, in at least one case, commented on the wonderful bargains   available to those who still had jobs  This attitude is of particular concern because, as Steve   Kamin mentioned, the effects of stimulus measures in many advanced foreign economies are   substantially front-loaded into 2009   Whether because of policy paralysis in the face of daunting challenges or, in some cases,   because of the weak political circumstances of incumbent governments, too many countries seem   unable or unwilling to elevate their responses to rapidly deteriorating conditions  I worry that a   similar hesitancy to take forceful steps could lead to inadequate responses to contingencies, such   as widespread banking problems in emerging markets  An absence of confidence in the political   strength of the government can also push officials towards more serious consideration of   measures, such as shifts in foreign exchange policies, which may relieve a certain amount of   domestic pain by shifting it elsewhere in a neutral or even negative-sum fashion        March 17–18, 2009 163 of 266  My concerns about this issue have increased dramatically in the last week  Many   emerging markets have limited capacity to help themselves, given their own fiscal and monetary   constraints One major exception, of course, is China  Yet even China seems to be relying in the   medium term on a rebound in advanced foreign economies that would restore many of the   exports lost in recent months  While that approach worked well for countries coming out of the   Asian financial crisis in 1999, it was built on the strength of largely unaffected American and   European economies  Obviously, demand in our economies will be weak for quite some time    Moreover, the continued problems in our financial sectors imply that capital flows to emerging   markets are unlikely to pick up, as they did following the Asian financial crisis   Despite these impediments to a reasonably fast-paced return to conditions promoting   rapid emerging market growth, there’s little indication in China or elsewhere that policymakers   have used the crisis to accelerate shifts in their own growth models away from a high level of   export dependence Coupled with what is, at least for the present, a somewhat passive policy   instinct in some advanced economies, international developments may, like our domestic   employment situation, suggest a more prolonged and shaky recovery period  Thank you, Mr   Chairman   Brian, I just want to make sure I understand the numbers as well, and it   comes down to a difference in wording between A and B  In B, you have “increase its purchases   of agency debt this year by $100 billion to a total of $200 billion”  In A, it just says, “boost its   purchases” and “now anticipates purchasing $200 billion”  I guess that makes the headline           March 17–18, 2009 176 of 266  number in alternative A $1 trillion  But, if I understand correctly, it’s really an additional   $900 billion of authorized purchases Is that right?   Okay I’m just curious  Why is the alternative A today $100 billion   less than the alternative A in the Bluebook, which was $500 billion additional MBS and   $500 billion Treasuries?   Thank you   Thank you, Mr Chairman  Of the options on the table right now, I   favor the combined option Like Governor Duke, I would have been receptive to a higher   number, and I guess President Evans would have been as well  The reason for that is twofold   (1) just because of my understanding of the magnitude of the challenge right now, and (2), as   President Evans said, I think, it’s really very important for us to be able to project a strong but   adaptable approach to monetary policy, not just until the next meeting, but over the course of the   next year It seems to me that by rolling out a bigger, more ambitious headline number, if you   will, but then saying we’re going to implement that over an extended period of time, it gives us   the opportunity at each of the next several Open Market Committee meetings to say “we are   staying with an aggressive policy”  In contrast to when you’re working with the fed funds rate   and you either have to stay where you are or reduce it another 25 or 50 basis points, here one   could say that the Desk is continuing in an aggressive fashion to make purchases   That leads into the issue of communication more generally, and like President Lockhart, I   think the maximum amount of explanation of what we’re doing and why we’re doing it is   important  There is and has been over the last several days a near obsession among markets   about whether or not we are going to engage in large-scale purchases of Treasuries  I will   predict that there’s going to be a lot of speculation about why we’re doing it  I will also predict   that the explanation that it’s “helping improve conditions in private credit markets” will not seem           March 17–18, 2009 214 of 266  to most commentators to be a complete explanation  Thus, in an effort to respond to Governor   Warsh’s concerns—which I don’t share to the extent of being unwilling to do securities   purchases, but do think are important—I would hope that in the delicate but important arena of   communications outside of the formal statement, we will be able to find a way quite quickly to   clarify why we’re doing this   Right, exactly   To what market forces are you referring?  "
8747,2009-04-28,TARULLO," Thank you, Mr Chairman  While anchoring the last spot in the go-  round has the disadvantage of addressing an audience that is weary, if not catatonic, [laughter] it   does have the advantage of allowing me to endorse a consensus without having to repeat all of   the reasoning that has generated it So let me begin by agreeing with what I hear to be the   prevailing view  First, the pace of decline in the economy has slowed significantly since our last   meeting  Second, since our last meeting, we have seen some encouraging indications in the data,                 April 28–29, 2009 94 of 201  but, Mr Chairman, I have to say here that the one thing you may regret from your “60 Minutes”   appearance is the use of this phrase  Third, there is considerable uncertainty whether these are   green shoots promising blossoms to come or a school of red herring swimming across the sea of   death [Laughter]   Within this broadly shared frame of reference, I would make two observations  One,   with an eye to history, relates to the uncertainty that I just noted  The other relates to the likely   duration of a recovery period once the bottom has in fact been reached  As to history, we all   know that serious recessions have their own idiosyncratic origins and run their own course    However, in light of the mildly hopeful data in the intermeeting period, I thought it useful to ask   the question whether similar signs have in the past converged in what turned out to be a false   dawn and, if so, whether we can distinguish between signs of a false dawn and signs of true   recovery   Looking at the last two serious economic downturns in the United States—the 1973–75   and the1981–82 recessions—staff members from Dave Stockton’s division provided some   interesting answers First, in both instances there was indeed a period during which hopeful   signs converged that in retrospect were not harbingers of imminent stabilization and recovery but   were instead followed by further deterioration  In each case, housing starts, initial claims, PCE   growth, industrial production, and equity markets all improved noticeably at approximately the   same time  That is, the signs were even more uniformly tilted toward the upside than they are at   present Second, a review of Greenbooks from the relevant periods reveals that the staff   interpreted these data as indicating the end of cyclical declines Third, what we now know to be   the actual beginnings of recovery, however, were characterized by improvements in these same   indicators at a pace not unlike that which had been seen in the earlier false dawn  Needless to     April 28–29, 2009 95 of 201  say, two cases do not a pattern make  Moreover, further analysis of these and other examples   might yield more finely grained conclusions  For the present, though, this modest inquiry helps   explain and, indeed, excuse our collective low levels of assurance in our assessments of current   conditions   Let me now rehearse some reasons that I continue to tend toward the view that, even   when a true turning point is reached, recovery may be much more gradual—even halting at   times—than has been our experience with economic downturns since the Second World War    First, as noted in a number of recent studies, most recently Rogoff and Reinhart, economic   downturns that begin with a financial crisis can be expected to be more painful and to have   longer recovery periods than other serious recessions  Although it is very difficult to   disaggregate the effects of reduced demand, asset value uncertainty, and capital impairment, it   seems probable that this last factor is both important and unlikely to be remedied soon, the   TARP notwithstanding  With some notable exceptions, improvements in credit markets still   seem generally associated, directly or indirectly, with government support  Indeed, to a   considerable extent, our financial institutions are all still fundamentally tethered to government   guarantees or support   Second, as I suggested at the last FOMC meeting, in an unusual number of industries,   structural changes that were insipient even before the onset of the financial crisis, have been   accelerated with the potential for extended negative effects on employment  At the same time,   sources of financing for new businesses are likely to remain constrained for some time to come   Third, as many of you have already noted, there are significant headwinds that may   partially offset any positive momentum that develops  For example, again, as you have noted, it   seems likely that the considerable damage to commercial real estate markets has only begun     April 28–29, 2009 96 of 201  working its way through the financial system, with attendant negative implications for the   balance sheets of many regional banking organizations  A somewhat different example is   suggested by the possibility that many foreign economies may be lagging the US downturn    Particularly with respect to the euro area, lags in employment reduction, bank balance sheet   repair, and other factors lead me to a somewhat more pessimistic view of economic performance   in the coming quarters than was suggested in the Greenbook, whose alternative scenario of lower   foreign economic growth produces materially negative effects on US economic performance   Fourth, and finally, the likely continued fragility of the economy makes it unusually   vulnerable to shocks, which could, in effect, set the reset button on the recovery effort  Some of   these potential shocks are classically economic, such as a crisis in an Eastern European country   or a former Soviet Republic  Others, such as a swine flu pandemic or adverse geopolitical   developments, are truly exogenous   Neither individually, nor as a whole, do these factors have salience for our decisions at   this meeting  However, they do suggest that policy challenges may extend for a considerable   period—policy challenges, I should say, beyond that of the unwinding of our balance sheet    Even when dawn truly breaks, it promises to be a very slowly clearing day  Thank you, Mr   Chairman   Thank you, Mr Chairman  I believe the problem with which we are   confronted, as many of you have already noted, is fundamentally one of communication  I   would elaborate that a bit to say that I think the problem may be in no small part our ability to     April 28–29, 2009 147 of 201  communicate to ourselves, individually and collectively, why we are doing what we are doing  I   regard that as important because of what I said yesterday and what the Chairman mentioned this   morning in the conclusion to his wrap-up, which is that we may be faced with a suboptimally   performing economy for some time to come in which the policy challenges will extend beyond   the challenge of readjusting our balance sheet over a number of years  Under these   circumstances, it becomes more important that we have a clear sense of what policy instruments   we think are available and why and how we are going to deploy them in response to a given set   of conditions   Based on listening to the March meeting discussion and this meeting’s discussion, I do   not feel that we are actually in a position to articulate a standard that is roughly comparable to   what is articulated when normal monetary policy is being done  Under those circumstances, I   favor saying the least because my concern is that saying more will lead to inferences that we   don’t actually want people to draw So, for example, by adopting a more forward-leaning   strategy such as alternative A this morning, I fear that a message would be sent as to how exactly   we are reading the green shoots versus the red herrings debate  I fear that there would be an   inference drawn that we have concluded that we know how the Treasury purchases are actually   functioning and we have some reason to believe that they will respond to what we think the most   important problems in the economy are  Like Governor Warsh, I do fear a bit that an inference   will be drawn as to our being more willing to accommodate the fiscal policies that are being   pursued right now, which I think is not something that any of us has decided we want to   communicate This is not to say that I would be opposed to increased purchases of Treasuries or,   indeed, any other number of policy instruments, but only once we are in a position to     April 28–29, 2009 148 of 201  communicate with enough specificity, either in our statements or through other means of   communication, so as to guard against those kinds of inferences being drawn   On the merits, I think that President Yellen stated the economic conditions better than I   could, and I subscribe to her analysis On the outcomes, I favor alternative B, and I should say I   guess that I favor alternative B with as little change from the March policy statement as is   possible, given that we are now in a later month, precisely to avoid any of the inferences that I   suggested could be wrongly drawn being in fact drawn  Thank you, Mr Chairman  "
8787,2009-06-23,TARULLO," Thank you, Mr Chairman  I thought someone might ask this, which is   why I didn’t get in the queue Brian, what kind of reaction do you expect from markets and   economic commentators to the press release the Chairman is working on?  He read us part of the   draft on the modifications to the various liquidity facilities  Specifically, do you think there’s   much of a chance that it will be read as, if not the beginning of tightening, the lifting up of the   screwdriver and placing it against the screw?  [Laughter] I’d also be interested in what Brian   Sack and Trish think about that   I presume that, if you had thought of this, you would have already   suggested it, but does anything come to mind that would allow us to mitigate that risk?   Thank you Thank you, Mr Chairman   I’m now a little confused  It sounds to me as though we’re now having   the monetary policy discussion, and if that’s what we’re going to do, that’s fine  I just want to   know if that’s what we’re actually doing   I think we’re now getting to the substance of what I thought was going   to be tomorrow’s discussion   Mr Chairman, I think we should say for the record that Brian should   draw no negative inferences from the fact that at his very first meeting President Lacker suggests   that we should withdraw discretion from the Desk  [Laughter]   Thank you, Mr Chairman  Listening to the 15 of you who have   preceded me this morning, I am struck by the fact that the central tendency of our economic   analyses may be even narrower than that suggested in the projections that were gathered in   advance of this meeting  So although, Mr Chairman, it’s your job and not mine to summarize, I   think much of what I’m going to say necessarily reiterates much of what has already been said              June 23–24, 2009 157 of 261  First, the recent hopeful signs of stabilization cannot obscure the fact that economic   conditions remain poor  Even some of the hopeful signs themselves reveal how bad things are    As many of you have noted, improvements in financial market conditions are still quite   dependent on government-provided liquidity facilities and guarantees  The recent rise in housing   starts follows a precipitous multiyear decline, and it could yet be blunted by rising mortgage   rates   Recent developments in the labor market have also been cited as cause for guarded   optimism, but again, as many of you have noted, the news is not all good  In fact, the news is not   good at all, it’s just less bad The decline in initial unemployment claims and the reduction in   job losses over the last couple of months are surely welcome, but unemployment claims are still   at very high levels, and we are still losing jobs in the economy, just at a reduced rate    Meanwhile, the unemployment rate continues its apparently inexorable rise towards double   digits The rate of involuntary non-full-time employment has more than doubled in the last   eighteen months, and the level of aggregate hours worked continues to decline  Since December   2007, the ranks of unemployed Americans have swelled by seven million  Analogous points   could be made about industrial production, retail sales, or just about any other economic   indicator So let me end this first point by noting that, whatever the merits of the protagonists in   the great debate on the correct measure of the output gap, the number is clearly large   My second point, again, I think, reflecting what many of you have already said, is that   there continue to be many reasons to believe that recovery, when it does come, will be slow and   fragile I have now been tutored by Governor Duke to listen to the words that recur the most   during a conversation, and this morning “sluggish” was high among them  Although this is not a   particularly controversial observation, I think it’s one that bears repeating as we consider our        June 23–24, 2009 158 of 261  policy trajectories going forward As many of us have noted previously, background   circumstances suggest an elongated recovery  Economic downturns that begin with a financial   crisis have historically been more painful and with longer recovery periods than other serious   recessions  Households, financial institutions, and other firms are all repairing their balance   sheets in reaction to big reductions in asset values and large debt overhangs  This response,   while understandable and in many respects necessary, leans against the stimulus provided by   increased government spending  Some headwinds are even more apparent than at our last   meeting  Even as we’re heartened by market reception of the SCAP process and by the   significant capital raises of many of the SCAP institutions, we must also note that, overall, bank   lending is still declining Moreover, the list of banks slated for closure grows longer each week,   as does the list of problem banks that I receive once a week  As some of you around this table   have been predicting, the difficulties in commercial real estate markets are growing and may   soon be felt with a vengeance at many regional and smaller banks     Expectations of an uneven and gradual recovery are reinforced when one looks abroad    As in the United States, signals from Europe are mixed, albeit on a somewhat lagged basis, but   there are, as here, drags upon renewed growth when growth does come  The effects of the   smaller stimulus programs in Europe will dissipate more quickly than in the US  Also,   conditions within a number of European banking systems are still not well known  The apparent   reluctance of many countries to conduct and report publicly on their own stress tests has stoked   concerns that weakness in real estate, Eastern Europe, and other exposures are weighing heavily   upon some of these institutions   Several of you have already mentioned China China is frequently cited as one bright   spot in a world economic canvas that is otherwise dark gray, but it, too, actually presents a more        June 23–24, 2009 159 of 261  ambiguous case  While the size and speed of China’s stimulus package has produced impressive   results in bringing its GDP growth above 7 percent, there is little evidence that China or for that   matter other East Asian nations are adjusting their growth models toward greater emphasis on   domestic consumption  They seem to be using infrastructure and other stimulus spending as a   kind of holding pattern, apparently expecting a significant rebound of consumption in the United   States and Europe Thus, even the Chinese recovery may have limited self-sustaining   momentum  The continued and, I fear, misplaced faith in the resurgence of the old export-led   growth model is captured in the image of about 400 empty container ships parked in Singapore   awaiting a return to the old normalcy   Like everyone, I welcome the indications of stabilization and in some areas bottoming   out Few would deny that we are significantly better situated than just a couple of months ago    However, we should not be carried away with optimism or too hastily moved towards the exits    In the current circumstances of a significant output gap, rising unemployment, uneven   improvement in financial markets and firms, and uncertain prospects abroad, inflationary   pressures are neither evident nor likely to be generated within the US economy any time soon    While I do not expect to double dip, I don’t think it can be ruled out entirely either  The   economy remains unusually vulnerable to exogenous shocks or to renewed stress at one or more   significant financial firms This is the most serious economic slump since the Depression, and it   is far from over  Thank you, Mr Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I must confess to being somewhat   discomfited by what I see as a disconnect between the analyses of the economy, which I alluded   to in the earlier go-round, and the fact that when it comes to policy there seems to be more   concern about the potential for inflation some years out than there is with the serious   underperformance of the economy today and for the foreseeable future   I understood our action in March to be an effort to provide further accommodation in the   circumstance of zero-bound rates  I think it’s very difficult to make a judgment now as to   exactly what effect that has had  It does seem, as President Yellen mentioned earlier, that there   is a strong theoretical case, that the counterfactual is difficult to come by, and that it is, other   than statements of future intentions, really the only policy tool available to us        June 23–24, 2009 194 of 261  I was somewhat attracted by not an option in the Bluebook, but an option included in the   June 16 memo from the two Brians, which was to modestly stretch out the Treasury purchase   program until the end of the year  I was attracted to that for a variety of reasons  One is that it   just created a certain time symmetry in our decisionmaking, because the MBS and agency debt   programs go through the end of the year  That, in turn, avoided what I fear is now going to be an   enormous spotlight placed upon us at the August meeting, which is going to be interpreted as the   moment of truth in deciding what happens now with the large-scale asset purchase programs  I   also thought that it might offset, to some degree, what I continue to fear is going to be the   interpretation of market actors and economic observers more generally—not simply that we   failed to expand today, but, within the context of the announcement to come tomorrow, the   announcement likely to come from the FDIC, and, precisely as President Fisher has noted,   because there seems to be a demand that we talk about scaling back the program, that this   inaction will be seen as a beginning response to those demands, which, for obvious reasons, I   think is misplaced as a policy matter  Having said all of that, I note that there is little or no   appetite in the rest of the Open Market Committee for even this action and certainly not for what   was included in the Bluebook as alternative A, which I actually wouldn’t favor at this point   either So I would be prepared to go along with alternative B     Let me now turn to the language issues in alternative B, which, as you can imagine, also   reflect some of my concerns  Like some of the earlier speakers, I find that the first paragraph is a   bit too upbeat, not just for the way that I read the economy, but, again, for the conversation we   had around this table earlier this morning  It’s not that there’s anything in there that’s wrong or   that I disagree with It’s not what is said—I guess it’s more what was left unsaid  I was trying to   figure that out overnight following dinner at the embassy and the baseball game later on in the        June 23–24, 2009 195 of 261  evening It lacks a reference to what so many of us commented on, which is our expectation of   just how slow the recovery will be when it comes  You see gradual resumption of sustainable   growth in there, but the likelihood of a long period, and a rather halting one at that, is what came   through in much of what all seventeen of us said earlier in the day  I would welcome any   suggestions from anybody else as to how we might add that idea     The more important issue to me is the potential inclusion of the final bracketed sentence,   which I think would be a significant policy mistake  And I think that for several reasons One is   my substantive policy views, which I described earlier  But, probably more importantly for the   rest of you, I think it would be a mistake precisely because of the way these statements are read,   so I’m elaborating a bit on what Governor Warsh has said  As everybody knows, anything   regarded as new in these statements is invested with enormous significance  By and large, the   statement goes a little bit by increment—a word is dropped here, a phrase is added there, and   people kind of masticate those changes  If you’ve got something that is brand new, something   that appears to be satisfying a demand from a certain group of market actors, I think that will be   invested with enormous significance  Under the circumstances, I don’t see that the policy   position of the Open Market Committee is there, and I, for one, don’t think that we’re going to   actually get there anytime soon  I also agree with President Lacker in that I have difficulty   understanding what that sentence actually means It’s either a tautology, in which case it’s not   particularly helpful, or it’s suggesting something that I don’t think we’ve actually done in a   policy sense So I think it’s both appropriate and important for the Chairman and others, either   in public testimony or on background, to explicate the various considerations that were reflected   in the very useful memos distributed by the staff  But I do think that this would be the story of   this Open Market Committee meeting if it were included  Thank you        June 23–24, 2009 196 of 261  I think they’re likely to ramp back the guarantees that they’ve been   providing   I would find striking the sentence useful  I think it would balance it a   little bit better Thank you  "
8814,2009-08-11,TARULLO," Thank you, Mr Chairman  Having exhausted my limited stock of   witticisms about coming last in line before the Chairman, I asked Debbie to move me up    [Laughter] But I also wanted to come a little earlier because, even in the five months since my   first FOMC meeting, a lot has changed  At that time, we were contemplating essentially two   scenarios, very bad and even worse In no small part because of the various actions of the   Federal Reserve, the financial system and the economy have largely stabilized, albeit at   historically lower levels than we would certainly like to see   It seems very likely now there will be positive, perhaps quite positive, growth in the   second half of this year As for 2010, more upside risk has crept into many people’s forecasts    So in thinking about our policies going forward, we may be at a point at which it is useful to   consider alternative outcomes in a roughly probabilistic fashion and to test how readily we can   craft the narrative that leads to each outcome  It would be a bit quixotic of me to undertake this   task for all seven of the Greenbook scenarios to which Larry alluded earlier, so let me distill the   manifold possibilities to just three  One, grind it out—a gradual, somewhat halting recovery that   leads to 2010 growth somewhere in the vicinity of trend but below what one might expect in a   rebound from a severe slump  Two, relapse—a significant stumble for the recovery next year,   with GDP growth again dropping significantly below trend  And, three, rejuvenation—a much   more robust recovery, with GDP growth significantly exceeding trend, not quite a V-shape   perhaps but a reasonably steep slope on the way up   So just to put my cards on the table, I would assign roughly even odds to the first possible   outcome, the grind-out scenario  Not coincidentally, I regard the Greenbook extended baseline   to be consistent with this outcome  Although I am somewhat less optimistic about next year than   the staff is, I note that their forecast for the second half of this year is pretty conservative  So if              August 11–12, 2009 67 of 165  one averages out their forecast over six quarters, it yields something akin to the first outcome    Of the remaining two, I see a somewhat greater chance of relapse than of rejuvenation, though I   should say that I now regard the odds of the two alternative outcomes as considerably less   skewed than I thought as recently as the June meeting  So clearly I find the story of measured   recovery the easiest to tell, in part because the very factors that augur well for the remainder of   2009 may not have sufficient staying power to maintain a healthy pace of recovery through all of   next year   The salutary effects of the fiscal stimulus package will start tapering off in the first part of   next year The undoubted need for firms to replenish their inventories will lead to sustained   production increases only if consumption increases can themselves be generated and maintained    The case for a steady increase in personal consumption expenditures is certainly plausible, but it   is hardly compelling According to the reported employment cost index, private wages and   salaries have been decelerating With large and still growing slack in labor markets, there is   good reason to believe that personal income will continue to suffer from rising unemployment   and suppressed wage gains Moreover, there remains, as Larry mentioned, the important   question of what saving rate we will see once incomes do begin to rise again  The Greenbook   makes a reasonable case based on past experience for a 4 percent rate, but the present crisis may   contain the seeds of a behavioral shift among some classes of consumers that could move the rate   up a percentage point or more   It appears that even the new normalcy in credit availability, both retail and wholesale,   may be some way off  The progress in the corporate bond markets, and to a lesser degree short-  term funding markets and plain vanilla securitization markets, has not extended to credit markets   more generally In particular, the rate of decline in bank lending has been accelerating during the              August 11–12, 2009 68 of 165  spring and summer  There will doubtless be multiple revisions to the July figures, but the   preliminary estimate of a whopping 18 percent decline spread across all forms of lending is a   sobering reminder of the difficulties ahead  While a considerable part of this drop is surely   attributable to the decline in demand and cautiousness in underwriting that are typical of   recessions, it seems likely that there are also structural factors in both bank lending and credit   markets, such as capital impairment and business model challenges, that will weigh on credit   markets for some time   I can certainly tell the other two stories—though with less conviction and, in the interest   of time, more briefly  A relapse could occur if privately generated demand cannot adequately fill   in behind the waning effect of fiscal stimulus, given such factors as the expected persistently   high levels of unemployment; the potential for more-rapid efforts to repair personal, corporate,   and financial balance sheets; and the severe retrenchment of sub-federal government spending   that is coming in the next two budget cycles  If commercial real estate markets turn out to be   even moderately worse than currently expected—bad enough—loan losses at many regional and   community banks could become truly debilitating     Rejuvenation might come if both confidence and wealth are significantly boosted by a   continuation of the equity market rally and a more rapid recovery of housing markets  The latter   of course would also prompt a greater rebound in construction  Along with the effects of pent-up   consumer demand for durables and other items, these developments could provide not just a   substitute for fiscal stimulus but a boost beyond the temporary effects of cash-for-clunkers,   infrastructure investment, and the various income transfer features of the February legislative   package Global economic recovery, particularly in Asia, may proceed more quickly with an   attendant boost to US export growth  While I can sketch out this more optimistic path, each of           August 11–12, 2009 69 of 165  its elements seems quite a bit less likely than those supporting the more sluggish outcome and   modestly less likely than the catalyst for relapse   I will be interested to hear if some of you can tell this last tale more convincingly  For   the present, though, what I think is most important in my little exercise is that the chances of next   year being somewhere between tepid and bad appear to me somewhere north of 75 percent in the   absence of further monetary or fiscal policy measures  Where exactly along that spectrum the   actual outcome falls will probably not become much clearer for some time  If this is a   reasonable way of looking at things, our best-advised posture for at least a few more, and maybe   more than a few more, meetings may be the somewhat unsatisfactory and awkward one of   neither lifting another implement out of our toolbox nor closing the box up and declaring the job   finished Mom was right at least sometimes  Patience really can be a virtue  [Laughter] Thank   you, Mr Chairman     I support alternative B (revised) for a lot of the reasons a lot of you   have stated to this point  "
8840,2009-09-22,TARULLO," Thank you, Mr Chairman  Brian, as you were discussing panels 27   and 28, you made reference to some lasting changes in some of the credit markets  Can you   specify a bit which you expect to be lasting and which you expect to continue to improve?   They’re not so much structural changes, though—you’re anticipating   that, as things continue to normalize, there won’t be some sort of a reversion to the way things   were before the crisis?   Okay Thanks   Thank you, Mr Chairman  Back in my accustomed spot at the end of   the queue, I thought the one criterion for deciding what to say might be to offer only my insights   that will add value to what has already been said  Mr Chairman, that concludes my statement    [Laughter]   Understanding, however, that another purpose of the go-round might be to explain each   member’s views to the Committee as a whole, let me note a few points that most inform my   outlook First, the employment situation continues to be dismal  Scan the monthly BLS release,   and the only demographic group whose unemployment rate looks less than disheartening is that   for college graduates at 47 percent A look behind even that figure gives little reason for   comfort, insofar as it stood at 27 percent just a year ago  Most of the rest of the numbers are   downright discouraging Of greater relevance, perhaps, for present purposes is the near   unanimity of forecasters that improvement in the labor market will be painfully slow  The most   optimistic alternative Greenbook scenario has the unemployment rate barely breaking 7 percent   at the end of 2011 A review of the latest Blue Chip economic indicators reveals that all but one   of the 50 forecasters believe the average unemployment rate in 2010 will come in above   9 percent To say that we are nowhere near achieving the maximum employment component of   our dual mandate would be a major understatement  The most that can fairly be said is that the   bottoming of negative employment trends may at some point soon be coming into view   Second, in looking back at my statement at the last meeting, I would have to amend my   view that GDP growth in the second half of 2009 will perhaps be quite positive to an expectation           September 22–23, 2009 123 of 212  that it will almost surely be quite positive with a good chance of being modestly above trend    But I see little to change my view of six weeks ago that 2010 is most likely to witness what I   termed the “grind it out” scenario, with economic growth ultimately above trend but nowhere   near the slope of recovery one might expect out of a deep recession     Indeed, there remains good reason to believe that one or more factors will keep the   economic road sufficiently rocky that we will have difficulty sustaining a good head of steam    Continuing high unemployment will impose a constraint on PCE growth  A higher personal   saving rate than the 4 percent, expected by the Greenbook to remain unchanged for the next two   years, would similarly drag down PCE growth  The fading of the stimulus package by the   middle of 2010 creates further uncertainty as to just how robust consumer demand will be and,   thus, how much production will grow once inventory drawdowns are completed  The prospect   of ongoing high levels of home foreclosures suggests that downward pressure on the housing   market may not fully abate for some time  Finally, the ongoing steep decline in bank lending,   like the continuing dysfunction in some other parts of credit markets, appears to reflect   something more than just the tightened lending standards associated with recessions   In the interest of completeness, I should note that prospects for a stronger global recovery   have brightened considerably, one of the factors I suggested that might support my rejuvenation   scenario here at home  Asia, in particular, seems to have generated enough momentum to outlast   the withdrawal of extraordinary stimulus Still, I would note that in China and most other East   Asian countries, we haven’t yet seen the emergence of a real promise of self-sustaining final   consumer demand   If some of the preceding sounds familiar, it should  I lifted a good bit of it from my   comments at the August FOMC The intervening month and a half has reinforced the positive              September 22–23, 2009 124 of 212  signs for the remainder of this year and, I would say, slightly rebalanced in a more optimistic   direction the respective probabilities of relapse, “grind it out,” or rejuvenation  But all three   remain plausible outcomes  In sum, I find myself singing much the same tune as last time, but   even as I reprise my coda, I want to alter it a bit, adding some lyrics suggested by President   Bullard’s remarks yesterday afternoon  And here I’m going to take advantage of my holding   down the sixteenth spot in the batting order to slide a little bit into relevant policy considerations    I stand by my August recommendation of patience during this period where the probabilities of   each of my three scenarios remain significant  The additional thought, picking up on President   Bullard’s comment, is that we should be prepared to undertake an appropriate policy response no   matter which of the three emerges as reality   As the rest of you will have quickly concluded, my own concern is specifically that we   not regard the possible conclusion of the current large-scale asset-purchase programs as in itself   raising the hurdle rate on future policy initiatives in the event that relapse seems to be occurring    It’s important in my view that we be clear on this point among ourselves and that we   communicate it to markets and the public  Thank you, Mr Chairman   Relapse   No, that’s not true  [Laughter]   Thank you, Mr Chairman  I can support alternative B, although, like   President Yellen, not without some reluctance  I have two difficulties with the language of   alternative B as drafted  In paragraph 1, although I think it does reflect accurately our sense of   the current trajectory of the economy, I don’t think it captures the level of uncertainty about what   may happen next year, and thus I would be substantially more comfortable with an explicit   indication of that uncertainty   With respect to paragraph 3, I think President Bullard captured the most important point   from my point of view, which is that the world should understand that we’re prepared to respond   as required by economic circumstances  I worry that there is a sense of finality that is projected     September 22–23, 2009 171 of 212  in the language as currently drafted, and I don’t think it turns on the “up to” language for the   reasons that Governor Warsh suggested  I think it turns more upon the way it’s stated and, to be   perfectly honest, upon a lot of external commentary which has begun to impute a certain finality   to us So whether through the mechanism that President Bullard suggested, or President   Rosengren suggested, or some other means, I would be substantially more comfortable with   alternative B if it states in more or less—and I say “more or less” given that we are a central   bank—explicit fashion that we are prepared to respond to changing economic conditions, so that   people do understand this is not final in the sense that, even if things begin to deteriorate next   year, we’re not going to think there’s a high hurdle rate because, after all, we ended that   program  Thank you, Mr Chairman   That is exactly my idea of it  People look at the deltas, I think   Yes I think it depends for me, ultimately, Mr Chairman, on what   other language might change  Were you to tell me that no other language was going to change   and I get to do “up to” or not, I would want it out   Yes, but I don’t get the sense that anybody else has any appetite for it,   so I don’t want to take people’s time up  After “Although economic activity is likely to remain   weak for a time,” I would have inserted, “and there remains considerable uncertainty as to future   economic performance, the Committee anticipates that…”   It’s the same point, I think, that you made before, which is that there is   language which has been in there for a while, but now we have cheered up the rest of the   paragraph Just as in paragraph 3, the language in the last sentence has been in there for a while,        September 22–23, 2009 183 of 212  but we’ve firmed up the rest of the paragraph  That’s why I was hoping for at least mildly   offsetting phraseology changes   Even I’m not interested in that  "
8868,2009-11-03,TARULLO," Thank you, Mr Chairman  Brian, in panel 19, you have plotted a   possible path for the tapering down of the MBS purchases  If that is the path that you indeed   follow, do you have some, even intuitive, sense of a point along that path at which you would   begin to feel relatively more confident that you weren’t going to see a significant effect on the   markets from the tapering off of our purchases?  I know that is tied up with the degree to which   this is a flow effect   Okay Thanks   Janet, I think your comment may have answered my question about   your first observation So you would favor a broad range of permanent swap facilities?                 November 3–4, 2009 52 of 201  So you are kind of for swaps but are leaning toward more rather than   fewer   Okay   Advance the runner   Thank you, Mr Chairman  First, let me say that I’ll be brief  Second, let   me say that I mean it  [Laughter]  I think little has changed on net since our last meeting, and this                               November 3–4, 2009 113 of 201  unremarkable story strikes me as itself unremarkable because the outlook for moderate growth in   the next few quarters has been relatively clear for a while  As to the second half of 2010 and   beyond, though, while the forecast of modestly to moderately above-trend growth remains   eminently plausible, there is considerable uncertainty  Factors such as the waning of stimulus   effects, the continued drag on consumption engendered by high unemployment, and the travails of   the commercial real estate market could well lead to a more sluggish pace of growth  On the other   hand, as I’ve said at each of the last couple of meetings, despite these significant downside risks, I   don’t discount entirely the possibility of a more rapid pace of recovery   Turning to price stability, the story is similar  substantial clarity for the near-to-medium   term with low levels of inflation and then more uncertainty thereafter  I have my doubts that an   unwelcome level of inflation could take hold in the absence of either a rapid acceleration in job   growth that got us at least within shouting distance of full employment or a big, exogenous shock in   the form of much higher commodity prices  But I acknowledge that the unusual characteristics of a   recession following a financial crisis and the consequent policy responses may make past   experience less than dispositive  And I would add that I am less convinced than I would like to be   that recent exchange rate developments are wholly benign  I think they bear watching   To conclude by referring to our statutory dual mandate, maximum employment is not   remotely in sight  Concerns about deflation have substantially receded, though they have not   disappeared entirely  Concerns about inflation seem at this point to be based more on anticipation   than on observation  But I’m happy to join others in continuing to keep watch  Thank you, Mr   Chairman                             November 3–4, 2009 114 of 201  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Like everybody, I think, I support the policy   actions set forth in alternative B  I do have some concerns about the language, specifically the   insertion of the “including” phrase at the beginning of paragraph 3  I didn’t have those concerns   when Brian circulated the language  I didn’t have those concerns after Brian explained to me why   the language is in there  But after this meeting, I do have them, [laughter] and let me explain why   First—this is a secondary point, but I will mention it—I am somewhat bemused by the   inflation expectations criterion  For a social scientist to put such weight on such a slippery metric,                               November 3–4, 2009 165 of 201  whose relationship to outcomes historically is, as I understand it, not particularly well established   empirically has just surprised me—something that I hadn’t focused on before being on the Board    That’s something that I look forward to hearing more about in the December meeting, when we   have a full presentation of the academic work behind inflation more generally   I understand that faith and intuition are important elements in economic policy making  So   in and of itself, that concern wouldn’t have moved me to speak  I guess where I do have a concern   is on the issue of what this phrase will communicate  This is going to be the news out of this   statement  Everything else is expected  Some of the things that some people expected to be in here   are not going to be in here, and therefore, this is going to be the only thing for people to focus on   To the extent that the “including” phrase is understood as a positive statement of the   principal factors that the 17 people around the table will be looking at over the coming meetings, I   think that would enhance communications, and I took it that that was the reason it was included in   the statement originally  But unlike Kevin, I didn’t find the 30 speeches a wholly positive and   productive development after the last FOMC meeting  My own sense from talking to a number of   market actors was that they thought that there was confusion within the Committee, which they   thought undermined within a very short period of time the FOMC statement itself  I don’t think it   was serious, and I think people kind of bounced back, and some of the sophisticated analysts did a   very nice job on our behalf of teasing out the points of agreement and putting them out to markets   more generally  But just having listened to the conversation, I am concerned that the release of this   statement with the “including” phrase will be quickly followed by a litigation of the meaning and   relative importance of each of these three items in a series of public statements, and when some   people start making the public statements, other people are going to be moved to make public   statements that kind of go a bit on the other side  Therefore, I am concerned that what began as a                  November 3–4, 2009 166 of 201  nicely stated, positive assertion of the principal factors that we all, some of us more than others, will   be looking at will fairly quickly devolve into a bit of cacophony   Now, it may be that markets will just look at who the speakers are and say, “Okay  Well,   this is nothing new from this person,” and so it won’t be that serious  But to the degree that what   we’re looking for in the next three, four, five, six meetings is the capacity to speak more or less with   one voice on how we plan to move ahead and eventually how we plan to exit, I fear that we’re   setting a not-terrific precedent for our capacity to do so  And so, Mr Chairman, although I certainly   wouldn’t even dream of opposing alternative B if you choose to keep the language in, I guess my   own preference would have been to hold this language until perhaps the December meeting, after   we’ve had a chance to talk about at least the inflation considerations in a bit more detail, in the   hopes that the positive statement at that time would reflect a greater level of consensus among the   seventeen of us  Thank you   Just to clarify or to restate what I said earlier, I agree with Bill Dudley    I think that, all things considered, sooner rather than later is actually better because you are not   locked in But the risk associated with the statement is not simply a function of the statement     November 3–4, 2009 173 of 201  itself on the day it is released And that was the point—we are in a position to minimize the   riskiness associated with the statement, and I would just urge everybody to bear that in mind,   particularly over the next 72 hours   This, again, seems to me to be pre-judging rather than to have a   criterion, which is, just to reiterate, what my concern is about this whole endeavor  "
8894,2009-12-15,TARULLO," Thank you, Mr Chairman  Brian, on panel 29, the orange line for   asset sales—that is understood by dealers to be sales and not just the runoff through maturation   of these securities?   All right I think you just answered my next question, which is  At   this juncture you’re not certain as to what the dealer views are on what our redemption default   position is?        December 15–16, 2009 14 of 247  Thank you   Thank you, Mr Chairman  Let me first say I know how pleased   everyone must be that we are getting through the go-round this afternoon so that we will have   plenty of time tomorrow for our special, though regrettably untelevised, version of “Who Wants   to Be an Inflation Fighter” [Laughter]  I have read the transcript   Developments since our previous meeting have obviously been positive, on balance,   though not uniformly so  The late-year improvement probably reduces somewhat further the   likelihood of what I have previously characterized as a relapse scenario  But even if this modest   trend continues through December, I don’t think a stronger than expected fourth quarter                 December 15–16, 2009 90 of 247  fundamentally changes the outlook for 2010  In this regard, there remains the important question   whether or, more precisely, how much self-sustaining demand will fill in behind the withdrawal   of stimulus over the course of next year  For the reasons many of us have rehearsed at previous   meetings, and that some of you have repeated this afternoon, the answer to this question is quite   uncertain   One area that unfortunately looks all too certain is unemployment  Even the most   optimistic of private forecasters believe that unemployment will remain at very elevated levels   throughout next year Quite apart from the social and longer-term economic damage that may be   effected by prolonged high unemployment, my intuition continues to be that a level of 9 or   10 percent places a significant limit on the growth of personal consumption expenditures unless   one expects that compensation levels will themselves rise steadily   Obviously then the contribution of wealth effects would be important for a sustained   acceleration in consumption, as, in fact, we see reflected in the forecasts of those who do   anticipate stronger PCE growth Here again, though, there is considerable uncertainty  Indeed, I   have noted that even those who sit together on the more optimistic end of the spectrum of   forecasts for 2010 disagree on whether housing or equities will be the key driver of rising wealth   As to housing, at least, while I can tell the story of reduced inventories, lower prices, and   less new home construction moving residential real estate eventually in a positive direction, I can   equally conceive of such factors as more foreclosures associated with unemployment and a   possible jump in mortgage rates associated with the end of our MBS purchases leading to   stagnant or even slightly declining home prices   To be fair, I should also note that some on the more pessimistic end of the 2010 spectrum   have been a bit undone by the revisions to 2009 data that revealed a higher saving rate than had        December 15–16, 2009 91 of 247  previously been assumed, thereby undermining the argument that saving will inevitably jump a   good deal next year with consequent negative effects on PCE   But this example makes my point as readily as the cloudiness around the more upbeat   commentaries We are still learning exactly how the different characteristics of a deep,   financially induced recession might confound expectations developed through experience with   each of the recessions in the last 60 years, whether mild, moderate, or severe  We will not have   the luxury of waiting to see all these differences unfold as we make our policy decisions  We   will necessarily be navigating in somewhat uncharted waters, but to this point, I believe we have   yet to see a credibly strong current flowing by us   My basic outlook is thus essentially unchanged from November, despite the noteworthy   developments since that time  Near-term prospects remain moderately positive, with the   important major qualification of employment  As to the second half of 2010 and beyond, a   forecast of incrementally to moderately above trend growth remains the best bet, but I continue   to see significant, though reduced, downside risks and growing, though still modest, upside risks   as well Thank you, Mr Chairman   Thank you, Mr Chairman  I think the nature of this discussion so far   has confirmed what I suspected coming into this meeting, which is that we’re right on the cusp of   starting to make hard decisions We’re not quite there yet, but everybody is positioning   themselves  And in that spirit, I want to position myself  [Laughter]  While supporting   alternative B, I want to draw a distinction between the substance of what I think we are doing        December 15–16, 2009 131 of 247  with the actions indicated in paragraphs 3 and 4 of alternative B and the way in which we’re   communicating it I have no problem with the first; I do have some concerns with the second     With respect to substance, I think what we are saying in paragraph 4 is that we had a   series of very special programs that were addressing blockages in credit markets that were   instituted over the last year or so  The unusual blockages and the large dysfunctionality in credit   markets has substantially, though not totally, abated  And under these circumstances we are   winding down most, and eventually all, of these programs  Second, I think we’re saying that   we’re wrapping up the large-scale asset purchases that we announced in March  Third, we’re   continuing, obviously, the zero interest rate policy  And, fourth, we haven’t made any decisions   on exit as of yet So I’m fine with all of those   On the language, I think paragraph 1 captures well the consensus around the table with   the Richard-Don amendment, which I think would be very useful  Let me jump to paragraph 4,   because I think paragraph 4 does have the potential to surprise markets  I don’t think the actions   themselves will surprise markets—I think this is what’s anticipated  But the fact of including it   in this statement, as Sandy suggested a few minutes ago, may be a surprise and will begin to, or   could begin to, elicit a lot of speculation as to whether this is, in fact, the beginning of a staged,   already planned exit As all of you know, the amount of speculation among market actors as to   what the exit plan is, with dates and quantities, is very high right now  So the last sentence, as   Kevin and others have suggested, ought to be taken seriously by us, and not be considered as   boilerplate I have to say, on the merits I’m quite comfortable with the winding down as   anticipated, with the possible exception of CMBS   That brings me to paragraph 3  When Brian Madigan sent around the language last week,   I looked at it and, for the reasons I have already indicated, I was a little uncomfortable, but I felt        December 15–16, 2009 132 of 247  that it was okay I thought that the last sentence of paragraph 3 was on the verge of being   anachronistic, but wasn’t quite there, so that it could await the January meeting  Brian Sack’s   informative and admirably forthright briefing yesterday injected some doubt into my mind about   that, because of the anticipated runoff issue Again, it’s not that the anticipated runoff seemed   ill-advised as a substantive matter, but I do have some concern about what’s being   communicated by allowing those runoffs to happen  Will there now be a firm view in the   markets that we are just going to let these things run off, notwithstanding what may happen in   the future? If there’s a fair chance that that will be the inference drawn, then we would be faced,   if conditions deteriorate in the future, with a decision that would be regarded as a significant   change in policy, a switching on and off of the lights as it were, rather than turning the dimmer   switch a little bit in one direction or another  For that reason, I was actually somewhat attracted   by Narayana’s suggestion   Even though, obviously, our policy inclinations are probably different,   I took Narayana’s suggestion to be a kind of general statement of the Bullard doctrine, which Jim   patiently repeats every six or seven weeks in this room—[laughter]—about the need for   flexibility depending on circumstances  I think that, while I could live with waiting one more   month or six or seven weeks, to change that last sentence of paragraph 3, I have to confess to   some uneasiness as to what we’re projecting to markets in staying with this sentence, given the   way I think that paragraph 4 and the slight changes of wording in paragraph 3 will be   understood   One final point—to Jeff’s point on MBS—I have two reactions to that  One, for reasons   many people stated in the go-round yesterday, mortgage rates and residential housing could still        December 15–16, 2009 133 of 247  be key to the path of recovery next year, and thus may be important to affect or to observe the   effects of one way or the other But, secondly, in the absence of conventional monetary policy   easing possibilities, because of the zero bound, we found in March we had two choices  We had   the agency MBS, basically, and then we had Treasuries  And Treasuries raise a whole different   set of concerns about the possible interaction with fiscal policy and maybe even foreign   exchange policy that I think a lot of people around the table wanted to avoid  So I think it’s not   just about the mortgage credit markets, even though to some degree it is about mortgage credit   markets Thank you, Mr Chairman   Richard suggests a parenthetical saying this is not boilerplate, this is—                 December 15–16, 2009 141 of 247 "
8925,2010-01-26,TARULLO,"  So moved    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I appreciate that you all are having to   operate based more on analysis and thought experiment than on experience with all of this, so   you may not be able to shed much light on this question  But I wonder to what degree you think   the efficacy of, and the risks associated with, each of these tools and strategies would vary   depending on the conditions in which we began to undertake the strategy  So, for example, if we   began during a period in which there was a noninflationary, even disinflationary, environment as   opposed to one in which we were beginning to feel inflationary pressures, or an environment in   which there was a lot of strain within the mortgage markets or not  As best you can tell, is the   sequencing and optimality of various tools more or less independent of the particular conditions   and the particular sources of concern that might be motivating us to start the exit?    One presumes that those are not the conditions under which we would   start to exit   January 26–27, 2010 44 of 260     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I think I have Kevin’s criteria and Don’s   conclusions  Let me try to explain why that is where I believe I am, stipulating, as did Dennis,   that this is a preliminary discussion from which I assume all of our views will evolve  The two   criteria that I find I have uppermost in mind with respect to all of these issues are, first,   credibility, and second, my substantive concern about cutting off too soon what is still a halting   and potentially fragile recovery   With respect to credibility, I think there are two subcomponents—one of which many of   you have mentioned, quite rightly—communication  At the risk of a somewhat unpleasant   metaphor, I think we need to let the markets, the newspapers, and everybody else masticate,   digest, and regurgitate what it is that we are doing so that they are not in a position of constantly   speculating, does this little action here mean the following or does it not?  But there is a second   part of credibility, which is that we need to be effective and be perceived as effective when we   act  There are a lot of uncertainties here  Many of you have articulately explained how many   uncertainties there are  But I don’t think we can afford to be seen as doing too much on-the-job   training, even in these unusual circumstances, because if we go out there with a proposed course   of action and then two meetings later say, “Well, it’s not quite working out the way we thought,   and we are going to dial it a little in the other direction,” regardless of the short-term wisdom of   that move, I think we will have lost an enormous amount   January 26–27, 2010 87 of 260    With respect to cutting off the recovery, I think this is just probably a different   substantive analytic and policy predisposition that divides us somewhat  But my sense, as we   will discuss tomorrow, is that the recovery is less well entrenched than probably some of you   believe  With respect to our balance sheet, though, whatever the merits of getting into this   position, we are in it now  We have these assets, and unlike Jeff, I think that, although I know   that countless bytes will be put onto disks in the future analyzing these programs, there was an   effect and it was a fairly significant effect on mortgage markets and long-term interest rates   generally  And I am concerned about any move—such as significant asset sales—early on that   might plausibly lead to a significant disruption of those markets   So implications for just a couple of areas  On the discount rate issue, I am kind of with   everybody on the general point  But I want to emphasize something that Charlie Plosser and   Betsy said, which is, notwithstanding what I think is Kevin’s quite correct caution that we are   never going to get everybody to separate liquidity policy and interest rate policy entirely, we   ought to try by doing what Charlie suggested—which is to say, let’s wrap up everything that we   think is liquidity ASAP, and let’s get our public communication strategy such as to say that is   what we are doing  The discount rate move is tied to the TAF, which is tied to the rundown of   the TALF facilities, and that’s basically what we are about  And if we repeat it enough, we’ll   achieve that first end, I hope, of making people really understand  It has for me the side benefit   of taking away the notion that we have to feed the beast and do something every meeting, which   appears to be walking backwards  You know, I don’t think we want to get ourselves in the mode   where we have to throw a maiden over the cliff to the dragon at every FOMC meeting    [Laughter]   January 26–27, 2010 88 of 260    So, then, what about the longer-term exit strategy issues?  Well, as I said, I find myself   most in agreement with Don, not because I had those views when I came in—I had sort of   inchoate views—but Don convinced me in just what he was saying a few moments ago  But I   want to cast it slightly differently, with Kevin’s criteria in mind  I am worried about cutting off   the recovery prematurely, and that is why, as Don said, I don’t want us to move until we are   really ready to move and we really want tightening to take place, keeping in mind what Kevin   and I would harp on, which is the credibility of our actions  When we move, we have to be   really sure that we are seen as having an effect and that the tightening is palpable, and people   aren’t sitting there saying, “Geez, you know, they have all these assets and reserves floating   around and they’re not having the effect that they want”  So that is Don’s sequencing of some   pre-move, but close to the moment  Draining plus the move plus asset sales intended shortly   thereafter seems to me to use multiple instruments and thereby maximize the chance that we will   have an effect  But with my own caution, I really want to wait until I am convinced that we are   not putting the recovery at risk  My sense is that, when we get to that point, we want to move   quite robustly using these multiple instruments  Thank you, Mr Chairman     830, but you have to be brief, Richard  [Laughter]    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I realized as all of you were speaking this   morning that, after a year here, I’ve come to regard the FOMC as a bit like a big extended family   in which each member finds a niche at its periodic gatherings  So, for example, as you just   heard, Governor Duke frequently provides extensive insight into the state of the banking sector    President Yellen has found a role in giving us careful and illuminating expositions of important   analytic issues  My role, on the other hand, it appears, is to create metaphors  [Laughter]  So   here we go   The data we have seen since our last meeting suggest that the basic story line in the   economy hasn’t changed  Expectations of recovery have taken firmer hold, and forecasts for   2010 of modestly above-trend growth with little prospect of unwanted inflation seem on track    But if the basic story line hasn’t changed, neither have the subplots  First, December’s   unexpected drop in nonfarm payrolls may, as some have suggested, reflect some weather-related   and administrative anomalies, but it may also support the kind of anecdotal reports to which   President Evans was alluding of extraordinary cautiousness in hiring by many employers that   January 26–27, 2010 160 of 260    will likely persist for some undetermined length of time  And I think this is also supported by   concerns about financial encumbrances to new business creation  Second, continuing declines in   bank lending remind us that CRE problems and impaired credit availability for consumers,   nonconforming residential mortgages, and smaller businesses will continue to hinder recovery    Third, significant imponderables remain on the economic horizon, including the impact of   cessation of RMBS purchases and later this year of waning stimulus effects  Finally, the atypical   etiology of the recently ended recession and of monetary and fiscal policy responses to it counsel   particular alertness on our part for unanticipated and potentially rapidly developing trends,   particularly in financial markets   Not only has there been little or no change since our last meeting, I also would expect the   narrative to be pretty consistent through at least the next couple of meetings  After that, I   anticipate that the effect of some of the just-noted imponderables will begin to exert considerable   influence on economic performance, for better or for worse and in a way that I now find difficult   to predict  I also harbor an uneasy suspicion that both the run-up to the midterm elections, as   Kevin was describing, and some potentially unpleasant geopolitical developments may introduce   additional uncertainty into economic and financial markets, further clouding prospects for the   latter part of the year   In sum, despite reasonably clear prospects for moderately above-trend growth for the first   half of calendar 2010, my uncertainty about the third and fourth quarters and beyond has not   declined nearly as much from the middle of last year as I might have anticipated  The economic   narrative is, thus, less like a Hemingway tale, moving crisply toward its conclusion, and more   like a serialized Dickens novel, sprawling and complex and in which you know there are going   January 26–27, 2010 161 of 260    to be surprising developments in later installments, but you’ll still be surprised when they occur   Thank you, Mr Chairman      You have the right words, but the wrong data  [Laughter]   January 26–27, 2010 181 of 260     Thank you, Mr Chairman  As I intimated yesterday, I see our exit   strategy as composed of three phases, at least two of which overlap  One is ending the special   liquidity programs that we have  Two is preparing, and including good communication of, a   strategy for tightening  And the third is the tightening itself  And I do think there’s an important   distinction between two and three   I am bemused, I must say, at the certainty of some of the people around the table as to the   robustness and pace of a recovery, particularly given a lot of the uncertainties that the Chairman   noted in his summation  My view, again, as expressed yesterday, is a concern that a signaling of   tightening and a response in markets could unnecessarily choke off what is still an uneven and   somewhat fragile recovery  At the same time, my inclination, which has only been strengthened   during this FOMC meeting, is that when the time for tightening comes, it is probably going to   have to be multi-tool and it may well have to be pretty muscular in order to achieve the efficacy   that we are going to be looking for   The public and markets are looking much more at changes in the language that we have   than in how new language might be read on its own in isolation  So that makes me, like a   number of others of you, disinclined toward any changes that might appear to be signaling a   moving from phase 2 to phase 3  So I guess I’m not looking to indicate that we are gradually   moving toward the exit if that means tightening  And it’s for that reason that I endorsed Charlie   Plosser’s idea yesterday of just ending the liquidity programs as quickly as we can  Let’s say we   have done it, and we have completed that phase   For all of these reasons, I favor alternative B, both the action and most of the language  I   favor inclusion of the language that Bill English suggested on the TAF because I think that it   pursues Charlie’s goal of wrapping all of this up  But I oppose the substitution of “holdings” for   January 26–27, 2010 198 of 260    “purchases,” not because it’s not potentially a useful way to begin changing the language  I   think Narayana proposes it with the intention of ongoing neutrality  I don’t think that’s the way   it’s going to be read by markets right now  They are just going to invest it with way more   significance than most of us at least would intend  And on the inflation language, I defer to you,   Mr Chairman  "
8948,2010-03-16,TARULLO,"  Some of us will, Mr Kohn    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Let me try to do this in the form of bullet   points, with staccato delivery where possible  [Laughter]  First point—overall assessment    unchanged  We have a reasonably well-grounded recovery, but it’s still halting and there seems   little prospect that it’s going to strengthen any time soon   March 16, 2010 77 of 146    With that in mind and with little else to say, let me go to three contextual points  Point   two—most important uncertainty  jobs and job creation, not just because it is an explicit   statutory responsibility of this Committee to promote maximum employment, but also,   obviously, because any recovery in self-sustaining demand is going to depend on personal   consumption expenditures, which, I think, ultimately will depend on job creation  While it is   true that the deceleration of job losses and the levels of temporary hiring continue to give reason   to hope that significant net job creation is just around the corner, we’ve been looking around that   corner for a little while, and, as David pointed out in his presentation, this is a phenomenon still   more anticipated than actualized   Third point—vulnerabilities of the economy  Here I’m a little bit more balanced  I agree   with Bill and Kevin that the fiscal vulnerability is probably increasing a little bit, in the sense that   there’s potential market reaction to fiscal situations—almost a demonstration effect in Europe   may be coming over here a bit   Having said that, though, I thought it was mildly reassuring, both with respect to the   Dubai situation last year and the immediate reactions to the Greek situation this year, that   financial markets overall were not particularly thrown off stride  For example, CDS spreads are   still up, so it’s not as if all of that has just been absorbed  But, it didn’t feel as though the   markets were so on edge that anything was going to throw them off   I would also mention on the upside something that has been less remarked  The edginess   I felt about foreign exchange markets for a time last fall has actually diminished in response not   only to some of the international stresses, but also to increased confidence in US recovery  The   strengthening of the US dollar has, I think, removed the concerns that some were beginning to   feel about whether foreign exchange markets could themselves be a source of instability    March 16, 2010 78 of 146    Ironically, of course, that’s likely to provide something of a drag on our exports and thus   economic performance going forward, but in a vulnerabilities analysis, it’s probably not a bad   thing  And finally, as Don mentioned, the withdrawal of liquidity facilities and the change and   normalization of discount rate policy raised issues only about whether we were moving towards   an increase in the federal funds rate, and I think that also was a confirmation that there is   substantially more financial stability now   Point four—new worries  We always have to have new worries  Like many of you, I’ve   heard a lot of caution from some market participants about incipient asset price bubbles   developing in this lengthy period of zero interest rate policy  I think there’s little doubt but that a   search for yield has been on for some time, particularly since equity markets in the US leveled   out towards the end of last year  Having said that and after having made some inquiries and   looked at some data, I don’t see much evidence of asset bubbles at present  It’s a little harder to   tell if the very low interest rates over this period have increased leverage in some asset markets   to levels that could suggest that we’re going to have bubbles at some time in the foreseeable   future, but, based on some very helpful analysis from Board staff and from staff in the New York   Fed’s Markets Group, it doesn’t appear at present that there are any obvious suspects  We’ll   obviously want to watch this going forward, because I think the distinction between, on the one   hand, a return to normal levels of risk and leverage and, on the other, a potentially unhealthy   buildup of leverage in some asset classes may not be so clear  We should surely be monitoring   behavior and experience of our regulated institutions with this issue in mind   In sum, lots of slack, lots of unemployment, no evidence of inflation, and little evidence   of incipient asset bubbles  While I can tell the story of how some of these conditions could turn   March 16, 2010 79 of 146    reasonably quickly, I don’t see any evidence yet that this has happened  Thank you, Mr   Chairman    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Let me say first that I noticed in Vice   Chairman Dudley’s handout in the lower left-hand corner there is a Federal Reserve Bank of   New York Blackbook  Now, I have also noticed that the motor vehicles of the Federal Reserve   Bank of New York are black, and this has led me to wonder what color the aircraft of the Federal   Reserve Bank of New York are—[laughter]   Coming back to the monetary policy statements, I think the most important thing for us   today is once again to remind ourselves that, by and large, markets and Fed watchers do not read   our language; they read changes in our language  So, for me, every change in the language has   to meet a fairly high hurdle rate, because it’s going to be interpreted and likely over-interpreted    That leads me to question, in the context of my self-evident support for alternative B, what, if   anything, do I want to change in communicating in March as opposed to January?  And I think   my answer is  Not much   I am concerned that there’s a bit of a drumbeat out there now, as if we’re moving down a   road towards tightening, a drumbeat which I think we have inadvertently amplified a bit, because   we’ve been changing our statement so much—we’ve been closing the liquidity facilities, we’ve   been doing a lot of things lately—all of which is, I think, the right thing to have done  But, to   March 16, 2010 115 of 146    switch metaphors, as I said last time, we can’t get ourselves into a circumstance in which we   have to throw a maiden over the cliff at every FOMC meeting  And I think this is a meeting   where everybody should live  [Laughter]  And that implies we can just stay calm and indicate   that not much has changed, things are going as we anticipated, and we are not moving towards a   tightening  I didn’t hear any real arguments, other than a kind of intellectual predisposition for   tightening, and I certainly didn’t hear any data-driven arguments for tightening   In terms of the language, the bracketed language, again, clearly seems a sensible   sentence  But I just worry about how it would be interpreted, given that it would be a delta  So   I’m not in favor of that  I’m certainly not in favor of including anything about a road map for   exit, and I will say in advance that I’m not sure I’m going to be in favor of that next time around   either, because of the drumbeat phenomenon, where people are going to think, “Okay, now   they’re just moving down that road”  I have no problem with the additional sentence at the end   of paragraph 3   That brings me to “extended period,” and it actually brings me to the concept of what Jim   calls state-contingent and Charlie refers to as a reaction function  I’m genuinely sympathetic to   the notion that we want to communicate that our actions are going to be dependent on what’s   happening in the economy going forward  I wish we were in a position to do that today by   removing “extended period,” but we are not  If you were to remove “extended period,” you have   raised interest rates  I don’t think there are any two ways around that, and we’ve moved   ourselves into a bit of a corner on this  I think some of us have kind of reinforced the assumption   out in markets that the day we remove “extended period” the clock begins to tick, and the federal   funds rate goes up two or three meetings thereafter   March 16, 2010 116 of 146    So, like Betsy, I think the best outcome might be one in which the market understanding   of what that language means changes  It changes from the sense that it’s the early warning   signal, with a date more or less certain of an interest rate rise, to an understanding that extended   period meant that, beginning over a year ago, we were in a period in which things were   obviously so bad that absent quite extraordinary and unanticipated changes in the foreseeable   future, the monetary policy was not going to shift   I think many of us are now in a mode where, although we’re likely to have interest rates   remaining low still for quite some time, we are more data-driven, and we are wanting to be more   sensitive to data coming in  But that’s not what the “extended period” language or its removal   would communicate  So if people want to do something about that language, and want to do it   with a credible assertion that it is not de facto an increase in interest rates, I think we’re going to   have to change the public perception of what it means  To do that, it’s going to take a lot of   cooperation and a lot of self-discipline among the seventeen members of the Open Market   Committee  I hope we might be able to achieve that, but, to be perfectly honest, recent history is   not particularly cause for optimism on those grounds  So I’m for B, without the brackets,   everything else is okay, although I’d be happy to incorporate President Bullard’s suggestion for   the addition of the “reluctance to hire” in paragraph 1  "
8972,2010-04-27,TARULLO,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Let me start briefly with my premises    First, I don’t want to tighten monetary policy right now  Second, I agree with President   April 27–28, 2010 54 of 206                   Rosengren’s point that the size and composition of the balance sheet is not an end in itself, but a   means to achieving the ends specified by the Congress in our dual mandate  Third, in general I   prefer maintaining our ability to adjust policy to the conditions as we find them  But, fourth, I   think there is some guidance needed in markets, specifically with respect to the question of asset   sales  That’s the thing that I find that people have asked about the most, substantially more than   interest on excess balances or term deposits or anything else   Which considerations have most affected me of these that I’ve heard from you today and   from staff and others in the days leading up to this meeting?  One is that it’s a bit hard for me to   see how anything but really quite substantial asset sales before a change in our target could   actually do very much to sop up some of that soggy bottom that we may be looking at when we   want to increase the target rate  There is uncertainty, obviously, about what reactions will be,   what the perceived signaling effect of our beginning to sell assets will be  So even though I   think people have done a good job of trying to project what those reactions will be, we don’t   have any history on the basis of which to extrapolate   Next, as several people have pointed out, we would be in a very uncomfortable position if   we wanted to reverse sales, if we thought, “Oops, we made some sales, turns out that that was a   little bit premature, and now we want to go back”  I think that the hurdle for that kind of reversal   would be considered quite high by everybody around the table   Next, though, is sort of the converse of that  Once we are in a mode in which we want to   tighten, I think that we should contemplate the possibility that we might sell assets fairly quickly   or sell a lot of assets fairly quickly, depending on the circumstances as we find them  That is to   say, if we are in a mode in which we have decided that tightening is warranted, we’ll presumably   have made the judgment that markets can sustain the tightening without pushing the economy in   April 27–28, 2010 55 of 206                   an unfavorable direction, and where, obviously, by definition, we’re not worried about either   signaling or actually tightening  So, if a situation such as President Plosser contemplates were to   be realized, I think that we, in turn, should contemplate moving in parallel with both policy tools   as quickly as might be needed   Where does this all leave me?  Well, it leaves me wanting a fairly parsimonious decision,   because obviously some of my premises are actually or potentially in conflict with one another    And that leads me to—[laughter]—that’s the nature of policymaking, President Yellen, in   addition to saying “so moved”  I’m not uncomfortable with needing to balance those   considerations, but they lead me to a parsimonious option 2, because what I hope that we can do   coming out of this meeting is to signal with some clarity that asset sales will not begin until we   have specified an increase in the target rate, and, in line with what Kevin was saying earlier, to   indicate that we’re prepared to move forward with a plan at that point, which would be   reasonably predictable and from which we could deviate if unusual circumstances dictated that   we do so  But I don’t think, at this moment, that we either need to or should decide, for example,   whether some variant on option 3 or option 4 is the right way to go, once we do make the   decision to begin selling those assets   On redemption of Treasuries, I guess at this juncture I’m opposed for the reason that   President Lacker stated  I think it’s best to bind these decisions up together when the time comes   to make them  And, as I’ve already intimated, my preferred mode of communication would not   be in the statement, certainly not this statement, because, again, I think that leads us towards   tightening  Obviously, the minutes will speak for themselves  But I would hope that we would   collectively equip the Chairman to be able to speak with the confidence that the whole FOMC is   April 27–28, 2010 56 of 206                   behind him on the elements of this consensus that we are able to reach, understanding that there   will be some elements of our decision that will need to await a future meeting  Thank you    Thank you, Mr Chairman  The factors relevant to the economic   outlook that are of particular importance to me have been expressed well around the table   already  The recovery is now better grounded, though judging by the package of our forecasts   presented by Brian yesterday, everyone agrees that, considering the severity of the recession, the   recovery will likely continue at no more than a moderate pace  During the intermeeting period,   the strength of personal consumption expenditures was a particularly pleasant surprise, though,   as has already been noted, there is some question as to how sustainable that strength is  Another   significant uncertainty is the pace of the housing recovery  The good number on housing starts   began from a very low baseline, and signs of firmness may be offset to some degree by inventory   pressures resulting from increased foreclosures  Since our last meeting, inflation has, if   anything, become more subdued   I join with all of those who find the biggest new threat to come from the Greek situation   and potential contagion effects in Europe and possibly elsewhere  A couple of months ago, it   was reassuring that markets reacted to the Greek problems with relative equanimity, but,   unfortunately, the lessons that some of us learned the hard way in 1997 have not been   internalized in the rest of the world  The risk now is that, in the face of prolonged inaction,   markets will scrutinize and test countries in roughly similar circumstances even if a fairly robust   assistance package for Greece is eventually approved  As of this moment, CDS spreads for   sovereign debt outside the euro zone are generally lower than they were at the beginning of the   year  That may seem reassuring, but it’s worth recalling that Russian bond spreads didn’t move   much in the late summer of 1997   I want to direct my remaining comments to the issue of employment or, more precisely,   unemployment  As Michael Elsby and his colleagues concluded in their paper for the March   April 27–28, 2010 128 of 206                   Brookings panel, there is little doubt that the present downturn is the deepest postwar recession   from the perspective of the labor market  In one sense, the recent recession followed the typical   pattern of disproportionately affecting less-educated workers and racial minorities  The   unemployment rate of high-school dropouts over the age of 25 shot up 79 percentage points   from early 2007 to what we hope was its peak of 156 percent in February of this year    Similarly, teenage unemployment rose nearly 10 percentage points   But another perspective reveals just how broad-based the impact on the labor market was    If we look at percentage increases in unemployment rates, we note an interesting fact  For each   category of more-educated workers over age 25—those with high-school diplomas, those with   associate degrees or some college, and those with college degrees or post-baccalaureate   degrees—the percentage increases in unemployment rates rose by a factor of between 24 and   25  So, for example, the unemployment rate for workers over 25 with high-school diplomas but   no college rose from 47 percent in January 2008 to a peak of 112 percent last October  Of   course, the unemployment rates for the especially vulnerable went up by more percentage points   from already higher levels, but the increase in the ranks of the unemployed within those   demographic groups was by a factor of between 16 and 20 as opposed to 24 to 25   I rehearse these selective statistics only to emphasize the point that there is a lot of slack   in virtually every segment of our labor market, including among the better-educated—and, as a   group, presumably more adaptable—workers  Moreover, for all the talk of upturns in   employment prospects, we are still not very far from the bottom  We have barely begun to have   net job growth  Anecdotal information about hiring plans is better than it has been, to be sure,   but it continues to reflect cautiousness  The growth in temporary employment in the first quarter   may well presage a near-term stream of permanent hiring, but, in some past recessions, such   April 27–28, 2010 129 of 206                   effects have lagged by up to a year  The very magnitude, speed, and scope of layoffs during the   recession have led some to ask whether structural unemployment has increased significantly,   particularly in light of expectations that a good portion of the layoffs came from industries that   either were associated with the housing bubble or in which employment is in apparently secular   decline  This question, of course, is a way of asking whether significant increases in   employment will be inflationary, or, at least, whether they will become inflationary at an earlier   stage of the recovery than might be expected if the historic relationship between output growth   and employment growth had not broken down in the second half of 2009   The recent nonpredictive nature of Okun’s law may well be transient, an artifact of an   unexpectedly high leap in productivity during the depths of the recession that probably will not   be replicated in the coming quarters  Moreover, there are few concrete signs that structural   unemployment has, in fact, increased substantially  There is actually a little data pointing in the   other direction  The Elsby paper to which I referred earlier drives the admittedly provisional   conclusion that, at least to date, workers who lost their jobs in declining economic sectors have   exited from unemployment at about the same rate as workers as a whole  Ultimately, of course,   it’s too early to say whether Okun’s law has just been violated or actually amended and thus,   among other things, how much structural unemployment may have increased  But even if we   stipulate that the NAIRU has gone up by a full percentage point, double the Greenbook estimate,   there would still be a big difference between the NAIRU and current unemployment levels   In the end, the degree to which structural unemployment rises may depend as much on   policy as on levels of job-worker mismatch  The specter of large numbers of workers remaining   unemployed for long periods surely does loom as a possibility and with it the likelihood of skill   erosion and increased aversion to those workers by potential employers  If policy continues to   April 27–28, 2010 130 of 206                   support aggregate demand growth and the availability of credit for new and growing businesses,   the severity of both short- and longer-term unemployment problems can be limited  If not, we   may experience elevated unemployment levels for some time to come with consequent negative   effects on potential economic growth and on fiscal conditions  Thank you, Mr Chairman    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I favor alternative B with the language in   paragraphs 1, 2, 3 and 5 precisely as they are  I continue to be sympathetic to President   Bullard’s desire both to do policy in a more state-contingent fashion and to say so, but I agree   with President Evans that the interpretation of any such move in that direction now is likely to be   wrongly interpreted by the markets   I’m against inclusion of anything from alternatives A, B, or C in paragraph 4  For   reasons some of you have said, I think we’re not at a point where it is useful to communicate   such consensus as there is in the Delphic tones that the FOMC statements take  So, for the   present, a rich description in the minutes plus, again, I hope, the opportunity for the Chairman to   April 27–28, 2010 166 of 206                   speak to these issues with the assurance of being backed up by the Committee is probably the   best way to go until June  Thank you    I’m with Vice Chairman Dudley    Mr Chairman    Is it possible that Governor Kohn would say a few words for posterity?     Just a few more   "
8996,2010-05-09,TARULLO,"  Jeff, there are two things I’d say  One, while Don has given the   aggregate statistics, my impression is that some of the institutions have made a good deal more   progress than others in changing their maturity structures, so the problems are acute in some of   the European institutions and significant but less acute in others   With respect to your question about whether to use this opportunity for lecturing them on   the need to make more progress, my instinct would be that, at this juncture, right when we’re   activating the swap lines, it’s probably not the moment to say that and to kind of offer a quid pro   quo, namely, that we want you to do more  But I do think that, as we go back to Basel on both   capital and liquidity reforms, this is going to strengthen our hand for making some of the   arguments we want to make    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Actually, I managed to get my comments   in in response to some of the questions  Just to rehearse a bit of what we discussed on Friday   afternoon, to this point we haven’t seen an impact in our financial system of any substantial   magnitude  But, as everybody recalls, such an impact isn’t seen until the moment it occurs   None of us is happy with where we are  I think I would have done things differently   from the Europeans three months ago  I would have done things differently from the Europeans   two months ago  And I probably would have done things differently two weeks ago  But we’re   in this position now, and, although optimally we could use the contribution of the swaps as a way   to leverage a better package from Ecofin, I just don’t see that as a realistic possibility right now    There will likely be a lot of unpleasantness in markets tomorrow no matter what all this looks   like, and I don’t think we are in a position to calibrate whether it would be better to wait one day,   two days, three days, or four days  I think it’s something that we’re just going to have to make a   judgment on  To the degree that we can stop this unpleasant spiral from getting going with any   more speed than it will already assume tomorrow, I think that a reestablishment of swap lines is   probably the best thing we can do for our own financial system  Therefore, I would support the   May 9, 2010 29 of 42             Chairman’s request that we give him authority to activate the swap lines at such time as he   deems prudent  "
9022,2010-06-22,TARULLO,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I understand Tom Hoenig’s position,   which is very straightforward and consistent with what Tom has said before, namely, that he’d   like to begin to reduce the size of the balance sheet  That’s why, when presented with Brian’s   issue, he responds accordingly  But I’m, maybe not bemused, but a bit interested in, Charlie and   Jeff, how you are parsing this  On the one hand, you say, “Couldn’t we explain it in a purely   technical fashion?”  On the other hand—this may be the equivalent of taking judicial notice—  I’m aware of your views on asset sales as well  So I’m wondering  Aren’t you, in all honesty,   sort of motivated by some of the same things that are motivating Tom?  And if that’s true, isn’t   this saying, “Well, couldn’t we convince people that it’s really technical?” even though it may   not be the sole motivation that we would have for doing it?    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I was looking for one of what is now a   fleeting number of opportunities just to agree with everything that Don says  The problem is   that, he said so many wise things, I can’t remember them all, so I’m going to have to go one by   one, but I think I agree with virtually everything that he said   I would just add one thought  Classic risk–reward calculus suggests to me that now is not   the time to be taking any action on asset sales or anything that looks unusual to the markets at all    I am mindful of what Kevin said and agree with him that we should be prepared as a Committee   and through the voice of the Chairman to lead market expectations rather than just feel as though   we’re slaves to those expectations, but I guess I would say, Kevin, that I don’t think this is one of   those moments for two reasons  First, with the deterioration of real economic conditions and the   big potential problems in Europe, it seems to me that markets are likely to regard as particularly   curious and perplexing any indication of a shift in policy by the Committee right now  Second,   the Chairman doesn’t testify until the third week in July  We’re just barely into the fourth week   June 22–23, 2010 52 of 213             of June right now, and a lot can change between now and then  So I would be inclined, as   Dennis said, to stand pat across the board   With respect to asset sales, what Jim and Kevin have said is something that we may want   to think about at some point in the future, although my default position is still the majority one   that the Chairman read   With respect to the Treasuries, I’m with a substantial majority of the Committee, in that   option 2 strikes me as the right one eventually  But, for the reasons I just stated, now is not the   moment  I guess this next point is almost anticlimactic, but in light of all of that, I obviously   endorse the proposal that Brian made on the swaps  Thank you    The refrigerator’s not cold but it’s gelling    Particularly when it’s not teal    A surplus of one    Thank you  For me, the intermeeting period has largely been a tale of   the tail  A look at real economic data suggests some slowing, though not a sharp break with the   pattern of recovery whose pace continues to be limited by the housing problems and balance   sheet repairs that are the legacy of the financial crisis  But as many of you have already   suggested, a glance at financial indicators and conversations with market participants tell a   different story, one of sharply renewed vulnerabilities and an associated flight to quality arising   directly from the debt problems of the euro zone periphery and, more generally, from the long-  term fiscal predicaments of many in the group of countries that we’ve traditionally called the   advanced economies   Nonfinancial data over the last seven weeks are largely consistent with what has become   a reasonably well established but not particularly robust recovery  As noted in the staff briefing,   consumer spending, manufacturing, and investment in equipment and software remain solid  But   other indicators are not so favorable, and it seems less clear that self-sustaining economic   activity will fully replace the waning effects of stimulus and inventory replenishment  As   evidenced by releases of the last two mornings, housing captures the broader picture well, both   in that we do not see a run of more than a few good data points before less encouraging reports   appear and in that there has been less good news lately   With respect to employment, there is, to be sure, still some reason to be hopeful about the   jobs picture, notably increases in hours worked and some preliminary information suggesting   June 22–23, 2010 115 of 213             that any structural unemployment by-products of the recession may be limited  But we’ve had   hopeful signs for some time now, and they’ve translated into decent private sector job growth in   only two months thus far  Looking at projections that Bill distributed yesterday, the FOMC as a   whole expects that unemployment two and a half years from now will still be a couple of   percentage points above what we consider the long-run trend   Now to the tail  Euro zone periphery problems have created obvious stresses, as revealed   most palpably in the financial data presented by Nellie yesterday  The uncertainty that results   has been increased by continued disjointed policy response and communication problems among   European policymakers  Owing to the awkward structure of its economic policymaking, this   awkwardness, I think, has been reflected in both the continued lack of elaboration on some   particulars of how the SPV will function and, as many of you have noted, in continuing and   recurring questions surrounding the bank stress test exercise  A number of observers here and in   Europe note that each time European policymakers take a leap ahead of the curve, they get   bogged down in the challenges of coordinating the implementation of their initiatives, and they   risk falling behind that curve once again  It’s possible to muddle through sovereign debt and   banking sector problems, but history suggests that a failure to get ahead of these problems will   often lead to grief   The uncertainties associated with the immediate risks of the sovereign debt and   associated banking problems are bad enough  Then we have the view, which I’ve heard from a   number of market participants, that virtually any policy chosen in Europe will be a bad one    Credible fiscal consolidation will be good for reassuring the financial system but, quite possibly,   bad for economic growth  Failure to move forward on credible fiscal consolidation may be   helpful in the short term but will compound the medium-term problems and, quite possibly, lead   June 22–23, 2010 116 of 213             to a steepening of yield curves sooner rather than later  Finding the right balance and timing of   policies will obviously be a challenge, not to mention the coordination difficulties   In terms of my own expectations, starting with my modal expectation, the effect of the   euro zone problems on risk aversion, exports, and equity values will be only partially offset by   lower Treasury rates and commodity prices  This expectation led me to pare somewhat my   projections for GDP growth in the remainder of this year and 2011, though not as much as the   Tealbook, and that’s in part because I never expected growth as high as the Greenbook had   foreseen before its recent change of hue  My modal forecast is not too optimistic to begin with    Add to that the tail risk of a financial event in Europe—and I think we can have a disruptive   financial event that falls short of a full-blown crisis—and we see at least some potential for   renewed asset value and credit strains in the United States with a resulting significant negative   effect on economic performance  So here’s hoping the tail doesn’t wag the dog  Thank you, Mr   Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I favor the policy actions in alternative B,   but not necessarily all of the language  Alternative B, as drafted, does not seem to me to reflect   either what I described as my modal projection or the tail risks that many of us have talked   about  With respect to the tail risks, I am not sure it would be particularly helpful to specify   those in our statement, and they will be evident in the minutes when they’re released in a few   weeks  But, with respect to the projections of the economy, I think that there was a palpable   change in the attitude of the Committee, and I agree with Kevin that alternative B, paragraph 1,   is rather more upbeat than either the Tealbook forecast or what most of us had to say around the   table  Initially, I was going to say I just favor the language in alternative A, but I only see two   differences between A and B, one of which is the insertion of “in recent months” to “bank   lending has continued to contract,” and that doesn’t strike me as a salient difference  So I would   favor more particularly the substitution of the last sentence of paragraph 1 in alternative A for the   last sentence of paragraph 1 of alternative B  I thought that the effort in the first red insertion in   paragraph 3 of alternative A—if I understand it correctly—to try to specify a bit more our   reaction function was and is an interesting and good effort  I don’t think the language quite   June 22–23, 2010 157 of 213             captures probably what all of us would agree to, but I think it would be worth doing more along   those lines for the next couple of meetings   The only other thing I’d say, Mr Chairman, is in support of my argument for the   sentence change in the first paragraph  I recall the debate last year, which included, to some   degree, people around this table, between those who said that the mixed data we were seeing at   the time were eminently characteristic of the early stages of a pretty strong recovery, and that we   would pretty soon see things converging around stronger data more or less across the board, and   those who predicted that this was going to be a halting recovery in which there were going to be   potholes, or headwinds, or some other metaphor, looking out a fair time into the future, and thus   we are going to continue to see a pattern that was sort of two steps forward, one step back   I think that, nine months later, that debate has been, at least in the medium term, clearly   decided in favor of the latter camp  So I think we’ve got to come to grips with the fact that, even   in the modal forecast, this is not a lot of strength, and this does not promise anything close to the   achievement of at least one side of the dual mandate, and, I suspect, increasingly, both sides of   the dual mandate  I don’t know how many years it takes before the high levels of unemployment   that we all project constitute the long run rather than the short run  Thank you, Mr Chairman    Is it clear that that actually softens our sense of the recovery?    Right    It doesn’t feel to me that—I could interpret each one either way, so   I’m sort of indifferent    I’d be in favor of any of those  [Laughter]    That was actually more Dennis than me    It may be an asymmetric interpretation  "
9048,2010-08-10,TARULLO,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’m a little worried down here at the end of   the table, because for the last 18 months I’ve been able just to refer to whatever Governor Kohn   said as capturing my view of the economy, which allows me to concentrate on one or two things    August 10, 2010 72 of 160             So I’d like to request that, if he carries through on his threat not to show up at the next meeting,   maybe he could submit for the record—[laughter]—his ongoing views of the economy    With externally bred tail risks in retreat, at least for the present, we’ve   all turned our attention again to the key question underlying medium-term economic projections,   namely, whether final sources of private demand will become sufficiently self-sustaining to   substitute for the waning effects of fiscal stimulus, the absence of further monetary stimulus, and   the completion of major inventory replenishment   While it is perhaps too soon to answer this question definitively, the handoff has clearly   not gone smoothly  The prevailing story last spring of a well-established recovery gradually   gaining momentum is considerably harder, though not impossible, to tell persuasively  Indeed,   against the backdrop of the generally disappointing data of the last couple of months, it seems to   me that the downward revision to estimates of second-quarter economic growth renders quite   credible a reading of the last year as a burst of stimulus-induced activity in an environment of   decreasing financial instability followed by lackluster growth in the face of continued balance   sheet repairs, business model adjustments, and shaky business and consumer confidence   Such a reading is supported by numerous factors already mentioned by a number of our   colleagues  In particular, a close look at employment data shows that there has been no net   improvement over the last 12 months  In fact, we have gone backwards  From July 2009 to July   2010, the working-age population of the United States increased by about two million  In that   same time frame, the number of employed people in the country decreased by roughly 900,000    After increasing in the early part of the year, the total number of people employed has declined a   August 10, 2010 73 of 160             bit in each of the last three months  The gains in hours worked earlier this year have been   maintained but have shown some signs of abating except, possibly, in manufacturing  After nine   months of increases, temporary employment also fell last month  In July, the labor force   participation rate and employment-to-population ratios had given up the modest improvements   seen in the spring and were just about where they were at the end of last year, hovering at levels   lower than any time since the early 1980s  Of the six alternative measures of labor   underutilization used by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which incorporate factors such as   discouraged workers and longer-term unemployment, five have increased since last July   Still, this is the past and the present I’ve been describing  Are there reasons to expect an   acceleration of the painfully slow pace of recovery over the next few quarters?  Or, more to the   point, are there reasons better than those adduced earlier this year in support of projections of   stronger growth, which turned out to have been erroneous or at least premature?   The factor most frequently mentioned is that financial conditions have improved   considerably since last year  The tightening of credit terms, as Betsy described, appears to be   coming to an end, and the decline in bank lending has slowed considerably  Large companies   have apparently taken advantage of favorable borrowing conditions to reduce their interest   expenses  All of this is true, but it describes not an impetus for faster economic growth, but the   conditions that would permit faster growth if the impetus comes from another source  The same   large companies that have so successfully accessed public debt markets are sitting on large   amounts of cash, which they will continue to do until they see the promise of increased demand   that would warrant investment in new capacity  Small businesses have the same view, as   reflected in the survey released this morning   August 10, 2010 74 of 160             I want to digress for just a moment to say a word about policy uncertainty and skill   mismatches as potential sources of suppressed job creation  While both undoubtedly play some   role today, neither approach is as important as the most important uncertainty, namely, that of   future demand for goods and services  Health care costs are undoubtedly an issue and are likely   to continue to be so for the indefinite future  With respect to job mismatches, I’m not sure,   Narayana, that a moderate uptick in job openings from near depression levels to the level that   was the lowest of the previous ten years constitutes a real mismatch problem  As the recovery   moves on, we are going to see mismatches  But right now the basic problem is aggregate   demand  And in response to the JOLTS point, I just note that the survey of hard-to-fill positions   indicates that they are at historic lows in small businesses   Other factors cited as grounds for relative optimism include improving export   performance, possible release of pent-up demand as consumer confidence improves, a decline in   what turns out, after all, to have been significantly increased saving rates once consumers have   paid off most of their debt, stronger than expected growth in some foreign markets, the continued   recovery in manufacturing following the carnage that began a couple of years ago, and an end to   the unusually high productivity growth during the recession   One might question at least parts of each of these mostly benign possibilities  But even if   we grant them all, we’re almost surely looking at no more than the kind of moderately above-  trend growth that was the central tendency of this Committee not so long ago  And, as seen in   the forecasts of even the most optimistic of the Blue Chip forecasters, that translates, at best, into   an unemployment rate of about 8½ percent at the end of next year, a figure that I strongly suspect   would itself mask a continued low employment-to-population ratio   August 10, 2010 75 of 160             With this employment picture, it seems exceedingly difficult to give a plausible account   of medium-term rapid economic growth of a sort that would propel us beyond where we would   be had trend growth continued through the last few years  Thus, even allowing for some increase   in the NAIRU, and some reduction in productive capacity, the only truly open question now   seems to be whether the economy will be moderately or badly underperforming for the   foreseeable future  Thank you, Mr Chairman    Bill and Brian, the bracketed language providing the alternative for   rolling over into MBS presumably reflects the preference of some people based on a combination   of policy and signaling concerns for choosing that alternative  But you, in particular, Bill,   alluded to the potential impairment of the functioning of the MBS market  Can one or both of   you elaborate on the degree of that impairment, that is, how high the costs would be, so that   people who have some exogenous preference for rolling over into MBS have a sense of what the   offsetting costs are?    Thank you    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I can support alternative B for a lot of the   reasons that Sandy and Kevin have already mentioned  First, it’s important, to the maximum   degree possible, that we emphasize through our communication strategy that alternative B can be   understood not as a change in basic policy but instead as a recalibration of policy instruments to   changes that have occurred in the world, one of which is the increasing runoff, which means that   maintaining neutrality requires something different from what was required before  Second,   August 10, 2010 130 of 160             contrary to the projections of virtually everybody around the table early in the year, except   maybe Kevin and me, the current economic situation is not where it was expected to be  Under   these circumstances, it does seem to me important that we not, in fact or in perception, be   tightening  Having said that, I think that Kevin identifies some important risks associated with   the action, which is why I emphasize the communication strategy   I do have a couple of additional comments  I was quite taken with Charlie Evans’s   comments, and I think he makes some powerful arguments that need to be considered seriously    In that regard, I’m a bit concerned that we’ve got yet another one-day meeting coming up, where   we may not have the opportunity to examine at length some of the options that we may—and I   underscore “may”—need to be considering over the coming several meetings  I know I’m   putting words in Charlie’s mouth, so he has perfect right to say I misunderstood him, but what I   heard him saying was that we have an obligation to search for tools that will achieve both parts   of the dual mandate  Now, when both parts of the dual mandate are not being achieved in the   same direction, or for the same set of reasons, then the duty upon us is even greater to look for   mechanisms, tools, and policy actions that will get us moving in the right direction on both parts   of the dual mandate   I have spared everybody around this table a disquisition on the legal implications of the   dual mandate, which are, after all, included in Title 12 of the United States Code  But the time   may be coming for that  I don’t think it is adequate to say that we can’t think of anything right   now, so that’s not something monetary policy can do  It is an abdication of responsibility, in my   view, and it is inconsistent with the law to take that position   I hope that we can develop some of the options that have been put on the table through   the useful memos that Bill and Brian and their staffs have produced  I hope that we can consider   August 10, 2010 131 of 160             some variants on that, perhaps along the lines of things that Narayana and Jim have been saying   for a while  For example, one possibility is doing more Treasury purchases over a given period   of time but accompanying that with more sales of MBS, so we’d have a net increase in the   balance sheet, but we’d actually be running down the holdings of MBS  I’m not proposing that,   but there are a lot of variants that haven’t yet been taken up, whose costs and benefits we haven’t   yet discussed, and I really do think it’s important for us to do that   With respect to the language itself, I have no problem with paragraph 1  I agree with   Kevin that keeping paragraph 3 the way it is makes a lot of sense  I’d be more comfortable if   paragraph 4 were phrased slightly differently, but I hope that we can trust to the Chairman’s   communication to fill some of that in, and the minutes will surely do so as well  I personally am   somewhat attracted to the bracketed language in paragraph 2 “at levels lower than are desirable   over the long run,” because it removes any possibility of an inference that the last clause of the   current paragraph 2 is to be taken as a good thing  But I don’t feel strongly about it  Thank you,   Mr Chairman    “To maintain the current level of monetary policy accommodation”  "
9070,2010-09-21,TARULLO,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  With the dual attraction of doughnuts and   an LSAP discussion beckoning [laughter], I’m going to try to truncate my remarks a bit  So I’ll   begin with a few summary points  First, nothing that has happened in the intermeeting period   has changed my view that we can expect continued lackluster economic growth in the face of   ongoing balance sheet repairs, business model adjustments, and shaky business and consumer   confidence  I don’t regard this as good news   Second, nothing that has happened in the intermeeting period has changed my view that   the only open question is how much the economy will underperform for the foreseeable future    Existing upside risks could push us to moderately underperforming status rather than to anything   like robust economic growth   Third, I had prepared some remarks on both structural unemployment and the potential   effects of regulatory and tax uncertainty on hiring  With respect to the former, maybe I could   just incorporate by reference everything that President Yellen and President Evans earlier said  I   congratulate them for the careful and thorough analysis they brought to bear on a question on   which people have a tendency, I think, sometimes to leap to conclusions based on selected data   or anecdotes  With respect to the claim that regulatory and tax uncertainty are the major culprits   inhibiting hiring, this seems to be based principally on complaints voiced by business executives   themselves  The well-known social science skepticism of self-reporting of attitudes and   September 21, 2010 66 of 151             intentions is fully applicable here  The reason people give for an action or omission is often not   borne out by third-party observation   A little perspective can help, and that perspective is nicely provided by the National   Federation of Independent Business survey to which Eric alluded earlier in the context of hard-  to-fill jobs  As always, the latest monthly survey of small business economic trends by the NFIB   includes the answers of its members to the question “What is the single most important problem   your business faces”  And, perhaps more tellingly, the survey contains graphs of the responses   over the quarter century of the monthly survey  What does it tell us?  Not surprisingly, lots of   businesses always complain about taxes, and they always complain about regulatory policy    Throughout this period, the percentage of smaller businesses saying that taxes are their biggest   problem has always been between 15 and 30 percent  In the August survey, the number was   21 percent  Similarly, over the life of the survey the number of businesses reporting regulation   as their biggest problem has almost always been between 10 and 25 percent  In the latest survey,   it stood at 15  Interestingly, the high-water mark for complaints about both taxes and regulation   was during the Clinton Administration when, as you recall, jobs were being created in   unprecedented numbers and the unemployment rate dropped below 5 percent   In contrast, until the last few years, sales had never been identified as the biggest problem   by more than about 18 percent of the respondents  In the past few years, the number has been   above 30 percent, where it remains today  I don’t place enormous stock in any of these numbers   in any absolute sense, but they do remind us that lots of businesspeople always have this view of   regulation and of taxes  They don’t, however, always complain about poor sales, which they’re   doing in great numbers today  The absence of actual and expected demand is surely not the only   factor inhibiting investment and hiring, but such careful and measured empirical work as has   September 21, 2010 67 of 151             been possible thus far suggests strongly that it has been the most important factor, and,   regrettably, there is no indication that it will fade any time soon  Thank you, Mr Chairman    Thank you, Mr Chairman  For the reasons that the Chairman and   many of you have already stated, I think that alternative B is the best course of action for today    I’m comfortable with the language as drafted in the package that Bill English distributed a little   bit earlier this morning  I would be open to modifications of that language that could engender   stronger consensus around the table, particularly if that consensus were to be translated into a   stronger perceived consensus by markets and the public   Mr Chairman, after listening to the conversation this morning and a lot of the questions   and ideas that were raised, I wonder whether it might be useful to try to do a briefing sometime   between now and the November meeting—maybe midway through, after Columbus day—in   which at least some of the issues that were raised today could be developed a bit and presented   so that we wouldn’t have to try to pack everything into even an elongated two-day meeting   That’s just an idea that occurred to me as I heard so many people evince the desire for a fuller   discussion  Thank you  "
9090,2010-10-15,TARULLO,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I want to begin by underscoring something   Bill Dudley said a few minutes ago, namely, that the most important thing about our structure for   communication and for specifying objectives of monetary policy over the near to medium term is   less about inflation targeting or price-level targeting and more about giving people a pretty clear   indication of how we would make decisions subsequent to a further accommodative policy step   That actually was my initial thought—just to agree with Bill’s observation  But having   listened to many of you who preceded me, I’m now almost affirmatively of the view that it would   be a bad idea to try to specify some further objective for monetary policy in the near term  It seems   to me that significant disagreements have been voiced today and that an effort to resolve those   disagreements may be more difficult than actually getting ourselves onto a path where people   understand why we’re making a large-scale asset purchase and what to expect about what we may   do in the future  Both Bill and Janet laid out potential paths that could be followed—though they   were somewhat different, either path would allow markets to project with fair assurance how they   could anticipate our reactions to subsequent market or economic developments  I will just state that   I would be opposed to enunciating any inflation target while omitting any reference to the   maximum employment mandate  I have feared for some time—a fear that has now been   reinforced—that there’s a tendency to want to read the second part of the dual mandate out of the   Federal Reserve Act, and I’m unalterably opposed to that  That feels to me the way some people   are conceiving of an inflation target  I thought Richard Fisher put the point very well, and, whether   or not you agree with Richard’s alternative, I think one has to be sensitive to his identification of the   problem    With respect to the second question, yes, I would favor additional LSAPs  As a couple of   people have said earlier, we do have some basis now for evaluating their efficacy  Surely, LSAPs   October 15, 2010 56 of 62             might not be one of the measures that people would favor were they able to control all policy, fiscal   and monetary  But we can control only monetary policy, and we have to respond to whatever   situation we find, using the tools available to us   I was inclined to say that I favor large, discrete adjustments made infrequently as opposed to   smaller, more continuous adjustments made more often  But I want to be very clear that I don’t   think “shock and awe” is on the table  I don’t think anybody is going to be shocked and awed by   $500 billion, given talk and market expectations already  I do think, for the reasons that a couple of   people have stated so far, that there is merit in committing to a particular quantum, which, by my   lights, would be larger rather than smaller, in order to have the maximum effect on markets  If, as   John said, stock effects have been shown to be the principal channel by which effects are   transmitted to the market, then presumably you want to give as much certainty about the stock as   you can at the outset   With respect to communication, I share in the broad agreement that having the Chairman   communicate explicitly and reasonably quickly with the press after the FOMC meetings is a good   idea  I wouldn’t say I’m agnostic about the best form of this communication, but I don’t think we   need to decide that now  I think Kevin identified a good point, namely, that if you have Q&A that’s   on the record, the opportunities for off-the-wall Qs that then dominate not just the As, but also the   press conference, become pretty significant  Thank you, Mr Chairman   "
9114,2010-11-02,TARULLO,"  See, now that you don’t come to these other meetings, you miss these   jokes  [Laughter]    Thank you, Mr Chairman  There’s been no significant change in my   outlook since the September meeting, and, actually, there was no significant change between the   August meeting and the September meeting  That’s not really good news for the economy   insofar as my outlook is, I think, at the very bottom of everybody’s projections, but you might   have thought it was good news for you, at least, because I wouldn’t have anything more to say    [Laughter]  No such luck   What I’ve been thinking about the last few weeks was actually prompted by some   discussions that I had with some of my counterparts from foreign central banks during the   Bank/Fund meetings a few weeks ago  The discussions started on the topics of a double-dip   recession and deflation, but they gravitated fairly quickly to considering the potential outcomes   in industrial economies, such as the continental European economies and the US, if they face an   extended period of very tepid growth, that is, growth at or slightly below trend  In particular, the   discussion focused on the degree to which such a period of growth could have some self-  replicating characteristics, thereby producing some losses that would not necessarily be apparent   just from extrapolation of a growth rate like that over time   So I asked myself  Well, what are the prospects for growth?  And every single one of   you is somewhat more optimistic than I am, though not a whole lot more  There may well be   some momentum building up over time simply because things will get better after a period of   time when they stop getting worse, and it’s for that reason that I actually have a little bit of   upside risk on my own otherwise gloomy forecast   November 2–3, 2010 89 of 238             I also did try to look systematically at what are arguably leading economic indicators    And I looked not just at those formally noted by the Conference Board, but also at other   indicators drawn from the data that people here aggregate for us—both objective ones, like   housing permits and capital goods orders, and subjective ones, like consumer confidence and   business sentiment  Most, although not all, of those pieces of information are positive; most,   although not all, are only mildly so, particularly considering the low baseline against which even   positive data are being measured  And I certainly didn’t see a case for a pattern suggesting an   acceleration of growth  So it seemed to me not unreasonable to hypothesize that a relatively   tepid pace of growth continues for some period of time  Clearly, the handoff from one stage of   recovery to another hasn’t been smooth  The period late last year and early this year of stimulus,   inventory replenishing, and relief that the cataclysm had been avoided, has not led smoothly to a   more self-sustaining growth supported by consumer demand  That fact, too, seemed to me to   reinforce the prospects for quite contained levels of economic growth going forward   What do I worry about under those circumstances?  Well, first, we’re clearly in a   liquidity bog, if not a liquidity trap  And in the absence of an increase in aggregate demand,   there doesn’t seem to be any real prospect of pulling ourselves out of that mire  Second—and   Eric alluded to this—at some point we’re likely to see some hysteresis effects taking hold in the   labor market  While I think that, to date, the evidence is fairly limited on whether skills   mismatches have led to increasing structural unemployment, a high enough level of long-term   unemployment will almost surely produce just such a result over time  Third, while we know   that firms are adding very little additional productive capacity in the face of weak demand, they   may also be taking capacity off line or allowing their ability to increase production quickly to   atrophy  This phenomenon is probably the hardest of the three to document, in large part   November 2–3, 2010 90 of 238             because we simply don’t have data on capacity in the 80 percent or so of our economy that’s not   industrial  But one suspects, or at least I suspect, that some of the firms that have been able to   maintain rising profits in the face of sluggish sales have done so not just through increased   efficiencies, but also through cost reductions effected by de facto capacity reductions   Now, each of these three factors would surely be reduced by sustained increases in   aggregate demand, but, again, in the absence of prospects for increased employment, it’s hard for   me to see where that aggregate demand comes from  So I think it’s not inconceivable that we’re   facing a recovery even slower than the modest pace expected in the aftermath of a recession   induced by a financial crisis, even slower than that reflected in the Tealbook, and even slower   than the central tendency of our own forecast for this quarter  But worse still, the economy could   see a greater increase in the NAIRU and a lower level of potential growth because of the kinds of   effects I mentioned a moment ago  In that case, there would be a longer lasting impact of the   slower period of growth, one that would stretch out for years even beyond those that we now   anticipate  So, in short, my concern is that a reluctance to provide further stimulus on the   grounds that structural constraints limit growth at present could itself become a self-fulfilling   prophecy That kind of thought is overhanging my forecast, and it’s also the way that I’ll be   thinking about policy tomorrow  Thank you, Mr Chairman    Thank you, Mr Chairman  This is a difficult decision for me, and I   think it was a difficult decision for most of you  The only people I worry about are the people   who think that the decision was easy, whether to do nothing or to do precisely this, because I do   think that, as many people have pointed out, there are nontrivial costs and nontrivial benefits   associated with, for example, each course of action that the Tealbook tried to play out for us    This shouldn’t be a surprise  When one is faced with difficult problems, policy responses are   invariably not going to be perfect  You’re going to have shortcomings with each, and you’re   going to have advantages with each   From my point of view, as you could tell from yesterday, I’m most concerned with the   present and, perhaps, future absence of sufficient aggregate demand to move us out of this rather   sluggish growth pattern which, I fear, will be self-reinforcing  And I certainly don’t believe that   $600 billion of additional asset purchases over time will turn that situation around   I’m nonetheless in favor of the action proposed in alternative B for a couple of reasons    First is the potential for deflation  I think this really is worth emphasizing—Jim Bullard did it   again today, John Moore did, as well, and others have alluded to it  Even if the potential is not   large in probability terms, it’s one that would have such costs that the extra bit of insurance   against it seems to me important  Second, the real economy effects hypothesized by the staff   with the implementation of this plan would have some influence on changing the balance of   November 2–3, 2010 186 of 238             people’s portfolios and thus where money is being extended in credit markets, and it would have   some effects at the margin, which, after all, is where economic policy is generally made   There are certainly risks  The Chairman detailed a number of them yesterday, and   several of you have mentioned them today  To me, the risk of excessive leverage developing in   some markets is among the most important of those, and I think it is incumbent on us in our   supervisory and new financial stability roles to monitor the growth not so much of asset prices as   of the leverage associated with that   Having said that there are risks, I’d also say that some of the things that I’ve heard   described as risks don’t worry me as much  First, there’s concern that if we do something today,   then markets will expect that we’re going to do more later with QE3 and QE4, as Nouriel   Roubini is now discussing publicly  I think we can’t have it both ways—we either worry about   market expectations or we try to lead market expectations  In taking this action today and   through the words of the Chairman and I hope the consonant words of others over time, I think   we can shape market reactions as to what may happen in the future   Second, there’s concern about our independence  I think that, if we fail to take a   monetary policy action that we think is the right action for fear that it will lead to encroachments   upon the monetary policy independence of this Committee, then the Committee has already lost   its monetary policy independence, because it is now being moved by expectations of how others   will assess it  I distinguish this from—just to pick something out of the air—the Fed doing   consumer protection rules  As many of the people around the table know, I thought that was   better done in another agency precisely because of the partisan nature of much of those   responsibilities and because they are not directly relevant to monetary policymaking  I feared it   might have effects upon our monetary policymaking function  Indeed, I think it already has    November 2–3, 2010 187 of 238             But, if we believe in the independence of this Committee to set monetary policy as we think best,   removed from the politics of the moment, then I think we have to proceed on that basis   Third, there’s concern about dollar depreciation  I really don’t understand the concern   here, to be perfectly honest  I’ve been doing international economics for a long time, and every   time the Fed moved, those of us who paid attention to trade and investment flows would always   think about the effect on the dollar and, thus, on both trade and investment flows, whether we’re   easing by reducing the federal funds rate by 50 basis points or by reinitiating an asset-purchase   program as we’re considering doing today  So, in terms of the perception that we’re going to   have such an effect, this really is not news—it’s the way things have always been  The attention   to it may be heightened at this juncture because there has been some question about the dollar’s   position over time  I am one who shares some concerns about the dollar’s position and the   potential for instability in foreign exchange markets, but I must say that that situation has   developed over the last decade as large current account deficits and large budget deficits were   run even in a period of economic growth  I don’t think that the actions of this Committee in   initiating an additional $600 billion in purchases are going to tip us towards foreign exchange   instability in the context of those broader problems which are going to have to be confronted by   the country over time, including having a more sustainable external balance   Fourth is the argument that it would be better if other parts of the US government took   their own policy actions  I agree it would be far better if aggregate demand were being   supported by the political branches of government  But it’s not, and I don’t think Section 2(a) of   the Federal Reserve Act reads this way “The Board of Governors and the Federal Open Market   Committee shall take such actions once they have told the rest of the government what’s best for   them to do”  [Laughter]  We’ve got the mandate to take such actions as we can, seeing the world   November 2–3, 2010 188 of 238             as we see it and taking it as we find it, just as sometimes people wish that the private sector   would be doing things differently, but it isn’t, and, therefore, monetary policy action is called for    So I think that there is an obligation on our part to do what we can, taking the world as we find it    Now, I do not disagree with Kevin that some prodding of the other branches of government to do   their part would be valuable, but that doesn’t seem to me to undercut our obligation to take the   actions that we can in an effort to achieve the dual mandate   I am in support of alternative B  I think that, as President Evans suggests, there would be   an argument for doing more precisely to get the benefits up  I can see the arguments of those   who think that the risks may be disproportionate to the benefits, so they don’t want to do   anything  I come down on the side of saying that the risks are exceeded by the potential benefits,   particularly in these circumstances where we do need to be mindful of the potential for   deflationary traps—we’re already in a liquidity trap  We have to think in a prophylactic fashion   as well as an incremental fashion  I’m sorry, this is a bit of a digression—I do vividly recall in   the 1990s pleading with Japanese authorities not to raise their value added tax and to take more   aggressive action to stop their economy from sliding into a liquidity trap and being met with a   whole line of arguments that “things are getting better, we just have to be a little bit patient”    There was an inability to pull out of conventional policymaking thinking and to see that the   situation was actually quite different   Is this policy move we’re contemplating destined to be a great boon and prod to the   economy?  No  However, I think the risks, which are real, are well worth assuming both as a   means of stopping a slide towards deflation if one were to start to develop and as a means to   provide an incremental prod towards activity in the real economy   November 2–3, 2010 189 of 238             With respect to all the suggestions on the language in the statement, I’ll just note the ones   that particularly appeal to me or that somewhat troubled me  I like both of Narayana’s   suggestions, and I think a lot of people do  I don’t like the “up to,” even though I understand   why Richard proposed it, and I like Kevin’s formulation better  The reason I don’t like “up to” is   that it makes it seem that there’s not a presumption that that’s what we’re going to do, and I think   we should have a pretty strong presumption that it’s going to be $600 billion during this period,   not more and not less  But, as Kevin suggested, if serious problems were occasioned by the   policy, or as Narayana suggested, if unexpectedly we got this huge burst of activity or, I would   add, if unexpectedly the slide towards deflation seemed to be taking place, then, of course, we   should change policy  But I would hope there would be a reasonably strong presumption for   action, because I don’t think we want to get into fine-tuning even though we do want to react to   the world as we see it  Regarding paragraph 4, I don’t feel strongly about the actual language in   A versus B, but I think, as Janet said, we might be well advised at this particular FOMC meeting   to minimize the number of changes except those we think are really necessary in order to reflect   our assessment of the economy and the action we’re taking today  Thank you, Mr Chairman    Doesn’t that undermine what you’re doing?     I think the issue may be, Jeff, that while we think about financial   stability pretty regularly as one of our responsibilities, I’m not sure that everybody externally   includes financial stability as an objective  Everybody else tends to think in terms of the dual   mandate    Kevin, what does it add from your point of view?    I’m sorry  Kevin, would you mind just reading again what you had   proposed?  "
9139,2010-12-14,TARULLO,"  What would change in six months?  I understand that the world would   change, but are you anticipating, Nathan, that things would be worse in Europe and, therefore,   we would not want to extend the swap arrangement?    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I think we’ve had a mixed picture since the   last meeting, and there have been a lot of those recently  But this is a different kind of mixed   picture, one in which the medium-term real economy prospects seem clearly to have improved    December 14, 2010 66 of 127             However, at least from my point of view, the downside risks are actually greater now, but they   are predominantly financial rather than from within the economy itself   With respect to the real economy, as many of you have already discussed, things have   improved, even since the last FOMC meeting  At that time, I thought we were likely to see only   tepid growth for some time, although I carefully and, it turns out, wisely hedged by saying that I   thought that the risks to the real economy were on the upside, particularly if there were some sort   of unanticipated policy action  I think we’ve gotten the unanticipated policy action in the form   of a fiscal package that exceeded general expectations  They may not be the most efficacious   additional stimulus measures in the world, but the payroll tax reduction and the full investment   expensing seem to have had a psychological as well as an anticipated real effect  Having said   that, though, I don’t think that the economy is likely to get carried away by optimism any time   soon, and neither should we   And now I have to say in recognition of yet another Navy win over Army, my next   couple of metaphors will be maritime in nature  While the instinct to “stay in port” has receded   considerably, it seems to have been replaced by an “ahead one-third” attitude rather than an “all   ahead full”  I think we see that in several respects  One, the mountains of cash on which major   corporations are sitting are probably a testament both to a lack of confidence in the payoff from   new investment and to a desire to self-insure against some economic or financial ill winds that   might blow across the Atlantic or maybe blow east from some of the states with particular   financing problems  Housing, as many of you have pointed out, remains in the doldrums  Even   though affordability looks good, demand remains low, probably in part because people are   waiting to see if prices will go down yet more, and, presumably, also because the rate on 30-year   fixed-rate mortgages is now increasing   December 14, 2010 67 of 127             I focus again, as I often do, on the labor market, in substantial part because it seems hard   to imagine a sustained or increasingly strong recovery without a significant decrease in   unemployment, unless you expect another really big spike in productivity, which I don’t think   anybody is forecasting  Labor market prospects are obviously mixed—there are more   encouraging indications in surveys of employers about future hiring plans, but those have yet to   materialize in strong net hiring  One useful labor market indicator reflecting continued caution is   the quit rate, a metric that Janet Yellen has mentioned a number of times when we have talked   about labor markets  First, I should note, as Janet has in the past, that a fairly high number of   quits reflects a healthy labor market, because people have opportunities and they have   confidence to leave current jobs  Looking at the JOLTS series, which admittedly has a short life,   quits had always exceeded layoffs and discharges by a minimum of about 20 percent on average,   and sometimes by as much as 80 or 90 percent  That changed in the fall of 2008 when quits   dropped precipitously  Late that year, as layoffs rose especially steeply, the two lines crossed on   the JOLTS graph for the first time  And then, for nearly a year, layoffs exceeded quits by about   20 percent, and sometimes more, before quits finally stabilized and layoffs declined in the latter   part of last year  Since then, layoffs have been near the levels seen in pre-crisis years  Quits, on   the other hand, have only inched up since that time—they’re still nearly 20 percent below   previous levels and, while the quits rate has now edged ahead of layoffs, it has bounced back and   forth a little bit over the last six months  Until the gap grows a good deal more, it will be hard to   conclude that the labor market is returning to some semblance of normality   With respect to the financial risks, I think Bill covered those well  I would just add a   couple of things about the euro zone  I think, first, we’ve seen what happens when you try to do   crisis management and structural reforms at the same time—you massively confuse investors and   December 14, 2010 68 of 127             markets, and the Europeans are still paying the price for that  Second, a number of you have   mentioned the supposed Spanish firewall  I, for one, don’t see any evidence that anybody is   building a firewall  At this point, it just seems to be a forest fire effort which is spread across all   of the periphery  If they really mean to have Spain being a firewall, one would hope to see a   more concentrated Spain-specific set of measures, internally and externally provided   In sum, I will end where I began by saying that, oddly in a sense, the real economy here   in the United States looks still to be improving only modestly, but with more traction than   before  But, somewhat counterintuitively, the downside risks are now greater, in the sense that   they are external, which is to say, I think, in financial markets  Thank you, Mr Chairman    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support alternative B as well  For the   reasons stated by Narayana and Kevin, I wish that it communicated rather more precisely than I   think it does what the threshold for a change in our intended path ought to be, but it’s 1235 pm,   and if we get into a discussion of that, we’re not likely to finish in a timely fashion   I would also reinforce Kevin’s caution about the impact of “FOMC chatter”  We used to   refer to that as what other people said about the FOMC  Now it’s the FOMC itself that seems   intent on chattering continuously in a way that I just don’t think is helping communications or   the integrity and external perception of this Committee  That’s it  Everything else looks fine  "
9169,2011-01-25,TARULLO,"  May I ask a question about it, Mr Chairman?    Janet, could you give a little more context for the kinds of information   that the subcommittee had in mind in thinking about the need for a better, more stringent   process?  I am thinking of this more as a lawyer rather than as a member of the FOMC, so I think   it would be helpful to make sure that everybody understands what actually is being proscribed   and why it’s being proscribed  For example, there’s a lot of information in the Tealbook every   six weeks, and I don’t think any of us think that information needs to get Class I confidentiality   January 25–26, 2011 6 of 282              treatment, certainly not as time goes on  So my question, then, is how people, particularly staff,   are to be able to distinguish what was intended by the Committee in making these revisions, on   the one hand, as opposed, on the other hand, to the literal embrace of the language of the revised   regulation    Can I give one concrete example?  I won’t belabor this  Suppose a   senior staff person is speaking to a group of academic economists and refers to the staff   projections for housing prices over the coming year, something which I, at least, receive only in   the form of the Tealbook  Some other memo may produce that information, of course, but that’s   where I see what the staff expects  Is that information intended to be proscribed or not intended   to be proscribed?    Just out of curiosity, does that apply to us, too, for example, during   testimony?    Just to be clear, the reason I raise this question is principally because   of the staff throughout the System  They’re going to be reading something which they were not   present at the creation of, and they just need to be able to understand what the implications of   this are for them    Unless it’s in the minutes, Narayana    It depends on what you say    January 25–26, 2011 36 of 282               I just wanted to add a couple of things to what Nellie said in response   to President Lockhart  When we get the BIS numbers, there are three things to keep in mind    One, our experience has been that the BIS numbers tend to overstate actual exposures just   because of the way they count and what they characterize as an in-country exposure as opposed   to an exposure to a foreign subsidiary of your own country’s companies   January 25–26, 2011 85 of 282              Two, since May we’ve been tracking this pretty carefully through the LISCC, and it’s   pretty clear that our large institutions have been reducing exposures not only directly to the   periphery, but also to those who hold a lot of periphery debt  How much?  That’s a little harder   to get our arms around, but the trend has been clear  In contrast, as Nellie pointed out, the   money market funds don’t have a penny less exposure to Europe today than they did a year   ago—they’ve just reallocated which countries the exposure is in   Three, if you look at credit default swaps for the large European banks, the big French   and German banks have not seen that much of a run-up in their CDS spreads  One assumes that   that’s in no small part because of an assumption that the French and German governments would   back those banks were they to take a significant hit from Spanish, Portuguese, Irish, and Greek   banks, which is probably a reasonably well-grounded assumption   So, for all of those reasons, it’s really hard to come up with numbers, and most of us who   have been puzzling over this for the last six or eight months are left with a sense that it’s a pretty   big potential exposure if things really go south, but it has been getting somewhat smaller over   that same period of time    Thank you, Mr Chairman  With respect to the economy as a whole, I   think what we’ve seen is characteristic of the kind of recovery that occurs after major financial   shocks, which is to say it has been a gradual, somewhat jagged path of recovery  Therefore,   inferring from what many of you have said, the interesting question for 2011 is whether we’re   January 25–26, 2011 137 of 282              going to break out of that pattern of some ups and downs and instead get a stronger, more self-  reinforcing recovery dynamic, or whether the continued drag from the housing market and more   hope than realization of increased employment gains will once again pull us back down a bit and   return us to a jagged pattern of recovery  On those latter points, I would agree with what many   have said already  I just want to add a point on the housing market  I think the problems with   foreclosure documentation now look to be on the bad side of initial estimates of the delays and   costs that will result  Quite apart from irregularities at individual servicers, the MERS problems   run very deep indeed and are almost surely going to result in some delays and quite a bit higher   costs than I think many expected   With respect to the recoveries from financial crises, obviously this is a time when the   economy is more susceptible to shocks than usual  I think Bill covered the shocks quite well, so   I would just associate myself with his comments   I’ll make a couple of remarks on the euro-zone problems  I agree with those who have   said the biggest short-term risk comes from the euro zone  It’s relatively calm right now, both   because of the rumors of more European-level initiatives and because of the ECB purchases of   sovereign debt ahead of auctions  Europe is not using this period of calm to get ahead of the   problem, which they would probably be best advised to do by building a credible firewall in   Spain through strengthening the European backstops for sovereign debt, accelerating the   programs of disclosure for all banks, and presenting a credible plan for recapitalization of at least   the cajas   However, Spain is moving ahead unilaterally on a variety of structural reform fronts    They also seem willing to address bank transparency and cajas recap issues, but I sense that   they’re somewhat reluctant to go full speed ahead when European policies are proceeding at such   January 25–26, 2011 138 of 282              a stately pace, for example, on stress tests at financial institutions generally  I think at this point   most, if not all, of the important policymakers throughout the euro zone believe that proactive   steps are indicated, and they’re being held back by significant domestic political problems in   both the stressed and the core countries  As all of you know, Ireland’s government is endangered   as Irish citizens see what the failure to regulate their banks is going to cost them  The German   ruling party has faced coalition problems as German citizens resist the idea that they should pay   for what they see as fiscal irresponsibility in the periphery  Portugal doesn’t want a program at   all, notwithstanding the fact that officials in the core countries are trying to push it upon them    So the mantra that Europe has the financial and technical resources to contain the problems   remains true, but I think there is some continued risk that, if it were to spread to Spain, a reactive   ad hoc response might not be enough owing both to the size of sovereign debt and to some of the   unknowns around Spanish bank liabilities   I want to turn now to the credit environment here in the United States or, more   accurately, to the two credit environments that I think we currently have  one where credit is at   least perceived by many to be in unreasonably short supply, notwithstanding the positive   developments in the economy as a whole, and another where we may—and I emphasize   “may”—be seeing the early signs of some frothiness  With respect to the first environment in   which small and medium-sized businesses operate in particular, it’s clear that lending to such   firms has been quite circumscribed, at least as judged by historical standards  We have all heard   complaints from representatives of such businesses that they cannot get loans that they say could   be used to expand their businesses and create new jobs  We have all also seen the surveys and   analyses that suggest that the problem is, at its root, a lack of demand by these businesses based   upon a lack of assurance about future demand  I suspect many around this table share my   January 25–26, 2011 139 of 282              frustration at not being able to reach conclusions based principally on data rather than   impressions, though  Again, I suspect that, like most of you, I’m inclined toward the lack of   demand explanation   But when, in the course of conversations with labor economists and in anticipation of the   discussion we had yesterday, some of them explained the still slow pace of job creation in part   by what they characterized as a credit squeeze on smaller businesses, I decided to try, at least, to   find some other sources of data that might put the issue in some perspective  I looked at the BLS   business employment dynamics data series, which breaks down job growth and destruction by   size of firm to see how job creation in the present recovery compares to those following prior   recessions  Unfortunately, the series doesn’t go back to the major recessions of the early 1980s   and mid-1970s, it’s pretty badly lagged (by almost eight months), and it still doesn’t give all of   the information that would be useful  Other than that, it’s actually a terrific data series    [Laughter]  Given all the qualifications on how useful this inquiry would be, I looked at the   shares of gross job creation by small, medium-sized, and large businesses in the recoveries from   the mild recessions of the early years of both of the past two decades and compared them with   the proportion of job creation in the early stages of the present recovery—this is gross job   creation, not net  It’s interesting that the shares of gross job creation by the smallest   businesses—that is, those with 1 to 10 employees, which I assume are generally excluded from   borrowing from banks—and by the largest businesses—those over 1,000, which we know to   have had good and cheap access to credit for some time now—are both modestly but noticeably   higher than their shares in the previous two recoveries  Therefore, the share of job creation by   medium-sized businesses is several percentage points lower than in past recoveries  This   observation is consistent with the story of an unusual credit squeeze on small and medium-sized   January 25–26, 2011 140 of 282              businesses, though it hardly validates that story  And in truth, the biggest fact that jumps off the   screen as one looks at this data series is how few total jobs are being created relative to any time   in the last 20 years   Switching now to the other environment, that in which credit is not only readily available   but perhaps so abundant and cheap as to invite a kind of domestic variant on a carry trade, it’s   obvious how sustained low interest rate conditions can create such an environment  Tom has   been talking about them for well over a year  But I, at least, have assumed to date that these   risks are more likely once greater confidence in the likely trajectory of the economy has set in   and, thus, certain asset classes are commanding more assurance about their future value   trajectory  So until recently, I hadn’t seen much in either the financial stability memos or   elsewhere to raise concerns, but now I think there are at least a few potential warning signs  The   financial stability memo package that Nellie summarized yesterday identifies the leveraged loan   market and farmland prices as worth watching—because Tom spent a good deal of time on   farmland, I’m not going to say anything more about it  The leveraged loan market, with its   duration advantage for investors over junk bonds, seems to be growing rapidly  I notice that just   this month Prudential, PIMCO, and Nuveen have all started leveraged loan funds  Of course, the   loans themselves are still originated with banks  So we can take advantage of our strengthened   links between financial stability analysis and supervision to provide CPC teams and Board staff   with some background and some things to watch for  A similar exercise is clearly going to be   useful for the banks that provide lending for farmland acquisition   While our supervisory function provides a good window onto developments in these   specific markets—as well as potentially serving as a tool for affecting those forms of credit, if   necessary—there may also be some new areas of leverage or financial engineering that don’t so   January 25–26, 2011 141 of 282              closely involve our supervised institutions  One interesting example of this is innovations in   ETFs, including leveraged and synthetic funds  Bill Dudley and I were at an FSB meeting on   assessing vulnerabilities a couple of weeks ago, and there was a fairly interesting and extended   discussion of the changes in the ETF industry  Leveraged and synthetic funds are still a pretty   small part of the ETF universe, but they’re growing rapidly  It’s noteworthy, to me at least, that,   of the five big US players in this universe, only one is a bank holding company, and it is clearly   grounded in plain vanilla ETFs and a classic asset management function, so that innovations are   taking place outside the regulated sector  We can inquire into whether any leverage is being   provided by banks, of course, but it may be that other channels of monitoring, such as through   the SEC, are needed  This, of course, raises the question of what tools would be available were   we to observe developments that we think are troublesome in any of those areas  I think we can   all agree that more-targeted tools are far preferable to monetary policy as a means of controlling   any emerging asset bubbles, particularly when credit is still constrained in key parts of the   economy  Thus, as I suggested a moment ago, this question of tools for use outside regulated   institutions could become quite significant over time  Thank you, Mr Chairman    Thank you, Mr Chairman  This is easy  I associate myself with   Kevin on everything he said about the language in alternative B  I associate myself with Betsy   on everything she said about inflation targeting  Thank you    Mr Chairman, it’s the one thing, though, that hasn’t really changed    That’s where I think there’s a bit of dissonance  If you think it’s a good idea to up the optimism   level a bit, I think a lot of people around the table would be open to suggestions, but I’m not sure   that one does it    Kevin’s strategy    But in which paragraph, Narayana?    Can I just ask Eric to clarify something?  Did I draw the correct   inference that you regard this as governing discussions with members of the general media, as   well as people whose purpose is to generate direct or indirect trading profits from predicting   monetary policy actions?   January 25–26, 2011 202 of 282               Could you explain that?  My assumption had been that the reason we   were not including talking to reporters here is because we had a shared view that whenever the   reporter used whatever he or she got, it was immediately available to the world on the web  But   maybe I’m missing something    Thanks    He did it for 40 years, Charlie   January 25–26, 2011 213 of 282               Thank you, Mr Chairman  My first point picks up on something that   Kevin said and a couple of people echoed, but it was notably absent from the beginning of the   go-round, and that point is that there are discrete issues here  The one that I think is front and   center is that of exclusivity of access, particularly exclusivity associated with profit and trading   for profit  The issue of communication seems to me a different one—related perhaps, but a   much more difficult one—and, as you said, Jim, one that has more affirmative elements to it and   January 25–26, 2011 225 of 282              not simply negative elements  As you could tell from my earlier question to Eric, I, like Kevin,   think the issues of the press are perhaps deserving of some conversation, but they’re separate, as   well, in part precisely because if the press itself is acting ethically, exclusivity is not an issue    They literally are speaking to the world whenever they repeat something that they have heard   from one of us   My second point is a little hard to say, but I’m going to say it  I disagree with Kevin on   this notion that somehow the Federal Reserve is special and that the rules that apply to the rest of   the government don’t apply to us  I’ll be honest and say that’s one of the things that has   concerned me about the Federal Reserve in the two years that I’ve been here  I’ll begin with   ethics  There have been some things that I have seen—and, again, it’s hard to say this—  particularly associated with some of the behaviors of some directors at Reserve Banks that just   shouldn’t be allowed, and I think we need to formalize things considerably more than they have   been formalized   The third point is that rules are hard  Rulemaking is difficult because you always have   under-inclusion and over-inclusion  This is why rulemaking processes are not a straightforward   exercise, and why rules are not always the best approach to take  But, Charlie, precisely because   one cannot legislate good judgment, there are times when one needs to legislate behavior  I think   there are circumstances in which the potential for over- and under-inclusion is sufficiently   circumscribed that one may need something approaching a rule, even though, in a lot of other   areas, principles and examples and guidelines are more appropriate mechanisms  In a way, some   of this discussion was like a first-year law class  People state a position, and some people create   a hypothetical that’s at the edge of that position to show how you can’t possibly have a rule    January 25–26, 2011 226 of 282              Well, of course, you can have a rule, but you can’t necessarily cover everything with that rule    Several people have been explicit about this, and I agree with them   The most disturbing thing right now is the phenomenon of someone who comes in, talks   to most or all members of the FOMC and then to a group of paying clients, essentially   advertising that fact and suggesting that there’s a special kind of information  This is not limited   to one person, and this is not just Macroeconomic Advisers, although they have been mentioned    Way before I was at the Fed, I heard people going around town saying, “Oh, yeah, I have lunch   with X and Y at the Fed, so I kind of know where they are, and this is where the Fed is heading   on this”  I think this problem is more serious than most of the people around the table think it is,   and I have believed since I’ve been here that there was a real problem waiting to explode  Now,   we’ve had a lot of bad press, which has been about other things, but I really think there’s the   potential for problems here  And I have to say that it’s not just limited to, as I said, the Larry   Meyer type of issue at all  I think Larry is going to bear the brunt of a lot of this in some   respects, but it really isn’t limited to him  We’re not at the point of being able to write that rule,   but that doesn’t mean we don’t need to be in favor of doing so  I would add that I really think   we need rules for the conduct of directors of Federal Reserve Banks  I really do  Thank you    There have been meetings where people are formally here in their role   as directors and they have attempted to lobby me on applications dealing with their institutions   and/or pending regulatory issues  In one case, even when I suggested to the individual that it   was inappropriate, he persisted with my colleagues and attempted to come by my office the next   morning  I just think we need a code of conduct to prevent that sort of thing  "
9194,2011-03-15,TARULLO,"  Doesn’t he have to sing?  [Laughter]    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Brian, I would guess that the primary   dealers canvassed by the Desk reveal the most about likely market reactions to tapering or   nontapering  But I have noticed that economists, not traders, seem more evenly split than the   primary dealers on whether we are going to taper, so there is at least some difference of view out   there in the market  Are there any factors that would militate in favor of tapering, maybe   March 15, 2011 9 of 165              differences in circumstances between now and last year when we observed the relative   dominance of the stock over the flow effect?    Nathan, doesn’t that vary a good bit, though, by country?  That is, the   amount of slack    Thank you, Mr Chairman  As the minutes have passed, I have been   trying to mentally cut back my statement  So I’m going to extemporize a bit   The first point, on which I agree, I think, with virtually everybody, is that since our last   meeting, the gradual recovery in the US economy looks better grounded than ever  But as   many of you have commented, the external risks—and I would say largely non-economically   originating risks—are substantially larger than I think any of us anticipated   I won’t dwell on an assessment of the economy right now  I do want to identify two   questions, which I think will have some salience for us going forward  One is probably a   secondary question but was raised by Dave Stockton in his presentation, which is whether the   less-than-expected levels of personal consumption expenditures observed over the last couple of   months are more due to a growing set of concerns about these external problems, such as oil   price increases or otherwise, or whether they have more to do with a chronic sense of concern   about job prospects or other things more internal to the US economy   The second question, I think, is actually substantially more consequential, and this is the   one raised variously by Charlie, Narayana, and Janet, which is to say  What is going on in the   labor market?  And exactly what conclusions can we, or should we, be trying to draw from the   decline in the unemployment rate, notwithstanding the quite modest pace of net job creation   along with the observed decline in the labor force participation rate?  I think this one will have a   lot of consequence for us as we have to make decisions over the course of the next year, and, like   Janet, I am a little skeptical of at least some people’s reactions—nobody on the Committee, but   some people’s reactions—which is to say, well, let’s just assume that the trend for longer-term   labor participation needs to be adjusted downward yet again  I just don’t think we know enough    Maybe looking at the U-5s is one way to get at the information; maybe there are other methods   March 15, 2011 76 of 165              as well  But something is going on here that is not jumping out coherently from the different   data streams   The last comment I want to make is to try to draw together thematically a lot of the very   trenchant observations that Bill Dudley made about various international developments  I think   what is unusual about the adverse and worrisome developments for our economy right now is   that they are dominantly noneconomic in origin  They are grounded basically in political or,   more recently, natural factors, and they are also dominantly, though not exclusively, foreign    Obviously first is the possibility of oil supply disruptions, which could be somewhere between   problematic and paralyzing, depending on how they go forward  But, look, we are just not   particularly well equipped to make an assessment of how likely supply disruptions in Bahrain or   any other Middle Eastern/North African country actually are  I’m not sure how confident the   guys down C Street are in their ability to make those predictions either, but we surely can’t   Second are the persistent sovereign and bank debt problems in the euro periphery  I am a   little bit more like Bill  I read it a little less optimistically than the staff has, I think  The way I   looked at last Friday’s agreement is that Europe is still doing just enough to keep a step ahead of   the problems rather than clearly outpacing them  This pattern, I think, keeps open the possibility   that some catalyst will accelerate the crisis quickly enough that the rather slow-moving European   policy apparatus cannot keep up  I do think that our financial institutions in the United States   have reduced their direct exposure to potential crisis countries substantially, although the   transmission of problems from the periphery to core European country banks could still have an   effect upon US financial institutions and our own economy  I continue to restate Nathan’s   mantra that Europe has both the financial and technical resources to contain this set of threats,   March 15, 2011 77 of 165              but the condition that one needs to add is  if the political will to do so is present    Understandably, the domestic and intra-European politics of all of this are very difficult   Then there is Japan  I really don’t think that we know nearly enough at this moment to   speak with any confidence about what the medium-term impact of the tsunami and the   consequent problems with the nuclear industry are going to be on Japan’s economy, much less   the growth or inflationary effects on the rest of the world  Ordinarily, we might think that,   notwithstanding the human tragedy, the reconstruction efforts of a rich country would provide a   medium-term fiscal boost, particularly since the devastation largely spared Japan’s industrial   base  But the scope of damage to the power infrastructure in particular, coming in the context of   more than a decade of economic stagnation and unfavorable demographic changes, raises at least   the possibility of substantially less transient and more negative effects  So my point in   rehearsing all of these possibilities is that they are very hard to work into an economic model,   formal or intuitive  We are more in the realm of uncertainty than of calculable risk, at least risks   calculable through economic analysis   Indeed, even the list of lesser but domestically grown potential downside effects on   medium-term economic growth contains items like the legal uncertainties around liability for the   foreclosure imbroglio and the prospect of accelerated fiscal contraction driven by larger political   debates  In these circumstances, it would obviously be imprudent to downplay these   possibilities  And while we may need to react should one or more of these risks be realized, it is   certainly not clear to me that even the most serious of these largely external risks has any   immediate implications for monetary policy  Thank you, Mr Chairman    Mr Chairman    Jim, isn’t there a little bit of tension between wanting to include the   $80 billion and favoring tapering?    Governor Tarullo    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I favor alternative B with Narayana’s first-  degree amendment and John’s second-degree amendment  I am sympathetic to Dennis’s   comments on the language here, but I guess, Dennis, my reaction is, we’ve already added the two   sentences in paragraph 2  I favor the addition of the last clause, the “close attention” clause, to   the second of those sentences for many of the reasons that you articulated  On my theory that   people pay attention to the changes in the statement as much as to what is in the statement itself,   I think people’s attention will already be drawn some to the recent inflation question   On Richard’s suggestion, I am indifferent, Mr Chairman, but I certainly have no problem   saying, “Currently, unemployment remains elevated,” as opposed to “the unemployment rate”    And I probably feel a little bit more about that now than I might have previously, precisely   because it’s not at all clear to me what the unemployment rate is doing right now   That’s all  Thank you  Oh, and the $80 billion a month, I don’t have strong views on   that    It’s the alignment to the constellations    This is probably a good moment to indicate that I think the   subcommittee proposal is fine, a good idea, although some of these issues do bear a little bit of   thinking  I have to say, I am concerned about ending the blackout period sooner, and I’m   concerned about it, I think, precisely because of the scenario Tom laid out, which is  Ben gives   the press conference, and then there are a bunch of people waiting for 1201 pm the next day to   go out and give their own gloss on what’s happened  And I fear that the dominant play here may   end up being defecting, in which case you get a lot of people doing it   I understand the notion of trying to give vent to different or dissenting voices, but I guess,   because my observation has been that we have had plenty of dissent, and much of it public, and   I’m not sure it has been particularly useful for the Committee as a whole, that maybe we want to   rethink a little bit the acceleration of the end of the blackout period   March 15, 2011 138 of 165               No  I just want to keep it where it is now    Janet, can I have a go at this again?  I’ve seen the very interesting   study of the actual impact on markets of utterances by different members of the FOMC, and   needless to say, having seen that study, I’m not worried about the impact on markets of   utterances by different members of the FOMC   I guess what I am worried about, Jeff, in my view, at least—reinforced by conversations   with members of the Congress, members of the media who have covered the Fed for a long time,   and academics—is that the stature of and respect for the Committee as a whole has been   adversely affected by a perception of not just good, solid policy disagreement within the confines   of the meetings, but a sense that there’s a bit of a free-for-all, and there’s a bit of a competition   for the airwaves  I would have thought that the preferable outcome would be self-restraint by   everybody, but that’s why I referred to game theory  I think there are a lot of incentives to go in   the other direction, and once somebody starts talking, then other people have the same incentive   In an ideal world, I think, you’d have a press conference by the Chairman, and then the   dominant reaction of other members of the Committee would be, “Yeah, that was pretty fair,   good,” and that’s it  Then very occasionally somebody feels, “I really think that he or she missed   something pretty fundamental that I think is important to say”  What I fear, though, is that the   afternoon after the press conference will become more Babel-like, so that’s the concern  It’s not   that people shouldn’t express their views  They certainly should  I do think that the way in   which we have evolved, with no one intending it to be this way, is that by so much, so   frequently, and in so many media expressing variant and idiosyncratic views, there’s been some   damage to the institution as a whole  That’s what I’m trying to get at  "
9217,2011-04-26,TARULLO,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Bill, in the memo that you circulated   earlier, and to some degree in your presentation this morning, there is a hint, but not an explicit   statement, of the proposition that the choice between option 1 and option 2, and variants thereon,   would be tied, at least, to the relative pace of tightening that we would eventually want to   undertake  Is that a correct inference to draw?   April 26–27, 2011 23 of 244               So let me ask this question somewhat differently  To what degree   would the pros and cons of the two options be different depending on whether the Committee’s   ultimate choice was a fairly gradual tightening or a fairly rapid tightening?    Okay  Thank you    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Bill Nelson suggested that there may be   some variants on the two options he presented  I have counted 14 so far  [Laughter]  And I think   I am going to use a strategy taken in the very best exam that I ever read from any of the roughly   2,000 students I have ever had, which was to refuse to answer the question that I had put on the   exam  I should also add some of the worst exams I ever got were ones that followed a similar   strategy  [Laughter]   April 26–27, 2011 78 of 244              As I have listened to everybody today, I am a bit concerned about where we’re heading   and what we think we are communicating by this discussion  And mindful of the Chairman’s   introduction where he suggested we are trying to find some principles, I am going to try to   identify some principles rather than programs  I think many of you have felt the tension between   these and have suggested where there is some flexibility or where you are open to other things    But for present purposes, I think it is particularly important to arm the Chairman with a smaller   number of first principles that can be developed, as appropriate, over the coming meetings   First, I think that the strategy we pursue here should be about, and principally about, our   monetary policy aims in the short run  That may sound almost tautological, but I don’t think it   is  Some people are offended by having MBSs on the balance sheet, and some people are   worried that we appear to be monetizing debt by having Treasuries on the balance sheet  Well,   we’ve got both of them on the balance sheet  And those decisions were taken, and I wouldn’t   want to see our exit strategy affected by some idealized desire to either have or not have some of   these assets on the balance sheet as an ongoing matter  Let’s instead focus on what is the best   way to achieve, as we believe appropriate, the removal of accommodation when the time comes    So that translates into, I think, a fair number of operational decisions that need to be made along   the way, but ones that should be pretty straightforward   Second, as the Chairman suggested, I think anything that we communicate ought to be   provisional  And although I didn’t take the notes that he’s been taking, because I don’t have to   synthesize everything, it seemed to me that at least half of you have suggested—whether state-  contingent or provisional or conditional—some adjective that suggests we shouldn’t be locking   ourselves in too much right now   April 26–27, 2011 79 of 244              Third, I also would like to see a pretty clear separation of the “when we exit” from the   “how we exit” questions  I think Tom is absolutely right—everybody’s views are affected, at   least on the margin, by our policy predispositions  But, again, in terms of public communication   right now, I think it’s really quite important to keep those distinct, even though it is perfectly   legitimate to address both of those questions   I would say that my fourth principle would be a certain degree of caution, particularly   with respect to unintended consequences of things we don’t understand as well as we wish we   did  Narayana suggested that we don’t rely too much on models for thinking about what the   impact of large-scale asset sales will be, and I think that’s a caution well taken  I, like Bill,   worry about yield curve effects if, for example, you had too many assets sold too quickly    Listening to you and trying to pull some of what different people have said together, it seems to   me there have been concerns about getting the balance sheet to a manageable state so that our   effect on the federal funds rate will proceed as we would like it to  At the same time, a lot of   people have shown concern that there not be too much riling of the markets because we are not   really entirely sure of how asset sales will be received  A number of you have also said that   some measure of predictability will both advance the aim of avoiding too much riling of the   markets and allow people to plan a little bit more going forward   All of those suggest to me that a fairly cautious but straightforward and largely, though   not totally, predetermined approach to asset sales, redemptions, or both is probably what’s   warranted here  I see a certain appeal to going in reverse, what Jim described as the LIFO   approach  But I think there are a couple of points of distinction that we should be aware of  One   is that the effects of these sales may differ from the effects of the purchases of the same assets   precisely because the macro and financial environments in which the transactions are taking   April 26–27, 2011 80 of 244              place are quite different  Second, to a considerable extent, we didn’t have a whole lot of choice   about the sequence that was followed on the way in  You guys moved interest rates down to   zero before I got here  Then you had your “extended period” tool, and then it became necessary   to think about large-scale asset purchases  But on the way out, we do have a choice, and I think   that assessing the pros and cons of various sequences and various combinations is probably the   better optimization of policy here   There are multiple instruments available for the removal of accommodation, and I think a   number of you have identified them  I genuinely don’t have strong priors on those, so I would   just reiterate that I think the principle should be a focus on the desired near-term monetary policy   effects, thereby putting into a secondary position what I termed “idealized aims”; second, that   this is provisional; third, that we separate “when” from “how”; and, fourth, that, particularly with   respect to asset sales, we try to adopt a gradual and predictable approach  Thank you, Mr   Chairman    I disagree  [Laughter]    Can I just ask a question?  In the same spirit in which I spoke in the   go-round, I guess I would just ask the question of how deeply you want to get into this   tomorrow, given where the Committee is right now  That is, one strategy is to try fairly, as I   think you have in your summation, to characterize how the Committee breaks down on a number   of substantive dimensions with some specificity  Another would be to try to identify genuine   consensus where it’s there, and I think you’ve got it on those three true–false questions, but in   other areas, maybe intentionally to generalize so as not to get too deeply into some of these   questions  For example, as I was listening to these guys at the end of the table, I found myself   thinking a little bit differently about the redemption versus asset sales point than I had before,   and to me it’s not so fundamental to our approach  Maybe it is to some people  I guess I just   wonder whether in a press conference you want to begin talking about those things, thereby   potentially inviting further specific questions  My question is not a rhetorical one  It’s a genuine   one   April 26–27, 2011 89 of 244               I don’t think this is a matter of being more or less transparent in a   sense because I think you’re trying to communicate where we are at this point    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Since our March meeting a lot has   happened, but I don’t think the basic lay of the land has changed significantly  Two features   continue to frame the picture  First, the economy certainly has some self-sustaining momentum,   but still not at a particularly robust pace  The well-documented obstacles to a sharp recovery   from recession that has been induced by a financial crisis have proved just as enduring as Ken   Rogoff and Carmen Reinhart predicted  At some point, obviously, obstacles such as the   overhang of foreclosed homes will recede into the background, but this hasn’t happened yet    Second, there continue to be an unusual number of essentially political or geopolitical risks,   many of which were rehearsed by Bill a few minutes ago, that could slow even further the   modest speed of the recovery   Last week I found myself lowering my economic growth projection under the cumulative   weight of these risks  Strictly speaking, I guess I probably shouldn’t do that, because I think   we’re supposed to give a modal projection rather than a number discounted based on the   combined likelihood and severity of significant risks  But the very number and persistence of   these risks, particularly the potential for more political turmoil in key oil-producing regions,   April 26–27, 2011 152 of 244              makes them hard to exclude from even a baseline projection  And as I think John mentioned   earlier, some appear already to have negatively influenced consumer confidence   This may seem like a relatively pessimistic read of the economic landscape, and I have   three responses to that  One, relative pessimism has served me pretty well in the last couple of   years  [Laughter]  Two, I note that the central tendency of the FOMC has come down to where I   was in January, and I’ve just gone down a little bit further  And, three, I do weight the risks to   economic growth to the upside in my projection, and I suspect a number of you actually weight   to the downside   Rather than going into more detail on the projection, I want to spend the rest of my time   on how we’re going to go about thinking about inflation over, I suspect, the course of the next   several meetings  A lot of people have already addressed it today  Over the weekend, one of the   many things I did instead of hunting for Easter eggs was to go through the transcripts of the   FOMC from the middle part of 2005 and from all of 2008, periods during which there had been   big run-ups in oil prices and, to some degree, other commodity prices, to see how the FOMC was   assessing what was going on and to see whether we can learn anything from that experience   I’ll return to that in a moment, but I first want to say that I think what a number of you   have tried to do today is to both develop a model or a theory or at least a mechanism for how   commodity prices or other current headline inflationary forces would carry forward into future   inflation  And then I think some of you have tried to specify what some of the tangible data-  driven indicators of those trends would be, and that seems to me not only the right but the   essential way to think about this going forward  We both have to have a concept of how we   think current pressures would persist over time, and, because we can’t for good reason afford to   April 26–27, 2011 153 of 244              wait until that actually happens, we have to try to identify what kinds of data would give us some   fairly strong basis for believing it will happen   But I contrast that with just stating things that might happen, and this is what one learns   by going back and looking at the transcripts  Concerns about commodity prices, particularly   reports of what businesses are saying—and there was a lot of this in 2005 and 2008—read like   this  “Man, we have just shifted  We are now thinking in inflationary terms”  And of course,   about six months later they weren’t  So I think that’s the kind of information that we have to   discount because it hasn’t proved particularly probative in the past  Anecdotes can help us   question what sorts of data streams would be useful, but ultimately, we need to be a somewhat   data-sensitive group when we start to make our decisions   So let me try to add one piece of information here, but this is hardly dispositive  I’m   looking again at labor markets, which won’t surprise you, and I begin with a somewhat puzzling   phenomenon of the unemployment rate having dropped so much in the last six months despite a   rate of net job creation that was, until recently, quite tepid, and even today is not particularly   robust  Without any more information than that, I think one would assume that the reason for   this phenomenon is a drop in the labor participation rate reflects the combined effects of   extended UI benefits expiring, the long-term unemployed becoming discouraged and leaving the   labor force, and the impact of a couple of years of a declining trend in participation because of an   aging population, which is just now showing up on the other side of the recession after having   been masked by the big dislocations of the past couple of years  And I think there’s something   to all these explanations  The Board staff has been trying to dig deeper in order to quantify each   of these effects, and I suspect their analyses will be of considerable importance not just for   present purposes, but for monetary policy going forward   April 26–27, 2011 154 of 244              But there are indications, admittedly preliminary, suggesting that something else is going   on here, and I’ll mention two  First, if trend participation is to be an important part of the   explanation, one would expect it to show up principally through demographics—that is,   participation rates begin to decline pretty dramatically for each five-year band of people   beginning at age 55  Even if, as seems the case, the participation rates of older Americans are   increasing now based both on choice and economic necessity, there’s such a gap between the rate   for 50-year-olds and rate for 65-year-olds that this shift would be swamped by the fundamental   fact of the baby boomers getting old   This logic of changing trend participation will probably be reflected in the data over the   medium term, but it has not been reflected in the data for the last year  The BLS doesn’t publish   age-specific data on employment and unemployment as quickly and as thoroughly as one would   like, so we’ve got to be a little cautious in drawing conclusions here  But reading the seasonally   adjusted household numbers over the last year or so, one sees something at odds with the trend   explanation  In each of the prime working decades of 25- to 34-year-olds, 35- to 44-year-olds,   and 45- to 54-year-olds, the numbers of unemployed have been falling, but in each cohort, the   number of employed workers has risen by less than the amount by which the unemployed have   fallen  Indeed, if we look at 35- to 44-year-olds, whose participation rate is historically the   highest among any age group, we see that the number of both employed and unemployed has   fallen  So there are fewer people in that age cohort employed today than one quarter ago, two   quarters ago, and three quarters ago  Significant numbers of this group have obviously left the   labor market  Now, on the other hand, contrary to what one might have expected, the number of   employed 20- to 24-year-olds has increased during this same period, which is something you   April 26–27, 2011 155 of 244              wouldn’t predict demographically  The number of employed people over age 55 has also   increased, more in line with what labor participation trends might have predicted   But going back to that central point about the three prime-age working cohorts, if the   trend explanation is, for the moment at least, not so convincing, we have to look to some of the   other standard explanations, such as exhaustion of UI benefits, to see if those are stronger  That   is, prime-age workers may be dropping out in large numbers after having exhausted their UI   benefits  Perhaps that’s true  I’m sure it is to some degree, but some yet unpublished research   by Alan Krueger suggests that something else is also going on here  Based on what I believe   was his examination of raw rather than published BLS data, he finds that in the past couple of   years, the recently unemployed have been more likely to leave the labor force than the long-term   unemployed  Now, this, obviously, is a reversal of traditional trends   Alan offers several hypotheses as to why, although he cannot demonstrate any of them   right now with currently available data  What’s important for my purposes is that most of these   hypotheses, particularly when combined with recent age-specific labor participation rates,   suggest that there may be even more slack in the labor markets than the unemployment numbers   would suggest, even when they are read through the lens of labor market participation trends    One of the most significant of his hypotheses is that middle-class people with a working partner   have shifted pretty quickly to getting more education or training to improve their skills    Presumably such people will be back in the labor market at some time in the future   All of this raises more questions than it answers, but when seen in combination with the   still very low level of quits and other factors, including the relative stagnation of unit labor costs,   I think it pushes toward there being a greater output gap and a lower medium-term NAIRU than   the usual employment statistics would suggest  While I continue to think that the unemployment   April 26–27, 2011 156 of 244              rate may tick up again later this year as people are lured back into the labor market by some   increases in job creation, Krueger’s research implies that this may not be the case  But even if   the unemployment rate continues to decline, his analysis suggests that there will still be more   real slack in labor markets   So let me conclude not with strong assertions about labor markets, but instead, again, to   suggest that for all of us over the course of the next few meetings, it’s going to be critical to try   to identify specific kinds of data and specific kinds of activity in parts of the labor market that, in   a concrete fashion, would reflect some impact of changing inflation expectations or tighter labor   markets  And I think that’s the only way, probably, we’re going to be able to develop a   consensus on what’s going on, as opposed to reverting somewhat less helpfully to our priors as   to what the models look like untethered from data  Thank you, Mr Chairman    I anticipated that [laughter], which is why I went back to 2005,   because we didn’t have a financial crisis following 2005, and there were many of the same kinds   of expectations  And I guess, Richard, what I’d say is that the 2008 transcripts are probably   more a lesson in the need to look at what else is going on  I have to say, I was taken by the   relative downplaying of financial risks and the relative playing up of inflationary risks in the   middle part of 2008    I would think that there should be something to that as well, Narayana    And it is frustrating to use the published BLS data because they simply aren’t as granular as   would be useful to us  But that’s why one of Alan’s hypotheses is particularly interesting, which   is that people are going into training or, in some cases, going into child care for their own kids   for some specified period of time    Narayana, you’d keep Jeff’s first change and revert to the original   language for the second?    Can you read that again, Charlie?    Thanks    Mr Chairman—I don’t think we have 100 percent agreement,   President Fisher, because you have been saying publicly that we have monetized the debt  And I   don’t think that that was either the intention or the action of this Committee  So I wonder if you   agree with the other part of President Evans’s statement    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support alternative B as well, but I should   say, I support it with the understanding that paragraph 3 genuinely is communicating neutrality   with respect to the potential for adjustment of holdings in one direction or another in the future   April 26–27, 2011 201 of 244              As people could tell from my remarks yesterday, I’m on the lower end of projections with   respect to expectations for economic growth  I continue to think that growth is going to be a   problem  Monetary policy is becoming trickier, and there’s no question but that the inflation   concerns that a lot of people have raised are something that we are going to need to be watching   carefully  But I don’t think at this juncture, given what I heard to be most people’s expectations   that these effects would be transitory, that we want to do anything like beginning to move toward   the exits, which I think ending reinvestment or changing the language would surely be   With respect to paragraph 2, I found myself sympathetic both with Jeff’s suggestions for   changes and with Charlie’s concerns about those changes, because I think Jeff is trying to do   what Betsy suggested, regularize the use of the language, which would probably be good for us   all  But I think Charlie’s point is, given how many terms have been used at this point, it might   sow more confusion than clarity to do so   So although I actually was comfortable with the two changes that are incorporated here,   like Betsy, I am attracted to Narayana’s compromise, which is to say, “other commodities have   pushed up inflation in recent months,” but then return to the “in a context of price stability,” and   then perhaps allow the Chairman to use a little bit of his time this afternoon to begin this process   of clarifying exactly what we mean as we talk about inflation   And I don’t have a strong view on “generally”  I think, at the margin, I would omit it    Thank you, Mr Chairman  "
9247,2011-06-21,TARULLO,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’m not sure if Richard and Eric would   extend their observations to the other time parameters that are in here  “At same time or   relatively soon thereafter”  I’m slightly uncomfortable with those, but if there’s a consensus   around the language that’s in here, I’m happy to go with it    Maybe Bill and I could supplement this a little bit, because we have   been talking about this a lot in the context of B of A and Citi, but also, to some degree, Morgan   June 21–22, 2011 87 of 282              Stanley  And I think, Eric, our best understanding, which Bill may want to supplement, is that in   the past, it’s been very hard to conceive of anybody surviving as an investment bank with an   A2/P2 rating  Bank of America may present a somewhat novel experiment, insofar as they’re   such a huge retail bank, with a very big liquidity base and lots of deposits and all the rest, which   is associated with the investment bank, but it’s by no means clear that that would be the case  So   I think our expectation has been that, at best, it would be a significant challenge for B of A, and   probably more than a significant challenge for Citi and Morgan, which is what’s led to all of the   planning by Richmond and New York over the course of eight or nine months since this first   became a possibility  Bill    That’s right  And the second thing is, I think there was a lesson,   Richard, insofar as with all three of these institutions, there’s been a heavy emphasis on liquidity   preparation over the course of the past eight or nine months  The liquidity preparation doesn’t   do anything to address the business-model question that Bill was just describing, but it does   mitigate the potential for a sudden discontinuous event    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I want to give my own rendition on a   theme on which Eric, Jeff, and Bill have already played variations—and that is, the way in which   the gap between what most people, including many of us, expected in terms of the recovery and   what has actually happened should affect the intellectual constructs that we are bringing right   now in thinking about policy  If you count this quarter as complete, there have been eight   quarters since positive GDP growth reappeared in the middle of 2009  And of those eight,   growth was significantly above trend in only two, 2009Q4 and 2010Q1  These, of course, are   the two quarters that probably benefited the most from stimulus spending and, to some degree,   probably from relief that a full collapse of the financial system had been averted  There is only   one other quarter with above 3 percent annualized growth, and just barely so  Of the other five,   June 21–22, 2011 148 of 282              one was just about at trend, given the central tendency in our forecast, and four of the eight had   economic growth well below trend, as reflected in the central tendency  So this looks to me a lot   less like a case of cruising along and occasionally hitting a soft patch than a case of slogging   through mud and once or twice hitting a stretch of dry pavement   Similarly, while the supply disruptions caused by the Japanese earthquake are surely   transitory, the lower level of defense outlays early this year probably is, and the run-up in   commodity prices may be, I recall that some other less-than-robust growth quarters over the past   couple of years have also been explained by reference to transitory factors  The factors in   question may well have been transitory, but new negative transitory factors still seem to keep   cropping up  This pattern suggests that the dominant narrative during the past year and a half of   a recovery characterized by solid, if unspectacular, growth as the economy recovers from a   serious recession may not be the best diagnosis of what has been going on  And if that’s the   case, there are obviously potential implications for policy  And, in fact, to wrap in the earlier   discussion, I think the differences among the DSGE models that Michael was explaining earlier   today reflect a lot of this, because, as we saw, the depressing New York Fed DSGE model seems   to do best, I think, because it places so much weight on the breakdown of financial   intermediation, which is obviously related to what we’ve seen over the past couple of years    This leads to a search for a better explanation for the past couple of years, one in which I know   the Board staff is vigorously engaged right now, and some suggestions about which were offered   earlier by Jeff and Bill  Jeff offered what I might characterize as a neo-declinist explanation    And Bill offered the explanation that monetary policy has maybe been   too timid  Mr Chairman, I’m not sure if you want to try the second one out in your press   June 21–22, 2011 149 of 282              conference tomorrow, but these are two possible explanations  I think there is a third, which   may not be inconsistent with Bill’s—that what made this recession so different from the other   two recessions that Larry was talking about is that this is a financially induced recession    Returning, once again, to the Rogoff–Reinhart theme that I have mentioned so many times   before, there is probably some good reason to believe that the effects of a financial crisis that   results in a serious recession take substantially longer to work themselves out more fully  I think   when we look at the performance factors that have been consistently overestimated—the house   price recovery and PCE, in particular—we see that they may well be linked to the etiology of the   crisis itself  So it does seem as though some emphasis upon the continuing effects of the direct   impact of the crisis on housing markets, on the operation of financial intermediaries, and on   residential mortgage securitization, and on servicing could accumulate into something that has a   continuing drag upon not just household wealth, but also consumer confidence and, as Tom was   mentioning earlier, the repair of household balance sheets   I would suggest one other thing, which some people have mentioned a number of times   over the past couple of years, and that is the degree to which some secular changes in the   economy that were under way before the crisis have maybe been accelerated, and have in turn   exacerbated some of the problems associated in particular with job creation  For instance, if we   have had a number of relatively mature industries that were already beginning to restructure, and   they lost employees very, very quickly during the recession, and other industries have,   understandably, not picked up the slack, you’d have a bigger effect on unemployment  Another   interesting phenomenon of this recession is that, unlike the past several, there has been relatively   little creation of new businesses that, in turn, add employment  There have been lots of new   businesses formed, but they are overwhelmingly sole proprietor businesses, which are deemed   June 21–22, 2011 150 of 282              businesses just because people file a Schedule C  In terms of new businesses that actually add   employees, the performance in the recovery from this recession has been the worst since these   numbers were kept  Other things may be going on with job creation that have been exacerbated   by the housing crisis and its aftermath   This is all hypothetical, obviously, just as I know Jeff and Bill were offering hypotheses    But I do think that there may be implications for policy going forward—and not just   retrospective, better explanations for what has happened over the past couple of years  I will   hold those for tomorrow  But at the very least, I think we all need individually to come to grips   with the degree to which our own expectations over the past couple of years have been—maybe   for some of you they haven’t—more or less continuously dashed  We need to find a better   explanation, I think, as to why, and thus what we may want to do in the future   Now two other points that have very little, if anything, to do with this theme  One,   regardless of what the right metaphor is, whether it’s cruising along with soft patches or slogging   along and hitting a little bit of dry pavement, there is no question but that the economy is   particularly vulnerable right now for all the reasons that many of you have mentioned  Janet   talked about the Middle East and North Africa, which is an area that almost fell off of   everybody’s radar over the last couple of months, but of course it’s still there, as are a bunch of   others that are not front and center  I think this raises the possibility, to change transportation   metaphors, of a stall-speed risk, and thus something else to be watching for  And then a final   point on inflation  I asked staff and others a bunch of questions about inflation, and I was struck   by the fact that they perceived persistent inflation in services  I am told that the lion’s share of   the explanation for that is in rents  And if that’s the case, that could be another byproduct of a   dysfunctional housing market  I suppose if I’m questioning whether otherwise conventional   June 21–22, 2011 151 of 282              explanations of transitory factors are actually holding, we should probably watch this as well   over the next couple of quarters  Thank you, Mr Chairman    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Like everyone else, I support alternative B    Again, I’m slightly uncomfortable with the language of B because it’s a bit more optimistic than   I would be  But as I reread it, there’s no denotation with which I disagree; I think it’s just some   of the connotations  In the interest of trying to get to agreement here in a timely fashion, I don’t   think I’ll suggest any language changes  I would be opposed to removing the reference to the   labor market, although I’m sympathetic to the point that Jeff made, that it wasn’t, strictly   speaking, backward looking  I also support John’s suggestion to remove “maintain the current   degree of monetary policy accommodation”  I wasn’t going to say anything about inflation   targeting, but I think I am now  When I came here, I was quite open minded on the subject of   June 21–22, 2011 190 of 282              inflation targeting, but I have to say, the more I listen to some of you, the more I’m afraid I read   this proposal as an effort to rewrite the Federal Reserve Act and to remove part of the dual   mandate  I guess I should say, for the record now, that I’m now drifting toward opposition to   any inflation target  Thank you, Mr Chairman    Mr Chairman, that goes, though, to what’s in paragraph 2, which is   where the expectation is stated  I didn’t note this a moment ago, but, I have to say, I was struck   by the fact that the “expectation” sentence was identical in alternatives A, B, and C  That is,   “expects the pace of recovery to pick up over coming quarters and the unemployment rate to   resume its gradual decline”  I guess what I’m saying is that I understand what you were saying a   June 21–22, 2011 196 of 282              moment ago, but isn’t it, in fact, what the Committee expects?  That is, when you said you think   it’s going to be temporary, that’s what the statement in paragraph 2 is basically saying     Thank you, Janet  I think that you and the subcommittee have done a   terrific job of walking down the middle, as Richard might have said, between excessive   generalities and excessive specificity  I do have one question, which relates to a change that you   made in response to a legitimate concern that somebody had, and the question is on paragraph 7   of the participants’ policy  This pertains to the last sentence of paragraph 7  The original   language, I believe, read, “During each blackout period, participants refrain from communicating   with members of the public about macroeconomic developments or monetary policy issues”  I   believe that the legitimate concern that was raised was that it sounded as though you couldn’t ask   somebody else what they thought was going on in the macroeconomy, which didn’t seem part of   what we had in mind  The way it’s been rephrased, though, now says, “participants refrain from   June 21–22, 2011 203 of 282              expressing their views … in meetings or conversations with members of the public,” and there’s   at least a little bit of ambiguity there, I think, suggesting that it is the forum which is dispositive   as opposed to the act of communicating the views to the public  I wonder if you’d clarify that a   bit    I think so  In essence, the subcommittee’s intention is that this means   participants refrain from, if I can put it this way, communicating their views about   macroeconomic developments or monetary policy issues to members of the public    Jim, could I ask you to clarify?  You said the blog said that we will not   make that mistake?    Except, Jim, they have the opportunity to show it to their research   director before they publish it and to get a sense if there’s a problem with it, and then that can be   worked out    Let me draw a distinction, if I could, between, on the one hand, having   to submit something for prior restraint, and, on the other hand, allowing a staff person to, on his   or her own initiative if he or she is worried about potential consequences, show it to a research   director  I think there’s a rather fundamental difference between those two    So what happens in the next sentence, Richard?    Mr Chairman, can I ask a question, though?  Picking up on Betsy’s   theme, to the degree that the inclusion of a number is very important to a couple of people and   others of us are somewhat indifferent, or at least don’t feel strongly about it, it would be   important to know whether people might vote “no” if there were no number in there  "
9271,2011-08-01,TARULLO,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I think we’re at this peculiar time right   now where people believe there’s maybe an 80 or 85 percent chance that we’re going to get by   this without a default or further turmoil in markets, but, as Bill and others have pointed out, there   is some residual chance that things may go awry in one house of the Congress  I think it actually   makes for a difficult time to have this conversation because on the one hand, we’re gripped by   experiences of the past 10 days or so and by our own predispositions on policy matters  But on   the other hand, the reality of it has, I think, receded to some degree, even though not completely    August 1, 2011 46 of 53              My own general sense is that it’s hard to make a lot of these decisions outside of a particular   context, given the rules and expectations that we’ve projected in the period running up to the   crisis itself   If you look at Brian and Bill’s checklist, I think I’m where the center of gravity is, which   is that 1 to 5 are certainly fine  Items 9 to 10 seem disconcerting in some ways but perhaps   shouldn’t be taken off the table  Items 6 and 7 strike me as particularly contingent on the   circumstances that one faces at that moment, and I find it difficult to say anything more than that   I will say one thing, though, and that is on this issue of what rules and expectations are in   place long enough before we hit the crisis, so that we’re responding to a set of credible   expectations that people have had rather than having them make everything up as we go along  I   would say on that point that we probably need to do more—certainly for the payments system, as   Louise and Betsy and a lot of other people have pointed out over the past couple of weeks—to   project what our reactions and rules will be in the event of disruptions based upon a variety of   sources   I also think that once we get into these kinds of situations—and I have felt this very   acutely for the past few weeks—that it was as incumbent upon us to tell Treasury what we would   and would not do as it was to listen to them as to what they would and would not do  And if   there comes a moment at which we are going to draw a line and say, basically, “You can’t   always assume that you can react and then we, in turn, will have to make the best of that,” I think   we might do better in contingency planning around all sides   We all agree on the money market funds, but it’s easy for us to agree because it’s not up   to us to do the regulating here  I would say on this point that I got a call from a sponsor of   money market funds last week who was very upset because his firm over the past month, in   August 1, 2011 47 of 53              preparation for potential problems, had been putting themselves in a more liquid position, and he   had gotten wind of the fact that another group of funds was fully intending to come to the   government and say, “The financial system collapses tomorrow unless you give us liquidity   assistance”  So I think it reiterates the need for the kind of regulation everybody’s talking about    The problem is, it’s not within our province to do it  I’m afraid I can’t be any more detailed than   that because I think we’re just not in the moment when we have to make that determination    Thank you, Mr Chairman  "
9294,2011-08-09,TARULLO,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Let me say up front that I asked to go first   today, not to parse economic data so much as to talk about cognitive dissonance and,   specifically, to make a plea to all of us and to remind myself audibly how important it is to resist   August 9, 2011 32 of 162              the temptation that we all naturally feel to cling to our own past beliefs and predispositions, even   in the face of a slew of dissonant data   For a year or more, I think that the implicit debate in these go-rounds during FOMC   meetings has been between those who argued that we are in an economic recovery that would be   steady, though unspectacular, with occasional soft patches, and those who argued that we are in a   weaker, halting recovery that would take a much longer time to return us to trend points in   growth and employment  Well, I think that debate is over  The side arguing steady but   unspectacular growth has lost, but it’s by no means clear that the side arguing that the recovery   was weak and halting has won  I think the meaningful debate today is whether even a weak and   halting recovery can continue or whether we’re already at or below stall speed and quite possibly   slipping into another recession  Equity markets—which, as Brian mentioned, seemed to reflect   for quite some time some of the more optimistic sentiment—have, in the past couple of weeks,   been marking down economic prospects  Yesterday they appeared to be siding with those who   think the most likely scenario is a recession, a probability assignment that strikes me as   somewhat high, or at least it would have last week   Despite the past year’s debate in which we’ve had different views, every member of this   Committee is united in having been too optimistic  I think that the most pessimistic among us, of   whom I was one, certainly did not expect that growth over the past four quarters would be only   about 16 percent, and would not have thought so even if we had been told about the impact of   Fukushima  Who among us today would stand behind the projections we made last year for   GDP growth during this year—and particularly in the second half of this year?  Almost none, if   any, I suspect   August 9, 2011 33 of 162              Most of us, I’m sure, still expect some increase in Q3 growth because of the resumption   of auto production that David mentioned a moment ago, but it seems plausible that this impact   itself will be transitory  And to the degree that expectations for a pickup in economic growth in   the remainder of this year and into 2012 were dependent on some assumed momentum from a   decent first half of the year, they are clearly unfounded  It’s not immediately clear what other   factors will contribute to an acceleration of the underlying pace of growth  Even the most   sanguine view of current conditions must acknowledge that the economy is now sufficiently   vulnerable that a modest shock could send us back into recession  Needless to say, the euro zone   situation described by Mike Leahy a few moments ago could be considerably more than a   modest shock  Many of us have been saying for some time that the Europeans had the financial   and technical resources to solve their problems if only they would exert the political will  I fear   we are fast approaching the point when this will no longer be the case  Plummeting equity   markets and tightening financial conditions, along with the blow to confidence they bring, could   surely also be more than a modest external shock to what is at best now a fragile recovery   Like investors rethinking their market positions, each of us needs to rethink our analytic   and policy positions to question the assumptions that lay behind our past expectations, and not   just to try to fit the most recent data into our prior views  We will, I am sure, spend a good bit of   time in future meetings analyzing, in the Tealbook’s rather understated formulation, the “forces   imposing greater-than-expected restraint on the expansion,” into which an honest inquiry is   likely to yield challenges to premises and beliefs held variously by most, if not all, of us in the   past year or more  This inquiry and the debates around it will surely be important in shaping our   policies and response to these forces and eventually in deciding when and how to exit  But I   would suggest that there is a more immediate task for us today—that is, to consider just how   August 9, 2011 34 of 162              perilous the current situation is and then, in light of the dangers identified by that assessment, to   consider what measures could be taken to reduce the probability of those dangers being realized    Given that the “steady growth” position has been thoroughly controverted and the “slow but   halting growth” position seriously undermined, it seems to me that the cost–benefit analysis of   additional monetary policy measures must have changed significantly  After all, both the string   of bad intermeeting data and the substantially reduced expectations, not to mention the recent   declines in markets, suggest that the factual predicates for our policy dispositions during the past   year were, to a greater or lesser extent, misplaced   Now, the economic go-round in a typical FOMC meeting is a pretty formal, almost—and   sometimes literally—scripted affair, and even the policy portion of most of our meetings tends to   play out in a fairly structured fashion, and properly so, since proposed language and alternative   policy options will quite sensibly have been proposed, modified, and much discussed before we   convene  Today, I think, should be different  The cumulative effect of the gathering evidence of   stagnation, the psychological impact of the ratings downgrade, the growing concerns that euro   zone problems may not be contained, and the global market drama of the past couple of days has   made this a potential inflection point  I hope that we can this morning operate in less scripted,   less structured fashion so that we can formulate the most appropriate response to the delicate   circumstances that confront us for actions that may be taken today or in the coming weeks  I   think we need to be a bit more nimble than we’re accustomed to being, and I hope that in the   spirit of all of us questioning ourselves, we can do that for the rest of the day  Thank you,   Mr Chairman    Bill, wasn’t that intended in part to change the language from this last   statement and to suggest that there’s been some shift since the last statement?    Mr Chairman  Could I just intervene here?  I wonder whether, in   order to crystallize points of agreement or disagreement, it might be useful—I don’t want to put   the onus on either Charlie or Janet—for one or both of them to briefly describe what is, in effect,   the transmission mechanism that they would expect  That is, if we adopted your language, Janet,   how would you see that affecting the economy?  And thus, why do you think it’s an efficacious   step to take right now?  Because I think some of the points of disagreement arise because people   are skeptical that a step will have an effect, and if we could specify that and maybe talk about   that as well as language, it might be helpful in reaching some consensus    That’s helpful  Thanks    Charlie, could you just give us an idea of what kind of action you   might consider in the event that you became convinced that economic growth was substantially   slowing and that inflationary expectations were declining?    But what’s the risk, Jim?    So no action at all?    President Fisher, would you be happier with “2014”?    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I want to begin, again, by invoking the   legal authority under which we act every time we gather around this table  And that legal   authority gives us a dual mandate  One, it doesn’t say we are supposed to promote price stability   and maximum employment so long as the rest of the government does what we’d like them to be   doing  And it does say that we have to promote both price stability and maximum employment,   and you cannot read one of those phrases out  How one balances those has obviously been a   centerpiece of US monetary policy at least since the late ’70s and probably before, but it is our   responsibility  Point two, if what I said earlier about this being a possible inflection point is   correct, I’m actually a bit concerned that simply changing the understanding of “extended   period” to what was already anticipated is not going to do much  And Mr Chairman, I do agree   with Charlie Plosser that we’re not going to dispense with speculation about QE3 by either   making or not making that change in the language   August 9, 2011 128 of 162              I’ve been listening to everybody and trying to figure out how we could maximize the   support for a particular statement here, and I’m not at all sure that I’ve got the way to do it  But   rather than state further my views on where the economy is and what monetary policy would do,   let me see if I can at least offer two suggestions that might help  First, I wonder whether there is   a way to add a qualifying or descriptive phrase that reinforces the sense that this date already   accords with our expectations for when we’d be converging on an appropriate moment to either   begin to remove or no longer grant accommodation, and thereby make it more obviously   contingent and more obviously predictive  I suggest this, Richard, mindful more of Jim’s points   about setting a date out there arbitrarily, no matter what it is, because I’m not as concerned about   the political implications of saying “2013”  Second, in trying to respond to, I think, some of   Charlie Plosser’s concerns and some that I heard from other people, I wonder whether inserting   an additional sentence in paragraph 4 might help give the public a more accurate sense of what   we did today, and thus tamp down a little bit of unwarranted speculation  We might think about   adding as a first sentence that “the Committee discussed the range of policy tools available to”—  whether it’s “promote a stronger pace of economic recovery in a context of price stability” or   “best foster maximum employment and price stability”—and then say, “It will continue to assess   the economic outlook in light of incoming information and is prepared to employ these tools as   appropriate”  The purpose for inserting that first sentence is to make clear (a) that a lot of things   other than QE3 were discussed and (b) that precisely because there’s a range of things under   discussion, action may be forthcoming, but there is by no means a commitment to do so  I think   the purpose is also to just accurately reflect to the world before the minutes come out, which is in   three weeks, that a lot of what we did today was to talk about what we might do and why we   might do it  I would hope that that could address the concerns of people who don’t want us to   August 9, 2011 129 of 162              seem too passive, while not going over the line with the concerns of people who think that we’re   not ready or that we don’t know enough to take some more tangible step right now  Having said   that, I’m going to withhold a judgment on anything because I’m not sure what’s on the table   right now  But I trust, Mr Chairman, you’re going to try to come back, distill everything, and   give us a concrete proposal on which you can again solicit people’s opinions    Okay  I’m not sure what the right language is to try that    “Projects”?    Ask the guys at the end of the table    Bill, maybe that’s the point  I think this is what Betsy was trying to   get at  If the sense of the forecast, and the forecast-dependent nature of this statement, were a bit   more explicit, that might give a little bit of comfort to those who worry that a date is being   placed out there absolutely    No, Betsy and I together, I think, are trying to address that by changing   the words to make it clearer that we’ve picked the date because of our current projections    Maybe that’s what I’m suggesting    I think somebody’s got it  [Simultaneous speakers]    Unless there’s an objection—    I think that first sentence really does help us a little bit with that “range   of policy tools”    This is Bill’s concern again?  "
9322,2011-09-20,TARULLO,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I intentionally didn’t draft up a statement   because I knew I came toward the end and wanted to hear what others had to say  Also, I knew   that if I drafted up a statement, I’d do what those of us at the end of the line always do, which is   furiously scribble throughout everybody else’s presentations to take account of what they’ve   been saying  And I did want to pay attention today  So let me start with two introductory   observations  One, as Richard said earlier, nothing that we’ve got on the table in a concrete   fashion this afternoon is presenting us with a true contingency for something dramatic   happening—the reemergence of really strong deflationary potential, the European crisis going   hot, or even just a rapid deterioration of US economic performance  And I do think it’s   important that we do some contingency planning along those lines, whether we call it something   within the existing flexible inflation-targeting framework or some other framework  LSAPs,   September 20–21, 2011 98 of 290              obviously, could be that, but we’ve only really considered LSAPs in the abstract today and not in   any particular fashion  A second and related observation echoes something Betsy said a moment   ago, which is that even though the alternatives we’re considering today for possible deployment   in the relatively near term are within the current framework, it’s worth paying some attention to   the relationship of one potential action to another, including possibly shifting toward a different   framework like nominal GDP or price targeting  With communication likely playing a more   prominent role in any further stimulus efforts, and with the importance of communication for the   credibility of the Committee on an ongoing basis no matter what our then-contemporary policy   instincts, it’s all the more important to be clear about our strategy   With those two introductory observations, let me turn to the specifics that are on the table   today  With respect to maturity extension, I absolutely agree with what everybody said  It’s a   limited step, and it’s self-limiting in a sense because there’s only so much that you can do  But   Charlie Evans said something that I’m going to echo, not in precisely the way that Charlie stated   it  Because I believe that anything we do in the communication realm is going to take some   work—it’s going to take some work through the Chairman socializing it publicly, through our   working on it and figuring things out—it may be difficult in the next meeting or two at least to   take any steps that some of us may be inclined to take to provide for monetary policy stimulus    And the maturity extension proposal is something that, precisely because it is self-contained,   does provide us an opportunity to utilize it for that limited purpose as we prepare ourselves to   either do something or at least have a framework within which we could do something with more   persistence   The only other thing I’d say is that it would be important for the efficacy of this measure   that the Treasury debt program not undermine the efficacy of the MEP by shifting the duration   September 20–21, 2011 99 of 290              composition of the Treasury debt that’s issued  I know that what they’ve been doing over the   past year or year and a half has been in accordance with a plan that they had, and it wasn’t   opportunistic in responding to what we had done  But I don’t think there’s much question that to   some degree, the shift in the composition of the debt that they issued did have the effect of   reducing the effectiveness of our own LSAP programs   Turning to communication, this is obviously a much bigger issue  I think it is pretty clear   that we are going to need to do something—hopefully sooner rather than later—to help market   actors and the public understand the implications of the mid-2013 date that we inserted in August   into our statement of expectations for low rates  It’s not in a strict sense necessary that whatever   is done to provide clarification be part of a broader change in communication efforts—or even   that it necessarily be consistent with such changes—but it would be desirable   I also believe, as more than several of you have commented, that one way or another the   SEP needs work  And I think it needs work, as John suggested, not only because it may help   produce real discussion, conversation, and clarity in our deliberations, but also because it could   serve as a complement to the statement and the minutes for communication and transparency   purposes  I’m still genuinely undecided about the best way to proceed on the discrete issue in   front of us, notwithstanding John’s very persuasive take-up of some of the things I said in my   heuristically intended memo of last week  It was an idea, not a proposal, and it’s never quite the   same thing to compare an idea with a specified proposal  So I think that before one selected   between this and the reaction function approach, one would need to fully elaborate something so   that you could poke holes in it as well  Having said that, and having listened to John today, I do   believe it would be worth developing something specific that could be compared during the   September 20–21, 2011 100 of 290              intermeeting period with the reaction function language that is embodied in paragraphs 4 and   possibly 2 of alternative A   I don’t want to rehearse everything I said in the memo last week  Just a couple more   comments on the reaction function  When I was listening to Bill and Charlie and Janet—all of   whom, I think, are proponents of this—I did pick up some differences, which I think we’ll   probably have to clarify  Charlie and Janet may not intend this, but I heard Bill to be thinking   that the paragraph 4 language is more contingent in some respects than I think Janet and Charlie   were projecting, so we’d surely need to clarify that  My own view is that it’s going to be read   closer to a rule, and the contingent element of it will probably drop some no matter what we try   to do  I would also say that I heard Janet advocate inclusion of paragraph 2  And I think, Janet,   if I’m not mistaken, you said you thought it was essential, actually, to have the paragraph 2   language, whereas Bill was suggesting maybe it would be better not to implicate that set of   issues  That will also make a big difference in how those numbers are perceived, and so one   would have to think through the consequences of both of those as well   With respect to the forecast-based approach, like Janet, I spent some time recently—I   don’t know if it was over your weekend, Janet—looking at Scandinavian central banks and   reading their monetary policy reports, which are, fortunately, in English, with very good   grammar I might note as well  And I think this may be the starting point  The Norges Bank was   my central bank of choice, having looked at a few of the alternatives  As I said in the memo, a   forecast-based approach doesn’t require as specific an ex ante agreement among FOMC   members as a reaction function  But I think maybe even more important than that—and I think   the Norges Bank experience shows this—is that because it allows us to indicate the path we   expect interest rates to follow, it provides more transparency, allows for better planning by   September 20–21, 2011 101 of 290              market actors, and allows us regularly to incorporate what may become foreseeable about future   developments, rather than relying on a quasi-rule with relatively fixed values  I also think, after   reading the Norges Bank approach, that it’s compatible with both flexible inflation targeting and   price targeting  And so there’s a certain suppleness to the approach that they’ve taken  A further   advantage of it—which didn’t occur to me as I was reading it this weekend but has in listening   today—is its effort—it dates back at least to 1983—to deal with the recurring question of   inflation targeting or targeting with a dual mandate that has consumed this Committee from time   to time  What the Norges Bank does, of course, is to establish an operational target of   25 percent, but it then sets forth the criteria for an appropriate interest rate path  By setting forth   these criteria, it maintains the inflation target but also gives a lot of emphasis to output gap and   other relevant performance features of the real economy  Those are transparent in the alternative   paths that you see in the regular reports of the Executive Board of the Norges Bank  So I think   there’s a lot of potential here not only to help with transparency but also maybe to get around this   issue that keeps coming up—because I’ll say, Jeff, as I listened to you today, I felt as though—  while you didn’t mean to do this, and you certainly weren’t doing it explicitly—you read the   unemployment mandate out of what we do here  If we can never talk about it, and we can’t   suggest that it plays an active role, then I think we begin to approach the point at which it’s not   really having the impact on our deliberations that the Congress intended   I equally understand why so many people are reluctant to attach a number to the   unemployment rate, and it seems to me that what’s done by the Norges Bank doesn’t provide a   perfect answer, but it does help  It does give some clarity, and it gives some real meat to the   notion that the path matters—how you’re getting to the 25 percent matters  I also would say that   Narayana mentioned duration in his introductory remarks  It does a bit of that as well, not as   September 20–21, 2011 102 of 290              specifically and as quantified as you would do, but I was interested in the fact that it begins its   summary by saying, “Based upon everything, we now”—in this case—“think interest rates   should be rising over the next X quarters, absent unusual developments”  Of course, I’d drop a   footnote here—their unemployment rate is 27 percent  So they’re in a slightly different   position    Yes  But inflation is 14, which is the really remarkable thing   There are obviously disadvantages here as well  If we really did what the Norges Bank   does, or something like it, we’d have to make significant changes in our institutional practices—  not only the nature of the SEP, but also consider how the Norges Bank conducts itself  As I   understand it, they meet two weeks before they actually make their interest rate decisions, at   which point they do the equivalent of thinking about the Tealbook projections and have a   discussion of that  They must be one cohesive group, because the seven of them seem to come   up with something thereafter, on the basis of which, two weeks later, they make the actual   interest rate decision  And that might pose cultural or logistical challenges for us to do   something like it  That’s just one example of what might have to be done  So obviously, one   way or another, some delay would be entailed in doing something really meaningful with the   SEP  And this will convey a less precise reaction function, though again, this would assume that   the reaction function is, in reality, quite firm   The Chairman—in a question, I think, to John—asked about the delicate situation we   have in that an entire group of 17 does our projections, but we only have, for right now, 5 plus 5   actually voting on interest rate policy  I guess, Mr Chairman, I would say that I don’t have a   specific proposal here  But it does seem to me that both are relevant  If one is looking for   September 20–21, 2011 103 of 290              credibility, then the views and projections of the nonvoting members of the FOMC are quite   relevant to providing credibility to markets at large, because even though Sandy and Jeff may not   be voting now, they’re going to be voting next year, or they’re going to be voting the year after   that  So their projections are also relevant  Thus, I might suggest a variant being two different   projections if we couldn’t come up with—as I suspect we couldn’t—the consensus adoption   (with modification) of the staff analysis that the Norges Bank seems to do   Oh, one final point  I’m sorry  This is what happens with notes  Going back to the   maturity extension point, I think John first mentioned today the idea of using MBS again, and   then Bill and Janet spoke to it, and Betsy endorsed it as well  And I would weigh in there  I   know that the earlier concern was that this looks like credit allocation, although I feel a little   boxed in here  People don’t want to do Treasury purchases because it looks like debt   monetization; they don’t want to do MBS purchases because it looks like credit allocation  If   you conclude that you want to do purchases, you’ve got to purchase something  And it does   seem, right now, for the reasons that Betsy and Bill identified, that we really could have more of   an effect  As I’ll mention later today or early tomorrow, since I think housing is right at the   center of what is keeping us in this slog right now, anything that can be done to affect housing   markets, even indirectly, would have a higher payoff  Thank you, Mr Chairman    That’s true, Jeff, and I understand what you’re saying, but you made a   point in part based on how the world would receive a statement endorsed by all or most members   of the Committee that associated a number with unemployment  I would say you can make the   converse argument  If the Committee were to come out now with an inflation target that made   no reference to unemployment, that would be construed in a very meaningful fashion as well;   personally, I think it would be construed as the embodiment of what some people in the world   advocate anyway, which is an inflation-only mandate  So you’re quite right to say the first   statement is going to attract an enormous amount of attention, but it goes both ways  Omitting   unemployment will have just as powerful a message as including something on unemployment    If not by the Red Sox themselves  [Laughter]   September 20–21, 2011 123 of 290               Note the distinction though, Jim, in what Bill just said  There’s a   difference between what Bill just said and saying, “Okay  We’re going to come back and ask for   another TARP now”  And I think that is a distinction in the minds of the Europeans    Thank you, Mr Chairman  As I read the Tealbook last week, I was   reminded of some of the wisdom of that eminent economic forecaster, Roseanne Roseannadanna    [laughter], and more specifically, her repeated comment that “it’s always something—if it’s not   one thing, it’s another”  And that’s really the story that I think all of us have been facing with   respect to economic growth over the past couple of years  There seems in the repeated narrative   to be some problem or other, which should be temporary, and it should dissipate, and at that   point growth should pick up   As all of you know, I’ve had a somewhat different story over this period, thinking   essentially that the baseline scenario was one of very tepid growth or a slog, as I’ve sometimes   described it  The stories are now converging, but it’s being further complicated by the fact that   it’s not a static story, that the changes that have taken place over the past couple of years in the   September 20–21, 2011 171 of 290              economy have changed the explanation that one can bring to bear  I think Janet alluded to this    You could have had the initial view—which was kind of my view—that we’re in the Rogoff–  Reinhart world, in which it was a financial-crisis-induced recession with a big change in asset   values, resulting in a lot of debt work-off  And to some degree, it was going to take some time,   and it was also going to take more stimulus to get the kind of kickback that you would expect in   a recession  I still believe that’s true, and it’s true particularly with respect to housing, although   as Sarah noted in her first go-round, the difficulty of the housing overhang being worked off   purely through existing market mechanisms has been demonstrated  And it’s been   disappointing—to me, to all of us—that the political branches of government have been so   alternately ineffective and uninterested in pursuing this with any great degree of attention   At the same time, though, we have to acknowledge that there are changes, and not   favorable ones, taking place in the economy  I do think that economic growth potential has   declined some during this period  I am struck by the number of non-Fed economists with whom   I’ve spoken—non-Fed economists who are not by instinct hawkishly inclined—who have made   the observation that there does seem to be a reduction in growth potential  And to some degree,   we would expect this based not only on the severity of the crisis, but also on the fact that if   production lies fallow long enough and if at least some workers are out of the labor force long   enough, their productive capacities and potential will have been diminished  I don’t think,   though, that that is the dominant explanation right now, particularly with respect to the labor   market  John said much of what I would have said, so I won’t repeat it   With respect to difficulties in finding workers, though, and the difficulties that firms   report in hiring the kinds of skilled workers they want, there is a reasonably well-documented   phenomenon whereby during high-unemployment periods, firms actually take longer to hire   September 20–21, 2011 172 of 290              workers because their sense is that with all of these unemployed people out there, there must be   somebody with exactly the right set of skills, and so their demands are actually higher for a lot of   skilled workers  Whereas in a high-growth, low-unemployment period, the human resources   mindset is, “We’re not going to get the perfect person because the perfect person already has   nine job offers; therefore, we’re just going to have to find somebody who’s good, whom we can   train, to whom we can add skills over time”  I think there may be a bit of that going on, but I’ve   been asking staff for quite a while now if they can see any indication of localized, either on a   geographic or sectoral basis, upward wage pressures, and they haven’t been able to find any, and   so I have none to report  I have no doubt that individual instances of such pressures do exist, but   it’s nothing that’s coming through in any kind of statistical series that we have  Notwithstanding   the Rogoff–Reinhart effect—the fact that there’s surely some diminution in growth potential at   least for the next few years—I think that the output gap story is still fundamentally a solid one    The question is, how much is it, and might we hit the point where structural factors are beginning   to bite a little bit more quickly?  Personally, I don’t think we’re there yet   Because a number of people raised financial regulatory issues, let me just say a couple of   things about that before I finish  And I’ll separate between the big guys and the little guys, if I   can do it that way  With respect to the big guys—separating between Europe and the United   States, but it’s, in some sense, for everyone—we have had a post-crisis reform agenda, which, in   terms of development of the regulations and requirements, we’re probably 50 percent, maybe a   little bit more, of the way through  But in terms of the implementation, we’re about 15 to   20 percent of the way through  If we were 100 percent of the way through both, I think we’d feel   substantially better about European firms and somewhat better about US firms, but the fact is,   we’re not  So the European firms have not raised the amount of capital that they needed to have    September 20–21, 2011 173 of 290              The liquidity-coverage ratio requirements, which will do a lot to constrain overdependence upon   wholesale funding, have not even been refined yet because it’s not the easiest thing in the world   to do that in a way that doesn’t undermine a lot of operation of financial markets like the CP   market, much less implement it  We’re at the point now where we’re getting, if not a crisis, at   least a lot of stress, before we’ve had an opportunity to finish the post-last-crisis regulatory   agenda  That raises concerns, and it gives me concern as well because banks, particularly   European banks, are more vulnerable than I’d like them to be and than they should be were this   agenda to have been fully implemented   Having said that, in a period of high stress you can’t generally accelerate the   implementation of that reform agenda because you’re essentially putting pro-cyclical demands   on the financial institutions  So there’s a limited amount in the short term that we can probably   do to buttress the capacities of the institutions to absorb the shocks that may be coming  As Bill   said, we have pushed our financial institutions, the big ones, to build capital through SCAP and   through CCAR earlier this year, so they are in substantially better shape because of our concerns   about potential downgrades of a few US institutions  We also about a year ago pushed them to   increase liquidity  If you look at the balance sheets, they are in way, way better shape than in   2007, much less 2008  But to refer to something else Bill said, if Europe implodes, all of what   I’ve just said is not going to provide insulation from substantial effects  They would basically   have to have 95 percent capital ratios in order to be fully insulated from the kind of effect that   the breakup of the EMU, for example, might, if it were not properly cauterized, have on the   world as a whole  I think that we in the Federal Reserve should be reinforced in our sense that   we’ve been doing the right thing, even against some fairly strong pushback from large financial   September 20–21, 2011 174 of 290              institutions, on capital in particular, but we shouldn’t believe that because of that, there’s going   to be some insulation if something truly cataclysmic happens in Europe   On the smaller banks, Richard, I just refer to what Betsy said  It’s largely a demand story   for some of the same reasons big companies are sitting on so much cash  It’s part self-insurance,   but it’s part just a lack of opportunity for projects into which they can put the cash  Having said   that, though, I think you and your colleagues are actually in a better position than Betsy, Sarah,   and I are to make the more granular assessment as to whether some supervisory practice at the   community bank level is inadvertently giving the wrong kinds of messages, because there are   hundreds, thousands of small banks being examined—I guess about a thousand, actually, by us—  and we don’t get the kind of detail and information about those routinely here, much less review   it, that we do for the large institutions  So if you and your colleagues, working with Betsy and   Sarah’s subcommittee, have some ways to generalize that, that would be great  My suspicion is,   though, this is going to be on the margin as well  Thank you, Mr Chairman    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Given that I have for some time believed   that there was no real momentum in the economy or, more precisely, that the momentum that   existed was provided only by fiscal and/or monetary stimulus measures at their peak of impact, I   do believe we are still in a position where we need further stimulus  Like many people around   the table, I would prefer that we had more of a structure within which we could provide that   stimulus as appropriate, both timing and quantity  We don’t right now, and certainly with   respect to the communications options, it’s going to take some time to develop it whether, as   September 20–21, 2011 241 of 290              Charlie Evans suggests, through public preparation before a move or through some change in the   economic projections  In light of that, I would support alternative B  The maturity extension is,   for the reasons many of you detailed yesterday, a program of limited efficacy, but as I suggested   yesterday as well, the very limitations are, in some sense, appropriate given that we don’t have a   broader structure, and I don’t think anybody is going to misunderstand this as the first step in   some broader program   On inflation, it is surely the case that inflation has been higher than many, if not most, of   the people around this table expected  On that, I would say two things  One, I find the staff’s   explanation as to why the factors pushing up inflation are temporary more compelling than the   explanation of factors as to why the relatively weak performance of the economy is temporary    And two, as many of you, most recently Janet, have suggested, if we’re not willing to   contemplate any increase in the potential inflation rate, even over a short term, notwithstanding a   path toward the long-term rate, then it doesn’t seem that we have a flexible inflation-targeting   strategy anymore  We have a hard target, and I have never understood that to be the framework   under which this Committee functioned   With respect to specifics, I’m sure whatever language those of you with an intense   interest in the inflation language come up with will be fine with me  For the reasons Betsy   stated, I also would favor paragraph 3 rather than 3′, but if there were a strong view among   others for 3′, I would not oppose it  Given what I said earlier, I am for the MBS rollover as well    Thank you, Mr Chairman    Some of these people are voting against alternative B    Yes, and Richard didn’t vote    Mr Chairman, to draw a distinction, I think you’ve been referring to   more conventional monetary policy contingencies  I believe that staff at the Board and the New   York Fed have already been thinking about liquidity facility contingencies  "
9348,2011-11-01,TARULLO,"  What were you going to pay up if he won?    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’ll begin where Esther began, with the   observation that people’s preferences with respect to things we call framework or quasi-  constitutional changes are almost always connected to substantive policy preferences  I very   much think that’s the case here, and so in part that leads me to want to bypass a lot of this   discussion in order to focus on the question of what should we be doing given the fact that we   have somewhat differing analyses of where the economy is  I think that leads to more need for   communication, but it pushes me away from a preference for structural or quasi-constitutional   changes because of my observation that writing constitutions or frameworks tends to become   more complicated precisely because there’s a different set of debates going on underneath, which   November 1–2, 2011 85 of 282              are substantive policy debates  And, while I wouldn’t foreclose any of that, having listened to   most of the conversation already today, it doesn’t strike me that there’s been an enormous   amount of convergence thus far around any new framework   The second introductory observation I’d make is that the more I’ve read in the   intermeeting period about the way other central banks do everything, do inflation targeting and   economic projections and the monetary policymaking in general, the more I have been impressed   with the—how shall I put this neutrally?—peculiarity of the Federal Reserve System  Thus the   tentative conclusion that much of what may work in other countries, in other monetary policy   committees in other systems, may not work particularly well precisely because of the different   institutional characteristics that the Federal Reserve System has   Turning to the questions that the staff put in front of us, I’m going to change the order   somewhat and start with the framework question  To Richard, I would say that the possibility of   unanticipated negative consequences is a sobering one to be sure, but one always has to balance   that with what the costs of the status quo are, and that’s where we get to substantive issues again    My own view, which won’t come as a surprise to anyone, is I am deeply distressed with the   status quo  I fear, as an increasing number of people do, that we are sliding into a period of   stagnation, which will become ever more difficult to extract ourselves from  As an ex ante   matter, I wouldn’t dismiss something just because there probably will be negative unanticipated   consequences  However, I think Janet and a number of others have pointed to anticipated   negative consequences, which could be associated with some of the framework changes, and add   to that the communications difficulties that a number of you have pointed out, and it seems to   me—again, like many, though not everybody here—that these things are worthy of continual   consideration in the event that the economy deteriorates further or, regrettably more likely   November 1–2, 2011 86 of 282              perhaps today than a few days ago, we get a major external shock sometime in the not-too-  distant future   I’m going to pair the threshold proposal with the SEP because I think they are both about   communications  As everybody knows from the last meeting, John and I were trying to push   forward onto the table the use of the modified SEP as a surrogate for the use of the thresholds,   and I continue to think that bears consideration, but I’m going to place two qualifications on my   own predisposition   First, I read the results of our initial foray here as posing more of a communication   problem than I had anticipated, and I am of the provisional conclusion that aggregating the   17 individual results is not going to do the trick  We may want to think about some alternatives,   again, taking into account the peculiar institutional characteristics of the Fed for this purpose, the   fact that we are a very large group compared with other central banks that have this kind of   exercise  The academics with whom I’ve spoken about these sorts of exercises all point to the   value of the discussion whereby the monetary policy committee critiques, and comes eventually   to some consensus, on the projected path of interest rates  I have a vivid imagination, but I have   had difficulty conjuring up the scenario in which the 17 people around this table come to a   consensus view on a projected path of interest rates  But it seems at least plausible that if staff   could construct three scenarios—one, relatively higher inflation; two, their baseline scenario;   three, relatively lower inflation—we might have the opportunity to get most members of the   Committee signing onto the proposition that if this, in fact, is the way that the economy evolves   over the next eight quarters or whatever the projection period would be, then the anticipated   federal funds rate path associated with that movement in the economy would be appropriate  I   don’t know if that’s possible either, but it seems to me worth thinking about   November 1–2, 2011 87 of 282              The second problem, which somebody alluded to earlier, and I did note this in my memo   last time, is that at present we’ve got the big balance sheet in addition to the zero interest rates    As many of us have said many times, beginning to draw down the balance sheet would be the   equivalent of a tightening move and thus would be relevant to market actors and somehow that   would be need to be factored in   Moving now to the flexible inflation approach, Jeff is absolutely right  You state the   proposition broadly enough, everybody can agree with it, and that allows everybody to tweak the   particular clauses or phrases in the formulation in order to make it fit their policy predisposition    As I’ve said before on this Committee, I was substantially more open-minded on stating an   explicit inflation target when I walked in here two years and nine months ago than I am now, and   the reason for that gets back to Esther’s observation  I think to a considerable extent, it reflects,   and would be perceived publicly as reflecting, a fairly strong, substantive preference for an   inflation target over the other side of the dual mandate   I have listened to some of us around the table who basically say that if you do price   stability well, you will promote maximum employment, which to me is very close to reading half   the dual mandate out of the statute  It is a coherent view of the world, but it’s not either what the   statute says or my view of the world, and thus I have some substantial resistance to it  There are   some environments in which the establishment of an explicit inflation target, along with the kind   of explanations of unemployment or maximum employment or output gaps that people have   mentioned, could be perceived as a balanced embodiment of the dual mandate  I don’t think that   this is one of them  Although I’m not closed-minded on the proposition, I have to say that   there’s a substantial hurdle that I feel has to be overcome before I would be comfortable with it   November 1–2, 2011 88 of 282              My last comment would be that one way to potentially make me comfortable with an   inflation target—contrary to what Esther said, as opposed to agreeing with her—is if it were put   in place as part of an exercise that was actually accommodative  That is, if the inflation target   were put in place and the rest of the explanation of the dual mandate made an effort to   communicate as clearly and credibly as we could a medium-term inflation target, while at the   same time taking the kind of substantive policy accommodation steps which I think are needed,   then it would be a different story  But as Esther’s comment reflects and as I’ve heard others   speak, it seems to me that a lot of people want actually to pull those apart because, quite   legitimately, they have a substantive policy preference for not taking further accommodative   action and, thus, don’t want to tie those two things together  Thank you, Mr Chairman    It’s CFTC rules, though, right?    But, Bill, when you said it was idiosyncratic, did you mean   idiosyncratic to the underlying problems at MF Global?    But in answer to Betsy’s question, were another firm that was a   commodities merchant to get in trouble, there is no reason to expect that the exchange treatment   of collateral would be different for them than it was in this case, right?    Are those the same accounts, or was the action on the Chicago   Mercantile independent of the private customers’ accounts?   November 1–2, 2011 111 of 282               So maybe it is related    If it is related, then it is purely idiosyncratic  If it’s not related, then it   gets to the way they conduct themselves      They can cut assets, too    I think I drew a somewhat different inference than Charlie did, because   I found myself focused on panel B in exhibit 4, which had quite a bit of variance  If at some   November 1–2, 2011 133 of 282              level the most relevant piece of information for markets is when the Fed will begin to exit—if I   looked at that, I’m not sure I would be too confident in drawing any conclusions  Go ahead    I’m talking about the lower right-hand column of panel B    Very last page, very last panel, very last graph    Yes  That returns me to the question I had earlier, which was whether,   if there were three kinds of scenarios, there would be more convergence  And this graph at least   suggests that there might not be a whole lot more convergence    Maybe that’s right    Narayana, there’s insight in that observation  How, in practical terms,   then, do you think one gets from the manifestation of everybody’s individual inclinations, which   this graph shows, on the one hand, to something resembling more of a consensus, which, I read   into your remarks, you would expect to actually be way less divergent    Yes, I was going to ask you about that   November 1–2, 2011 135 of 282               Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’m going to jettison most of the notes that   I had prepared because someone has said most of these things—though not with the literary   allusions that were included in my notes—and I want to address instead labor market issues   I think it’s worthwhile looking at the data rather than just relying on anecdotes, and as we   think about what’s happened in the labor market over the past few years, it’s important to draw a   distinction between what has happened in the past few years, presumably as a result of the   recession and its aftermath, on the one hand, and the very real long-term problems that we’ve got   in the labor market in this country, on the other hand  Basically, we’ve got to look at the delta,   and I think once we try to look at the delta rather than to absolute numbers or anecdotes that can   be drawn from one source or another, the picture becomes rather more clear   There are a variety of hypotheses about why structural problems may be greater and   greater as the result of the recession  One that has been alluded to today is, we had a bunch of   bubble sectors where there was a lot of lost employment, and so one would expect that people in   those sectors would have difficulty becoming reemployed  In the mid-’70s, we had a very   serious recession with a lot of lost employment in the Midwest in manufacturing  There were   November 1–2, 2011 181 of 282              concerns then about whether there was going to be increased structural unemployment, but a   retrospective look suggests that that was not the case  There are always some sectors in a serious   recession that suffer significantly, and at least to date in the experience since World War II, we   haven’t seen a particular impact on long-term structural unemployment increases  Something   may be different this time, but we’ve got to point to whatever it is that’s different this time than   in the mid-’70s or early ’80s   Second, we have the concern that because there’s been long-term unemployment of an   unusual and, indeed, unprecedented—since the data series was developed—nature, it seems   logical to infer that there’s going to be more structural unemployment there, that people are   going to have more trouble getting back to work  I think at some point, that is going to become a   phenomenon, but again, the data to date suggest or allow us to conclude, perhaps a tad   counterintuitively, that the probability of reemployment declined in about the same amounts for   the short-term unemployed and the long-term unemployed and has since risen in about the same   amounts for the short-term unemployed and the long-term unemployed  So, to date at least, this   hasn’t happened   Third, we’ve got a Beveridge curve phenomenon, which I refer to as shorthand for a lot   of the points about vacancies and mismatch and the like  Economists at the Federal Reserve   Banks of Cleveland and San Francisco have done a very nice job of going back pre–data series,   pre–JOLTS series to try to construct from other data approximate Beveridge curves that, again,   cover the two serious post–World War II recessions  And just as we saw this time, the   Beveridge curves get pushed out, and each time, the Beveridge curve comes back  There’s still   debate apparently among the labor economists, including the very good labor economists at the   Cleveland and San Francisco Feds, as to exactly why that was, but it does seem as though, when   November 1–2, 2011 182 of 282              you have an awful lot of unemployment growing pretty quickly, there’s a generalized disruption   in labor markets, which makes employers more likely to wait longer to fill vacancies, in   particular  It may turn out, Dennis, that the purple squirrel phenomenon is more widespread than   people think, because there does seem to be some sense that standards for hiring go up during   periods of high unemployment since employers are saying, “Gee, there must be somebody good   out there somewhere”   Finally, to the phenomena of a lack of literacy and of drug use, these are not new   phenomena  These are not deltas from the recession  We had these problems 25 years ago when   I was working on the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee  I spent time in the city of   Philadelphia with a school-to-work program, in which the greatest problem identified was the   failure of individuals to understand they had to show up to work every day  We had that   problem 25 years ago, 20 years ago, 10 years ago; we have it today; and we’re going to have it   5 years from now  It is a real problem for the productive potential of the country  It is not an   argument for the proposition that structural unemployment has increased during and as a result of   the recession  I do believe that structural unemployment has increased some, and I was actually   a bit surprised when we went through all the data, that the data don’t suggest it has increased   even more so far   The last point I would make, which I think is very important and gets to what John was   referring to earlier, is that at some point, all of this becomes a self-fulfilling prophesy  If there is   no aggregate demand, if there isn’t increased employment, if the productive facilities in both the   manufacturing and service sectors that are lying fallow now do not get back into use, the   productive capacity of the country and structural unemployment will go in the wrong direction    We are fortunate in that it doesn’t seem as though we are there yet, but it also strikes me that the   November 1–2, 2011 183 of 282              tipping point may not be that far away  And I think we can’t continue to come here as we have   for the past two years, straining to see green shoots coming out of the ground—saying, “Oh, the   signs of spring are now here”—and therefore to say we need not take any more action, only to   see another snowfall the next month  I hope Betsy is right  I hope that the underlying structural   conditions are getting closer to the point where there’s more self-sustaining momentum in the   economy, but even if there is some of that, it’s not going to move us very far or very fast in the   face of an awful lot of cyclical unemployment   What we should do about it—I guess I’m supposed to save that for tomorrow, so I will    Thank you, Mr Chairman    Thank you, Mr Chairman  A week and a half ago, I gave a speech in   which I suggested that additional purchases of mortgage-backed securities should be put back on   the top of our agenda  I carefully phrased that speech and that particular suggestion so as to say   that if things did not improve over the next couple of months, I thought we should consider it  I   qualified the formulation, really out of respect for the decisionmaking process of the Committee    In fact, I think that there is a good case to be made right now for additional MBS purchases   Before I get to that reasoning, though, I wanted to say a couple of things about the   general environment in which we’re making this decision today  First, we’re not just talking   about unemployment here  Had it been a circumstance in which the economy was growing   3½ percent a year but unemployment was remaining stubbornly high, it would have been one   thing  But that is not the circumstance that we confront  We have now had a several-year   November 1–2, 2011 226 of 282              pattern of growth that has little spurts and then reverts back to a very tepid pace  So the failure   to create more jobs seems quite logically tied to the performance of the economy as a whole  Of   course, there are some uncertainties about exactly how some sectors of the labor market would or   would not react to improved growth  But if one looks at the data, the importance of aggregate   demand and of cyclical unemployment as explanatory variables is as strong as virtually anything   that we look at in this Committee  So I do think it’s a red herring to talk about structural   unemployment or drug problems or something of the sort when we’re talking about what impact   may be had by further monetary stimulus  I appreciate Jeff’s formulation, which was basically   saying, “Yes, of course there’s room for more stimulus”  But Jeff assesses the risks of inflation   versus the stimulus, and I think that’s a legitimate conversation  I would come out on the other   side, but it does seem to me that’s the conversation we should be having   I think the case is actually quite strong, and it’s quite strong right now  Why MBS?    Well, people have already mentioned several of the reasons  The spreads are obviously one of   those reasons and the fact that we’re getting to the point where there may be some impact on   market functioning of further Treasury purchases  But I would also point to something that has   been reflected in a number of your comments over the past couple of days—that the suboptimal,   subexpected performance of the economy over the past few years, with the very disappointing   trajectory of the recovery, seems in retrospect pretty obviously tied to debt overhang, the   Reinhart–Rogoff kinds of factors that people have been citing for a while now  And the housing   sector is clearly at the center of all of that  As Betsy was indicating, in other areas there’s been a   good bit of working down of debt  Housing is what has continued to be dysfunctional  That’s   where the debt is; that’s where the failure of markets to clear is  Again, as Betsy was just   mentioning, that’s where prices and quantities don’t quite seem to be in the kind of equilibrium   November 1–2, 2011 227 of 282              that we would expect  So I think action we would take in the housing area with MBS purchases   would not only be efficacious in the way that all large-scale, long-term asset purchases would be,   but could also have a particular impact on the major impediment to the kind of recovery that   would more resemble past recoveries out of recessions   I know that a lot of people, myself included, are frustrated with the failure of the political   branches of government to take appropriate action to provide more clarity and stimulus for the   economy  But this is an instance in which there could be some synergy  Some modest steps   have already been taken to make refinancing more readily available  If we were to act by   announcing a large-scale asset purchase, I think both the public sector and the banks themselves   would see more opportunities again to leverage what we were doing to have a greater economic   impact   So the case is actually quite strong, and thus I’m very much tempted to join President   Evans in dissenting from alternative B, because I think alternative B does not accurately reflect   the state of the economy  Having said that, I believe there are a couple of reasons not to move   right now  One is the point that Narayana and John made earlier, and which Bill Dudley has   made, I think, on a number of occasions in the past several meetings—that we do need to get the   communications and the framework and the sense that we think in terms of multiple meetings   (and not just one meeting) more clear than we have  And there are some reasonable grounds for   arguing that an action by us today, whether it was A1 or A2, would once again be difficult for   markets and other observers fully to comprehend  They wouldn’t quite know how it was that we   were making decisions and why   November 1–2, 2011 228 of 282              Second, and someone alluded to this earlier also, I do think that the risks of a significant   adverse event in Europe are as high as they have been since May 2010  The risks are not just   significant—whatever the adjective above “significant” is, that’s the one we should have    “Humongous”—that’s the one that belongs in the statement as an   actual reflection of reality  Because of the increased possibility of something seriously adverse   happening, it might be prudent to withhold for now a significant additional policy initiative,   which is what I might otherwise favor, and then to assess the state of our communications, the   state of the economy, and the state of Europe over the next couple of meetings   So with considerable reluctance, I can support alternative B today  Mr Chairman, one   probably shouldn’t make one’s support or nonsupport based on any single word, except maybe   the insertion or omission of “not” in certain places  [Laughter]  But I do think that omitting   “significant,” given that it’s in the statement now and given what I regard as the increase in   financial risk since the last meeting, would be a mistake  Thanks     "
9367,2011-11-28,TARULLO,  Nothing  
9388,2011-12-13,TARULLO,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  First, with President Bullard’s permission   and based on a conversation we had during the break, I want to clarify one comment that Jim   made earlier about the divergence of the staff forecast from private forecasts  I heard Jim   mistakenly—and maybe others did too—to be referring to forecasts for US growth, but I think   actually Jim was referring to forecasts for European growth where the staff is somewhat more   pessimistic than private forecasters    That is the case—I think Steve and others and I have taken a somewhat   gloomier view than private forecasters, but what’s important to note is that everybody has moved   toward the gloomier side  I notice the Blue Chip forecast for each of the past couple of months   has gone down, and their consensus is now in slightly negative territory as well  This just   indicates that, as several of you have already pointed out, euro zone problems have gone from   being a dark threatening cloud on the horizon to still being a dark threatening cloud on the   horizon, but now almost certain to be a drag on US growth in any reasonable baseline   projection   An interesting question, of course, is whether in the absence of this impact from   Europe, the US recovery would continue to pick up pace  My own sense is that, just as has   been the case a couple of times already in the post-crisis period, the marginally better-than-  expected data over the intermeeting period would likely have proven to be just another short   stretch of dry pavement before we hit the mud again, rather than the beginning of an open road   I think the aggregate demand shortfall is still the story, with no particularly good reason   to think that there’s going to be much progress in creating the additional demand required to   move the economy more quickly toward filling the output gap  I want to say a couple of things,   December 13, 2011 72 of 198              some of which I can dispense with because John summarized very well some of the reasons to   expect that this is a short stretch of dry pavement rather than the beginning of a nice, wide, open   road     But more generally, it’s useful to recall again the origins of the circumstances in which   we find ourselves  It is a financially induced recession based on the bursting of asset bubbles   with an enormous amount of wealth lost  Board staff has been doing a lot of work on housing   policies and the housing market  One of the striking numbers that jumps out of the work they’ve   been doing is that there’s been $7 trillion in home equity lost since the peak of the housing   market about five years ago  Seven trillion dollars is obviously disproportionately in the hands   of consumers since most home equity is in the hands of the homeowners themselves  That has   clearly affected their own calculus of their wealth and their ability to take on further debt, and   indeed, their thinking about saving rates and spending in the future  That loss really has not in   any way, shape, or form begun to get worked off yet  Even if we’re dealing with retail debt,   even if we’re beginning to deal with the dysfunction of the housing market itself, there is that   enormous loss of home equity, which is not going to be replaced under the most optimistic of   scenarios for years to come   Similarly, there’s a lot of sunk capital, if I can put it that way, sitting basically fallow   throughout the United States, whether it’s in factories that are not being fully utilized or in   shopping malls that are sitting half or fully vacant at this point  This is the nature of a recession   following a period of overleverage and burst asset bubbles  There’s not a propensity to invest, to   increase supply, or to invest in more productive capacity until people are convinced, investors   are convinced, producers are convinced that there’s going to be more demand, and I really do   think that continues to be the story   December 13, 2011 73 of 198              In terms of the labor market and what it can tell us about whether there’s an output gap or   whether we’re on a more recovery-oriented path, it’s hard to use any past postwar recession as a   model for comparison with what’s going on now because none of those was a financially   induced recession  Jim referred to the two more recent recessions, which were not only not   financially induced, but also shallow  The two more severe recessions obviously were further   ago, in the early ’80s and the mid-’70s   It’s difficult to conclude very much from the comparative performance of the labor   market post this recession compared with the earlier two shallow recessions for a couple of   reasons  One, precisely because those recessions were shallow, there were not large numbers of   layoffs  We saw a striking, almost frightening hemorrhage of jobs in late 2008 and early 2009,   whereas in those earlier recessions, because they were shallower, the employment adjustment   occurred more through attrition, which took time, and indeed continued into the recovery period    That is related to a second distinguishing factor, which was that those earlier recessions followed   long periods of expansion during which it’s reasonable to think that a fair number of productive   inefficiencies got baked into the labor market, and thus it was easier for companies to increase   production in the post-recession period without increasing employment   Here, like in the earlier   severe recessions, we had a cascade of layoffs, and thus one would expect some rebound and   some reduction of the unemployment rate—because the layoffs had been so dramatic—in order   to increase production at all, and I think that’s what we’ve seen  The jury is still out on exactly   where we are with labor markets, but I don’t think that comparison of this experience with any   past recessions suggests that somehow we’re performing better here   This leads to my final observation, which is that the critical issue is whether, after five   years in which we’ve averaged less than 1 percent growth per year and with many reasons to   December 13, 2011 74 of 198              believe we will at best slog along for some time to come, we’re approaching the point at which   future potential growth may be adversely affected by this continuing period of lower economic   growth and outright recession   In the labor market, which I’ve looked at more closely than any other part of the   economy, I don’t think we’re there yet, but we’re certainly much closer than we’ve probably   ever come before in the United States, at least in the postwar period  I’ll close with a slight gloss   on Narayana’s very interesting observations earlier about the better use of unemployment as a   way of doing monetary policy  Narayana makes very good points, which would probably hold   up when the data were generalized, though maybe not in quite the same magnitudes  The one   thing I would say, Narayana, which I don’t think you’d disagree with, is that particularly because   there are some underlying structural problems in the economy, an extended period of high   unemployment and subpar economic performance could increase those structural problems and   thereby make the unemployment rate look somewhat better than it might actually look otherwise   just because of people dropping out of the labor market  With that qualification, I agree with   what Narayana said earlier  Thank you, Mr Chairman    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I favor more accommodation substantially   for the reasons stated by President Evans, and more specifically, I’d be inclined toward   paragraph 3 of Alternative A  But, I’m not going to advocate for paragraph 3 of Alternative A   for two reasons  One, obviously, we haven’t laid the foundation for additional MBS purchases   right now either internally or externally  Two, maybe less obviously, I do have some sympathy   for those who have observed that the efficacy of various monetary policy instruments in the   absence of good fiscal policy is more constrained and more limited than we’d like it to be  It   would be useful to maximize the effects of MBS purchases and consequent reductions in   mortgage rates, and that can best be done through further pursuit of a variety of initiatives, which   now, for the first time in a while, seem to be under consideration more seriously both by the   Administration and by the Congress  If we followed Bill’s advice and proselytized for the   adoption of some of these additional measures by the political branches of government, action   we took to lower mortgage rates would be augmented or amplified in the economy itself   Having said that, I do look forward to a vigorous debate in January on some of the issues   that have been latent in what many of you have said  I do think the question of efficacy is a   December 13, 2011 105 of 198              serious one  I honestly don’t understand the inflation concern  So I’d be interested in hearing   more about that in January   With respect to specific language, for the same reasons stated by Betsy, I wouldn’t favor   a change in paragraph 4 right now  Get our communications a little bit straighter  On   paragraph 5, I’m sympathetic to the point Narayana made and for an additional reason, Mr   Chairman  When we do change the language, I think people ask themselves, “What do we think   has changed in the world?”  I don’t assess the risks from Europe any greater now than I did at the   last meeting  I assessed them quite high at the last meeting, but no greater right now, and so if   someone were to infer from this that somehow there’s some greater concern we have, that   wouldn’t be quite reflective at least of my own view  Thank you    We’re going to have cake    Thank you, Mr Chairman  First, on the question of publishing FOMC   participants’ policy projections, I, as everyone knows, have been very supportive of doing so,   and I support the recommendation of the subcommittee  I do take seriously their caution about   the potential communications challenges that may ensue, and I appreciate their intention to   continue exploring refinements to this initiative   Because of the unusual, if not unique, characteristics of the FOMC compared with the   monetary policy making function of other central banks, various models for developing and   publishing policy projections would be difficult to replicate in our context  But there is a   possibility that the effectiveness of communications using the projections may need some   institutional devices beyond meeting minutes or press conferences  We should, accordingly,   probably think of the exercise we may well launch in January as somewhat provisional, not in   December 13, 2011 145 of 198              the sense that we may abandon it, but in the sense that we may well want to modify it after some   period of time   Turning now to the statement of principles, the textbook policy value of an inflation   target, or, indeed, any other set of monetary policy principles to be communicated to the public,   assumes a single, coherent view of monetary policy to be implemented by a single, coherently   functioning agent  That assumption, it seems to me, does not hold in the current case—that is, of   the FOMC  We are quite divided on our substantive views of monetary policy, as has been   reflected in virtually every FOMC meeting which I have attended in the past three years  This   divergence and this set of institutional considerations raise a set of factors that are not generally   addressed in straightforward economic treatments of the virtues of an inflation target or other set   of guiding principles for monetary policy   There are basically two ways for a group of people with significantly diverse views to   reach agreement on a text addressing a subject on which they differ  One is to work out a   substantive compromise on some or all of their points of difference  The second is to artfully   craft a text with enough left unsaid or ambiguous that all sides can credibly argue that it reflects,   or at least admits, an interpretation consistent with their favored position on issues for which   substantive compromises have not been reached  The difficulty inherent in both strategies is   obviously increased where the goal is consensus rather than a majority, or even a supermajority    I don’t think that the first strategy—that is, working out a substantive compromise—has been   either the aim or the outcome of the subcommittee’s efforts  Indeed, it would be a rather   formidable task, given the wide differences in monetary policy views held within our   Committee   December 13, 2011 146 of 198              The second strategy—that is, the artful crafting of a text—has frequently been used in   legislation and international agreements, but it can also be used in purely private contractual   transactions  Its success largely rests upon whether a coherent interpretation of that text   eventually prevails  When an authoritative interpreter exists, such as a court or arbitral panel, the   odds of ex post interpretative coherence increase, though by no means to 100 percent  In such   cases, the negotiating parties essentially take their chances that their favored position will   prevail, and they spar over wording in the negotiations in order to increase these chances  But   where there is no such authoritative interpreter, as in our case of drafting principles for the   conduct of monetary policy, the interpretive project is more complicated  Indeed, here the   most—although not only—relevant interpreters are the very parties who couldn’t agree on the   substantive compromise in the first place  Sometimes an ensuing practice of compromises on   specific decisions will over time yield de facto interpretive coherence  But sometimes parties   will stick doggedly to their opposing positions, and, indeed, publicly reemphasize their   differences as they argue for their favored views of the text  In such cases, ironically, an effort to   draft a compromise text may make compromise on specific decisions more difficult in practice   Because better communication is, if not the sole aim of this exercise, then at least its   principal aim, it seems to me important to filter the potential costs and benefits through this lens   of interpretive practice  Turning first to the benefits, they seem fairly modest at best  One would   be the incremental advantage of anchoring inflation expectations with a stated inflation target   rather than, as at present, one that is less than fully explicit but fairly widely understood to have   been adopted by a significant majority of the FOMC  It seems to me one of the lessons of the   past few years is that inflation expectations are already quite well anchored  A second potential   benefit is that it affirms the maximum employment mandate is in fact pursued by the FOMC as a   December 13, 2011 147 of 198              discrete goal rather than simply as the outgrowth of policies that produce stable prices  And,   third, there is the potential benefit for perhaps some greater clarity on how these mandates are   balanced, though, frankly, the present statement seems fairly ambiguous on this point, and   probably necessarily so, again, because of the substantive differences among members of the   Committee   The costs of such an effort seem potentially quite high, though it is not at all clear that   they necessarily would be so  One, as suggested in my little discourse on interpretive practice, is   that unless 16 of the 17 members of the FOMC take a vow of silence and refrain from offering   their own public interpretations, there is the possibility that whatever initial clarification of   FOMC collective intentions is perceived to have been provided by the statement will soon be   undone in a cacophony of speeches and other pronouncements by FOMC members  Already in   this go-round I have heard some efforts to stake out a particular interpretation of what the   statement means, and doubtless there would be other competing such interpretations   A second potential cost is, as also suggested earlier, that the public quality of these   competing efforts to interpret the text may reinforce differences of principle or approach and   thereby make agreement on specific monetary policy actions more difficult     A third potential cost is the substantial risk that the release of a statement such as this one   will bring the Federal Reserve front and center once again into the political debate—this time in   a presidential election year  This kind of political debate is most likely to arise if liberal   constituencies read the statement as embedding an asymmetric treatment of the two sides of the   dual mandate for all of the reasons with which we are familiar  But it is also possible that even a   statement such as this that does not give a specific unemployment target as a counterpart to an   inflation target could still elicit unhappiness from those who would prefer a single inflation-only   December 13, 2011 148 of 198              mandate  To me at least, it is one thing to court political controversy because of a specific policy   action, which we think necessary to achieve our mandate as an independent central bank, but it is   another to court controversy in a context in which we are attempting actually to communicate   policy more effectively   The foregoing analysis leads me to continue to have considerable skepticism about the   utility of this effort  Some of my concern might be allayed by changes in the text, notably   language that makes clear that we have a loss function that weighs deviations from each of our   two objectives equally  The way in which the statement is generally understood by analysts and   the public may also be affected by the context in which it is issued—that is, other things we are   doing or saying contemporaneous with the publication of the principles themselves  But even   with wording changes, and what I at least would consider a useful context, it would behoove all   of us to have more information on the way in which a statement of this sort would be received by   the public   I have a pretty good idea of how a single-sentence statement establishing an inflation   target would be received, but I honestly don’t know how something longer and more nuanced,   such as the statement before us, would be understood  The commentary by Fed watchers that I   have seen basically says that what is holding up an inflation target is disagreement over how to   articulate the maximum employment objective  There doesn’t seem to be any sense of what the   possibilities are   We haven’t had any testing of something like this, at least not recently, such as through   speeches of FOMC members mentioning the possibility of something of this sort  My hope   would be that we can find a way to do this, and to watch and gauge the reactions to these   December 13, 2011 149 of 198              suggestions prior to making a decision on whether adoption of something along these lines   would, on net, facilitate more effective monetary policy  Thank you, Mr Chairman    Never thought it was, Jeff    What are we voting on here?  "
9414,2013-10-16,TARULLO,"  I don’t know that that’s constitutional    Mike, in 2011, as I recall, at least one or two banks really did start to   scrape up against the leverage ratio  Is that not happening this time around?  They have seen   some surges of deposits, but not so much that they are getting toward the leverage-ratio limit?    Yes, that’s what happened last time  Okay  Thanks    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Bill, this question may be for both you and   Bill Nelson  How long would it take us to ramp up a TAF 20?    Yes  I’ve gotten very mixed views from bankers as to whether they   thought stigma would attach  But the fact that at least some think it would makes me wonder   what would happen if, the day after we made this announcement and there was a liquidity   squeeze in the market, guys don’t want to come to the window    I’m sorry  What’s that again, Bill?    Yes  That was part of the reason I was asking the question  First, to   learn how long it would take actually to get it up as it was before, but, second, whether it would   have to be reconceived in any fashion in order to be effective in current circumstances  It sounds   like the answer is “yes”    You’re fine as a policy matter?    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I have thoughts along the same lines as   Jay, but maybe slightly different or perhaps complementary   That is, my observation in the past   has been that in periods where there is a lot of financial turmoil for one reason or another,   somewhat, to me, initially, counterintuitively, some of the most effective statements, whether   from the Treasury secretary or from the Chairman of the Fed, have been very pithy—one or two   sentences that state the willingness of the government or the central bank essentially to do what it   takes to maintain financial stability  I have a little bit of concern that if we intentionally put out   the list of things that we’ve got unanimity for, and then on things where we don’t have   unanimity—and maybe since we’re not under the gun right now there’s not as much pressure and   the circumstances aren’t upon us, so we want to keep thinking about 6 or 7 or 8 or 9, and maybe   some other measures—that we might inadvertently communicate to markets that we could do 1   through 5 and maybe that’s about it  In that case the game plan might be read by some market   actors as insufficient to deal with some of the concerns that they have, and then in an odd and   almost paradoxical fashion be unhelpful as opposed to helpful  I’m not asserting it  I’m asking   the question as to whether that is a possibility, in which case we might want to reserve the   option, when we get to the time—whether it’s before the default, right around the default,   whenever it is—of a pithy statement from the Chairman with the backing of the Committee that   basically says something along the lines that Jay said a moment ago   October 16, 2013 27 of 50     Another martial metaphor    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I would not take any options off the table,   even though for some of the reasons just discussed it is not clear we would want to exercise those   options  I think Jeremy made the key point, which is that you have to imagine us in particular   states of the world that could be quite bad  One thing I have been struck by in the run-up to this   fiscal cliff, unlike the 2011 one, is the degree to which some of the key people in financial   markets are much more focused on this than they were before  Number two, they have difficulty   articulating exactly what bad things they think would happen, but they are pretty sure some   really bad stuff would happen  And that suggests to me that if this were to come to pass, we   would be in really an unprecedented situation in which we would be ill-advised to, ex ante, say   that we are going to restrain ourselves from doing things that we otherwise wouldn’t do, but in   the circumstances where the alternative is sufficiently bad, we might want to collectively hold   our noses and do  I think that’s really the most important point coming out of this, which is why   I was so concerned that the way in which we communicate what we are willing to do not be an   implicit exclusion of things that we might otherwise want to think about doing    No, he didn’t  And Bill Dudley put it well when he tried to sort of   marry the two things together  "
