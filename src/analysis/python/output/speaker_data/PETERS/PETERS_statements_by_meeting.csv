8370,2008-01-29,"  There is a large, independent SIV not affiliated with a bank, named Gordian   Knot, that is still in existence  It’s under severe pressure, but it has been weathering the storm  One   can argue it might have been more conservative than some of the other SIVs    Yes  My perception is that the people who were further down on the list   made active decisions to get out of the business or reduce their scale of the business, not necessarily   January 29–30, 2008 190 of 249    just on gut feeling but because they had invested earlier on in the staff and the models to evaluate   the product space  So they understood that the economics of the subprime business had deteriorated   and that the risk relative to the return was rising, and they made an active decision, usually, to   retract a bit from that space  Now, they may have made those decisions gradually and incrementally   over the year from mid-2006 forward  It wasn’t one stress test, but it was a thorough understanding   of the economics of the actual business that drove their decisionmaking    We need to be careful with the nomenclature  Stress testing right now in the   industry encompasses a lot of things, and people will tell you that they do stress testing, but they are   really doing static shocks  What we are talking about is not a historical analysis but a kind of   forward-looking scenario that builds in your view of the world  Those are the firms that, again,   made more-active decisions to reduce their exposures    I would say we’ve looked at a lot of that  The one place I would highlight   most articulately is the degree of international coordination and cooperation we’ve had under way    The core firms in the United States are one portion of this system now, with a number of very   significant global competitors  So the coordination between us, the OCC, the SEC, the UK FSA,   and the other senior supervisor groups has been really necessary for everyone to get a good   January 29–30, 2008 192 of 249    understanding of practices  It’s perhaps more valuable to some of the foreign supervisors who have   only one or two large firms under their jurisdictions  But even from our vantage point of what our   direct supervisory responsibility is, the consolidation within the industry has collapsed the number   of firms that we view directly  "
