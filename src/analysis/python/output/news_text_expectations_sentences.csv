0,2004-11-10,"[""WASHINGTON, Nov. 10 -- The Federal Reserve raised short-term interest rates on Wednesday for the fourth time this year, and suggested that it would continue to raise them gradually through much of next year.   The policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee raised the federal funds rate on overnight loans between banks by a quarter point, to 2 percent, a move that was widely expected.   Saying that monetary policy is still ''accommodative,'' the central bank repeated its assertion of the last several months that it would continue to raise short-term rates at a ''measured pace'' from their historic lows earlier this year. The stock market had little reaction, with the three main gauges trading slightly lower. Bond prices fell on the possibility of further rate increases.   ''Output appears to be growing at a moderate pace despite the rise in energy prices,'' the Fed said in a statement announcing its decision. ''Inflation and longer-term inflation expectations remain well contained.''   The statement suggested that officials felt no need to retreat from the Fed's strategy of gradually raising interest rates, and provided no hint of a pause in December that many analysts have been expecting.   At the same time, the emphasis on low inflation pressures indicated that officials thought they could take their time if, as many forecasters predict, economic growth slows sharply next year.   ''It's ambiguous enough that it can be spun in any direction to support your view,'' said Robert DiClemente, chief United States economist at Citigroup.   By historical standards, interest rates are still far below normal levels. After adjusting for inflation, the ''real'' federal funds rate is barely equal to zero after being solidly negative for the last two years.   On average, the federal funds rate has been about three percentage points above the rate of inflation. Most analysts think a normal or neutral rate under today's circumstances would be about 4 percent.   But members of the Federal Open Market Committee have warned against formulaic approaches.   ''I believe it to be very important that the F.O.M.C. not go on a forced march to some point estimate of the equilibrium real federal funds rate,'' Roger W. Ferguson, the Fed's vice chairman, said in a speech on Oct. 29.   Job creation, which had been very sluggish this summer and was a lingering worry for the Federal Reserve, appears to have surged by 337,000 jobs in October and to have been stronger than previously thought during August and September.   But most forecasters believe economic growth will slow from its current rate of about 4 percent this year, and some predict that it will slow to nearly 3 percent next year.   Among other factors, higher oil prices are expected to be a drag on consumer spending. The jolt from last year's tax cuts has now mostly played out, and homeowners are no longer taking advantage of low interest rates to refinance mortgages and take cash out of their homes.   The Fed chairman, Alan Greenspan, and other top officials have also noted that business executives remain more cautious about investment than is usually the case in an economic recovery, and they had been counting on business investment to be a principal source of growth.   The Federal Reserve's most recent beige book, a summary of anecdotal reports about the economy from around the country, suggested that oil prices were pinching both consumer and business spending.   Businesses ''modestly increased'' capital spending and hiring, the Fed said, and ''businesses in most districts continued to express concern over the rising cost of energy and other inputs.''   The biggest uncertainties, aside from the possibility of a terrorist attack, are about the huge United States trade deficit and the prospects for a significant fall in the value of the dollar.   The trade deficit narrowed slightly in September, the Commerce Department reported on Wednesday, but the deficit has widened by about 25 percent over the last year and is expected to widen further in the months ahead as a result of high oil prices.   Higher trade deficits subtract from domestic economic growth, and they have also led to a staggering increase in the United States' overall indebtedness to the rest of the world, which is now ballooning by more than $600 billion a year.   Laurence H. Meyer, chief economist at Macroeconomic Advisers, predicted that the economy would expand at a rapid rate of 4 percent next year, but said he had trimmed his forecast slightly to account for a slower growth in net exports.   At the same time, he predicted, consumer spending will be restrained as stimulus from President Bush's tax cuts declines and as people cling more tightly to their pocketbooks.   ''The Fed is in a tough spot,'' said Peter Morici, professor of economics at the University of Maryland. ''It has established expectations that it will increase interest rates further, and there's a lot of experience showing that it's bad to frustrate expectations. On the other hand, there is evidence that the economy is in trouble.''   Fed officials are more sanguine, with Mr. Greenspan still predicting that the economy simply entered a temporary ''soft patch'' this summer. Fed officials also feel they have room to maneuver, because inflation remains very low.   The Fed's unofficial rule is that inflation, excluding volatile sectors like food and energy, should not increase more than about 2 percent a year.   The Consumer Price Index, excluding food and energy, is up about 2 percent this year. But the Fed's preferred measure of inflation, the Commerce Department's deflator for personal consumer expenditures, shows the core rate of inflation at 1.5 percent.

1,2004-11-10,"[""Following is the text of a statement released by the Federal Reserve yesterday after the Fed's monetary policy panel, the Federal Open Market Committee, decided to raise its benchmark interest rates a quarter point:   The Federal Open Market Committee decided to raise its target for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points, to 2 percent.   The committee believes that even after this action the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative and, coupled with robust underlying growth in productivity, is providing ongoing support to economic activity. Output appears to be growing at a moderate pace despite the rise in energy prices, and labor market conditions have improved. Inflation and longer-term inflation expectations remain well contained.   The committee perceives the upside and downside risks to the attainment of both sustainable growth and price stability for the next few quarters to be roughly equal. With underlying inflation expected to be relatively low, the committee believes that policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that is likely to be measured.

2,2004-11-10,"['The Federal Reserve raised interest rates for the fourth time this year and left the door open to more increases in coming months. The Fed\'s interest-rate setting committee raised its short-term interest-rate target to 2% from 1.75%, as widely expected. The Fed has boosted the rate a quarter of a point at each of four consecutive meetings since June, when the rate stood at a 46-year low of 1%. Several commercial banks responded by raising the prime rate, a benchmark for commercial and consumer loans, to 5% from 4.75%. The Federal Open Market Committee said, as it did after each of its past three increases, that it can raise rates ""at a pace that is likely to be measured,"" leaving the door open to another increase at its Dec. 14 meeting. Economists are split on the likelihood of such an increase. ""If they see evidence hiring is holding up and consumer spending isn\'t tanking despite high oil prices, they\'ll not be too concerned,"" even if oil prices rise some more, said Peter Hooper, chief U.S. economist at Deutsche Bank, who expects a December rate increase. But Laurence Meyer, a former Fed governor now working for the forecasting firm Macroeconomic Advisers, said the Fed sees little momentum to economic growth at present. ""If the economy is stuck in this [trend] for another quarter or two, they are going to pause in December."" One wild card is the dollar. ""Even with the rate hikes, the dollar has been weakening,"" noted David Malpass, chief global economist at Bear Stearns. A lower dollar raises the prices of imports and thus puts upward pressure on inflation. Though yesterday\'s meeting was devoid of surprises, it appears to mark a transition. The past four increases have been motivated mostly by the Fed\'s desire to lift rates from emergency levels that were appropriate when deflation was more of a concern than inflation. For almost two years, the ""real,"" or inflation-adjusted, funds rate had been negative, and Fed officials considered that to be a recipe in the long run for accelerating inflation. Though 2% is still below neutral, it is now above the underlying inflation rate of 1.4%, based on the Fed\'s preferred price index. Neutral, in Fed jargon, means a level that neither stimulates nor restrains growth, and commonly is estimated at 3% to 5% in the long run. ""Now that the real fed-funds rate is out of [or very close to being out of] negative territory, the [interest rate] path is expected to become more data dependent,"" Morgan Stanley economist David Greenlaw wrote in a note to clients. The strength in employment and declines in oil prices have led markets to expect a rate boost in December, but signs of weaker consumer or business spending or another jump in oil prices could change that. The statement accompanying the rate decision gave little hint of the Fed\'s plans. It said, ""Output appears to be growing at a moderate pace, despite the rise in energy prices, and labor-market conditions have improved."" The assessment was a bit more upbeat than the one issued in September, when the Fed said output growth had regained ""some traction"" and the job market had improved ""modestly."" The Fed also said, ""Inflation and longer-term inflation expectations remain well contained."" And once again, it stated that the risks to both inflation and growth in the next few quarters were balanced. Because the Fed signaled no inclination to pause in its rate increases, futures markets continued to put about 80% odds on a quarter-point increase in December. Still, some Fed officials may want to pause. Just 10 of the Fed\'s 12 regional banks requested a quarter-point increase in the little-used discount rate to 3% before yesterday\'s meeting, whereas all 12 had asked for the three prior increases. The San Francisco and Dallas regional banks didn\'t ask for an increase before yesterday, though San Francisco did so after the meeting. The president of the San Francisco bank, Janet Yellen, recently has been more cautious on the economic outlook than her peers. The Dallas bank\'s president, Robert McTeer, resigned last week to take another job, but that was well after his bank\'s board last met. Regional-bank boards send requests to change the discount rate, which is charged on short-term Fed loans to commercial banks, to the Federal Reserve Board in Washington. Those requests usually reflect the monetary-policy recommendation of the bank\'s president. Though all 12 voting members of the 19-member FOMC supported yesterday\'s rate increase, neither Ms. Yellen nor the acting Dallas president, Helen Holcomb, have a vote this year.

3,1998-09-29,"[""WASHINGTON, Sept. 29 -- The Federal Reserve cut interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point today in an attempt to keep the financial turmoil afflicting much of the world from derailing the domestic economy. The central bank reduced the main short-term rate it controls to 5.25 percent from 5.5 percent, the smallest increment available to it, in a move intended as much to signal the Federal Reserve's deepening concern about the economy's prospects as to stimulate faster growth. It was the first time the Federal Reserve has cut rates since January 1996, and the first change in rates since March 1997. The cut in the Federal funds rate, widely anticipated by economists and investors, will put downward pressure on the rates paid by consumers and businesses and could give a slight boost to the American economy at a time when the financial crisis that began last year in Asia is hitting the United States with increasing force. Maury N. Harris, an economist at Paine Webber in New York, described it as a ''growth insurance policy'' taken out by the Federal Reserve to head off the possibility of a downturn and the need for a more pronounced rate cut later. The reduction is likely to have only a marginal effect on the problems plaguing Japan, Southeast Asia, Russia and Latin America. But to the extent it keeps the American economy healthy, the rate cut would help other countries by strengthening demand for their products from the world's biggest economy. It could also give embattled markets around the world some reassurance that Alan Greenspan, the world's most influential economic policy maker, recognizes the severity of the crisis facing them. ''It's really signaling that somebody at the top knows what's going on,'' said M. Cary Leahey, an economist at High Frequency Economics, a consulting firm. On Wall Street, where there had been some speculation that the rate cut would be half a percentage point, investors seemed disappointed that the Fed had limited the move to a quarter-point. The Dow Jones industrial average fell almost 100 points immediately after the announcement by the Fed this afternoon before rebounding somewhat to close at 8,080.52, down 28.32 points. [Page C1.] ''The big signal is that the Fed is still very cautious in how fast it moves,'' said John E. Silvia, chief economist at the Kemper funds in Chicago. ''They're confronted with two very different mixed pictures: domestic economic strength and foreign financial market concerns.'' The central bank's decision to limit the rate cut seemed to reflect the continuing concern among some of its members that with unemployment at 4.5 percent, a 25-year low, there is still a risk that upward pressure on wages could cause an inflationary spiral if growth accelerates. But in the last several months there have been increasing signs that the economy is slowing because of the problems that have devastated Asia and Russia and are threatening Latin America. Since early this month, Mr. Greenspan has been signaling that the risks from abroad are forcing the central bank to consider a rate reduction. Manufacturers and farmers have seen many of their export markets shrivel. The stock market has fallen sharply from its mid-July peak, raising questions about the ability and willingness of consumers to continue spending. Fearful of growing worldwide risks, investors and lenders have pulled back, creating the circumstances for a credit shortage. The near-collapse last week of a little-known but highly sophisticated investment firm, Long-Term Capital Management L.P., made clear that the United States was not completely insulated from jarring financial shocks. And just hours before the Fed announced its decision today, the Conference Board, a business research group, reported that consumer confidence fell sharply in September. ''The action was taken to cushion the effects on prospective economic growth in the United States of increasing weakness in foreign economies and of less accommodative financial conditions domestically,'' the central bank's policy-making Federal Open Market Committee said in a statement. ''The recent changes in the global economy and adjustments in the U.S. financial markets mean that a slightly lower Federal funds rate should now be consistent with keeping inflation low and sustaining economic growth going forward,'' the statement said. Analysts said the Fed's statement was notable for its emphasis on tightening credit conditions. Many of the interest rates that most affect consumers are already quite low, especially mortgage rates, and consumer demand has shown no signs of being inhibited by interest rates. But the problems at Long-Term Capital Management, including the losses its problems have inflicted on banks and brokerage firms, as well as a rise in the cost of capital for companies seeking financing in the stock and bond markets, have together created a developing squeeze on Wall Street. In addition to exerting a braking effect on growth, the tighter conditions could cause problems in the event that other investment firms or banks encounter difficulties linked to the global crisis. Easing the Federal funds rate -- the rate on overnight loans between banks -- would help counter that credit shortage and help avert any potential problems in the financial system. ''This is not your normal kind of rate cut,'' said G. David Orr, an economist at the First Union Corporation. ''It was not taken to stimulate an economy being hurt by high interest rates. It was taken to protect the economy from a potential credit contraction resulting from loan losses at major money center banks and brokerages.'' The Fed left unchanged, at 5 percent, the other short-term rate it controls -- the largely symbolic discount rate on loans it makes to banks. The policy panel meets twice more this year -- on Nov. 17 and Dec. 22 -- and many analysts think further rate reductions are likely, especially if growth continues to show signs of moderating or if the global crisis further unsettles the markets. ''This is just the beginning,'' Mr. Orr said. The Fed has been under growing pressure for months from Wall Street, manufacturers, farmers and other nations to cut rates. But within the central bank there has always been a band of determined inflation-fighters who are likely still to be wary of loosening policy. Their leaders this year have been Jerry L. Jordan, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, and William Poole, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. Both have expressed concern at policy meetings this year that a rapid increase in the money supply is an early warning sign of inflationary pressures. How they voted at today's meeting will not be disclosed until the minutes are released on Nov. 19; their votes at the previous meeting, on Aug. 18, will be disclosed on Thursday. The Fed may also have held to a quarter-point reduction today because of its experience in 1987, when it quickly cut rates after the stock market crash in October. Although Mr. Greenspan was widely praised at the time for increasing the flow of money into the financial system during a time of crisis, the economy proved stronger than expected, inflation began creeping up, and within months the Fed had to reverse itself and start raising rates. While Fed officials have repeatedly stressed in recent weeks that they cannot act as central bankers to the world, their decision today, especially if followed by additional easing, could have some helpful effects on the global markets. Lower American interest rates could help diminish the flow of capital from around the world to the United States, where Treasury securities have become the safe haven of choice for increasingly nervous investors. The less money flowing into the United States from abroad, the more is available for investment in other markets that need it more. In the same way, rate cuts could weaken the dollar and help encourage lower rates in other countries, aiding governments, banks and companies that are coping with debts denominated in dollars and with tumbling currency values.""]","[""washington, sept. 29 -- the federal reserve cut interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point today in an attempt to keep the financial turmoil afflicting much of the world from derailing the domestic economy. the central bank reduced the main short-term rate it controls to 5.25 percent from 5.5 percent, the smallest increment available to it, in a move intended as much to signal the federal reserve's deepening concern about the economy's prospects as to stimulate faster growth. it was the first time the federal reserve has cut rates since january 1996, and the first change in rates since march 1997. the cut in the federal funds rate, widely anticipated by economists and investors, will put downward pressure on the rates paid by consumers and businesses and could give a slight boost to the american economy at a time when the financial crisis that began last year in asia is hitting the united states with increasing force. maury n. harris, an economist at paine webber in new york, described it as a ''growth insurance policy'' taken out by the federal reserve to head off the possibility of a downturn and the need for a more pronounced rate cut later. the reduction is likely to have only a marginal effect on the problems plaguing japan, southeast asia, russia and latin america. but to the extent it keeps the american economy healthy, the rate cut would help other countries by strengthening demand for their products from the world's biggest economy. it could also give embattled markets around the world some reassurance that alan greenspan, the world's most influential economic policy maker, recognizes the severity of the crisis facing them.

''the recent changes in the global economy and adjustments in the u.s. financial markets mean that a slightly lower federal funds rate should now be consistent with keeping inflation low and sustaining economic growth going forward,'' the statement said. analysts said the fed's statement was notable for its emphasis on tightening credit conditions. many of the interest rates that most affect consumers are already quite low, especially mortgage rates, and consumer demand has shown no signs of being inhibited by interest rates. but the problems at long-term capital management, including the losses its problems have inflicted on banks and brokerage firms, as well as a rise in the cost of capital for companies seeking financing in the stock and bond markets, have together created a developing squeeze on wall street. in addition to exerting a braking effect on growth, the tighter conditions could cause problems in the event that other investment firms or banks encounter difficulties linked to the global crisis. easing the federal funds rate -- the rate on overnight loans between banks -- would help counter that credit shortage and help avert any potential problems in the financial system. ''this is not your normal kind of rate cut,'' said g. david orr, an economist at the first union corporation. ''it was not taken to stimulate an economy being hurt by high interest rates. it was taken to protect the economy from a potential credit contraction resulting from loan losses at major money center banks and brokerages.'' the fed left unchanged, at 5 percent, the other short-term rate it controls -- the largely symbolic discount rate on loans it makes to banks. the policy panel meets twice more this year -- on nov. 17 and dec. 22 -- and many analysts think further rate reductions are likely, especially if growth continues to show signs of moderating or if the global crisis further unsettles the markets. ''this is just the beginning,'' mr. orr said. the fed has been under growing pressure for months from wall street, manufacturers, farmers and other nations to cut rates. but within the central bank there has always been a band of determined inflation-fighters who are likely still to be wary of loosening policy. their leaders this year have been jerry l. jordan, the president of the federal reserve bank of cleveland, and william poole, the president of the federal reserve bank of st. louis. both have expressed concern at policy meetings this year that a rapid increase in the money supply is an early warning sign of inflationary pressures. how they voted at today's meeting will not be disclosed until the minutes are released on nov. 19; their votes at the previous meeting, on aug. 18, will be disclosed on thursday. the fed may also have held to a quarter-point reduction today because of its experience in 1987, when it quickly cut rates after the stock market crash in october. although mr. greenspan was widely praised at the time for increasing the flow of money into the financial system during a time of crisis, the economy proved stronger than expected, inflation began creeping up, and within months the fed had to reverse itself and start raising rates. while fed officials have repeatedly stressed in recent weeks that they cannot act as central bankers to the world, their decision today, especially if followed by additional easing, could have some helpful effects on the global markets. lower american interest rates could help diminish the flow of capital from around the world to the united states, where treasury securities have become the safe haven of choice for increasingly nervous investors. the less money flowing into the united states from abroad, the more is available for investment in other markets that need it more. in the same way, rate cuts could weaken the dollar and help encourage lower rates in other countries, aiding governments, banks and companies that are coping with debts denominated in dollars and with tumbling currency values.""]",58.0,,,,,,,,,1

6,2006-08-08,"['WASHINGTON -- By leaving interest rates unchanged yesterday after two years of steady increases, the Federal Reserve sought to balance the risks of a sharp slowdown and rising inflation -- an effort many economists said might not succeed. Reflecting the difficulty of the Fed\'s task, economists -- like the Fed\'s policy makers themselves -- aren\'t unanimous about what the central bank should do as the economy sends mixed signals. Some economists feel the Fed has raised rates too far already, while others say it hasn\'t raised them enough. In keeping its target for short-term interest rates at 5.25%, the Fed acknowledged that ""readings on core inflation have been elevated in recent months."" But, reiterating Chairman Ben Bernanke\'s forecast last month, it added: ""Inflation pressures seem likely to moderate over time, reflecting contained inflation expectations and the cumulative effects of monetary-policy actions and other factors."" That sentence suggests the Fed feels it has done enough, or almost enough, to rein in economic growth and nudge inflation down to a more acceptable level. Still, as it did in June, the central bank left the door open to further rate increases, saying that ""some inflation risks remain. The extent and timing of any additional [increases] . . . to address these risks will depend on the evolution of the outlook for both inflation and economic growth."" Yesterday\'s decision was widely, though not universally, expected. Stocks initially rallied on the news, but ended the day lower, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average falling 45.79 points at 11173.59. Bonds were little changed on the day. The Fed is entering what has traditionally been one of the most delicate phases of the business cycle. The economy has reached full strength and inflation pressures have built. There are signs that higher interest rates are slowing the economy, but it remains unclear if they have slowed it enough -- or too much. The Fed paused at a similar point in February 1995 and in May 2000. The first time, the economy had a ""soft landing"" -- slow growth followed by five more years of expansion. The second time, it fell into recession. If economic data ""do signal some relief on the inflation front and further softening in the economy this could be the end of the [rate-raising] cycle,"" said Al Broaddus, former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond. ""And if they\'re lucky and timed it right, that would reduce the risk that the Fed causes the economy to weaken too much."" But by retaining its bias toward raising rates, the Fed has discouraged investors from driving down long-term interest rates and made it easier to raise rates again if needed, Mr. Broaddus added. In recent months, inflation has risen above the Fed\'s informal ""comfort zone"" of 1% to 2%, excluding food and energy. The Fed attributes the rise primarily to companies passing higher energy costs on to consumers, and it believes inflation will drop back so long as energy prices stabilize and growth doesn\'t exceed ""potential"" -- the rate at which the economy can grow without straining the available work force and industrial capacity. Meanwhile, it expects economic growth to remain steady as businesses and exports offset a slowdown in consumer spending. Recent data, however, haven\'t fully supported that view. Economic growth slowed to a 2.5% annual rate in the second quarter in part because of a surprise drop in investment on business equipment. Payroll growth was sluggish, and the jobless rate rose in July. Moreover, inflation pressures appear to have been bubbling longer than previously realized. The Labor Department said yesterday that growth in nonfarm business productivity -- or output per hour worked -- in the second quarter slowed sharply to a 1.1% annual rate from 4.3% in the first quarter, and was 2.4% in the four quarters ended in June. Wage-and-benefit costs per unit of output grew 4.2% in the second quarter, and were up 3.2% from a year earlier. Unit labor costs fell in early 2004, but began growing late that year. Since then, those costs have accelerated and now are growing fast enough to eat into profit margins, which could encourage companies to raise prices. Pat Henry, executive vice president of operations at RehabCare Group Inc., a St. Louis provider of rehabilitative health services, said a shortage of physical, occupational and speech therapists is driving up wages for those positions and forcing the company to rely on costly contract labor. Last year, RehabCare raised contract rates to clients an average of 3% to 4% to compensate for higher wages. This year, Ms. Henry estimates around 50% of the company\'s contracts will see price increases. ""Labor costs keep going up, so we keep having to go back to our clients and say, ""Hey, we can\'t do this anymore at this price,\'"" she says. In its statement yesterday, the Fed didn\'t repeat its assertion in June that ""ongoing productivity gains have held down the rise in unit labor costs."" After three years in which monetary-policy decisions were relatively simple, economic crosscurrents have made the Fed\'s decisions much trickier and views within the central bank have diverged. Yesterday\'s was the first meeting since Mr. Bernanke succeeded Alan Greenspan as chairman on Feb. 1 that the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee wasn\'t unanimous. Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond President Jeffrey Lacker dissented, favoring another quarter-point rate boost. Mr. Lacker has been worried about the pace of inflation, inflationary psychology, and the Fed\'s anti-inflation credibility. In an interview with The Wall Street Journal in mid-June, he expressed concern at how much inflation expectations, as measured by inflation-indexed Treasury bonds, had fluctuated in response to new economic data. ""That\'s evidence of some residual uncertainty about our intentions regarding inflation,"" he said then. In theory, those expectations wouldn\'t move much if the markets thought the Fed would always keep inflation stable and low. Inflation expectations rose in late April, after Mr. Bernanke broached the possibility the Fed might pause in its rate increases. They later declined after the Fed talked tough on inflation and raised rates in June, and have since moved higher again, on both new data and yesterday\'s rate decision. The Richmond Fed is traditionally one of the more hawkish of the Fed\'s 12 regional banks. Mr. Broaddus, Mr. Lacker\'s predecessor, speculated that Mr. Lacker wanted another increase for ""additional credibility insurance. I probably would have gone the same way."" Futures markets now put only about a 20% probability on the Fed\'s raising rates at its next meeting Sept. 20. They see no additional increases beyond that. Economists, however, are deeply split on what the Fed should do. ""There was a strong case for pausing at 4.5%,"" said Ian Shepherdson, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics. ""There was already plenty of evidence the previous hikes had begun to soften growth."" He predicted the Fed will start to cut rates by next April. Ethan Harris, chief U.S. economist at Lehman Brothers, said the Fed shouldn\'t have paused, and predicted it will eventually raise its short-term rate target to 5.75%. ""You can\'t fight inflation without risking overkill on the economy,"" he said. ""That is a risk, and it\'s a risk they should take."" Though unhappy with the current level of inflation, Fed officials also realize the economy can change direction suddenly, especially when prices of assets -- such as stocks or homes -- fall sharply. Inflation and labor costs were both rising in 2000 when the Fed halted its previous cycle of rate increases. As it later became clear, however, the slump in stocks and business investment had already set in motion a slide into recession the following year and a big drop in inflation. Fed officials acknowledge that a key risk to their forecast is that the housing market could fall harder than they expect, with ripple effects on consumer confidence, spending and investment. Avoiding such a low-probability, high-cost event may have been a motivation for pausing. Nouriel Roubini, an economist at New York University and author of a popular economics blog, said it is already too late. ""The Fed should have tightened earlier to avoid a festering of the housing bubble early on. The Fed is facing a nightmare now: the recession will come and easing will not prevent it."" --- Christopher Conkey contributed to this article. --- Online Today: WSJ.com subscribers can read economists\' reactions to the decision, plus see how the Fed\'s statement compares with the one it released in June, at WSJ.com/OnlineToday.

7,2006-08-08,"['The dollar struggled back to end a bit below day-earlier levels after declining and then reversing course several times in the wake of the Federal Reserve\'s decision to leave its benchmark federal-funds rate unchanged. The dollar plunged in a knee-jerk reaction to the central bank\'s decision and policy statement, hitting an intraday low of 114.55 yen while the euro jumped as high as $1.2899, only to retrace its losses shortly thereafter. The pause in the Fed\'s rate-tightening campaign was largely expected, as was the tone of the policy statement which left the door open for future rate increases. After 90 minutes of choppy trading, the dollar ended the North American session close to its predecision levels, as many analysts had predicted. Volatile currency trading isn\'t unusual following an announcement from the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee because investors always adjust their positions as soon as the decision is made public. Late in New York, the euro was at $1.2848 from $1.2835 immediately before the decision and from $1.2841 late Monday. The dollar was at 115.10 yen from 115.22 yen predecision and 115.11 yen late Monday, while the euro was at 147.77 yen from 147.87 yen and from 147.82 yen late Monday. The dollar was trading at 1.2244 Swiss francs from 1.2259 francs late Monday, and sterling was fetching $1.9092 from $1.9069. ""The rate pause was as expected,"" Marc Chandler, global head of foreign exchange at Brown Brothers Harriman, said. But ""the [dollar\'s] initial knee-jerk reaction"" came as investors were ""revising down their expectations of a September rate increase."" Following the release of the central bank\'s decision, the market upgraded its expectation for a September rate increase from 44% to just under 50%. In its accompanying policy statement, the Fed said that ""inflation pressures seem likely to moderate over time,"" though ""some inflation risks remain."" Officials reiterated that they remain on guard for any signs of inflation, citing factors such as ""high levels of resource utilization"" as well as energy and commodity prices. ""The extent and timing of any additional firming that may be needed to address these risks will depend on the evolution of the outlook for both inflation and economic growth, as implied by incoming information,"" the central bank said. The move to keep the Fed funds rate, governing overnight interback loans, unchanged at 5.25% -- a 9-to-1 decision -- breaks a string of 17 straight quarter-point increases since June 2004. Yet the decision and policy statement were so close to market expectations, that the dollar\'s knee-jerk drop was short-lived and it quickly strengthened to levels close to those predecision. The as-expected statement from the Fed is therefore unlikely to change the market\'s general dollar-bearish tone, analysts said. Investors are now awaiting June wholesale inventory data slated for release today, as well as June trade data tomorrow.

8,2007-08-07,"['The dollar was down versus the yen and stronger against the euro after the Federal Reserve acknowledged recent turbulence in financial markets but didn\'t stray too far from its tightening bias. The Federal Open Market Committee voted to keep its benchmark federal-funds rate at 5.25% as expected. All eyes were on the Fed statement, which said ""downside risks to growth have increased somewhat,"" although inflation is still the ""predominant"" concern. The Fed also added language saying ""financial markets have been volatile in recent weeks, credit conditions have become tighter for some households and businesses, and the housing correction is ongoing."" Some investors -- particularly in the stock market -- had been hoping the Fed would signal a more dovish position in light of the recent credit crunch. Equities dropped sharply immediately after the statement and this sent the yen higher versus the euro and the dollar. Later on, however, stocks bounced into positive territory and the Japanese currency ceded its gains. ""The Fed didn\'t really say enough to calm market volatility, and as long as markets remain volatile, I think that risky assets will continue under pressure"" and lend strength to the yen, said Sophia Drossos, currency strategist at Morgan Stanley in New York. Late in New York, the euro was at $1.3750, down from $1.3783 late Monday, while the dollar was at 118.71 yen, down from 119.09 yen. The euro was at 163.37 yen, down from 164.05 yen, while the pound was at $2.0228, down from $2.0301. The dollar was at 1.1960 Swiss francs, up from 1.1922 francs. With the Fed still clinging close to its central scenario that inflation is its main concern, the statement did little to move the dollar versus the euro.

10,2007-08-07,"[""WASHINGTON, Aug. 7 -- The Federal Reserve kept its key interest rate unchanged on Tuesday and signaled that it still expected to avoid cutting short-term rates despite the recent tumult in credit markets and on Wall Street. The Fed suggested that it would change course only if economic conditions deteriorate badly in the weeks and months ahead.    In a statement announcing that the overnight lending rate it controls would remain unchanged at 5.25 percent, the Fed's policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee did not drift significantly from its core message that inflation remains a greater risk to the economy than recession.    The central bank, however, softened its tone slightly by giving some recognition to worsening conditions in financial markets, by adding a new phrase to its statement saying that the risk of an economic downturn has ''increased somewhat.''    ''The Fed threw the markets a bone, commenting on recent market volatility and tighter credit conditions,'' Steven A. Wood of Insight Economics wrote in a commentary. ''However, they gave no hint that they would act anytime soon.''    On Wall Street, traders had difficulty sorting out the Fed's message and by the end of the day still seemed convinced that the Fed was keeping the door open to a rate cut later this year. After falling sharply minutes after the statement was released around 2:15 p.m., stocks later rebounded, finishing trading modestly higher. The Standard & Poor's 500 stock index gained 0.6 percent and the Dow Jones industrial average added almost 36 points to close at 13,504.30.    In the futures market, the odds of a rate cut by the end of this year were reduced somewhat but still remained greater than even. Many on Wall Street had hoped that the recent tightening in credit markets would prompt the Fed to more clearly signal a shift in its focus from concern about inflation toward a greater fear of an economic downturn.    But the Fed gave Wall Street something much less definitive.    ''I think this means that the Fed isn't preparing the market for a rate cut anytime soon,'' said Tom Gallagher, a Fed analyst with the ISI Group in Washington, a financial research firm. ''On the other hand, they set up a statement that they could use to justify a rate cut if things deteriorate faster than they now expect.''    The Fed statement noted that ''financial markets have been volatile in recent weeks, credit conditions have become tighter for some households and businesses, and the housing correction is ongoing.''    ''Nevertheless,'' the statement continued, ''the economy seems likely to continue to expand at a moderate pace over coming quarters, supported by solid growth in employment and incomes and a robust global economy.''    Analysts said that the Fed appeared to be saying that the recent volatility in the markets did not appear to be spreading much beyond Wall Street.    ''They acknowledged that there is uncertainty in the markets, but that uncertainty remains a financial issue rather than a real economic issue,'' said Jack Caffrey, an equity strategist with  JPMorgan Private Bank. ''And ultimately, they're going to take their direction from the real economy.''    The stock market has been on edge in recent weeks as concern spread that tighter lending standards for everyone from large corporations to prospective home buyers could cause the economy to seize up. But the Fed saw that as unlikely to happen.    Ben S. Bernanke, the Fed chairman, told Congress three weeks ago that the central bank's economic forecast for the year had become only slightly more pessimistic since February, despite the growing problems with housing.    Analysts said one reason for the Fed's stance is that under Mr. Bernanke the central bank is more reluctant to bail out those suffering from financial losses than it was under his predecessor, Alan Greenspan, who was much more willing to ease credit in times of market uncertainty.    ''Ben Bernanke is more standoffish,'' said Drew Matus, an economist with  Lehman Brothers. ''He's the guy sitting there watching the kids in the playground. And if there's a fight, he's going to stay out of it unless somebody's going to get hurt. Greenspan was more like a doting parent.''    But the recent tightening in the credit markets poses the most significant challenge to policy makers since the Fed stopped raising rates in June 2006. In the last year, the central bank has been able to hold rates steady as economic growth moderated and it appeared that underlying inflation would soon slow to a pace of under 2 percent a year.    Now, however, policy makers appear to be facing a more jarring -- and complicated -- reality. The economy and the job market remain relatively healthy and the Fed's preferred inflation gauge -- the price index for personal consumption spending excluding food and energy -- has come down to a 1.9 percent rate after running as high as 2.5 percent early this year. But the credit market tightening has significantly raised longer-term borrowing costs for consumers and businesses.    In addition to the challenge of conducting monetary policy, there is new evidence that the productivity advances of the past decade may be ebbing.    Productivity grew at a 1.8 percent rate in the second quarter, the Labor Department said on Tuesday, but the gains of previous years were revised downward. For the first quarter, worker productivity grew at a 0.7 percent rate, off from the earlier estimate of 1 percent, and the advance for all of 2006 was set at just 1 percent, the slowest since the surge in productivity began in the mid-1990s.    Greater worker productivity makes it easier to maintain strong economic growth without adding to inflation.    Analysts on Wall Street found themselves in the awkward position of looking forward to more trouble in the economy before the Fed might come to the rescue.    If economic conditions get much worse and the Fed is ''more comfortable with the inflation outlook, that's a catalyst for an eventual easing in monetary policy,'' said Richard Berner, chief United States economist with  Morgan Stanley. ''But we're not there yet.''    Chart: ''The Fed's Words'' In its policy statement released today, the Federal Reserve made only slight changes to a paragraph that had been unchanged since March.

11,1999-10-05,"[""WASHINGTON, Oct. 5 -- The Federal Reserve voted today to leave interest rates unchanged, but warned that it was still concerned about the potential for inflation and might raise rates soon if the economy did not cool off. Economists and investors had expected the central bank's decision not to change the short-term rates it controls. But the Fed's warning about its possible next move -- in the form of a formal tilt toward a tighter monetary policy -- nonetheless jolted Wall Street and suggested that financial markets would remain jittery in coming weeks in anticipation of new data about the momentum of the economy. The Dow Jones industrial average, which had been up over 100 points just before the Fed's announcement, plummeted immediately and was down around 125 points before rebounding. It closed at 10,400.59, down 0.64 point on the day. Bond prices tumbled, sending longer-term interest rates higher. In holding rates steady for now but putting investors on notice that a rate increase could be in the offing, the Fed was trying to strike a policy balance that acknowledged both the warning signals of inflation being generated by the robust economy and the almost total lack of actual inflation outside of surging oil prices. ''They had pretty much telegraphed that they weren't going to raise interest rates this time, but they are certainly leaving their options open to do so in the future,'' said David Wyss, an economist at Standard & Poor's DRI, a consulting firm. ''They have a feeling that the economy may be doing too well for its own good.'' Fed officials, led by Alan Greenspan, the central bank's chairman, have become increasingly convinced in recent months that the economy's capacity to grow without inflation has been substantially improved by huge investments in efficiency-enhancing computers and other technology. Yet they have not abandoned their traditional rules and models, which hold that the economy cannot sustain the current combination of 4 percent annual growth and unemployment of just 4.2 percent without setting off an inflationary spiral of rising prices and wages. ''Strengthening productivity growth has been fostering favorable trends in unit costs and prices, and much recent information suggests that these trends have been sustained,'' the Fed's policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee said in a statement after its meeting today. ''Nonetheless, the growth of demand has continued to outpace that of supply, as evidenced by a decreasing pool of available workers willing to take jobs.'' Under those circumstances, the committee said, the Fed ''will need to be especially alert in the months ahead to the potential for costs to increase significantly in excess of productivity in a manner that could contribute to inflation pressures.'' The committee said its adoption of a bias toward raising rates in the future ''did not signify a commitment to near-term action'' and that it would study economic data and the state of the financial markets in coming weeks before making a decision. After long keeping decisions to adopt a policy bias a secret, the Fed has been disclosing them immediately after each meeting since earlier this year, prompting considerable confusion in the markets as to whether a bias is all but a promise of a change in policy or just an alert. In this case, analysts said that if economic reports in coming weeks showed a decline in unemployment, an increase in wages exceeding productivity increases or signs of continuing robust demand in key sectors like housing, the Fed could push rates up as soon as its next meeting on Nov. 16. The Fed has already pushed its benchmark Federal funds target rate up twice this year in quarter- point steps, to 5.25 percent. Its more symbolic discount rate stands at 4.75 percent. Fed officials are likely to pay particular attention to the employment report for September, which will be released on Friday, and the report for October, which will be released on Nov. 5. ''The implication is that if the numbers continue the way they have been recently and the stock market doesn't do anything dramatic, then the Fed will probably tighten again in November,'' said James F. O'Sullivan, an economist at J. P. Morgan in New York. The Fed's two rate increases this year have helped push up long-term rates and consumer loan rates. The housing market in particular -- a key component of economic activity -- is feeling the pinch of higher rates, with higher mortgage rates ending a surge in refinancing activity and starting to crimp home sales, which had been running at record levels. The decline over the last several months in the stock market should also help take some steam out of consumer confidence and demand, analysts said. But in some ways the economy is strengthening, with manufacturers, for example, benefiting from an increase in exports as demand from Asia and Europe rebounds. ''There is some slowing in housing and some slowing in consumption, but it's not very dramatic yet,'' Mr. O'Sullivan said. ''In the other direction, exports are accelerating, there's no weakening in business investment and inventories seem poised for an increase.'' Today's statement did not mention the possible effects on the economy and the financial system of any widespread problems that might be caused by the Year 2000 computer software problem. Earlier this year, analysts had speculated that the Fed might have to put monetary policy on hold the last several months of the year regardless of inflation pressures to avoid adding to any problems that technology might be causing in the markets or the financial system. But analysts said the Fed was now more confident that the computer problems would be contained, and that it could raise rates in November if economic conditions require it.""]","[""washington, oct. 5 -- the federal reserve voted today to leave interest rates unchanged, but warned that it was still concerned about the potential for inflation and might raise rates soon if the economy did not cool off. economists and investors had expected the central bank's decision not to change the short-term rates it controls. but the fed's warning about its possible next move -- in the form of a formal tilt toward a tighter monetary policy -- nonetheless jolted wall street and suggested that financial markets would remain jittery in coming weeks in anticipation of new data about the momentum of the economy. the dow jones industrial average, which had been up over 100 points just before the fed's announcement, plummeted immediately and was down around 125 points before rebounding. it closed at 10,400.59, down 0.64 point on the day. bond prices tumbled, sending longer-term interest rates higher. in holding rates steady for now but putting investors on notice that a rate increase could be in the offing, the fed was trying to strike a policy balance that acknowledged both the warning signals of inflation being generated by the robust economy and the almost total lack of actual inflation outside of surging oil prices.

12,2003-09-16,"['WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged as a government report that showed underlying inflation at a 37-year low kept the central bank on alert for inflation falling too much. The Fed, as expected, left its target for the federal-funds rate, charged on overnight loans between banks, at 1%, its lowest since 1958. It also said, as it has since May, that the risks to economic growth are balanced, but there is a greater risk of an ""unwelcome fall in inflation"" than of an increase. It also said that rates could remain low for a ""considerable period."" The statement accompanying the unanimous rate decision by the 12 voting members of the Federal Open Market Committee, the central bank\'s policy-making body, was almost identical to the statement after its Aug. 12 meeting. ""They don\'t want to do anything to upset the markets in terms of changing the communications strategy,"" said Janet Yellen, a former Fed governor. Indeed, there was almost no reaction in bond or stock markets. By contrast, when Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan tried in previous statements to convey that the Fed would take its time about raising interest rates, bond prices plunged and yields shot up. Still, the overall tone of the message and the minor changes the Fed did make underlined its caution on the economy and falling inflation. Despite recent strong economic data that have prompted private economists to expect growth at more than a 4% annual rate in the second half of this year, the Fed merely acknowledged, as it did last month, that ""spending is firming."" It actually struck a more pessimistic note about employment, which it said has been ""weakening,"" than it did a month ago, when it said job indicators were ""mixed."" The biggest question hanging over Fed policy is what it means by a ""considerable period."" The phrase was added last month to underline that with inflation already so low, the Fed doesn\'t need to raise interest rates as quickly as it has in previous recoveries to head off surging price pressure. The Fed\'s concern about inflation falling too low got some support from yesterday\'s Labor Department report that the consumer price index rose 0.3% in August from July, almost entirely as a result of a 2.7% jump in energy prices. Excluding food and energy, ""core"" prices rose just 0.1% and were up only 1.3% from a year earlier, the lowest annual increase since 1966. The so-called chained consumer price index, which better reflects shifting spending patterns than the regular index, shows an even lower core inflation rate of 0.8%. Either way, inflation is near the bottom of the 1% to 2% range that many Fed officials think is ideal. Below that range, there is a heightened risk that a shock to the economy could turn low inflation into deflation, or generally falling prices. Deflation can undermine the economy by squeezing heavily indebted borrowers and making it difficult for the Fed to stimulate spending. --- Journal Link: WSJ.com subscribers can see the latest economic reports, at WSJ.com/JournalLinks.

13,2003-09-16,"['NEW YORK -- On a day when Federal Reserve policy makers deliberated interest-rate policy, the focus of foreign-exchange markets was very much on a central bank from a different country: Japan. With the yen surging 1.2% yesterday against the dollar and 2.1% against the euro, investors were waiting to see whether Japan\'s Ministry of Finance -- which has been a dominant force in the markets of late -- would once again step in to stop the yen from getting too strong and derailing the country\'s export-led recovery. In the end, Japan\'s government was apparently a no-show. And while the dollar strengthened against its European counterparts, its lack of good fortune against the yen reflects the fact that currency speculators were betting Japanese authorities would be hesitant to intervene heavily to support the dollar ahead of this weekend\'s meeting of finance ministers from the Group of Seven industrialized nations.

""It\'s a very difficult market to trade right now."" Against this backdrop, investors largely ignored a decision by the Federal Reserve to leave benchmark rates on hold at a 45-year low of 1%, as expected. Once again, the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee said rates will remain low for a ""considerable period."" While noting that monetary policy and productivity growth is ""providing important ongoing support to economic activity,"" the FOMC did shift slightly from language used after its last meeting on Aug. 12, in noting that the labor market ""has been weakening."" The dollar softened slightly in a knee-jerk reaction to that statement, said John McCarthy, director of foreign exchange at ING Barings Capital Markets in New York. But he and other traders called the decision a nonevent for currency markets, and the euro quickly slipped to a low of $1.1155. Meanwhile, the yen reached its strongest level in nearly two weeks against the dollar at 116.13 yen, and a week high against the euro at 129.81 yen. Late Tuesday in New York, the euro was trading around $1.1178, down from $1.1286 Monday. The common currency was at 129.80 yen, down sharply from 132.56 yen on Monday while the dollar was at 116.18 yen, also much weaker than 117.50 yen late Monday in New York. Against the Swiss franc, the dollar was quoted around 1.3897, up from 1.3803, while sterling was trading at $1.5880, from $1.6013. The yen\'s strength was supported by an improved economic outlook for Japan and a continued influx of foreign capital. But traders said the apparent discovery in Asian trading that much-discussed bids placed with banks on behalf of the BOJ had been pulled, fueled the rally. As a result, the market pushed the yen higher still, in the process extending the already massive outstanding long yen positions. Certainly, this is the way almost the entire spectrum of foreign-exchange-market participants -- speculators, momentum funds, technical traders and longer-term global investors -- is positioned. Merrill Lynch\'s latest survey of fixed-income fund managers yesterday showed managers more bullish on the yen now than at any time in the past 10 years. Deutsche Bank\'s Russell Mellon equivalent last week showed yen bullishness to be at a nine-year high. And the latest data from the International Monetary market on the Chicago futures exchange show net yen long positions at a four-year high. However, some traders suspected the Bank of Japan, acting on behalf of Japan\'s Ministry of Finance, had a hand in keeping the dollar above 116 yen. But that was only after a loss of about 1.5 yen on the day for the dollar, and nearly a 3-yen decline by the euro. ""The yen strengthened based on the fact that people perceived the BOJ wouldn\'t be around, and probably they weren\'t,"" said Mr. McCarthy, adding that the euro and dollar probably bottomed because the selling spree simply ran out of gas. Foreigners have been heavy buyers of Japanese stocks, and the Nikkei closed up 1.6% at 10,877.03 yesterday after the BOJ upgraded its assessment of the domestic economy. Demand for Asian stocks -- and upward pressure on region\'s currencies -- remains strong, according to the latest client equity flows data from UBS Investment Bank. The Asia-Pacific region enjoyed a net $262 million inflow in the week ended Sept. 12. Meanwhile, this weekend\'s G7 meeting in Dubai has become the market\'s biggest focus, with currency policy expected to be high on the agenda. Calls on both sides of the Atlantic have grown louder for China to remove or loosen the yuan\'s peg to the dollar, which officials see as supporting Chinese exports by keeping the currency artificially undervalued. Yet while the G7 communique isn\'t considered likely to specifically target China\'s foreign-exchange policy, analysts expect it to echo comments made by U.S. Treasury Secretary John Snow on his recent trip to Asia in support of flexible and market-based exchange rates. The discussions could be sticky for Japan, which has pumped just under $80 billion into the market in the first seven months of the year to keep the yen from appreciating too rapidly, with market participants estimating there has been another $15 billion or more of intervention so far in September.

14,2003-09-16,"[""WASHINGTON, Sept. 16 -- The Federal Reserve retained its cautious outlook for the economy today, leaving short-term interest rates unchanged at 1 percent.   The decision was not a surprise as Fed officials announced a month ago that they were prepared to keep the benchmark federal funds rate at its current low levels ''for a considerable period.''   If there was an added nuance to the decision today by the Federal Open Market Committee, which sets monetary policy, it was in its slightly more pessimistic tone about unemployment. In its statement accompanying today's decision, the Fed noted that the labor market had been weakening. That reflected the continued loss of jobs last month and several unexpected jumps in the number of people seeking unemployment claims. By contrast, the Fed described labor conditions last month as mixed.   The wording suggested that Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, was more worried than before that a continuation of the relatively high unemployment rate -- slightly above 6 percent of the work force -- could affect economic growth in the months ahead.   Fed officials have made it clear they expect the economy to grow at a robust annual rate of 4 percent for the rest of the year and much of next.   But senior officials have also let it be known that they still see potential threats to the expansion that now seems to be under way. In addition to concerns about high unemployment, which could weaken consumer spending, officials view the inflation rate as uncomfortably low.   Today, the Fed repeated word for word its previous statements that ''pricing power'' of businesses is ''muted'' and that the risk of deflation is greater than the risk of inflation. ''The probability, though minor, of an unwelcome fall in inflation exceeds that of a rise in inflation from its already low level,'' the committee said. ''The risk of inflation becoming undesirably low remains the predominant concern for the foreseeable future.''   Shortly before the Federal Open Market Committee met today, the Labor Department offered new evidence that businesses had little or no margin to raise prices.   The Labor Department reported that consumer prices edged up 0.3 percent in August, which translates to an annual rate of 2.2 percent. But most of that increase stemmed from a jump in energy prices. The core inflation rate, excluding food and energy, climbed 0.1 percent last month -- an annual rate of 1.3 percent.   Recent economic data offer many signs of greater business activity and increased demand from businesses and consumers, and many economists predict the economy will expand at an annual rate of more than 4 percent in the months ahead.   Part of that growth stems from heightened consumer demand, which appears to have been stoked by the tax cuts that Congress passed this spring. But business investment has revived somewhat in recent months, and the stock market has been buoyant. Yesterday, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained 1.4 percent, the Dow industrials 1.3 percent and the Nasdaq 2.3 percent.   In a speech two weeks ago, the Fed governor, Ben S. Bernanke, said that he agreed with private-sector forecasts that economic growth would be strong but that unemployment would remain near current levels for the time being.   ''I have been of the view for quite a while that acceleration of growth to 4 percent or better in 2004 is plausible,'' Mr. Bernanke said in a speech on Sept. 4. ''I agree also that the decline in the unemployment rate, though steady, is likely to be slow.''   Today, Fed officials seemed determined to do as little as possible to excite financial markets.   The central bank is still smarting from a torrent of criticism this summer that it miscommunicated its intentions about taking extraordinary measures to avoid the possibility of a downward spiral in prices.   Based on both formal statements and informal signals by Fed officials, bond investors became convinced this summer that the Fed was about to start buying up longer-term Treasury notes to keep long-term interest rates low.   When the Fed decided not to do that, or to reduce its overnight federal funds rate below 1 percent, long-term bond rates shot up and bond prices plunged -- leading to huge losses for many bond investors.   Today, the Fed seemed bent on reassuring investors that it had no plans yet to raise interest rates, even if the economic growth did become more robust.   ''The message here is that the Fed is doing nothing for some time yet,'' wrote Ian Shepherdson, an economist at High Frequency Economics, a consulting firm in Valhalla, N.Y.   Sung Won Sohn, chief economist at Wells Fargo Bank, said the Fed paid particularly close attention to inflation statistics published by the Commerce Department that suggest even greater price restraint than that shown in the C.P.I.

16,2003-06-25,"['NEW YORK -- The dollar advanced against its widely traded counterparts in the afternoon, taking back some of the day\'s earlier losses after the Federal Reserve decided to trim U.S. interest rates less aggressively than many had expected. Prior to the Federal Open Market Committee\'s announcement of a reduction of 0.25 percentage point in the federal-funds target rate, the dollar had slipped sharply on a flurry of last-minute positioning that sent a slew of currencies to highs for the day against the dollar. Some investors had shifted to higher-yielding currencies such as sterling and the Canadian, Australian and New Zealand dollars to guard against a more aggressive 0.50-percentage-point cut that would have further widened interest-rate differentials and made dollar-denominated assets even less attractive. The euro had also benefited against the dollar, while the yen remained relatively steady, with fears of intervention by Japanese monetary authorities capping any pre-FOMC tendency for the yen to appreciate and covert Bank of Japan action believed to have supported the dollar after the rate announcement. ""This certainly wasn\'t as dramatic a move as it could have been, and at the margin it\'s positive for the dollar, providing we see positive U.S. growth numbers continuing to come through,"" said Tim Stewart, chief currency strategist with Morgan Stanley in New York, referring to the Fed\'s decision.

The Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed\'s interest-rate panel, faces conflicting trends. Job growth, retail sales and business investment all softened in March. Such developments normally call for looser monetary policy. At the same time, inflation has risen, as companies pass higher energy and raw-material costs on to consumers. That would normally call for tighter monetary policy. In its action and words yesterday, the Fed demonstrated that while it is concerned about both trends, it puts more weight on inflation. Spending growth has ""slowed somewhat, partly in response to the earlier increases in energy prices,"" the Fed said. That suggests the Fed considers the slowdown temporary: Energy prices have declined in recent weeks, and claims for unemployment insurance declined in April. The Fed said job-market conditions ""apparently continue to improve gradually."" On inflation, the Fed repeated a line from its March 22 statement that ""pressures on inflation have picked up in recent months and pricing power is more evident."" But it omitted a sentence from March 22 that said higher energy prices had yet to feed through to consumers. The omission follows two months of elevated gains in consumer prices that have lifted inflation excluding food and energy, according to the Fed\'s preferred price index, from 1.2% early last year to 1.7% in March. That\'s at the top of the 1.5% to 1.75% range Fed officials had forecast for later this year. As it did after its four prior meetings, the Fed said inflation expectations are ""well contained."" But in an unusual error, the statement first issued at 2:15 p.m. EDT didn\'t include that sentence. Wall Street analysts at first pounced on the omission as evidence of even greater inflation worries, noting a recent University of Michigan consumer survey found higher expected inflation. ""Any time a central bank removes a phrase that long-term inflation expectations remain well contained from a statement, we should take notice,"" J.P. Morgan Chase initially said in a note to clients. The Fed corrected the statement at around 4 p.m. A Fed spokeswoman said the sentence was in the actual draft statement that FOMC members discussed in their meeting. The omission occurred inadvertently when Fed staff were preparing it for public release, she said. The omission was noticed by a Fed staffer and corrected immediately, she said. The gyrations of markets and analysts in response to the error and subsequent correction attest to the enormous impact just a few of the Fed\'s words now carry. Changes to the federal-funds rate ripple out to rates charged on a variety of consumer and business savings-and-loan rates. Commercial banks announced that they were raising their prime lending rate, the benchmark for many loans, to 6% from 5.75%. The Fed also raised its less-important discount rate, charged on short-term central-bank loans to commercial banks, to 4% from 3.75%. Eleven of the 12 voting members of the 19-member Federal Open Market Committee voted in favor of the rate change. Governor Ben Bernanke has recused himself from FOMC deliberations as he awaits confirmation to become chairman of President Bush\'s Council of Economic Advisers. Fed officials have puzzled over why the yield on the 10-year Treasury bond is lower now than it was when the Fed started raising rates last June. Yields, which reflect in part expectations for where the federal-funds rate will be, normally rise when the Fed tightens. Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan in February called low yields a ""conundrum,"" suggesting that he thinks the federal-funds rate would go higher this year than the 3.75% the futures market now expects. His remarks helped send the Treasury yield from below 4.2% to above 4.6% during the winter, but it has since returned to below 4.2%. ""The markets are always a little ahead of the Fed,"" said Peter McTeague, interest-rate strategist at RBS Greenwich Capital. ""It\'s less of a conundrum why rates are here because the trajectory of the economy is different from what it was a few weeks ago."" ""The bond market is telling us the risk of recession is higher than the Fed thinks,"" Kevin Hassett, economist at the American Enterprise Institute, told a panel discussion hosted by the institute. Inflation isn\'t the risk that the Fed seems to think it is, Mr. Hassett said, because it reflects global, not U.S., demand for oil and other commodities. Data in the next eight weeks, including Friday\'s jobs report, will help determine whether the Fed or the bond market is right. Continued softness could force the Fed to reconsider its hawkish stance and its ""measured"" pace. The use of ""measured"" has been a source of growing debate inside the central bank. Some officials believe the phrase limits their flexibility, and gives investors a false sense of certainty about the Fed\'s actions. Most officials feel it gives the markets useful information but acknowledge that as inflation pressures mount and the federal-funds rate approaches a more normal level, the sentence will have to go. But the word survives in part out of worries that dropping it would elevate expectations of an imminent shift to bigger rate increases. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York\'s trading desk asked bond dealers last week if they expected ""measured"" to change, and how they would interpret such a change. Bank of America chief economist Mickey Levy said that rather than scrap ""measured,"" the Fed can ""just use more and more descriptive language to describe economic and inflation conditions and let that more colorful language supersede the importance of the term measured."" Mr. McTeague said minutes of the Fed\'s March 22 meeting ""suggest measured could mean anything. . . . They watered down the meaning of it, but the fact they left it in there probably comforts some people in the markets."" --- Journal Link: WSJ.com subscribers can see a graphic scrutinizing the Fed\'s statement and read economists\' reactions to the rate increase, at WSJ.com/JournalLinks.

20,2005-05-03,"['Financial markets accustomed to the Federal Reserve\'s fine-tuned communications strategy got a rude awakening yesterday, when the central bank issued a late amendment to its policy statement that appeared to modestly alter its assessment of inflation. The benchmark 10-year Treasury note, which had slipped modestly in the wake of the Federal Open Market Committee\'s original statement, ended the day higher, while shorter-dated issues managed to pare their losses after the Fed reinserted into its policy statement the line that ""longer-term inflation expectations remain well contained."" The apparent dropping of that line in the FOMC\'s earlier statement, issued at 2:15 p.m. EDT, had been pounced on by many in the markets as evidence of a more-hawkish bent from the Fed, as well as proof that it didn\'t intend to pause at any point in its monetary-tightening cycle. The correction, released just before 4 p.m., seemed to alter that view, fueling gains in bond prices. ""As a further irony, the bond-market rally after the Fed\'s revision to the statement has been larger than would have been the case if the Fed had left the sentence in to begin with,"" said Alan Ruskin, head of research at financial consultancy 4Cast in New York. At 4 p.m., the benchmark 10-year note was up 5/32, or $1.56 per $1,000 face value, at 98 19/32. Its yield fell to 4.178% from 4.196% on Monday. The 30-year bond was up 11/32 at 113 11/32 to yield 4.495%, down from 4.515%. Economists\' reactions to the Fed\'s stumble were more measured than participants in the financial markets, where mistakes cost money. Andy Brenner, head of institutional fixed income at Investec in New York, blasted the Fed for its mistake and for when the correction was announced, given that markets had little time to fix bad positions. He noted ""there is mass confusion"" about what the Fed was trying to accomplish. The bank said the wording was ""dropped inadvertently."" The topsy-turvy market moves came despite a sense that the Fed\'s underlying message remains unchanged from its last policy communique, in March: it intends to continue to raise interest rates against a backdrop of higher inflation. ""The confirmation from the FOMC that they were unable to complete a `cut and paste\' and inadvertently excluded the comment on long-term inflation expectations fits with the evidence that inflation expectations are at least as contained as they were back at the March meeting,"" said Mr. Ruskin. In the end, noted Stephen Stanley, chief economist at RBS Greenwich in Greenwich, Conn., the Fed turned out to be ""exactly where we thought (they were) albeit two hours later than expected: the growth assessment was downgraded, but the core inflation outlook is more threatening."" The confidence was further underlined by a narrowing of the benchmark-Treasury yield curve, with the difference between the two- and 10-year yields flattening to 0.53 from 0.55 percentage point. That is a level not seen since March 2001 and underscores the bond market\'s faith that the central bank will keep inflation pressures contained by staying on the path of measured rate increases. ""Inflation is more of a concern, but they are not panicking and the Fed is saying that although economic growth is somewhat slower, they are staying on the path of measured rate hikes,"" said Dominic Konstam, head of interest-rate strategy at Credit Suisse First Boston in New York. With another quarter-point rate increase set to arrive in June, Mr. Konstam expects the yield curve to grind flatter, toward the 0.40-percentage-point area. Over the past 16 months, the curve has experienced a strong flattening trajectory -- kicking off from around 2.50 percentage points in January 2004 -- against the backdrop of a rising federal-funds rate and relatively low levels of inflation.   --- Shayna Stoyko, Michael Mackenzie and Michael Derby contributed to this article.

21,1997-11-12,"[""WASHINGTON, Nov. 12 -- Torn between fear of incipient inflation at home and concern about unsettling financial markets around the world, the Federal Reserve voted today to leave interest rates unchanged and ride out the storm for a while longer. The decision had been widely expected by economists and investors, who saw little chance that the central bank would risk upsetting the global markets by raising rates, even though there is mounting evidence that inflationary pressures are building in the American economy. But it highlighted the delicate situation faced by the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, as he sought to keep the long economic expansion enjoyed by the United States on track while also taking account of his vast influence over markets and economies in the rest of the world. As if to illustrate just how volatile an environment Mr. Greenspan faces, markets tumbled once again today. Sharp declines in Asian and Latin American markets caused jitters on Wall Street, where investors appeared increasingly convinced that slowdowns in foreign economies would hurt profits of multinational companies and slow growth in the United States. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 157.41 points to close at 7,401.32. It was the steepest drop in the index since the 554-point decline on Oct. 27. Although the financial turmoil has the potential to do the same thing as a rate increase by the Fed -- slow the economy sufficiently to keep it from overheating -- Fed officials have made clear over the last several weeks that they still view an outbreak of inflation as a real possibility. Mr. Greenspan said last month that continuing declines in the unemployment rate -- currently at 4.7 percent, a 24-year low -- at a time of strong domestic growth could set off a process in which higher wages would lead to price inflation. Many analysts believe that if the financial markets were calm the Fed would have seriously considered raising interest rates today, and could still do so in the next three months. Still, Mr. Greenspan and his colleagues have also been keenly aware that the combination of falling stock prices, tumbling currency values and weak banking systems in other countries, particularly in Asia, holds risks for the global economy and for the United States in particular. Raising rates now could make the situation worse by pushing down stock and bond prices and further weakening foreign currencies relative to the dollar. Mr. Greenspan is to answer questions about the international markets from the House Banking Committee Thursday morning. Even as the Fed's policy-making committee was meeting today, the stock market in Brazil, the latest nation to be buffeted by the round-the-world financial turmoil, was falling more than 10 percent. ''Against that kind of backdrop, the Fed doesn't have a lot of choice, and in that sense their decision today was not difficult,'' said Ian Shepherdson, the chief economist at HSBC Markets in New York. ''In the longer term it gets much more difficult because they will have to take account of the domestic situation.'' Despite some early warning signs of inflation, including a 4.2 percent increase in hourly earnings over the last year, the Fed has left rates unchanged in recent months because actual gauges of prices have remained stable or in some cases have fallen. Some economists have even been making a case in the last few months that the real danger to the economy is from deflation -- an across-the-board fall in prices -- rather than from inflation. Their argument is built on the premise that the slowdown in the Asian economies, combined with global overcapacity in many industries, could lead to falling prices around the world. Other economists believe that fears of deflation are vastly overblown, especially since falling prices are likely to be limited to manufactured goods, while prices for services are likely to continue rising. In any case, the deflation argument has so far received only a cursory hearing with the Federal Reserve, where the focus has been squarely on strong economic growth and the pressures that could ignite inflation in the United States. ''All the dangers seem to be on the inflationary side, not the deflationary side,'' Alice M. Rivlin, the Fed's vice chairwoman, said last week. The Federal Open Market Committee of the Fed will next meet on Dec. 16, and economists said the chances of a rate increase then, so close to Christmas, were almost nil. But economists are already vigorously debating what situation the Fed will face at its subsequent meeting, in February. One camp believes the global financial upheaval will slow the American economy enough so that no rate increase will be needed and perhaps a rate cut could be justified later in the year. ''There is as logical a case for a rate cut next year as for a rate tightening,'' said James Glassman, an economist at Chase Securities in New York. The other camp holds that for the last year or two the economy has always seemed to be just months away from slowing to a more sustainable pace, but then continued to grow at a robust pace and to create new inflationary pressures. With unemployment low and possibly heading lower, consumer spending strong and business investment running at high levels, even a downturn in Asia and Latin America might not be enough to eradicate inflationary pressures in the United States. ''The Fed has erred on the side of caution up to this point,'' said Gail D. Fosler, the chief economist at the Conference Board, a business group in New York. ''As we get into 1998, they may have to take a risk and raise rates to signal that they will take a stand against the inflationary pressures that are present.'' Economists will be looking particularly hard over the next few months for indications of whether productivity -- the output of a worker in one hour -- is rising fast enough to offset the increases in wages. Corporate profits have remained strong enough this year to suggest that productivity continues to outpace wage gains, economists said. But with companies increasingly being forced to pay more to attract the numbers and quality of workers they want, it is unclear how long that situation will continue, they said.  05:13 EST November 13, 1997""]","[""washington, nov. 12 -- torn between fear of incipient inflation at home and concern about unsettling financial markets around the world, the federal reserve voted today to leave interest rates unchanged and ride out the storm for a while longer. the decision had been widely expected by economists and investors, who saw little chance that the central bank would risk upsetting the global markets by raising rates, even though there is mounting evidence that inflationary pressures are building in the american economy. but it highlighted the delicate situation faced by the federal reserve chairman, alan greenspan, as he sought to keep the long economic expansion enjoyed by the united states on track while also taking account of his vast influence over markets and economies in the rest of the world. as if to illustrate just how volatile an environment mr. greenspan faces, markets tumbled once again today. sharp declines in asian and latin american markets caused jitters on wall street, where investors appeared increasingly convinced that slowdowns in foreign economies would hurt profits of multinational companies and slow growth in the united states. the dow jones industrial average fell 157.41 points to close at 7,401.32. it was the steepest drop in the index since the 554-point decline on oct. 27. although the financial turmoil has the potential to do the same thing as a rate increase by the fed -- slow the economy sufficiently to keep it from overheating -- fed officials have made clear over the last several weeks that they still view an outbreak of inflation as a real possibility. mr. greenspan said last month that continuing declines in the unemployment rate -- currently at 4.7 percent, a 24-year low -- at a time of strong domestic growth could set off a process in which higher wages would lead to price inflation. many analysts believe that if the financial markets were calm the fed would have seriously considered raising interest rates today, and could still do so in the next three months. still, mr. greenspan and his colleagues have also been keenly aware that the combination of falling stock prices, tumbling currency values and weak banking systems in other countries, particularly in asia, holds risks for the global economy and for the united states in particular. raising rates now could make the situation worse by pushing down stock and bond prices and further weakening foreign currencies relative to the dollar. mr. greenspan is to answer questions about the international markets from the house banking committee thursday morning. even as the fed's policy-making committee was meeting today, the stock market in brazil, the latest nation to be buffeted by the round-the-world financial turmoil, was falling more than 10 percent.

22,1989-08-22,"['NEW YORK -- The dollar sank, hampered by weak fundamentals, a general move to marks and sterling, and a U.S. durable-goods report that fell short of market expectations. Durable-goods orders fell 1.9% in July, following a revised 1.4% drop in June. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones Capital Markets Report predicted orders would be unchanged in July, and the poor showing opened the door for dollar-dumping in New York after the U.S. currency had been flagging in Asia and Europe. In late afternoon New York trading, the dollar was at 1.9395 marks, down from 1.9577 marks late Monday, and at 142.20 yen, down from 143.10 yen. Sterling was at $1.5890, up from $1.5725. In Tokyo Wednesday, the dollar opened for trading at 142.30 yen, down from Tuesday\'s Tokyo close of 142.78 yen. Terri Reid, an investment officer with Harris Trust & Savings Bank, Chicago, said talk of a ""fairly large"" order for marks in that city may have pushed the dollar below critical technical support at 1.9500 marks. ""Once we broke below 1.9510 marks, the market hit sort of a black hole. There were simply no dollar bids until we moved down to about 1.9460 marks."" At that point, traders said, a rash of stop-loss sell orders expedited the dollar\'s decline to around 1.9400 marks. Traders said the action was more a reflection of strength in sterling and the mark than dollar weakness. Sterling is benefiting from optimism ahead of today\'s British current account report, which is expected to show improvements in July for the trade and current accounts. Pound strengthening started Friday, and shows no signs of abating -- at least against the dollar -- until the current account report appears. Sterling\'s strong advance has some dealers worried that disappointing current-account results could lead to widespread profit-taking and major losses for holders of the British currency. But Cynthia Johnson, vice president and manager of corporate foreign exchange at Lloyds Bank in New York, doesn\'t entirely agree. While a partial pullback may occur, she says firm technicals and an improving outlook on British interest rates will provide the safety net in the event of lackluster trade numbers. ""Sterling\'s smooth rise above $1.5800 and 3.06 marks -- both were tough resistance -- was evidence of the pound\'s technical strength,"" she said. Meanwhile, the feisty mark posted impressive gains against all currencies save the pound amid persistent rumors in Europe and later in New York that the West German Bundesbank was planning to raise interest rates when the bank\'s Central Council resumes its regular meetings tommorrow after a summer recess. Generally, however, traders and analysts say they don\'t expect the Council -- the German equivalent of the U.S.\'s Federal Open Market Committee -- to make any major decisions this month. Said one trader at a West German bank in New York: ""These rumors would have made sense if the dollar were reaching new highs against the mark. But as we stand now, there\'s no basis for a {Bundesbank} rate hike."" The West German central bank last raised interest rates June 29, boosting the discount and Lombard rates by one-half percentage point to 5% and 7% respectively. Some rumor-supporters pointed to the Bundesbank\'s announcement that West Germany\'s M3 money supply growth accelerated to an annualized rate of 4.9% in July, up from 4.3% in June, though just below the central bank\'s 5% growth target for 1989. M3 consists of cash in circulation, sight deposits, time deposits under four years, and most savings accounts. But the increase in M3 growth was widely expected by West German economists surveyed by Dow Jones, who said the repeal of a 10% witholding tax on interest income on July 1, which was announced in April, temporarily slowed money growth in June. Additionally, July\'s rate is down from May\'s 5.3% growth, and a robust 6.1% expansion rate in April. As for the FOMC, which convened to consider credit policy at the U.S. Federal Reserve, traders don\'t expect a monumental change in monetary approach while the U.S. economy continues to hum along at a gentle pace and inflation remains under control.

""once we broke below 1.9510 marks, the market hit sort of a black hole. there were simply no dollar bids until we moved down to about 1.9460 marks."" at that point, traders said, a rash of stop-loss sell orders expedited the dollar's decline to around 1.9400 marks. traders said the action was more a reflection of strength in sterling and the mark than dollar weakness. sterling is benefiting from optimism ahead of today's british current account report, which is expected to show improvements in july for the trade and current accounts. pound strengthening started friday, and shows no signs of abating -- at least against the dollar -- until the current account report appears. sterling's strong advance has some dealers worried that disappointing current-account results could lead to widespread profit-taking and major losses for holders of the british currency. but cynthia johnson, vice president and manager of corporate foreign exchange at lloyds bank in new york, doesn't entirely agree. while a partial pullback may occur, she says firm technicals and an improving outlook on british interest rates will provide the safety net in the event of lackluster trade numbers. ""sterling's smooth rise above $1.5800 and 3.06 marks -- both were tough resistance -- was evidence of the pound's technical strength,"" she said. meanwhile, the feisty mark posted impressive gains against all currencies save the pound amid persistent rumors in europe and later in new york that the west german bundesbank was planning to raise interest rates when the bank's central council resumes its regular meetings tommorrow after a summer recess. generally, however, traders and analysts say they don't expect the council -- the german equivalent of the u.s.'s federal open market committee -- to make any major decisions this month. said one trader at a west german bank in new york: ""these rumors would have made sense if the dollar were reaching new highs against the mark. but as we stand now, there's no basis for a {bundesbank} rate hike."" the west german central bank last raised interest rates june 29, boosting the discount and lombard rates by one-half percentage point to 5% and 7% respectively. some rumor-supporters pointed to the bundesbank's announcement that west germany's m3 money supply growth accelerated to an annualized rate of 4.9% in july, up from 4.3% in june, though just below the central bank's 5% growth target for 1989. m3 consists of cash in circulation, sight deposits, time deposits under four years, and most savings accounts. but the increase in m3 growth was widely expected by west german economists surveyed by dow jones, who said the repeal of a 10% witholding tax on interest income on july 1, which was announced in april, temporarily slowed money growth in june. additionally, july's rate is down from may's 5.3% growth, and a robust 6.1% expansion rate in april. as for the fomc, which convened to consider credit policy at the u.s. federal reserve, traders don't expect a monumental change in monetary approach while the u.s. economy continues to hum along at a gentle pace and inflation remains under control. on the commodity exchange in new york, gold for current delivery settled at $367.90 an ounce, down 50 cents. estimated volume was a light 1.3 million ounces. in early trading in hong kong wednesday, gold was quoted at $366.65 an ounce.']",32.0,,,,,,,,,1
23,2003-12-09,"[""WASHINGTON, Dec. 9 -- The Federal Reserve kept its benchmark short-term interest rate at 1 percent on Tuesday, the lowest level in 45 years, but it laid the groundwork for a gradual tightening of monetary policy next year.   In a significant shift by the Federal Open Market Committee, which sets monetary policy, the Fed said the risk of ''an unwelcome fall in inflation has diminished in recent months and now appears almost equal to that of a rise in inflation.''   That was a retreat from the Fed's language of the last several months, when it justified its policy of rock-bottom interest rates in large part on concern that the risks of declining prices, or deflation, were greater than those of inflation. At the same time, the Fed moved again to soothe investors by repeating its assertion that inflation remains low enough to allow a policy of cheap money ''for a considerable period.''   Analysts and investors had been focused on that phrase in the run-up to Tuesday's meeting, with some predicting that the Fed would drop it and implicitly abandon its open-ended commitment to low rates.   But Fed officials turned the tables, repeating the soothing phrase while at the same time alerting investors that they are no longer much worried about Japanese-style deflation.   ''Make no mistake, yesterday's statement is immensely significant,'' wrote Ian Shepherdson, North American analyst at High Frequency Economics, a consulting firm in Valhalla, N.Y. ''The groundwork for the first hike is being laid.''   Investors reacted immediately, though without tumult. Bond investors demanded modestly higher yields on Treasury notes and bonds in anticipation of higher interest rates in the future. Yields on 10-year Treasury notes climbed to 4.35 percent late Tuesday afternoon from 4.27 percent on Monday.   The dollar, which has fallen sharply against the euro and other leading currencies, drifted down a bit more against the Japanese yen, to a rate of 106.79, and slipped to another low against the euro, which settled at $1.2237.   In stock trading, the Dow Jones industrial average -- after briefly climbing past the 10,000 level before the Fed's announcement -- fell back in the afternoon, closing down 0.42 percent. Technology stocks were hit harder, with the Nasdaq composite index losing 2 percent of its value.   The Fed's rate-setting committee, in a statement after its meeting on Tuesday, acknowledged that economic growth and the job market had improved since its last meeting, on Oct. 28. ''Output is expanding briskly,'' it said, ''and the labor market appears to be improving modestly.'' For the first time in several months, it did not express concern about weak ''pricing power,'' the ability of companies to demand higher prices.   Instead, it noted that ''increases in core consumer prices are muted and expected to remain low.'' Then it abandoned its previous statements about the risks of an ''unwelcome fall in inflation.''   ''However, with inflation quite low and resource use slack,'' it added, ''the committee believes that policy accommodation can be maintained for a considerable period.''   Analysts said, though, that the Fed was still viewing the economic recovery as fragile and in need of special care.   Robert Gay, an economist at Commerzbank Securities in New York, said: ''The Fed needs to have constant data over numerous months to be convinced that the economy is out of the woods. They're starting to say that it's clearing, but until you can actually see the sunlight, it's reasonable for them to not change policy dramatically.''   A growing number of analysts have begun to say that the Fed needs to start tightening its grip. The economy expanded at an annual pace of 8.2 percent in the third quarter, the fastest in nearly 20 years, and unemployment has edged downward.   And while consumer prices continue to climb at an annual rate just slightly above 1 percent, prices for a growing number of commodities are increasing. Gold prices, which have surged in the last few months, settled at $407.75 an ounce on Tuesday, the highest level in almost eight years. Silver prices also rose.   Those increases reflect the declining value of the dollar, as foreign suppliers adjust prices to reflect exchange rates, but some of that also reflects surging demand for raw materials in the United States and China.   Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, has thus far seemed largely unconcerned about those price rises. In speeches, he and other Fed officials have instead focused on the slackness of the job market and the continued excess capacity of factories.   Unemployment declined in November, to 5.9 percent from 6 percent, but job growth continues to be modest in comparison with most previous recoveries. The economy has added about 300,000 jobs in the last three months, but economists estimate that about 250,000 more jobs a month would be needed to bring the unemployment rate down significantly from current levels.   Part of the reason is surging productivity, which has allowed companies to increase production without adding workers. Productivity shot up to 9.2 percent in the third quarter, hindering job creation but keeping down pressure for higher wages.   Robert DiClemente, an economist with Citigroup, said the Fed's announcement made rate increases unlikely until at least August.   ''They certainly are recognizing what everyone senses, which is that the character of the recovery is changing,'' Mr. DiClemente said. ''At the same time, they are pretty pointed in saying that they expected inflation to remain low.''   Based on prices in the futures market, where traders bet on the direction of the Federal funds rate on overnight loans between banks, many investors assume that the Fed will raise rates a quarter-point by June.   But Jan Hatzius, a Goldman, Sachs economist, said he remained convinced that the first rate increase would not come until the start of 2005, in part because growth may slow in the second half of next year and in part because the Fed does not like to raise rates shortly before elections.   ''They recognized the better growth outlook but reiterated their intention to keep interest rates low until the excess slack in the economy has been used up and inflation has risen,'' Mr. Hatzius wrote in a research note on Tuesday. ''This is unlikely to happen until 2005.''

25,2003-12-09,"[""The Dow Jones industrial average rose briefly above 10,000 yesterday, the first time the average has been above this psychologically important level in more than 18 months.   But the Dow and the overall market retreated in the afternoon when Federal Reserve policy makers provided their first hint of the need to raise interest rates sometime next year, although they left their short-term interest rate benchmark unchanged. Treasury prices also fell as yields moved higher and the dollar slipped against the euro.   The Dow has been flirting with 10,000 for several weeks, and after jumping 102.59 points on Monday to 9,965.27, the Dow looked poised for a break through.   The 10,000 level was breached about nine minutes after trading opened, with the Dow rising to 10,003.05. But the Dow slipped back quickly. It made another run to 9,999.05 just after the Fed announced its decision at 2:15 p.m. Eastern time.   At the close, the Dow was down 41.85 points, or 0.4 percent, to 9,923.42. The Nasdaq composite index, which briefly passed 2,000 in intraday trading last week, tumbled 40.53 points, or 2.1 percent, to 1,908.32. And the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index lost 9.12 points, or 0.9 percent, to 1,060.18.   The price of the Treasury's benchmark 10-year note, which was up about a third of a point before the Fed announcement, was off 21/32 to 99 6/32 in late trading, while its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, rose to 4.35 percent from 4.27 percent on Monday.   The euro was valued at $1.2237 in late trading, up from $1.2228 on Monday, while the dollar was at 106.79 yen, down from 107.38 on Monday. Since the beginning of the month, the dollar is down 2 percent against the euro and 2.3 percent against the yen.   Many investors appeared to be focusing more on the Fed meeting in Washington than Dow 10,000. While there were no big surprises in the announcement, Fed officials did change their view on inflation and that seemed to undercut the stock and bond markets in the afternoon.   Until yesterday, policy makers on the Federal Open Market Committee have said that the threat of ''an unwelcome fall in inflation'' outweighed the risk of a rise in prices and for this reason the Fed would keep short-term rates low ''for a considerable period.''   Their statement changed yesterday, saying that ''the probability of an unwelcome fall in inflation has diminished in recent months and now appears almost equal to that of a rise in inflation.''   For some investors and analysts, this change on inflation is the first step in laying the groundwork for raising interest rates next year. Analysts and forecasters have been saying for some time that they expected the Fed to begin raising rates in the summer or fall of 2004.   In yesterday's statement, the Fed justified keeping the ''considerable period'' phrase by saying, ''With inflation quite low and resource use slack, the committee believes that policy accommodation can be maintained for a considerable period.''   Wall Street analysts did not expect the Fed to raise its benchmark interest rate, which is at a 45-year low of 1 percent. Some were expecting the Fed to adjust the ''considerable period'' language, but the inflation wording was changed.   ''The tactics were different than people thought but the message was the same,'' said Josh Feinman, chief economist at Deutsche Asset Management. Despite the change in inflation language, Mr. Feinman said, ''the basic message is that they are not likely to move rates any time soon.'' He said a rate increase was unlikely before the middle of next year.   David J. Greenlaw, chief United States fixed-income economist at Morgan Stanley, said that the result of the statement was a little confusion in the markets as some argued that the shift on inflation hinted at a move sooner on rates while the keeping of the ''considerable period'' wording meant things had not changed.

26,2003-12-09,"['NEW YORK -- The dollar sank against its major rivals after the Federal Reserve affirmed its reluctance to raise interest rates anytime soon. But the U.S. currency managed to claw back from yet another record low against the euro. Apparent intervention by Japan\'s Ministry of Finance late in the day also shored up the dollar against the yen after it had fallen through a key support level to its worst showing in three years, although for many dealers, the reprieve seemed temporary. The Federal Open Market Committee, the policy-making arm of the Fed, issued yet another nuanced official statement on its monetary policy, but clearly signaled it isn\'t prepared to raise its federal funds target of 1% anytime soon. ""The things that changed weren\'t necessarily what people thought would change,"" said Jason Bonanca, currency strategist at Credit Suisse First Boston in New York. Currency traders had expected the Fed to drop the phrase ""considerable period"" when describing how long the Fed would keep rates low for, as a nod to the improving economic landscape. Instead, the Fed kept that language, but instead de-emphasized the threat of falling inflation, a risk first flagged by the central bank back in May. In its official statement, the Fed said ""the probability of an unwelcome fall in inflation has diminished in recent months and now appears almost equal to that of a rise in inflation."" Low inflation and slack in the economy allow the Fed to keep short term interest rates low for ""a considerable period,"" the FOMC said. ""We\'re left with a slightly more hawkish Fed,"" said Mr. Bonanca.

This should continue to weigh on the dollar, he said. Lower interest rates in the U.S. have weighed heavily on the dollar this year and are likely to continue to encourage investors to park funds elsewhere, which could further erode the dollar\'s value. Some analysts believe the Fed would have to raise rates by 50 basis points, or half a percentage point, before the dollar could find its footing against its major rivals.

The dollar, meanwhile, recovered from its worst levels of 106.82 yen touched soon after the FOMC statement, to trade at 107.03 yen, down from 107.37 yen Monday. Dealers said the Tokyo branches of large Japanese banks -- familiar agent banks for the Bank of Japan, which intervenes in currency markets on behalf of the Ministry of Finance -- aggressively bought dollars when the dollar traded as low as 106.74 yen. ""They quickly started bidding it there,"" said a dealer at a Japanese bank in New York. Japanese authorities have sold more than 16 trillion yen ($148.9 billion) so far this year in an attempt to stem the yen\'s rapid appreciation, which they contend undermines the competitiveness of Japanese goods on global markets and threatens the country\'s export-led recovery.

Earlier in the global session, the euro spiked to a new all-time high of $1.2278 for the eighth consecutive trading day.

27,2000-12-19,"[""WASHINGTON, Dec. 19 -- The Federal Reserve said today that it was shifting its sights from fighting inflation to steering the economy away from a possible recession, emphasizing in blunt language a number of problems that could derail the decade-long expansion. The Fed left interest rates unchanged but made clear it was ready to cut rates if the slowdown that has become increasingly evident in recent weeks appears to be developing into a full-fledged downturn. In holding rates steady, the Federal Reserve disappointed Wall Street. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 61.05 points, to 10,584.37, after being up as much as 139 points before the announcement. The Nasdaq composite index fell 112.81 points, to 2,511.71, its lowest level since August 1999. [Page C1.] The Fed did not use the word recession in describing its decision, and it indicated that it still saw some risk of inflation, particularly from higher oil and natural gas prices. The policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee listed a series of weaknesses and potential problems that could turn the slowdown, which it helped bring about through a series of rate increases, into the first recession since early in the 1990's. The Fed is scheduled to meet next on Jan. 30 and 31, and analysts said there is a good chance of a rate cut then, especially if there are further signs that the economy is weakening. ''The purpose of the announcement today was to assure businesses and households that the Fed is not blind to the evidence of and concern over the slowing economy,'' said Joel Prakken, an economist at Macroeconomic Advisors in St. Louis. ''They're signaling that should it become necessary to do so, they are prepared to lower interest rates.'' In disclosing its decision, the Fed emphasized how rapidly economic conditions had deteriorated. ''The drag on demand and profits from rising energy prices, as well as eroding consumer confidence, reports of substantial shortfalls in sales and earnings and stress in some segments of the financial markets suggest that economic activity may be slowing further,'' the committee said in a statement issued about 2:15 p.m. ''While some inflation risks persist, they are diminished by the more moderate pace of economic activity and by the absence of any indication that longer-term inflation expectations have increased,'' the committee said. Using words that signaled the formal adoption of a presumption that the Fed would soon have to consider cutting rates -- a 180-degree turnabout from its previous position -- the committee said it ''believes that the risks are weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate economic weakness in the foreseeable future.'' Although the Fed has been trying for a year and a half to cool down what had been an overheated economy, the abruptness of the slowdown over the last month or so has clearly caught it by surprise. In its report on conditions in the Federal Reserve districts earlier this month, the Fed noted no signs of real trouble, saying only that some regions were reporting slower growth and others moderate but steady growth. And at its last meeting, on Nov. 15, the Fed concluded that ''the risks continue to be weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate heightened inflation pressures.'' The sharp deceleration has left Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, and his colleagues approaching circumstances that give central bankers nightmares: realizing that they may have raised rates too much, requiring them to do a quick about-face in hopes of averting a stall that would drive up unemployment, sink the stock market and set off finger pointing about who is to blame. What is particularly inducing fear for the Fed is the possibility, remote at this point but still real, that it could face an upturn in inflation because of higher energy costs and low unemployment at the same time growth slows to a crawl or goes into reverse. President-elect George W. Bush has been warning for the last two weeks that there may be a downturn just ahead, and that his proposal for a $1.3 trillion tax cut over the next decade is just the prescription for a faltering economy. Mr. Bush and his team have cited rising energy prices in particular as a cause for concern. In a speech two weeks ago, Mr. Greenspan alerted investors that he was aware of the risks to the economy, especially since the bond market was effectively cutting off credit to all but the strongest of borrowers and banks were tightening their lending standards. A report in The Wall Street Journal on Monday suggesting that the Fed would seriously consider a rate cut today generated hope among investors who see a declining interest rate environment as the best tonic for the pessimism that has gripped the markets in recent weeks. While the Fed opted to hold rates steady, the concerned tone of its statement suggested that it was intent on sending as clear a signal as it could, short of cutting rates, about the risks to the economy. ''They went as far as they could with words but stopped short of action,'' said Martin A. Regalia, chief economist at the United States Chamber of Commerce. The Fed raised its benchmark federal funds target rate 1.75 percentage points, to 6.5 percent, in six steps between June 1999 and May of this year. It has left the rate unchanged since then. The rate increases were intended to slow the growth in economic output from above 5 percent a year, well beyond what most economists think is sustainable over the long run without igniting inflation, to something closer to 3 percent. Growth now appears to be running about 2.5 percent, a subdued but still healthy rate. As the Fed suggested today, however, there are plenty of reasons to think that the growth rate could fall further. Perhaps more important, confidence among both investors and consumers appears to be deteriorating. If left unchecked, that could lead to more concrete economic problems. ''If psychology goes decidedly south, the real numbers will follow,'' Mr. Regalia said. ''That's what the Fed was trying to address, and it's why they went from an anti-inflation bias to a progrowth bias without a stop at neutral.'' But if the Fed wants to avert a meltdown in the markets, it is clearly not unhappy to see the speculative froth skimmed off stock prices. Indeed, some Fed officials may not be particularly displeased with where the economy is now, given their desire to make sure that inflationary forces do not get a toehold. Consumer price inflation by some measures has been creeping up. Average hourly earnings have been accelerating. The sharp rise in natural gas prices will put pressure on both businesses and consumers. ''On the one hand, growth has slowed, maybe more sharply than most were expecting, and the economy in those circumstances is vulnerable to recession,'' Mr. Prakken said. ''On the other hand, it's foolish to argue that the inflation risks have evaporated.''""]","[""washington, dec. 19 -- the federal reserve said today that it was shifting its sights from fighting inflation to steering the economy away from a possible recession, emphasizing in blunt language a number of problems that could derail the decade-long expansion. the fed left interest rates unchanged but made clear it was ready to cut rates if the slowdown that has become increasingly evident in recent weeks appears to be developing into a full-fledged downturn. in holding rates steady, the federal reserve disappointed wall street. the dow jones industrial average fell 61.05 points, to 10,584.37, after being up as much as 139 points before the announcement. the nasdaq composite index fell 112.81 points, to 2,511.71, its lowest level since august 1999.

28,2000-12-19,"[""WASHINGTON -- More and more, economists are predicting that the recent economic slowdown will end in a recession early next year. Indeed, the Federal Reserve stated yesterday that weakening growth is now a greater threat to the economy than higher inflation. President-elect George W. Bush is using the threat of recession to push for his $1.3 trillion tax cut. In doing so, he risks using a bad argument to sell a good policy. During much of the postwar era, economists and policymakers believed that fiscal policy was government's primary tool for countering recessions. The idea was that forecasters would accurately predict business cycles and that timely tax cuts or government spending would offset the effects of recessions. In the early 1960's, when this idea was at its peak, many economists believed that recessions were a thing of the past. In the 1970's, however, such fine tuning of the economy fell out of favor. It became apparent that economic forecasting was grossly incapable of predicting downturns far enough in advance. And even if such forecasting were possible, the legislative machinery would be too cumbersome to respond appropriately. Indeed, in all seven of the postwar recessions, Congress did not pass legislation in response to the downturn until after it had ended. In some cases, Congress didn't enact anti-recession programs until years after the recession was over. For example, in May 1977, Congress was still passing legislation to deal with the recession that ended in March 1975. For these and other reasons, economists soured on fiscal policy as a tool to ease economic downturns. While the idea might work in theory, it proved impossible to enact the appropriate programs when they would actually help. Moreover, using fiscal policy to tame recessions often did more harm than good. For instance, if government spending is used to prop up the economy, legislators can easily recast their pork-barrel spending bills as anti-recession medicine -- even though these projects seldom, if ever, are located where unemployment is high or address sectors of the economy that are hurting. At the same time that fiscal policy was falling out of favor, monetary policy gained greater respect among economists. In an economic downturn, the Federal Reserve can cut interest rates and expand the money supply almost instantaneously. After all, the Federal Open Market Committee meets every six weeks as a matter of course to review economic conditions and take action if necessary. And no Congressional debate is required. In contrast, before Mr. Bush's tax cut can be enacted, it must be reviewed by lawyers and economists at the Treasury Department. Economic assumptions must be updated and new revenue projections made. The divided Congress is unlikely to pass this big tax bill quickly -- indeed, there is already disagreement on how to proceed. And the parts of Mr. Bush's plan that are most ripe for passage, like marriage penalty relief, are not big enough to have much effect. It is hard to see how the tax cut would have much impact on the economy before mid-year, even if made retroactive. By that time, we would probably be past the slowdown. There is a good case to be made for a big tax cut, and Mr. Bush made it when first putting forward his tax plan a year ago, long before there were any signs of a recession. Taxes are too high, and certain features of the tax code, like the marriage penalty, need to be fixed. But Mr. Bush should not argue that his tax cut will save the economy from a recession. Such a tactic could undermine his credibility and corrode his relationship with the Federal Reserve.

31,1991-12-17,"['WASHINGTON, Dec. 17 -- Housing starts fell 2.1 percent in November, all but assuring home builders of their worst year since the end of World War II, the Commerce Department reported today. The report apparently contributed to a White House decision to acknowledge that the economy remained in recession.   The housing industry traditionally leads the economy out of recession, but after a spurt earlier this year it has slumped along with the rest of the economy despite continuing declines in interest rates.   Mirroring the suggestions of many analysts, the White House spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, said, ""For all practical purposes, the recession continues.""   The Bush Administration and many private economists have urged the Federal Reserve to cut short-term interest rates to help revive the faltering economy.   The Federal Open Market Committee, the central bank\'s policy-making arm, met privately today amid expectations of a further easing of credit, perhaps as early as this week. This morning, however, the Fed drained reserves from the banking system when the overnight interest rate subject to its direct control slipped below the current target of 4 1/2 percent. This action was aimed at steadying rates, though analysts did not rule out later action to cut them. [ Page D14. ]   The housing figures followed by a day a Federal Reserve report showing that industrial production also fell in November, by four-tenths of a percent, after posting virtually no growth for three months.   In the housing report, the Commerce Department said new construction of single-family homes and apartments totaled a seasonally adjusted 1.066 million last month, down from 1.089 million in October. The decline was entirely in apartments.   ""We are now guaranteed the lowest total since World War II,"" said David F. Seiders, an economist at the National Association of Home Builders.   The housing weakness was widespread. Starts fell in both the Midwest and West and barely rose in the South. Only the Northeast posted a sizable gain.   Starts in the first 11 months of the year were 16.5 percent below the 1990 period, and analysts said the 1991 total would be less than the 1.015 million units built in 1946 as the nation began to recover from the war. There had been just 325,000 starts in 1945.   ""If we get a number in December that doesn\'t fall off the cliff, we will come in about 1.004 million for \'91,"" Mr. Seiders said. ""Even in 1982, one of the deepest recessions in memory, we had 1.062 million starts.""   The revised 7.1 percent jump in October was the biggest advance since a 17.1 percent gain in February, when the housing industry began emerging from its recession.   But the increase was not as big as the 7.3 percent advance initially reported last month. And the 3.7 percent drop in September was a bit deeper than the original 3.5 percent estimate.   John A. Tuccillo, an economist with the National Association of Realtors, attributed the weakness to ""a lapse in consumer confidence, diminished demand and the ongoing financing struggle in the building industry.""   Analysts said snow and cold temperatures in November also curbed construction in some areas, particularly the Midwest.

[ page d14. ]   the housing figures followed by a day a federal reserve report showing that industrial production also fell in november, by four-tenths of a percent, after posting virtually no growth for three months.   in the housing report, the commerce department said new construction of single-family homes and apartments totaled a seasonally adjusted 1.066 million last month, down from 1.089 million in october. the decline was entirely in apartments.   ""we are now guaranteed the lowest total since world war ii,"" said david f. seiders, an economist at the national association of home builders.   the housing weakness was widespread. starts fell in both the midwest and west and barely rose in the south. only the northeast posted a sizable gain.   starts in the first 11 months of the year were 16.5 percent below the 1990 period, and analysts said the 1991 total would be less than the 1.015 million units built in 1946 as the nation began to recover from the war. there had been just 325,000 starts in 1945.   ""if we get a number in december that doesn't fall off the cliff, we will come in about 1.004 million for '91,"" mr. seiders said. ""even in 1982, one of the deepest recessions in memory, we had 1.062 million starts.""   the revised 7.1 percent jump in october was the biggest advance since a 17.1 percent gain in february, when the housing industry began emerging from its recession.   but the increase was not as big as the 7.3 percent advance initially reported last month. and the 3.7 percent drop in september was a bit deeper than the original 3.5 percent estimate.   john a. tuccillo, an economist with the national association of realtors, attributed the weakness to ""a lapse in consumer confidence, diminished demand and the ongoing financing struggle in the building industry.""   analysts said snow and cold temperatures in november also curbed construction in some areas, particularly the midwest.   but applications for building permits -- often a barometer of future activity -- suggested continued weakness. they fell 2.9 percent, to a 998,000 annual rate, after rising 4.5 percent a month earlier.   despite the bleak outlook for 1991, analysts said the housing industry should resume growth early next year. richard peach, an economist with the mortgage bankers association, said there were already reports of more prospective buyers looking at homes. as sales pick up, builders usually resume construction.   graph: ""housing construction"" shows new private housing started and permits authorized from 6/90 to 11/91 (source: commerce department) (pg. d2)  ']",33.0,,,,,,,,,1

33,2006-06-29,"['The Federal Reserve raised interest rates for the 17th consecutive time, but its words suggested growing prospects for a pause in rate increases, helping to spark a rally in stock markets. As widely expected, the central bank boosted its short-term interest-rate target to 5.25% from 5%. But for the first time since it began raising rates from a low of 1%, in June 2004, the Fed didn\'t explicitly say another rate increase was under consideration -- and markets took that as a welcome signal. ""The extent and timing of any additional"" rate increases ""will depend on the evolution of the outlook for both inflation and economic growth,"" the Fed said in a statement. By contrast, the Fed\'s last statement, on May 10, said ""some further"" rate increases ""may yet be needed."" The language shift reflects Fed officials\' decreased confidence that they know now what they\'ll do next, given how much rates already have risen, its view that the economy is slowing and its concern over an unexpected rise in inflation that it nonetheless hopes is temporary. The new language doesn\'t rule out another rate increase, but gives the Fed added flexibility to base its decision more on coming economic data than on any previous guidance it gave to markets. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which was up about 80 points before the statement was released, soared to close 217.24 points higher, a gain of about 2%, its best day in more than three years. The Nasdaq Stock Market was up 3%, its biggest one-day rally since March 2004. Long-term bond yields edged down. ""The Fed was not as hawkish as investors expected, and we\'re seeing a \'relief rally\' here,"" said David Ader, a strategist at RBS Greenwich Capital. Futures markets lowered the odds of a quarter-percentage point increase at the Fed\'s next meeting, on Aug. 8, to 60% from 80%. The Fed statement acknowledged, as many Fed officials have in the last month, that recent measures of inflation have been ""elevated."" But it softened the sting by suggesting the Fed expects inflation to edge lower as the economy slows. ""Economic growth is moderating,"" the statement said. ""Although the moderation . . . should help to limit inflation pressures over time, the (Fed) judges that some inflation risks remain."" Mickey Levy, chief economist at Bank of America, termed it ""a favorable statement from the market\'s perspective, but it\'s a risky statement from the Fed\'s perspective."" Inflation is likely to accelerate over the next few months, reflecting the lagged impact of strong economic growth in recent years, he said, and that could force the Fed to raise rates again. Economists, investors and even some on Capitol Hill have lately begun to worry the Fed might raise rates too much, tipping the economy into recession. That concern has been helping roil markets in recent weeks. In a new Wall Street Journal survey, 12 of 56 economic forecasters said they saw a possible Fed ""policy mistake"" as the biggest risk to the U.S. economy in the next year -- a greater threat than a housing downturn, inflation, an energy-price crunch or avian flu. Six months earlier, only eight economists cited a Fed mistake as the biggest risk; a housing downturn was at the top of the list. Some Fed officials share the worries about raising rates too far. All 10 voting members of the 17-member Federal Open Market Committee agreed to raise the target for the Federal funds rate, which is charged on overnight loans between banks. Two committee seats are vacant. But two of 12 reserve banks did not request an accompanying increase in the less-important discount rate, which is charged on Fed loans to commercial banks. Their presidents -- Janet Yellen in San Francisco and Thomas Hoenig in Kansas City -- have recently warned of the risks of raising rates too much. The Fed\'s statement attempts to balance the competing risks of slowing growth and rising inflation. The Commerce Department reported yesterday that the economy grew at a robust 5.6% annual pace in the first quarter. Economists believe growth slipped below 3% in the current quarter under the weight of higher oil prices and interest rates. At the same time, inflation has edged above what Fed officials sometimes call their ""comfort zone."" After a period of rising interest rates, the economy often decelerates while inflation rises for a while. But that creates a challenge for new Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke, who faces the task of demonstrating he will be as tough on inflation as his predecessor, Alan Greenspan. Mr. Bernanke suffered a setback in that effort when he first raised the possibility of a pause in interest-rate increases in April, causing some investors to question his anti-inflation resolve. To compensate, he and numerous other Fed officials in the past month have unleashed a rhetorical broadside, labeling recent inflation developments ""unwelcome,"" ""beyond acceptable,"" ""corrosive"" and ""unhinged,"" raising market expectations of monetary tightening. ""Bernanke\'s a new Fed chairman and his credibility is on the line as an inflation fighter,"" said Scott Anderson, senior economist at Wells Fargo &Co. ""That might push him to raise rates higher -- higher than Greenspan would have had to."" The Wall Street Journal survey doesn\'t see a Fed mistake as the most probable outcome. ""That\'s a risk, that\'s not the expectation,"" said Peter Hooper, chief U.S. economist at Deutsche Bank Securities in New York. More than half of the economists in the Journal survey -- 31 of the 56 surveyed -- think the Fed will be able to control inflation without damaging the economy. Only a quarter believe the Fed will overshoot. Mr. Bernanke likely will elaborate further on the Fed\'s view of the economy and interest-rate outlook when he testifies before Congress on July 19 as part of his semiannual monetary report. Economists generally have a high opinion of Mr. Bernanke, who this week oversaw the Fed meeting for the third time. Survey respondents gave him a B-plus for his interest-rate decisions, a bit lower than the ""A-minus"" they gave him in an early May survey. Lehman Brothers chief U.S. economist Ethan Harris, who gave Mr. Bernanke an A, also gave the media a C for misinterpreting the Fed chairman. Drew Matus, an economist at Lehman, said the latest statement, by raising the prospect of a pause, seems inconsistent with the hawkish rhetoric of the past month -- and as a result, the Fed could ""get caught in another credibility issue."" Yesterday, expected inflation, as implied by the behavior of inflation-indexed bonds, rose three-hundredths of a percentage point.

34,2006-06-29,"['Treasury bond prices rallied yesterday after the Federal Reserve increased rates by a quarter of a percentage point but gave investors hope it may soon pause its money-tightening campaign. Bonds rose across all maturities, sending their yields lower. The 10-year Treasury note gained 11/32 point, or $3.44 for every $1,000 invested, to 99 12/32. The two-year note rose 5/32 to 99 27/32. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note slipped 0.04 percentage point to 5.21%, while the yield on the two-year note fell 0.08 percentage point to 5.20%. It was the first time in three weeks that yields on 10-year Treasurys, which generally carry more risk because of their longer terms, had even slightly exceeded yields on their 2-year counterparts. The Federal Open Market Committee hiked the Federal Funds target rate to 5.25% from 5.00%. The central bank has now lifted the funds rate 4.25 percentage points since June 2004. The tone of the committee\'s announcement took some of the wind out of expectations for another quarter point rate increase at the Fed\'s Aug. 8 meeting and sparked gains in the battered Treasury market, which has suffered in the past two weeks on concerns that inflation was worsening, and the Fed would extend its hiking campaign to fight it. ""It was a reasonably favorable announcement, which opened the door to a pause and put away the bears who were talking about a 50 basis point hike,"" said Robert G. Smith, chief investment officer of Smith Affiliated Capital Corp., a New York fixed-income money manager. Over the past two weeks, some investors had expressed worries that Fed chairman Ben Bernanke and other officials might approve a 0.5 percentage point increase. The market also took the view that another hike in August was less likely. Jerry Webman, director of fixed income at OppenheimerFunds, said yesterday\'s Fed statement means ""continued uncertainty and markets that continue to price with uncertainty in mind."" Still, he said, the bond markets are likely to have a smoother ride than the stock market, because the Fed appears to be committed to continued vigilance against inflation. The bonds of Embarq Corp., a Kansas telecommunications company, rallied Thursday as buyers snapped up the securities, which have been largely under water since the telecommunications company sold the debt in May. Yields on 10-year bonds sold by Embarq were 2.05 percentage points higher than Treasurys with the same duration, and yields on 30-year Embarq bonds were 2.76 percentage points higher. David Novosel, investment analyst at Gimme Credit, an independent research firm specializing in corporate bonds, said the Embarq bonds were due for relief after being hammered after they were issued. ""It was a bit overdone in terms of selling,"" he said. The successful sale Wednesday of junk-rated bonds from Windstream Communications -- also a land-line phone company -- reminded investors that Embarq\'s bonds had become oversold. Embarq, which focuses on the land-line sector of the telecommunications market, sold $4.485 billion of bonds on May 12, preparing to spin off from Sprint five days later. Investors lined up for the bonds that offered attractive yields, placing as much as $17 billion in orders. The risk aversion that swept through financial markets in the weeks that followed, however, weighed on the securities, with shorter-term investors quickly exiting their positions before their profits turned into losses.

35,2004-08-10,"['FOR TWO YEARS, Alan Greenspan has stood on the deck of the American economy under a banner reading ""Mission Accomplished."" In that time, the Fed chairman has been eager to take credit for stewarding the economy through a financial bubble and its turbulent aftermath. Two years ago, in Jackson Hole, Wyo., he said it was ""reasonable"" to assert that ""no low-risk, low-cost, incremental monetary tightening exists that can reliably deflate a bubble."" Perhaps. But, controversially, he went further, arguing that it appears there isn\'t even a Federal Reserve policy that ""can at least limit the size of a bubble and, hence, its destructive fallout."" Cut to last month, when he testified before Congress with a full-throated endorsement of the strength of the economy. Even as oil prices pressed higher, employment flagged and consumer spending trickled down, Sir Alan dismissed concerns, saying that the economy has hit merely a ""soft patch"" that would be ""short-lived,"" and that the current condition ""bodes well for consumer spending."" Mr. Greenspan and the Fed have boxed themselves in. After a few strong payroll reports and some inflation numbers that topped expectations earlier this year, the Fed\'s pledge of ""patience"" and ability to wait a ""considerable period"" went out the window. The Fed then went on its current measured course to raise rates to maintain price stability and seemingly won\'t be deterred, even in the face of a sputtering economy. Therefore, the sluggishness must be defined as temporary. So the federal-funds rate went up a quarter of a point to 1.5% yesterday, with little substantive change in the Fed policy makers\' description of the outlook. They are raising rates into a slowing economy because they have said they were going to. To not have raised interest rates yesterday risked seriously wrong-footing the markets and eroding credibility. But the Fed and its chairman aren\'t just in that one box. They are in the middle of a Russian doll of their own making. Mr. Greenspan must now raise rates, because, for Mr. Greenspan\'s legacy, the economy must be on a steady expansion path. It must be so because he has asserted that he dealt with the bubble and its aftermath correctly. For that amount and duration of stimulus -- coupled with the enormous tax cuts from the Bush administration -- not to revive the economy would mean that the Fed\'s ""Deal With Bubbles After They Pop"" policy isn\'t a successful course. Goldman Sachs economist Bill Dudley thinks the Fed has ""fundamentally underweighted the importance of the bursting of the bubble."" It is difficult for Mr. Greenspan to say the bubble is the reason for the current lackluster conditions ""because then they have to say the bubble had real consequences, not just financial consequences. It forces them to take responsibility."" Mr. Greenspan could have mitigated this problem by not declaring victory prematurely. He could have been more cautious about the sustainability of this fragile economic expansion. The Fed needs to keep an eye on inflation, but it needs to do less jawboning and more plain speaking. The Federal Open Market Committee shouldn\'t have been cheerleading for the economy in its statement yesterday, and it probably should have waited out this soft patch before raising rates again. Mr. Greenspan might take satisfaction that he is now being criticized by some economists and Wall Streeters for raising interest rates, when only a couple of months ago, he was being lambasted by other investors for being hopelessly behind the inflation curve. But just because different factions have equal and opposite critiques of your tenure doesn\'t mean you are doing a good job. It is true that corporations are in shipshape, with strong balance sheets and high margins. The tide of the global economy is rising.

36,2004-08-10,"['WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve raised short-term interest rates for the second time in two months and, suggesting that the recent economic slowdown was temporary, signaled that more rate increases remain in store this year. The Fed\'s policy-making committee increased its target for the federal-funds rate -- the rate charged on overnight loans between banks -- to 1.5% from 1.25%. It began lifting that target in June. It had cut it 13 times, to 1% from 6.5%, in the prior four years. Explaining its reasoning, the Fed said that ""in recent months, output growth has moderated and the pace of improvement in labor-market conditions has slowed"" -- developments that it blamed on ""the substantial rise in energy prices."" Some recent economic reports have been downbeat, in particular a surprisingly weak increase of 32,000 nonfarm jobs in July. That report, together with a softening in consumer spending in June triggered largely by higher oil prices, has prompted some economists to warn that the economic expansion could be in danger. The Fed doesn\'t share that view. In its statement, it said: ""The economy nevertheless appears poised to resume a stronger pace of expansion going forward."" Morgan Stanley economist David Greenlaw called the inclusion of such an explicit forecast in the Fed\'s statement ""highly unusual"" and ""a clear indication that the Fed feels the recent incoming data represent a temporary soft patch."" The statement suggests that the Fed is more likely than not to raise interest rates at its next few meetings, including Sept. 21, the last meeting before the election. It remains to be seen whether the Fed\'s optimism is well-grounded. For one thing, something other than high oil prices may be undermining consumer spending. If so, economic data in coming months could prove disappointing. Another risk is that oil prices may ratchet higher. If either happens, the Fed would have to consider a halt to rate increases. Still, the Fed seemed to go out of its way to suggest that its previous plan remains largely on track. It repeated that it expected to raise rates at a ""measured"" pace and retained its caveat that it would modify that course as necessary to preserve ""price stability."" The Fed first inserted that caveat in June as a warning that more robust growth or inflation numbers could force it to switch to half-point or larger moves. It did say that the likelihood of higher or lower inflation was about even, as were the risks of stronger and weaker economic growth, for the next few quarters. Even so, recent remarks by Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan and his colleagues clearly show they are more worried about breeding inflation by leaving rates low, than they are about aborting the expansion by continuing to raise them. Yesterday\'s rate move was approved by all 12 voting members of the Fed\'s 19-member Federal Open Market Committee. All 12 reserve banks had also requested a quarter-point increase in the more-symbolic discount rate, which is the rate charged on short-term advances to commercial banks The moves had divergent effects on stocks and bonds. Stocks sold off initially, then rallied to close on their highs, heartened by the Fed\'s optimistic outlook. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 130.01 points to 9944.67. Bond prices, which move in the opposite direction to yields, sold off in anticipation of higher short-term rates. The yield on the 10-year Treasury bond rose to 4.3% from 4.25%. ""I hadn\'t anticipated the explicit vote of confidence in the continuing underlying thrust of the expansion,"" said Michael Prell, a former top Fed staffer and now a consultant in Arlington, Va. ""Many in the [bond] market were hoping for a more neutral message."" Paradoxically, higher interest rates, which a sitting president normally deplores, might be good news for President Bush\'s re-election hopes. The Fed\'s optimistic outlook, ratified by the stock market\'s rally, will give credence to Mr. Bush\'s assertion that the economy is improving and hurt challenger John Kerry\'s claims to the contrary. In response to the Fed\'s raising the discount rate to 2.5% from 2.25%, several banks raised their prime lending rate to 4.5% from 4.25%. Other savings and loan rates will probably respond in coming days. Over time, higher rates discourage business and consumer borrowing, and thus keep the economy from overheating. The Fed\'s action and statement affirmed its overall strategy, first rolled out in May: to raise the funds rate at a ""measured"" pace, a euphemism for quarter-point moves. Fed officials say the 1% funds rate in place before June made sense only with last year\'s tepid growth, extreme business caution and risk of deflation, which is defined as generally falling prices. With the Fed confident that the expansion is entrenched, its goal now is to get rates back to a more normal level to avoid planting the seeds of inflation a year or two down the road. Before Friday\'s jobs report, that suggested the Fed would raise rates at most of its remaining meetings this year: in September, November and December, even if growth slowed a bit along the way. The weakness in July\'s employment report raised the possibility that growth had softened more than the Fed was willing to tolerate. Many analysts speculated that the Fed wouldn\'t change rates in September in part to avoid controversy close to the Nov. 2 election, although Fed officials say the election would have no bearing on their decision. To be sure, the Fed\'s acknowledgment of recent weakness does make coming rate increases a bit less certain. Futures markets late yesterday put the odds of a quarter-point increase in September at 68%, down from 78% Thursday but above 60%, where they stood before the Fed meeting yesterday. A key measure of credit conditions is the ""real"" interest rate, which is the interest rate minus the inflation rate. For almost three years, the real federal-funds rate has been negative. Many Fed officials, in particular some reserve-bank presidents who heard growing reports of price increases from local business contacts, are anxious to make the real funds rate positive again (implying a nominal rate of 2% or higher), fearing that leaving it negative would inevitably fuel price pressures. Some Fed governors in Washington were less concerned, believing the recent inflation jump to be transitory and confident that still-high unemployment would contain inflation pressures. Mr. Greenspan himself has edged closer to the inflation hawks lately. One of his concerns is that a major bulwark against inflation in recent years -- strong productivity growth, which enables firms to boost wages and sales without raising prices -- is fading. Yesterday, the Labor Department said growth in nonfarm business productivity slowed to an annual rate of 2.9% in the second quarter from 3.7% in the first. That\'s still a healthy pace but down from the exceptionally high 4% average of the prior three years. Slower growth in output per hour, coupled with brisk growth in hourly wages and benefits, caused labor costs per unit of output to grow 1.9% in the second quarter, the fastest pace in two years. --- Question of the Day: How many more times do you think Fed policy makers will raise rates before the end of the year?

37,2004-08-10,"[""WASHINGTON, Aug. 10 -- The Federal Reserve increased short-term interest rates on Tuesday by one-quarter of a percentage point, to 1.5 percent, and strongly implied that it would keep raising rates modestly but regularly in the months ahead.   Analysts had almost uniformly expected the increase, the second such move since June 30.   But the Fed, the nation's central bank, was tougher in a statement issued after the meeting than some had thought it would be, and this increased the prospects that policy makers would follow up with an additional rate rise at their next meeting in September, less than six weeks before the election.   In the statement, the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee acknowledged that economic growth and job creation had both slowed but said that the economy ''nevertheless appears poised to resume a stronger pace of expansion.''   The Fed also reiterated statements pointing to a series of small rate increases that are widely expected to stretch over the next year or so. And it raised another benchmark interest rate, the discount rate on loans to big banks, also by a quarter-point, to 2.5 percent.   ''We read it as pretty hawkish,'' said William C. Dudley, chief United States economist at Goldman, Sachs, the Wall Street investment bank. ''There was no hint here that the Fed is inclined to stop. They could have left open an escape hatch, but I don't see any escape hatch here.''   Though investors often sell stocks when they see interest rates rising, the stock market reacted positively to the Fed's statement that it expects economic growth to rebound soon. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, a broad measure of the performance of large stocks, rose 1.3 percent yesterday, as did the Dow Jones industrial average, which advanced just over 130 points, to 9,944.67. The technology-focused Nasdaq composite index closed up 1.9 percent, at 1,808.70.   Investors appear not only to have been encouraged by the Federal Reserve's positive outlook on the economy but may have been reassured that policy makers demonstrated steadiness rather than anxiety in carrying out their plans.   ''The markets are more optimistic because they are reflecting the optimism of the Fed's economic forecast,'' said Laurence H. Meyer, a former Fed governor and president of Macroeconomic Advisers, a forecasting firm in St. Louis.   Fed officials, after making clear their intention to start raising interest rates, have been watching as economic growth and job creation have slowed unexpectedly over the last three months, partly because rising gasoline prices have forced consumers to spend less on other things and partly because the stimulus effect of home refinancing and tax cuts has begun to ebb.   Economic growth slowed to a 3 percent annual pace in the second quarter of this year, down from a 4.5 percent pace in the first quarter, and the surge in job creation that accelerated last spring all but came to a halt in July.   Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, predicted last month that the economy's ''soft patch'' would prove temporary and said that the expansion was still ''self-sustaining'' -- a signal that policy makers intended to adhere to their goal of gradually raising rates from the lowest levels since the late 1950's.   In starting to raise rates now, even in the face of weak job growth and only modest price increases, the Fed seems intent on nipping any threat of inflation before it can flower.   At 1.5 percent, the federal funds rate on overnight loans between banks is below the rate of inflation, putting the ''real'' rate of such borrowing below zero. Mr. Greenspan has warned for months that interest rates are too low to be sustainable, because the flood of cheap money will eventually provoke a cycle of rising prices. But the Fed did not actually reverse its easy monetary policies until the economy had begun to weaken.   Fed officials may have little room for maneuver. Despite signs of sluggish growth, consumer prices are climbing faster than the central bankers would like to see, and the cost of oil, which has contributed to previous rounds of inflation, has surged. And even though wages have been lagging behind prices, total labor costs are rising, in large part because of higher health care costs.   On Tuesday, hours before the Fed announced its decision, the Labor Department reported that productivity growth slowed to 2.9 percent in the three months from April through June, the slowest pace in a quarter since late 2002. Unit labor costs, the cost of labor for a given amount of production, climbed at an annual pace of 1.9 percent.   Fed officials have closely watched labor costs, which they regard as one of the most important indicators of a fundamental rise in inflation.   The big question ahead is oil prices, which have climbed more than 30 percent this year and briefly touched a record of $45.02 a barrel on Tuesday before easing back to settle in New York at $44.52.   The Fed attributes much of the blame for the recent economic slowdown to the rise in oil prices, as do many private economists. And its optimistic outlook is based in part on the assumption that crude oil prices will decline to more typical levels.   Mr. Greenspan has studied the oil markets for decades, to the point of being able to recite from memory the details of major oil fields in the Persian Gulf region. Yet he and other top Fed officials argue that oil price increases still fall into the category of transitory events.   Several analysts said Fed policy makers could pause in their rate increases at their meeting in September, if the next rounds of data on consumer spending and business investment were weaker than expected.   ''We honestly believe that the Fed is unsure as to whether the economic glass is half-full or half-empty,'' wrote Richard Yamarone, director of economic research at Argus Research, who predicted that the Fed would wait until after the presidential election to raise rates again. ''The economy is undoubtedly on a prosperous path; it's just that some unforeseen obstacles have surfaced in recent weeks.''   But many investors took a different view. If the Fed had wanted to hint at the possibility of slower rate increases, this line of reasoning went, it could have modified its statement to allow for the possibility of a change in its stance if growth or employment stalled.   Instead, it emphasized that its monetary policy remains ''accommodative,'' meaning one that is based on cheap money, even after the latest rate increase. And though the Fed said it would still adjust its policy in response to changes in economic prospects, it said it would do so to fulfill its obligations to maintain price stability, and it remained silent about responding to slumping growth or employment.   Richard Berner, a senior economist at Morgan Stanley, said the Federal Reserve would ultimately chart its course on the basis of the economic data in the next few months. But nothing it has seen in the latest reports of weakness has yet swayed it from its intended course.   ''There is no change in the game plan,'' Mr. Berner said. ''The communication process is far from perfect, but people from Wall Street to Main Street should be getting the same message.''

38,2004-08-10,"[""Following is the text of a statement released by the Federal Reserve yesterday after the Fed's monetary policy panel, the Federal Open Market Committee, decided to raise its benchmark interest rates a quarter point:   The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to raise its target for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points, to 11/2 percent.   The committee believes that even after this action, the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative and, coupled with robust underlying growth in productivity, is providing ongoing support to economic activity. In recent months, output growth has moderated and the pace of improvement in labor market conditions has slowed. This softness likely owes importantly to the substantial rise in energy prices. The economy nevertheless appears poised to resume a stronger pace of expansion going forward. Inflation has been somewhat elevated this year, though a portion of the rise in prices seems to reflect transitory factors.   The committee perceives the upside and downside risks to the attainment of both sustainable growth and price stability for the next few quarters are roughly equal. With underlying inflation still expected to be relatively low, the committee believes that policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that is likely to be measured. Nonetheless, the committee will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to fulfill its obligation to maintain price stability.   Voting for the F.O.M.C. monetary policy action were: Alan Greenspan, chairman; Timothy F. Geithner, vice chairman; Ben S. Bernanke; Susan S. Bies; Roger W. Ferguson Jr.; Edward M. Gramlich; Thomas M. Hoenig; Donald L. Kohn; Cathy E. Minehan; Mark W. Olson; Sandra Pianalto; and William Poole.

39,1999-06-30,"[""WASHINGTON, June 30 -- The Federal Reserve nudged its benchmark interest rate up by a quarter of a percentage point today but said there was no clear case for another rate increase to keep inflation at bay. The increase in the overnight lending rate between banks, known as the Federal funds target rate, had been expected by economists and investors for weeks. The rise, to 5 percent from 4.75 percent, came after a series of three quarter-point rate reductions made by the central bank last fall during the height of the global financial crisis. But many analysts had expected the Federal Reserve to raise rates by another quarter-point at its next meeting in August, and they were caught off guard by the central bank's suggestion today that there was no consensus on the need for another increase to slow the economy's growth. That suggestion, in the form of a shift to a neutral stance from a stance toward higher rates, was taken as a green light by investors on Wall Street, who rapidly bid up stock and bond prices in the belief that higher rates were less likely this summer. The Dow Jones industrial average surged 210 points in the 13 minutes after the central bank's announcement and finished up 155.45 points, to 10,970.80. The yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, fell below 6 percent, closing at 5.96 percent. [Page C1.] Economists warned that investors might have overreacted and said that the Fed had not ruled out the possibility of another rate increase as soon as August if the economy did not show clear signs of cooling. In fact, a continued rise in stock prices could offset the slowing effect of today's increase and could prompt the Fed to raise rates even more. The central bank left unchanged, at 4.5 percent, its discount rate on loans to banks. Its quarter-point increase in the Federal funds rate could lead to an increase in loan rates for businesses and consumer credit like auto and home-equity loans. Many large banks raised their prime lending rates to 8 percent from 7.75 percent after the Fed completed its two-day policy meeting this afternoon. But interest rates that are set directly or indirectly in the financial markets, like those on mortgages and corporate bonds, will depend on whether investors think the likelihood of further rate increases has been diminished and that inflation is no threat. Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, has warned over the last several months that although there is almost no inflation, there is an increasing risk that continued robust growth could push wages and then prices into an upward spiral. Market interest rates had been moving higher over the last several months in anticipation of a rate increase by the Federal Reserve, helping to cool off rate-sensitive sectors of the economy like housing. But economic indicators have given mixed signals in recent weeks about the prospects for slowing, and analysts said the Fed's shift to a neutral stance today was intended to say that the central bank would wait for more data before deciding how to proceed rather than that it was finished tightening monetary policy for the year. ''They wanted to signal to the market that they haven't prejudged the next move,'' said William Dudley of Goldman, Sachs. ''In the end the decision is going to be dependent on the economic environment.'' But some analysts said they now expected the Fed to tighten policy only when it had tangible evidence of brewing inflationary pressures, not just an expectation of them. In explaining its decision, the Federal Reserve's policy-making Federal Open Market Committee remained open to what has become known as the ''new age'' economic paradigm: that huge investments in computers and other technology have made businesses so much more efficient that the economy can run at much higher levels than in the past, and at lower rates of unemployment, without generating inflation. ''Labor markets have continued to tighten over recent quarters, but strengthening productivity growth has contained inflationary pressures,'' the committee said. ''Owing to the uncertain resolution of the balance of conflicting forces in the economy going forward, the F.O.M.C. has chosen to adopt a directive that includes no predilection about near-term policy action.'' The statement went on, however, to emphasize that the Fed's tolerance for strong growth and low unemployment has its limits. ''The committee nonetheless recognizes that in the current dynamic environment, it must be especially alert to the emergence, or potential emergence, of inflationary forces that might undermine growth,'' the statement said. Since the Fed cut rates three times last fall, the economy has grown, and the financial crisis that started in Asia and spread around the world has abated. The central bank justified the rate increase today in those terms, saying ''the full degree'' of last fall's rate reductions is ''no longer necessary'' to keep financial markets well oiled and the economy in the United States on an even keel. If history is any guide, the shift to a neutral policy stance, or bias, is no guarantee that the Federal Reserve will not raise rates when it next meets on Aug. 24. The central bank has traditionally moved back to a neutral bias after raising rates even when another rate increase seemed likely. It maintained a neutral stance in 1994, for example, even as it was doubling the Federal funds rate to 6 percent from 3 percent. What is different this time around is that the Fed is disclosing its policy bias publicly after each meeting. In 1994, and until earlier this year, it kept the bias a secret until after the subsequent policy meeting, meaning that the central bank was not using it to signal its intentions to the markets. Whatever the Fed's intentions, the market's response today was to send stock prices higher, making consumers feel that much wealthier and willing to spend, and to bring down bond yields, providing a kick to the economy that could well offset whatever slowing effect the increase in official short-term rates accomplishes. ''In the process of making this announcement, the Fed has greatly reduced the odds that the economy is going to slow down,'' said Paul L. Kasriel, an economist at the Northern Trust Company in Chicago. ''The fear of Greenspan has been removed from the financial markets. That means the restrictiveness on the economy that had been put in place based on the expectation of higher rates has been removed.'' Investors could reassess their initial reaction in coming days, as they often do when it comes to the Fed's hints about policy. But they are most likely to take their cue from key indicators of growth and inflation in coming weeks, starting with job creation and the unemployment rate for June on Friday. Still, an array of politicians and business executives who had been pressing Mr. Greenspan to show restraint in slowing the economy given the absence of inflation took heart from the Fed's signals today. ''Given the dearth of inflation and strong but steady growth, today's decision was, in my judgment, an error, but a minor one,'' said Jerry Jasinowski, the president of the National Association of Manufacturers, which has long argued that the economy's potential for noninflationary growth is much higher than the Fed recognizes. Robert B. Reich, the former Labor Secretary in the Clinton Administration, said the Fed had ''exercised restraint'' in its rate increase but said the central bank had yet to recognize that it should not sacrifice growth and jobs to fighting inflation that does not yet exist. ''The metaphor suggesting that a little inflation is like the genie out of the bottle is simply wrong,'' Mr. Reich said. ''We know empirically that inflation can be stopped. More to the point, the lag between when the Fed acts and the response in the economy is actually very small, because financial markets are extraordinarily efficient and respond very quickly.''""]","[""washington, june 30 -- the federal reserve nudged its benchmark interest rate up by a quarter of a percentage point today but said there was no clear case for another rate increase to keep inflation at bay. the increase in the overnight lending rate between banks, known as the federal funds target rate, had been expected by economists and investors for weeks. the rise, to 5 percent from 4.75 percent, came after a series of three quarter-point rate reductions made by the central bank last fall during the height of the global financial crisis. but many analysts had expected the federal reserve to raise rates by another quarter-point at its next meeting in august, and they were caught off guard by the central bank's suggestion today that there was no consensus on the need for another increase to slow the economy's growth. that suggestion, in the form of a shift to a neutral stance from a stance toward higher rates, was taken as a green light by investors on wall street, who rapidly bid up stock and bond prices in the belief that higher rates were less likely this summer. the dow jones industrial average surged 210 points in the 13 minutes after the central bank's announcement and finished up 155.45 points, to 10,970.80. the yield on the benchmark 30-year treasury bond, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, fell below 6 percent, closing at 5.96 percent.

43,2001-10-02,"['NEW YORK -- The dollar shrugged off a widely expected interest-rate cut by the Federal Reserve, ending the day slightly weaker against the euro and slightly higher against the yen as heightened political risk continued to weigh on the currency. Sterling, meanwhile, weakened sharply against its major counterparts after U.K. Prime Minister Tony Blair gave his strongest endorsement yet to joining European Monetary Union during the five-year lifetime of his current Parliament. As expected, the Fed cut its overnight federal-funds rate target (which governs overnight interbank loans) to 2.5% from 3.0%, its lowest level since 1962. It also lowered the discount rate (a key benchmark) by the same amount, to 2%. The Federal Open Market Committee reiterated that ""the risks are weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate economic weakness in the foreseeable future."" This was exactly what currency markets had been expecting, a fact that sparked a slight selloff in the dollar in the aftermath of the rate decision, but not much price movement.

44,2004-09-21,"[""WASHINGTON, Sept. 21 -- The Federal Reserve raised short-term interest rates another quarter of a point on Tuesday, and it suggested that it will keep raising them gradually over the next year.   It was the Fed's third rate increase in three months. Coming six weeks before the presidential elections on Nov. 2, the decision pushed the federal funds rate on overnight loans between banks up to 1.75 percent from 1.5 percent.   While incumbent presidents normally cringe at the prospect of higher rates before an election, the increases are not expected to pose a threat to President Bush because consumers and businesses have felt almost no tangible impact.   Long-term interest rates, which determine home mortgage rates and many commercial loans, have edged down since June as fears of inflation have receded.   And because this was the Fed's last policy meeting before the elections, consumers are unlikely to feel any more pinch from rates before the elections than they have already.   ''If anything, the effect on consumers has been positive,'' said Sung Won Sohn, chief economist at Wells Fargo Bank in Minneapolis. Rates on 30-year fixed rate mortgages have declined from about 6.25 percent in June to 5.63 percent in mid-September, and the housing market remains almost as hot as ever. Stock and bond markets reacted very little to the decision, suggesting that long-term interest rates are likely to remain steady through the election as well. [Page C13.]   Shortly before the Fed announced its decision, the Commerce Department reported that housing construction, which had been expected to slow as rates went up, climbed to an annual rate of two million homes in August. That was the highest level in five months.   The main question ahead of Tuesday's decision was whether the central bank would signal any change in its goal of raising rates at a measured pace of regular quarter-point increases over the next year.   It did not, and if anything expressed greater optimism about the economy and therefore greater confidence about raising rates than it did after its previous policy meeting on Aug. 10.   ''Output growth appears to have regained some traction, and labor market conditions have improved modestly,'' the Federal Open Market Committee said in a statement accompanying its decision.   Reiterating previous statements, the central bank stressed that interest rates were still low. ''Even after this action, the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative,'' the Fed said in its statement.   Fed officials have made it clear that short-term rates, which were pushed down to 1 percent last year, are too low to be sustainable.   The ''real'' federal funds rate, after subtracting the effect of inflation, is still below zero and far below historical levels. Even in nominal terms, short-term rates are still as low as they were in the late 1950's.   ''Even though the Federal Reserve has started to tighten monetary policy, it's still far from tight,'' said Nariman Behravesh, chief economist at Global Insight, an economic forecasting company. ''By most measures, Fed policy is still quite stimulative.''   In sharp contrast to the first President Bush, whose top advisers blamed the policies of the Fed chairman, Alan Greenspan, for worsening the recession of 1990 and 1991, White House officials under the current President Bush have not criticized the rate increases.   By any measure, Mr. Bush has been a major beneficiary of Fed policy throughout his term, as the Fed cut rates repeatedly to fight the recession of 2001 and the shocks caused by the terrorist attacks and the preparations for wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.   Mr. Bush and Senator John Kerry both refused to comment on the Fed's latest rate increase.   ''It is not the Federal Reserve's decision today, but the wrong choices of President Bush over four years that has most squeezed the pocketbooks of middle class families,'' the Kerry campaign said in a statement on Tuesday.   Treasury Secretary John W. Snow, speaking to a town meeting in Nashua, N.H., said that Mr. Bush's tax cuts had provided much-needed ''oxygen'' to the economy and that rising interest rates were ''consistent with an economic recovery,'' according to the Reuters news service.   Nonetheless, Fed officials are aware that the economic expansion is more fragile than it seemed a few months ago, and the Fed was more cautious on Tuesday than when it first raised rates June 30.   In June, the Fed said the nation's output was rising at a solid pace. On Tuesday, by contrast, it said that output growth ''appears to have regained some traction.''   Ian Shepherdson, chief United States economist for High Frequency Economics in Valhalla, N.Y., said: ''There is a degree of ambiguity that was not there in June. What they are doing here is leaving themselves room to maneuver. They're telling us that if the data doesn't turn out the way they think they have room not to hike rates in November.''   Since the start of this year, Mr. Greenspan has charted a steady course even as the economy experienced an unexpected jump in consumer prices this spring and an unexpected slowdown in consumer spending and economic growth in the summer.   Mr. Greenspan and other top officials contended that both surprises would prove temporary, and they have already been vindicated on the issue of consumer prices. The core rate of inflation, excluding volatile sectors like food and energy, declined to only 0.1 percent in August.   The jury is still out on whether Mr. Greenspan is correct in contending that the soft patch in the economy is ending. Economic growth slowed to an annual rate of 2.8 percent in the second quarter, barely half as fast as the previous quarter, but most forecasters still predict that growth will remain above 3.5 percent for the rest of the year.   Chart: ''Responding to the Fed''   As the Federal Reserve has started to push up short-term interest rates, the cost of home equity loans has climbed in tandem with the moves.

The committee believes that even after this action, the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative and, coupled with robust underlying growth in productivity, is providing ongoing support to economic activity.

48,2008-10-29,"['The euro remained stronger against the dollar, even though U.S. stocks reversed a rally, after the Federal Open Market Committee fulfilled Wall Street calls for a rate cut. The Fed cut its fed-funds target rate half a percentage point, to 1%, the lowest level since June 2004. Initially, the euro and equities markets declined in the wake of the announcement. The market had expected the cut, and traders took profits on bullish positions in advance of the announcement. But the Fed in its statement noted it was adopting a range of extraordinary measures to pump liquidity into the credit markets and signaled that it was open to further cuts. This helped U.S. bank stocks bounce in a late-day rally characteristic of volatile markets over the latest weeks. In turn, currency traders went back to their higher-yielding, riskier bets. When the equities rally then reversed, pushing the Dow Jones Industrial Average to close down 74.16 points, the euro held on to its lead on the dollar. However, the dollar slipped and was slightly lower against the yen. Late Wednesday afternoon in New York, the euro was at $1.2941 from $1.2699 late Tuesday, while the dollar was at 97.18 yen from 97.63 yen. The euro was at 125.76 yen from 123.98 yen. The U.K. pound was at $1.6393 from $1.5898 and the dollar was at 1.1326 Swiss francs from 1.1567 francs Tuesday. Earlier in the session, the dollar fell to its lowest level this week against the euro as markets geared up for the rate cut, U.S. stocks rose and crude-oil futures prices sank. The euro hit an intraday high of $1.2993. Nevertheless, analysts said financial-market uncertainty persists, especially as the Fed\'s economic outlook was more dire than many in the market expected. ""The pace of economic activity appears to have slowed markedly, owing importantly to a decline in consumer expenditures,"" the statement said. The financial crisis, it added, ""is likely to exert additional restraint on spending."" As a result, said Ron Leven, a currency strategist at Morgan Stanley in New York, position reduction continues to be the driving force of markets, which leads to dollar demand. The dollar is considered among the most liquid and safe assets, the reason it is a reserve currency. That high demand led the Fed Wednesday to also announce temporary reciprocal currency arrangements with Brazil, Mexico, South Korea and Singapore to improve liquidity in global financial markets. The Brazilian real and Mexican peso narrowly advanced on the news. The facilities will support the provision of U.S. dollar liquidity in amounts of as much as $30 billion each by the four non-U.S. central banks.

The Fed already has swap lines with several major central banks, including the European Central Bank, Bank of England and Reserve Bank of Australia.

""the pace of economic activity appears to have slowed markedly, owing importantly to a decline in consumer expenditures,"" the statement said. the financial crisis, it added, ""is likely to exert additional restraint on spending."" as a result, said ron leven, a currency strategist at morgan stanley in new york, position reduction continues to be the driving force of markets, which leads to dollar demand. the dollar is considered among the most liquid and safe assets, the reason it is a reserve currency. that high demand led the fed wednesday to also announce temporary reciprocal currency arrangements with brazil, mexico, south korea and singapore to improve liquidity in global financial markets. the brazilian real and mexican peso narrowly advanced on the news. the facilities will support the provision of u.s. dollar liquidity in amounts of as much as $30 billion each by the four non-u.s. central banks. volatility in these countries and the consequent exit of investors back to funding currencies have been a big part of the dollar's recent strength. the fed already has swap lines with several major central banks, including the european central bank, bank of england and reserve bank of australia. the move by the fed ""broadens cooperation with a wider net of countries, and it should limit the extent to which money-market instability creates currency instability that becomes destabilizing for all asset classes, eventually hurting u.s. exports,"" said alan ruskin, international strategist at rbs greenwich capital.  license this article from dow jones reprint service']",32.0,1.0,"nevertheless, analysts said financial-market uncertainty persists, especially as the fed's economic outlook was more dire than many in the market expected",,,,,,,1

50,2008-10-29,"[""Following is the full text of Wednesday's statement by the Federal Reserve announcing it was lowering interest rates by a half-point, to 1 percent. The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to lower its target for the federal funds rate 50 basis points to 1 percent. The pace of economic activity appears to have slowed markedly, owing importantly to a decline in consumer expenditures. Business equipment spending and industrial production have weakened in recent months, and slowing economic activity in many foreign economies is damping the prospects for United States exports. Moreover, the intensification of financial market turmoil is likely to exert additional restraint on spending, partly by further reducing the ability of households and businesses to obtain credit. In light of the declines in the prices of energy and other commodities and the weaker prospects for economic activity, the committee expects inflation to moderate in coming quarters to levels consistent with price stability. Recent policy actions, including today's rate reduction, coordinated interest rate cuts by central banks, extraordinary liquidity measures and official steps to strengthen financial systems should help over time to improve credit conditions and promote a return to moderate economic growth. Nevertheless, downside risks to growth remain. The committee will monitor economic and financial developments carefully and will act as needed to promote sustainable economic growth and price stability.

51,1995-12-19,"['Prices of Treasury securities rebounded sharply yesterday as the Federal Reserve lowered short-term interest rates.   The price of the 30-year bond rose 1 10/32, to 110 15/32; its yield, which moves in the opposite direction of its price, dropped to 6.11 percent, down from 6.20 percent on Monday. The benchmark issue lost a point and a half on Monday on fears the cut would not occur while Federal budget talks were stalemated. Before rising, bonds faltered in early trading on follow-through selling generated by Monday\'s steep drop.   Inflation has been somewhat more favorable than anticipated,"" the Alan Greenspan, the Fed\'s chairman, said in a statement, ""and this result along with an associated moderation in inflation expectations warrants a modest easing in monetary conditions.""   The Fed move trimmed the Federal funds rate that banks charge each other for overnight loans by a quarter of a percentage point, to 5.50 percent. It followed a string of statistics showing the economy softening after a rise in the third quarter. Donald Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Securities, said, ""In addition to the subdued, benign and nonthreatening pace of inflation it is certainly true that some recently released economic statistics indicating a slower pace of business activity entered into the equation as well.""   The Federal Open Market Committee\'s rate cut yesterday, in its last meeting of the year, followed a similar cut five months ago.   Expectations of what the Fed would do yesterday had been divided, with half of the market seeing at least a cut of 25 basis points in short-term rates and the other not expecting any change because of the stalled budget talks. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.   Nerves, though, remained a bit frayed over what budget compromises will be made to reach an accord. Traders said the early losses were pared after President Clinton and Congressional leaders agreed to meet at the White House at 3 P.M. on a seven-year deficit reduction plan. ""People are seeing that politicians are actually sitting down to talk,"" said Gerald A. Guild, head of fixed- income trading at Advest Inc.   After the meeting in Washington, both sides said that there had been progress. Republicans said that if a another high-level budget meeting went well today, they would consider a stopgap spending bill to end the partial shutdown of the Government. They also said they hoped talks would lead to a budget agreement by the end of the year. Elsewhere in the market, the Treasury plans to sell $18.25 billion in new two-year notes today and $12 billion in new five-year notes tomorrow. In when-issued trading ahead of the auctions, the twos were being offered at a price to yield 5.27 percent and the fives at 5.50 percent.   In municipal bonds, where New York City\'s huge $1.3 billion offering weighed on a market already flush with new issues, the bonds offered yields higher than Treasury securities to make them more attractive to investors and easier to compete with existing issues.   Traders said the sale was also helped by the fact that the settlement date -- that date buyers must pay for the bonds -- falls a few days after Jan. 1, when investors normally are receiving cash from interest payments on other investments.   Goldman, Sachs & Company was the senior manager in the sale, which was made up of bonds maturing from 1997 through 2025, with a maximum yield of 6.32 percent for the longest maturity, about 14 basis points more than a comparable Treasury security.   Serial bonds with shorter maturities offered yields from 4.10 percent for an issue due in 1997 to 6.27 percent for bonds due in 2014 and 2015. Other long bonds were priced to yield 6.30 percent for those due in 2019 and 2020.   Though the issue was priced at a precarious time for the markets, as the market awaited the Fed\'s decision, traders said the deal went well. By borrowing money at lower interest rates the city has reduced its debt service payments.   ""The key thing,"" said Alan L. Anders, director of financing policy for New York City\'s Office of Budget Management, ""is that the city realized a $47 million savings for the current fiscal 1996 budget, only a little less than what we expected.""

52,1995-12-19,"['WASHINGTON, Dec. 19 -- Nudged along by a slowing economy and nervous financial markets, the Federal Reserve lowered a key interest rate today by a quarter of a point.   The cut in short-term rates, which the Federal Reserve said was justified because of the lack of any threat of inflation, allowed the stock and bond markets to regain some of their big losses on Monday. But it left considerable uncertainty about whether Wall Street would be cheered by President Clinton\'s agreement with Republican Congressional leaders this afternoon to come up with a framework for a budget accord that would be concluded by the end of the year. The announcement at the White House came after the markets closed.   The Federal Reserve action, trimming to 5.5 percent the rate at which banks lend each other money overnight, marked the first time in five months that the nation\'s central bank has yielded to the perception in financial markets that interest rates were too high. [Page D1.]   But in a quirk of the interplay among the Federal Reserve, the markets and the budget negotiators, the small cut in interest rates and the resulting 34.68-point increase in the Dow Jones industrial average may actually ease some of the pressure for a quick compromise on a balanced budget.   The sharp drop in the financial markets on Monday provoked considerable finger-pointing in Washington this morning. Fear spread among politicians in both parties that they might be blamed for reversing the huge run-up in the stock and bond markets over the year. But it was unclear how big a role those fears played in the agreement reached this afternoon among President Clinton, House Speaker Newt Gingrich and Senator Bob Dole, the majority leader, to try once again to settle their differences -- this time by the end of next week.   ""A hundred-point drop is not big enough to force anyone to make concessions they view as unwise,"" one senior Administration official said today. ""But it certainly is big enough to get your attention.""   Consumers are likely to derive only limited benefits from today\'s cut. The Federal Reserve left unchanged at 5.25 percent the discount rate, which it charges banks for short-term loans. Only one bank, Banc One of Columbus, Ohio, responded to the Fed\'s action today by cutting its prime lending rate, which helps determine the rate on a variety of consumer and small business loans. Others may follow soon. Markets also drove down longer-term rates that influence the cost of home mortgages, but they remained above levels prevailing earlier this month and any savings to consumers would be modest.   In Washington, though, symbolism is often more important than substance, and the symbol of a rate cut at a time of a Government shutdown and a possible budget deal is a particularly strong one. The Fed\'s chairman, Alan Greenspan, has waded into the middle of the balanced-budget debate several times, predicting to Congress that a balanced budget accord would prompt the markets to cut long-term rates even further. Several analysts viewed the Fed\'s rate cut as a carrot dangled in front of White House and Congressional leaders as the nation moved into a critical election year.   To no one\'s surprise, Mr. Greenspan mentioned none of the political maneuvering on the budget in his terse statement announcing the Fed\'s cut in rates. ""Since the last easing of monetary policy in July,"" he said, ""inflation has been somewhat more favorable than anticipated, and this result along with an associated moderation in inflation expectations warrants a modest easing in monetary conditions.""   While the Federal Reserve was concerned about some indicators of a slowing economy -- weaker retail and auto sales, an erratic housing market and some signs that the worldwide demand for semiconductors is winding down after a frenetic year -- it clearly does not view a recession as a real danger. Economic growth, in fact, was not even mentioned in Mr. Greenspan\'s statement.   What gave the Fed a bit of room to operate was the low inflation rate. Curbing inflation is the Fed\'s chief mission, and with the Consumer Price Index rising only 2.6 percent so far this year, the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee could initiate a modest reduction without any fear of adding any fuel to the inflationary embers.   No sooner had the Fed acted today than the Secretary of the Treasury, Robert E. Rubin, declared that the economy was in fine shape. ""We believe that the current expansion has considerable room to run,"" Mr. Rubin said in a statement that was released jointly with Joseph E. Stiglitz, the chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers.   But privately, Mr. Rubin has been warning Administration officials that the markets have built into their current high levels the assumption that a balanced budget deal will be reached. And his warning was borne out on Monday, when the specter of budget impasse was enough to touch off a correction that seemed simply waiting for an excuse to set it off.   The unresolved question is whether the slightly better prospect of a budget deal will be enough to sustain the rebound that began this afternoon. While the Fed\'s cut buoyed the market, that move is not likely to be repeated soon. As one White House aide put it late today: ""Next week Alan Greenspan isn\'t going to be able to put his finger in the dike.""   The Federal Reserve will not meet to consider interest rates again until the end of January, and it is unlikely to act any earlier unless economic conditions change markedly..   So the markets may be riding out the end of the year on the ups and downs of the budget talks, at once reflecting their progress and influencing their outcome. It is a situation that leaves many analysts and fund managers uneasy.   ""When you look at the effect the budgets they are talking about have on the economy, it doesn\'t amount to a hill of beans,"" said Allen Sinai, the chief global economist at Lehman Brothers. The shrinking of the Federal budget, Mr. Sinai has calculated, could cause a $20 billion to $25 billion ""drag"" on economic growth next year. In a $7 trillion economy that rolls ahead as relentlessly as the Mississipi River, that is a small drop in the stream.   One crucial piece of information that the Federal Reserve is supposed to rely on -- the latest estimate of growth of the gross domestic product for the third quarter -- may not have been available to its policy makers today. That is because of the continuing shutdown of many corners of the Government, including the Commerce Department, which compiles the statistic. It will not be released publicly until a continuing budget resolution is passed, allowing the department to reopen.   The Federal Reserve\'s action today concludes a year in which it received an enormous amount of scrutiny for doing relatively little to interest rates. The last change in the Federal funds rate came in July, when the Fed lowered it by a quarter of a percentage point to 5.75 percent. Just as it did today, the Fed left the discount rate unchanged at 5.25 percent.   Seven increases during the 12-month period beginning on Feb. 4, 1994, pushed the Federal funds rate up to 6 percent from 3 percent. The Federal Reserve Board also raised the discount rate in four stages, to 5.25 percent from 3 percent, beginning on May 17, 1994.

53,1990-11-13,"['NEW YORK -- The dollar ended slightly higher against its European counterparts though stronger against the yen, after being caught between interest rate concerns and uncertainty in the Persian Gulf. Lacking definitive news to drive either an aggressive sell-off or buying spree, the greenback remained bound in tight trading ranges, taking a back seat to the mark as the main market-mover. A robust German economy and widespread expectations of a firm, if not tightening, monetary policy by the Deutsche Bundesbank is fostering the sentiment in the market that ""one can hold marks against everything,"" said Albert Soria, first vice president and foreign exchange manager at Kansallis-Osake-Pankki in New York. While the high costs of reconstructing the former East Germany might normally be perceived as a strain on the German economy and currency, the market is apparently interpreting it the opposite way. Germany\'s massive need for capital amid a global credit shortage suggests that to attract the necessary funds, the Germans will coordinate a firm interest rate policy and the architecture for a strong mark, said Marc Cohen, vice president of corporate foreign exchange for Fuji Bank in New York. This optimism over the mark, coupled with the speculation of a further cut in U.S. interest rates, sent the dollar to yet another historic low against the German unit of 1.4735 marks. The previous low was 1.4753 marks set in intraday European trading Monday. Expectations of a U.S. rate reduction were heightened because of yesterday\'s meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, the policy-making body of the U.S. Federal Reserve. The perceived federal funds target rate is currently at 7 3/4%. Another 25 basis point cut is widely expected by the market, participants said. Several traders said that expectations of a Fed easing the same day as the FOMC meeting were premature. Nevertheless, it appeared that many participants had sold off the dollar in expectation of money market intervention by the Fed yesterday. When no such activity materialized, however, disappointed participants took back some dollars, traders said. Mounting evidence that U.S. interest rates will have to come down soon to bolster an ""economy dripping with recessionary fears"" continue to encourage taking slightly short positions, said Joseph Cambria, foreign exchange manager at Banque Paribas in New York. Participants are expecting an easing of monetary policy as early as this week, traders said. But, because a small relaxation in monetary policy already is factored into the market, ""we could see a spike in the dollar just after the move if it comes in {as expected} at 7 1/2%,"" he added. Meanwhile, the rhetoric out of the Persian Gulf seemed to blow alternately hot and cold, leaving participants unwilling to buy dollars in expectation of war and equally reluctant to be extremely oversold on the U.S. unit. Late in the New York trading day, the dollar was quoted at 1.4785 marks, up from 1.4780 marks late Monday in New York. The U.S. currency was also changing hands at 129.69 yen, up from 128.33 yen in New York late Monday. Sterling was trading at $1.9630, down from $1.9655 late Monday. In early trading in Tokyo Wednesday, the dollar was trading at 129.47 yen, up from Tuesday\'s Tokyo close of 128.77 yen. Meanwhile, the U.S. currency was quoted at about 1.4798 marks, up from Tuesday\'s Tokyo close of 1.4755 marks. Tokyo\'s markets were closed Monday for a holiday. The White House insisted that it seeks a ""peaceful resolution"" of the Iraq crisis and that the suggestion that Congress be recalled to debate offensive military action was unnecessary. As a result, many traders felt that the threat of an immediate flare-up in the Gulf was lessened, traders said. Other traders, however, may have concentrated on more menacing comments, such as U.K. Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher\'s statements that she believes Iraqi President Saddam Hussein is close to acquiring nuclear weapons, and that force must be used unless Iraq ends its occupation of Kuwait. The net effect of belligerent and conciliatory rhetoric was effectively to keep participants unsure as to how the Gulf-factor would affect the dollar. Much more attention was consequently paid to non-dollar foreign exchange trading. Yesterday was generally a day of broad mark strength and yen weakness. The mark ended New York dealings at around 87.72 yen, up from 86.83 yen late Monday. The mark also gained against the Swiss franc, finishing at 0.8465 Swiss franc, up from 0.8437 Swiss franc Tuesday. Sterling also stumbled against the mark, changing hands at 2.9023 marks, above its intraday low of 2.8985 marks, but down from 2.9050 marks late Monday and well below its central European Monetary System rate of 2.9500 marks. The yen lost not only against the mark, but also weakened against sterling and the Swiss unit. Sterling was quoted at 254.58 yen, above 252.23 yen late Monday. The Swiss franc was at 103.63 yen, up from 102.91 yen late Monday. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery settled at $386 an ounce, up $3.70.

54,1990-11-13,"['NEW YORK -- Bond prices shot up yesterday as strong bullish sentiment, fueled by perceptions that both interest rates and inflation are declining, continued to lure buyers into the market. The benchmark 30-year bond ended one point higher yesterday in U.S. trading when compared with Friday\'s closing levels. The advance translates into a gain of $10 for a bond with a $1,000 face amount. The issue\'s yield, which moves in the opposite direction of its price, eased to 8.53%. Corporates, tax-exempt municipals, mortgage-backed securities and junk bonds also posted solid gains. Some traders argue that the advance in the Treasury market wasn\'t that spectacular considering prices of government notes and bonds had been surging overseas long before the U.S. market opened. The U.S. bond market was essentially closed Monday in observance of Veterans Day, although many domestic investors purchased U.S. Treasury securities on Monday in London. The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond rose 7/8 point in London on Monday. Michael Moran, manager of government trading at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corp., said trading yesterday amounted to ""catch up from overnight"" trading in overseas markets. ""We came in at these levels but were not able to make substantially new highs,"" due to profit taking. Mr. Moran said the profit takers dominated trading for much of the morning. That, combined with rising oil prices and disappointment that the Federal Reserve didn\'t reduce interest rates yesterday, constrained the market\'s upward potential. But traders said the mood in the market remains decidedly bullish. Although the Federal Reserve did not reduce short-term interest rates yesterday, market players are ""optimistic that the Fed will ease in the next few days,"" said James Capra, a senior vice president at Lehman Brothers Government Securities Inc. He said inflationary expectations also are improving, largely because investors believe that oil prices will soon resume their downward drift as the fear of war in the Middle East recedes. The Fed\'s policy-making Federal Open Market Committee met yesterday to discuss the direction of interest rates. Many investors expect the central bank to loosen its monetary stance as early as today. Treasury Securities Treasury prices rose sharply from Friday\'s closing levels, but were up only modestly from levels reached on Monday in London. The benchmark 30-year bond was quoted late yesterday in New York at 102 8/32, up from 101 8/32 late Friday in New York. The bond was quoted late Monday in London at 102 3/32. The benchmark bond\'s yield ended domestic trading yesterday at 8.53%, down from 8.62% in New York on Friday. Prices of short-term securities also rose. The price of two-year notes ended at 100 9/32 to yield 7.57%. That was up from Friday\'s price of 100 8/32 to yield 7.59%. The government sold $20.1 billion of Treasury bills yesterday at its regular weekly auction. The average discount rate for three-month bills was set at 7.05%, while 7.02% was the rate set for six-month bills. The rates were down from last week\'s auction, when they were 7.07% and 7.05%, respectively. The 7.05% rate on the three-month bills was the lowest at an auction since the average of 6.94% at the Aug. 8, 1988 auction. The average rate on six-month bills was the lowest at an auction since the average of 6.99% at the July 11, 1988 auction. Here are details of yesterday\'s auction: Rates are determined by the difference between the purchase price and face value. Thus, higher bidding narrows the investor\'s return while lower bidding widens it. The percentage rates are calculated on a 360-day year, while the coupon equivalent yield is based on a 365-day year. 13-Week            26-Week Applications ......... $33,837,600,000    $30,462,895,000 Accepted bids ........ $10,086,145,000    $10,015,665,000 Accepted at low price              41%                44% Accepted noncompet\'ly  $ 1,871,390,000    $ 1,392,870,000 Average price (Rate)    98.218 (7.05%)     96.451 (7.02%) High price (Rate) ..... 98.220 (7.04%)     96.461 (7.00%) Low price (Rate) ...... 98.218 (7.05%)     96.451 (7.02%) Coupon equivalent .....          7.28%              7.38% Both issues are dated Nov. 15.

Corporate & Junk Bonds More than $1.4 billion of investment-grade debt was offered yesterday, including a $500 million issue of 40-year bonds by Hydro-Quebec, a Canadian state-run utility. The debentures were priced by underwriters led by First Boston Corp. to yield 9.556%, a spread of 1.03 percentage points above the Treasury\'s 30-year bond. The Hydro-Quebec issue is one of the few long-term bond offerings to hit the market in the fourth quarter. Prior to Hydro-Quebec\'s offering yesterday, only $750 million in long-term corporate debt had been priced this quarter. With so few long-term fixed-income securities to choose from, analysts said that investors snapped up the Hydro-Quebec securities, which are rated double-A-3 by Moody\'s Investors Service Inc. Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc. priced an issue of 250,000 units through underwriters led by Salomon Brothers Inc. Each unit consists of one three-year 8.20% note and one warrant which is exercisable between June 19, 1991 and July 10, 1991 into one 8.20% note three-year note. Other corporations that tapped the market yesterday included Pennzoil Co. and Phillips Petroleum Co. In trading yesterday, the investment-grade corporate debt market ended 3/4 to 1 point higher. Junk bonds ended 3/8 to 1/2 point higher. Municipal Bonds Municipal-bond prices ended 1/4 to 5/8 point higher. In new-issue dealings, PaineWebber Inc. officials reported that an unsold balance on an issue of $303.3 million New York State general obligation bonds would be released on Wednesday. The single-A rated bonds, won via competitive bid, are priced to yield from 5.90% in 1991 to 7.40% in 2016 to 2020. Several New York traders said Tuesday that the state paid virtually no penalty for its current fiscal problems on the price of the bonds. Among actively traded issues, the New Jersey Turnpike Authority\'s 7.20% securities of 2018 were 3/8 higher at 99 3/8 to yield 7.24%. No large new competitive deals are expected to be priced today. Mortgage-, Asset-Backed Securities Mortgage-backed securities ended between 3/8 and 1/2 point higher yesterday. Government National Mortgage Association 9.5% securities for November delivery, for example, were up 14/32 at 100 3/32. There were no new mortgage-backed or asset-backed offerings announced. Foreign Bonds Spain\'s debut in the French franc eurobond market was given a rousing welcome yesterday. The three-billion-franc ($601 million) offering of eight-year bonds was the largest raised in a single transaction in the fixed-rate Eurofranc market. And Spain was the first sovereign borrower to tap the sector all year. ""Spain wanted to make a splash, and it\'s done exactly that,"" said a syndicate manager of a French bank. Credit Commercial de France won the mandate for the Spain Eurobond after intense competition among five banks. The issue was sold to investors at a fixed price of 99.27 to yield 10.64%. The bonds were freed to trade minutes after pricing and closed at a price of 99.28 bid, 99.38 offered. The yield was about 0.40 percentage point above the comparable French Treasury issue, the low end of expectations. In trading, seasoned Eurodollar bonds were quoted about 3/8 point higher, but spreads between yields on Eurobonds and U.S. Treasurys widened because the Euromarket lagged the U.S. Treasury market\'s gains.']","['new york -- bond prices shot up yesterday as strong bullish sentiment, fueled by perceptions that both interest rates and inflation are declining, continued to lure buyers into the market. the benchmark 30-year bond ended one point higher yesterday in u.s. trading when compared with friday's closing levels. the advance translates into a gain of $10 for a bond with a $1,000 face amount. the issue's yield, which moves in the opposite direction of its price, eased to 8.53%. corporates, tax-exempt municipals, mortgage-backed securities and junk bonds also posted solid gains. some traders argue that the advance in the treasury market wasn't that spectacular considering prices of government notes and bonds had been surging overseas long before the u.s. market opened. the u.s. bond market was essentially closed monday in observance of veterans day, although many domestic investors purchased u.s. treasury securities on monday in london. the benchmark 30-year treasury bond rose 7/8 point in london on monday. michael moran, manager of government trading at donaldson, lufkin & jenrette securities corp., said trading yesterday amounted to ""catch up from overnight"" trading in overseas markets.

56,2002-03-19,"['WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged at a key policy meeting, but it laid the first, tentative groundwork to possibly reverse an unprecedented string of rate cuts last year and start lifting rates later this year. As expected, the central bank left its target short-term interest rate at a 40-year low of 1.75% yesterday, and in a break with the past, it also disclosed that all 10 members of its policy-making body voted in favor of that decision. More significantly, the Fed declared that risks are now evenly balanced between economic weakness and inflation, the first time since November of 2000 that it hasn\'t seen risks tilted toward weakness. The shift in its assessment of risks, which could signal that the recent era of declining rates is over, follows a spate of signs lately that the economy is recovering more quickly than Fed officials had anticipated. ""The information that has become available since the last meeting of the committee indicates that the economy, bolstered by a marked swing in inventory investment, is expanding at a significant pace,"" the Fed said in a statement. In January, Fed officials generally expected the economy to expand 2.5% to 3% over the course of the year, and unemployment to top 6%. But some now acknowledge those figures are conservative. Private-sector forecasts put growth at 4% or better, and the unemployment rate dropped to 5.5% in February from 5.8% in December. The change in risk assessments was widely anticipated by analysts, who predict the Fed will soon start reversing some of the 11 rate cuts undertaken last year to counteract the recession and the fallout from the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. The economy\'s speedy rebound suggests that, at 1.75%, the Federal funds rate is too low for the expansion to continue without eventually generating inflation. Long-term rates, such as on mortgages, have risen this year in anticipation of such a reversal. Futures markets put high odds that the Fed will raise rates a quarter of a percentage point in May and an additional quarter point in June, though yesterday they trimmed those odds slightly. The Fed did allude to the low level of rates, saying ""the stance of monetary policy is currently accommodative."" But it also underlined the continued risks to the expansion by noting: ""The degree of the strengthening in final demand over coming quarters, an essential element in sustained economic expansion, is still uncertain."" That suggests an increase in rates could still be further off than investors expect. Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan has warned that a boost to growth from inventory replenishment could peter out without a follow-through from business and consumer spending. Although auto and retail sales have held up, and business spending also appears to have turned the corner, Mr. Greenspan has also warned that some of stimulants to growth could be temporary, such as the boost to purchasing power from falling energy prices, which has since begun to reverse, and mortgage refinancing, which has cooled with the recent climb in long-term rates. With Fed officials still seeing no imminent outbreak of inflation, they can afford to wait several months to be sure the recovery is sound. Like the Fed, central banks in Europe slashed rates last year to stave off recession. The formal end to that cycle of monetary easing took place yesterday, when Sweden\'s central bank became the first major central bank to raise interest rates. The much-larger European Central Bank, which sets interest rates for the 12 nations that use the euro, is signaling that interest rates won\'t fall further, but that they will not rise anytime soon either. For the most part, though, the euro zone economy does appear well on the way to economic recovery. For the Fed, the assessment of the ""balance of risks"" -- something it makes at each meeting of policy makers -- is part of a new disclosure policy adopted in January 2000, which replaced the old ""bias"" to raise or lower interest rates. Fed officials made the change out of concern that the bias was too often interpreted as a commitment to raise or lower rates. The balance of risks was designed to be less constricting, by removing any direct linkage to rates or to any specific time period. Thus, the shift to balanced risks doesn\'t mean a rate increase will follow soon. On the other hand, the Fed could also raise rates without first tilting risks toward inflation. By releasing how members of the Federal Open Market Committee vote on the funds rate, the Fed is taking another step to make its decision-making more transparent. In 1994, it began releasing a statement when it changed the funds rate. At its December 1998 meeting, the FOMC decided also to announce immediately major shifts in its policy bias. Beginning in 2000, it began releasing a statement after every meeting. With yesterday\'s change, the Fed will disclose immediately if any member of the committee, made up of the board\'s seven governors (two of whose seats are now vacant) and five of the 12 regional bank presidents, dissented. That had been disclosed in the meeting\'s minutes, released after the subsequent FOMC meeting. --- G.

57,2002-03-19,"[""WASHINGTON, March 19 -- The Federal Reserve signaled to investors, businesses and consumers today that they should prepare for higher interest rates this year if the economy continues its speedy recovery. At a meeting of the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee, the central bank voted to hold rates steady, as it did at its meeting in January. But the Fed laid the groundwork to begin reversing some of the 11 rate cuts it carried out last year as the economy sank into recession. The central bank also took a step to respond to criticism that its deliberations remain too shrouded in secrecy. It said that from now on it would immediately disclose how individual members voted on interest rate decisions. The Fed now waits to disclose the votes of individual members until after the subsequent meeting, when it releases minutes of its deliberations. At today's meeting, the Fed said, all 10 members of the open-market committee supported the decision to leave rates unchanged. In a statement, the committee said it was standing down from what amounted to a heightened state of alert for further economic weakness, reflecting the view of Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, that a recovery is well under way and that further rate cuts are unlikely. The Fed said it now viewed the risks to the economy as evenly balanced between sustained weakness and growth so strong that it could ignite inflation. In shifting to a neutral stance, the Fed did not commit itself to raising rates, and it cited continued uncertainty about whether initial signs of a robust comeback will be sustained throughout the year. But it noted evidence that the economy was bouncing back very strongly, suggesting that it would soon have to revisit what it called its ''accommodative'' level of interest rates. Recent data indicate that the economy ''is expanding at a significant pace,'' the statement said. But it added that it was ''still uncertain'' whether the expansion could be continued for long enough to assure that the economy does not stall. ''In these circumstances, although the stance of monetary policy is currently accommodative, the committee believes that against the backdrop of its long-run goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth and of the information currently available,'' the statement said, ''the risks are balanced with respect to the prospects for both goals.'' In shifting the focus of its policy statement away from the risks of recession, the Fed was adhering to its practice of trying to give the financial markets plenty of warning when its foresees a reversal in the direction of interest rates. Although it no longer adopts a formal policy ''bias'' toward raising or lowering rates, the Fed has taken to communicating its intentions through a ''balance of risks'' statement. Unless faced with a rapid change in the outlook or a financial crisis, the Fed has tended to change course gradually to avoid destabilizing the markets; in this case, the Fed has moved from a tilt toward cutting rates to a neutral stance, and many economists expect that it will use its next meeting, on May 7, to signal that it intends to start raising rates. Bruce Steinberg, chief economist at Merrill Lynch, called today's statement ''a step toward a new tightening cycle,'' adding that the questions now are ''when and how much.'' Robert V. DiClemente, an economist at Salomon Smith Barney, said the Fed was trying to walk a line between recognizing the reality of the strengthening economy without undercutting the recovery by instilling a fear of higher interest rates in the bond market. Today's statement, he said, ''can be interpreted as part of the first steps toward eventual rate hikes without any intention of becoming restrictive.'' Stocks dipped in the moments after the announcement at 2:15 p.m., then recovered somewhat and ended the day generally higher. The Dow Jones industrial average closed at 10,635.25, up 57.50. The Nasdaq composite index rose 3.81, to 1,880.87. Bond prices rose. In the futures markets, where investors gamble on the course of interest rates, the betting today was that the Fed could begin raising rates as soon as its next meeting, in May, and was likely to do so by its subsequent meeting, at the end of June. The Fed's 11 rate cuts last year pushed the benchmark federal funds target rate on overnight loans among banks down to 1.75 percent, a 40-year low, from 6.5 percent. Rates on many business and consumer loans fell as a result, encouraging more borrowing to support a wide range of economic activity, from auto sales and home remodeling to investments in factory equipment. With consumer sales remaining strong and businesses beginning to restock inventories after paring back during last year's downturn, economists expect the economy to expand at an annual rate of as much as 5 percent in the first quarter. But Fed officials, including Mr. Greenspan, have said the recovery may ultimately be more anemic than after most past recessions, in part because companies remain reluctant to invest heavily in new equipment, the type of activity that was essential to the 1990's boom. In its assessment of the economy, the Fed stressed a ''marked swing in inventory adjustment,'' a reference to evidence that businesses are stocking up on supplies and raw materials in anticipation of an upturn in demand for their goods. But the Fed obliquely reiterated the concern of some of its members that inventory rebuilding would be a temporary phenomenon and that economic growth could dip later this year if other economic forces do not take up the slack. The statement said that ''the degree of the strengthening in final demand over coming quarters, an essential element in sustained economic expansion, is still uncertain.'' The Fed's decision to begin releasing roll call votes on interest rate changes was a surprise. Under pressure from Congress, Mr. Greenspan has gradually, but steadily, opened the Fed's deliberations and operations to greater scrutiny and communicated its decisions more rapidly. But there are still strict limits on what the Fed makes public. Although it releases minutes of its deliberations two days after the subsequent meeting, providing an outline of the discussion, it withholds verbatim transcripts of its interest rate meetings for five years or more.""]","[""washington, march 19 -- the federal reserve signaled to investors, businesses and consumers today that they should prepare for higher interest rates this year if the economy continues its speedy recovery. at a meeting of the policy-setting federal open market committee, the central bank voted to hold rates steady, as it did at its meeting in january. but the fed laid the groundwork to begin reversing some of the 11 rate cuts it carried out last year as the economy sank into recession. the central bank also took a step to respond to criticism that its deliberations remain too shrouded in secrecy. it said that from now on it would immediately disclose how individual members voted on interest rate decisions. the fed now waits to disclose the votes of individual members until after the subsequent meeting, when it releases minutes of its deliberations. at today's meeting, the fed said, all 10 members of the open-market committee supported the decision to leave rates unchanged. in a statement, the committee said it was standing down from what amounted to a heightened state of alert for further economic weakness, reflecting the view of alan greenspan, the fed chairman, that a recovery is well under way and that further rate cuts are unlikely. the fed said it now viewed the risks to the economy as evenly balanced between sustained weakness and growth so strong that it could ignite inflation. in shifting to a neutral stance, the fed did not commit itself to raising rates, and it cited continued uncertainty about whether initial signs of a robust comeback will be sustained throughout the year. but it noted evidence that the economy was bouncing back very strongly, suggesting that it would soon have to revisit what it called its ''accommodative'' level of interest rates. recent data indicate that the economy ''is expanding at a significant pace,'' the statement said. but it added that it was ''still uncertain'' whether the expansion could be continued for long enough to assure that the economy does not stall.

It was the last sustained rise, not the last one over all. (There was a rise of 1.75 percentage point from June 1999 to May 2000.) CORRECTED 5/7/04.   WASHINGTON, May 4 -- The Federal Reserve kept short-term interest rates at 1 percent on Tuesday but gave its clearest hint yet that it is preparing a retreat from its policy of cheap money.   In what appeared to be an effort to prepare markets for higher rates as early as this summer, the Federal Open Market Committee, which sets monetary policy, said in a statement that it ''believes that policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that is likely to be measured.''   The statement was a retreat from the Fed's previous stance, when policy makers said they could afford to be ''patient'' before increasing rates. The Fed also declared that the risks to price stability ''have moved into balance.''   The statement reinforced expectations among investors that the Fed would start to push borrowing costs higher before the November presidential election. If and when it raises rates, it would be the first time in four years and could lead to the first series of increases since 1994.   Traditionally, the Fed has been reluctant to increase interest rates in the middle of a presidential campaign. But Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, has in the past made it clear he would be willing to do so.   Tom Schlesinger, executive director of the Financial Markets Center, a nonprofit research group in Philomont, Va., said, ''The Fed feels confident that it has the autonomy and the built-up political capital to do what it thinks is right.''   But the Fed also emphasized on Tuesday that it felt no need to act abruptly, and suggested that it might move more cautiously than it did 10 years ago, when the economic cycle was at a somewhat similar stage. It indicated that it thinks inflation is not yet a threat, brushing aside an unexpectedly big rise in consumer prices in March.   ''Although incoming inflation data have moved somewhat higher, long-term expectations appear to have remained well contained,'' the rate panel said in the statement.   Investors appeared initially confused by the mixed signals, with stock and bond prices gyrating after the statement was released. Reactions by the end of the day were muted, in part because many investors had been betting on higher interest rates sooner rather than later. Stocks ended modestly higher, and the yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which is related to mortgage rates, had already climbed to around 4.5 percent from 3.7 percent in mid-March. It ended the day at 4.56 percent.   With recent signs that economic growth is strengthening and that inflation may be on the upswing, the Fed is at what policy makers call an ''inflection point'' -- the moment when its priority shifts from pumping up a weak economy to keeping it from overheating.   Mr. Greenspan cautioned last month that the central bank would have to push up interest rates ''at some point,'' and the debate among analysts has been whether officials would act this summer or wait until early next year.   Robert V. DiClemente, a senior economist at Citigroup who has contended that the Fed would not act until next year, said on Tuesday that he had changed his view.   ''I think they will move this summer,'' Mr. DiClemente said. ''But I don't think this will be an uninterrupted series of rate increases.''   Laurence E. Meyer, a former Fed governor who is now a senior adviser at Macroeconomic Advisers, a forecasting company, said debate within the Fed appeared to have shifted to the pace and extent of future rate increases.   ''It's almost a foregone conclusion -- they will go ahead sooner rather than later,'' Mr. Meyer said. ''But the second message is, 'relax, the pace is going to be gradual.'''   For much of the last year, Mr. Greenspan and other top officials have made it clear that they wanted to keep interest rates low until they saw signs of a sustained increase in job creation and concrete evidence of rising inflation.   After losing nearly three million jobs from early of 2001 through the end of 2003, the nation added 308,000 jobs in March. Though the surprisingly positive employment report was not enough to persuade Fed officials that the job market had begun to recover, it corroborated evidence of rapid growth in factory production and buoyant expectations of business executives.   Indeed, hours before the Fed announced its decision Tuesday, the Commerce Department reported that factory orders increased 4.3 percent in March, the fastest pace in two years.   Last month, the Labor Department said that consumer prices increased at an unexpectedly rapid rate of 0.5 percent in March, and that report was corroborated by a separate estimate of inflation in the government's most recent estimate of economic growth.   But Mr. Greenspan and other officials have made it clear in recent weeks that they did not believe inflation is a threat. In testimony before the Joint Economic Committee of Congress two weeks ago, Mr. Greenspan said that productivity continued to climb rapidly and that inflation could remain subdued even if companies felt compelled to raise wages as they hired more workers.   Mr. Greenspan has assiduously sought to prepare investors for a return to higher rates, making a series of minute changes in the wording of Fed statements to signal that a change in policy was gradually drawing near.   In January, the Fed dropped its open-ended pledge to keep rates low for ''a considerable period'' and said it would merely be ''patient'' before deciding to change policy.   Last month, Mr. Greenspan told Congress that the Fed was no longer worried about deflation and conspicuously refrained from using the word ''patient.'' In announcing on Tuesday that the Fed would move in a ''measured'' pace to higher rates, it took the process one step further.   The big question now is how far the Fed will go when it finally does begin to raise rates.   ''They talked about the pace of the journey, but they didn't talk about the destination,'' said Paul McCulley, portfolio manager at Pimco Advisers, one of the nation's largest bond management firms. ''We don't know where they are going to stop, and that is why the market is still fairly antsy.''

61,2004-05-04,"['In many ways, it is not the most logical or convenient time for the Fed to be raising interest rates. After all, there are more than 500,000 fewer private-sector jobs today than there were at the recession\'s end in November 2001. And an army of young people is floating in school or at home with mom and dad -- many of them discouraged and no longer reflected in the official labor-force totals -- waiting for a better job market. The headlines are filled with stories about outsourcing of jobs to Asia, while others reflect fears that interest-rate hikes could undermine the housing market. To top it off, a heated presidential race is under way and, well, it\'s largely about the economy. Don\'t worry. The Fed\'s not going to hike rates unless the economy is poised for sustained above-trend growth. Moreover, inflation is not going to force its hand. After all, the policy-making Federal Open Market Committee yesterday characterized the risks to price stability as balanced, and found inflation expectations to be benign. Although some analysts and investors hit the panic button when the March CPI spiked -- and when that same report rippled through the GDP deflators -- the Fed would have none of it. In contrast, Fed policy makers expressed relief that inflation may be stabilizing, easing their earlier worries about deflation risks. They also noted that the economy is far from fully employed. But the economy will surpass expectations, just as it has in the past year. Investors have caught the scent and so has the Fed. If Fed officials seem less ""patient"" after yesterday, it\'s not because growth thus far provides a compelling case for tightening. Rather, it\'s because they recognize the economy\'s impressive momentum. For sure, the hiring pace is nothing to write home about yet, but the trend-like 171,000 monthly payroll gains in the first quarter are beginning to look like a transition to a stronger job market. If both investors and the Fed appear to be increasingly open to the prospect of monetary-policy tightening, it is because the U.S. economy persistently outperformed consensus forecasts over the past year, producing faster than expected growth and slower than expected inflation. Even following the recent round of upward revisions to 2004 forecasts, it is likely that these same errors are being repeated. As a result, further upward adjustments to consensus growth forecasts are in store, while remaining doubts about the expansion\'s durability will fade. As new data confirm the economy\'s strength, the Federal Reserve\'s prospective path for withdrawing its monetary stimulus will appear to be both more straightforward, and less threatening. Already, investors have discarded earlier concerns that upcoming U.S. elections would discourage the Fed from implementing appropriate policy adjustments. Current uncertainties about whether the Fed should follow a gradual or aggressive tightening path also will tend to fade, as improving growth prospects will make the prospective policy moves implicit in current forward prices seem to be somewhat cautious. Although the U.S. economy has been growing for the past two and a half years -- and since mid-2003 at an annual pace of more than 5% -- doubts had lingered about the expansion\'s speed and durability. For example, consensus estimates currently anticipate GDP growth in this year\'s second half at an annual pace of 4%, slowing to 3.5% annual pace by next year\'s second half. As most Fed officials consider a 4% growth pace to be sustainable in current circumstances, it hasn\'t been clear why the Fed would be expected to hike rates if growth was expected to slow soon to a below-trend pace. Recognition is growing that sluggish employment growth mainly has reflected outsized productivity gains. The unstated implication is that the economy\'s growth potential has been higher than understood previously, as few observers would claim that the labor force is fully employed already. Despite analysts\' doubts, however, advance signs of persistently strong growth have been accumulating. The powerful combination of solid gains in household demand, record profits and unprecedented corporate liquidity represent the classic building blocks of business expansion. All have been present to a striking degree for at least the past few quarters. In fact, investors implicitly anticipate a sharp shift in the outlook. In particular, current prices are consistent with a 25 basis point hike in the funds rate target at the FOMC\'s Aug. 10 meeting. Moreover, the structure of rates today points to a series of Fed rate hikes that would put the funds rate -- currently 1% -- at about 3.5% by the end of next year. Nonetheless, consensus forecasts still are likely to underestimate growth prospects, as the widely cited potential roadblocks to sustained rapid growth are far from convincing. Undoubtedly, expectations will key off job gains. This stands to reason: Accelerating employment growth will represent a more powerful influence on household spending than either the absence of new tax measures or the end of mortgage refinancing. If job gains accelerate to a monthly average pace of 200,000 or more in the coming quarters -- as seems highly plausible -- it is reasonable to expect that 2004 growth forecasts will be raised to more than 5%, while 2005 growth forecasts will rise into a 4% to 5% range. With growth firmly above trend, the case for monetary policy tightening will be compelling, even in the absence of heightened inflation pressures. A series of Fed rate hikes beginning in August would seem appropriate, with the Funds rate hitting around 4% by the end of next year. The implications for long-term interest rates of stronger growth are less certain. Investors already anticipate an eventual return of consumer price inflation to at least a 2.5% annual rate. However, it is likely that inflation will continue to fall short of consensus worries. It is difficult to envision a significant acceleration in inflation with unit labor costs stable or falling. The moderate recent rise in the Employment Cost Index, and the wide gap between current job totals and the pre-2001 employment peak, suggests that unit costs are not likely to accelerate quickly. The Fed may be tightening as the Democrats and Republicans gather for their national conventions in Boston and New York late this summer.

62,2004-05-04,"['NEW YORK -- Long-dated Treasurys plummeted on fears that the Federal Reserve isn\'t acting aggressively enough to avert a rise in inflation. But two-year notes, which often weaken quickly amid concerns about Fed policy tightening, scarcely moved, reassured by the Fed\'s apparent pledge to move only gradually in raising interest rates. ""The market doesn\'t agree with the Fed\'s assessment"" on inflation, said Gerald Lucas, head of U.S. Treasury and agency strategy at Banc of America Securities. After concluding its meeting yesterday, the Fed\'s policy setting Federal Open Market Committee said in a statement that ""at this juncture, with inflation low and resource use slack, the committee believes that policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that is likely to be measured."" That was ""a very, very benign statement,"" said Bill Quan, economist at Mizuho Securities in Hoboken, N.J. Treasurys initially rallied after release of the Fed statement, largely on relief that the wording, at first glance, didn\'t appear to suggest a rate boost was imminent. Yet, as the market digested the Fed\'s stance, it began to question that conviction also. At 4 p.m., the benchmark 10-year note was down 12/32 point, or $3.75 per $1,000 face value, at 95 22/32. Its yield rose to 4.551% from 4.502% Monday, as yields move inversely to prices. The 30-year bond\'s price was down 25/32 point at 100 17/32 to yield 5.337%, up from 5.282% Monday. For holders of longer-dated issues, or those beyond a maturity of five years, inflation is the primary enemy as rising prices erode the value of investing in a fixed sum for a long period of time. Two-year notes were unchanged to yield 2.319%. In other markets, mortgage-backed securities weakened across the board, with Fannie Mae\'s 30-year, 5% issue off 6/32 at 96 19/32. Interest-rate swaps spreads widened to levels not seen since early September, reflecting the selloff in long-dated Treasurys. Analysts noted that the Fed could still raise its federal-funds target rate -- which it left unchanged yesterday at 1% -- at its next meeting, in late June, if data continue to point to robust growth and accelerating inflation. But looking at the Fed\'s statement, policy makers don\'t seem to think that will occur, said Dominic Konstam, head of interest-rate strategy at Credit Suisse First Boston. ""The Fed is slowly moving to unravel their dovish sentiments of recent statements,"" Mr. Konstam said.   Corporate and Junk Bonds Stock floor-trading ""specialist"" firm LaBranche &Co. sold $460 million of senior Rule 144a notes via Credit Suisse First Boston: $200 million of five-year notes, noncallable for three years, priced to yield 9 1/2%, and $260 million of eight-year notes, noncallable for four years, priced to yield 11%. The issue was rated single-B by Standard &Poor\'s. Moody\'s Investors Service has a Ba1 rating on LaBranche\'s senior unsecured debt. The yields are exceptionally high for single-B-rated bonds, and in fact were a quarter percentage point higher than expected. That was enough to attract blue-chip high-yield money managers, who comprised a majority of the issue, said a person familiar with the allocations. The sale was seen as crucial for the company. In March, LaBranche warned it probably wouldn\'t be able to repay $100 million of senior notes due in August without a refinancing or asset sale. Meanwhile, BMW Motor Credit\'s $1.5 billion auto securitization was priced at what were said to be the tightest overall interest rate spreads ever for a prime auto issue, according to bankers at joint lead manager J.P.

""the market doesn't agree with the fed's assessment"" on inflation, said gerald lucas, head of u.s. treasury and agency strategy at banc of america securities. after concluding its meeting yesterday, the fed's policy setting federal open market committee said in a statement that ""at this juncture, with inflation low and resource use slack, the committee believes that policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that is likely to be measured."" that was ""a very, very benign statement,"" said bill quan, economist at mizuho securities in hoboken, n.j. treasurys initially rallied after release of the fed statement, largely on relief that the wording, at first glance, didn't appear to suggest a rate boost was imminent. yet, as the market digested the fed's stance, it began to question that conviction also. at 4 p.m., the benchmark 10-year note was down 12/32 point, or $3.75 per $1,000 face value, at 95 22/32. its yield rose to 4.551% from 4.502% monday, as yields move inversely to prices. the 30-year bond's price was down 25/32 point at 100 17/32 to yield 5.337%, up from 5.282% monday. for holders of longer-dated issues, or those beyond a maturity of five years, inflation is the primary enemy as rising prices erode the value of investing in a fixed sum for a long period of time. two-year notes were unchanged to yield 2.319%. in other markets, mortgage-backed securities weakened across the board, with fannie mae's 30-year, 5% issue off 6/32 at 96 19/32. interest-rate swaps spreads widened to levels not seen since early september, reflecting the selloff in long-dated treasurys. analysts noted that the fed could still raise its federal-funds target rate -- which it left unchanged yesterday at 1% -- at its next meeting, in late june, if data continue to point to robust growth and accelerating inflation. but looking at the fed's statement, policy makers don't seem to think that will occur, said dominic konstam, head of interest-rate strategy at credit suisse first boston. ""the fed is slowly moving to unravel their dovish sentiments of recent statements,"" mr. konstam said.   corporate and junk bonds stock floor-trading ""specialist"" firm labranche &co. sold $460 million of senior rule 144a notes via credit suisse first boston: $200 million of five-year notes, noncallable for three years, priced to yield 9 1/2%, and $260 million of eight-year notes, noncallable for four years, priced to yield 11%. the issue was rated single-b by standard &poor's. moody's investors service has a ba1 rating on labranche's senior unsecured debt. the yields are exceptionally high for single-b-rated bonds, and in fact were a quarter percentage point higher than expected. that was enough to attract blue-chip high-yield money managers, who comprised a majority of the issue, said a person familiar with the allocations. the sale was seen as crucial for the company. in march, labranche warned it probably wouldn't be able to repay $100 million of senior notes due in august without a refinancing or asset sale. meanwhile, bmw motor credit's $1.5 billion auto securitization was priced at what were said to be the tightest overall interest rate spreads ever for a prime auto issue, according to bankers at joint lead manager j.p. morgan securities. --- simona covel and david feldheim contributed to this article.  license this article from dow jones reprint service']",30.0,,,,,,,,,1

64,2005-08-09,"['WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve raised short-term interest rates for the tenth-consecutive time, lifting its short-term rate target to 3.5% from 3.25%, and signaling more increases to come. Analysts and markets are raising their estimates of how much further the Fed will go, because the economy is strengthening, inflation a bit less favorable and long-term interest rates remain unusually low. ""Aggregate spending, despite high energy prices, appears to have strengthened since late winter, and labor market conditions continue to improve gradually,"" the Fed said in a statement accompanying its decision, affirming that the spring soft patch is over. Inflation, excluding food and energy prices, ""has been relatively low in recent months and longer-term inflation expectations remain well contained, but pressures on inflation have stayed elevated."" The Fed repeated its view that rates would likely continue to rise at a ""measured"" pace, which has come to mean no more than a quarter-point per meeting. The 12 voting members of the 19-member Federal Open Market Committee, which sets interest-rate policy, agreed unanimously on the increase in their target for the federal-funds rate, which is charged on overnight loans between banks. The Fed also raised its less-important discount rate, charged on central-bank advances to commercial banks, to 4.5% from 4.25%. Wells Fargo Bank and other commercial lenders raised their prime rates, the benchmark for many consumer and business loans, to 6.5% from 6.25%. The Fed has raised the funds rate a quarter-point at every policy meeting since June of last year, when it stood at a 46-year low of 1%. In the last six weeks, futures markets have raised the expected year-end funds rate to between 4% and 4.25% from below 3.75%. Economists have followed suit. Bill Dudley, chief U.S. economist at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., recently revised upward his forecast for the funds rate next spring to 5% from 4.5%. ""The growth outlook has improved, and the labor market is tighter,"" said Mr. Dudley. For the last year, Fed officials have characterized their actions as raising rates from a level that was still stimulating spending to a ""neutral"" level that neither stimulates nor restrains growth. The Fed has no specific interest rate in mind for neutral, but assumes it will have arrived when the economy is using all readily available labor and capital without straining capacity. But some economists see a risk that economic growth could soon outstrip capacity, putting upward pressure on prices and wages. ""The question the Fed should start to ask is whether neutral is the appropriate end point,"" said Bruce Kasman, head of economic research at J.P. Morgan Chase &Co. ""An economy that continues to grow 3.5% to 4% will require not just neutral, but restrictive policy."" There aren\'t any signs of strain yet. The Labor Department said yesterday that productivity -- that is, output per hour -- of workers outside farms and government rose at a 2.2% annual rate in the second quarter, down from 3.2% in the first, but still in line with the brisk performance of the past decade. Productivity growth enables firms to expand sales with the same amount of labor, containing costs. Growth in labor costs adjusted for productivity also slowed to 1.3% in the second quarter, the lowest in a year, from 3.6%. A narrower measure of productivity, which includes only incorporated, nonfinancial businesses and is watched closely by Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan, is more encouraging. That measure rose a sharp 5.4% in the year through March. (Second-quarter figures aren\'t available yet.) Labor costs also grew much more slowly by this measure. By either measure, productivity growth is strong, said Martin Baily, a scholar at the Institute for International Economics, a Washington think tank. ""This is good news in terms of keeping . . . inflation down,"" and should comfort the Fed, he said. On the negative side, annual productivity growth was revised down to an average of 3.7% from 2002 to 2004, from 4.2%, and labor-cost growth has been revised up to 0.3% from negative 0.2%. The Commerce Department already had revised up inflation this year, according to the Fed\'s preferred price index, to 2% from about 1.6%, which some analysts said would encourage tighter monetary policy. However, the revisions were primarily technical and didn\'t unsettle Fed officials, as their reference in yesterday\'s statement to ""relatively low"" inflation suggested. Ironically, the more markets price in additional Fed tightening, the less likely such tightening becomes. That\'s because as markets price in more Fed increases, long-term bond yields have risen, to 4.4% now from 4% in late June. If they rise enough, that could cool the economy, especially housing prices, without more action by the Fed. For now, Fed officials feel their actions haven\'t tightened overall credit conditions much, and thus plan to keep raising short-term rates. --- Online Today: WSJ.com subscribers can see how the Federal Reserve\'s statement compares with the one in June, and read the full text of the Fed\'s statement, at WSJ.com/OnlineToday.

65,1990-08-21,"['NEW YORK -- Bond prices gyrated in nervous trading, reacting to changes in interest rates and news reports out of the Middle East. The Treasury\'s benchmark 30-year bond fell nearly 3/4 point in early trading, but rebounded during midday to end slightly lower. The yield on the bond ended at 8.94%, slightly higher than Monday\'s 8.93% closing yield. Mortgage and tax-exempt municipals underperformed the Treasury market and posted modest losses. But junk bonds posted moderate to sharp declines, taking their cues from the troubled stock market. Most top-tier junk bonds posted declines of 1/2 to 3/4 point, while prices of many middle-tier and lower-tier bonds sank one to two points. The bond market opened lower on rumors, later denied, that a U.S. warplane had been shot down over the Persian Gulf. The prospect of war between the U.S. and Iraq alarmed investors because it raised the chances that oil prices would rise further, which in turn, would put more upward pressure on inflation. But as the yield on the benchmark 30-year bond exceeded the psychologically important 9% level, the market began to bounce back. ""The market was getting ahead of itself on the sell side,"" said Steve Ricchuito, economist at Barclays De Zoete Wedd Securities Inc. ""When the yield went above the 9% level, the market started to attract interest from investors,"" he said. Bonds continued to rebound when Iraqi President Saddam Hussein hinted that he may be willing to reconcile differences with the U.S. ""We had some indications that the Iraqi annexation of Kuwait might be negotiable,"" said Lincoln Anderson, economist at Bear, Stearns & Co. ""That contributed to the bond market rally."" Oil prices, which lead bond prices in the inverse direction, fell after Mr. Hussein\'s remarks, giving the fixed-income market an added boost. A decline in the closely watched federal funds rate also sparked some modest buying in the Treasury market. The decline in the rate banks charge each other for overnight loans occurred shortly after the Federal Reserve executed $2 billion in customer repurchase agreements. The rate fell from 8% to as low as 7 3/4%. The intervention came as a surprise to the market. Although many economists said the Fed action was probably technical in nature and designed to offset reserve shortages in the banking system, ""many people think there may be a Fed ease afoot,"" said an economist at Shearson Lehman Government Securities Inc. One reason investors may have been suspicious is that members of the Fed\'s policy-making Federal Open Market Committee met yesterday to discuss monetary policy and consider whether the time is right to lower short-term rates. Adding speed to the upward swing in bond prices was buying on the part of speculators who had taken short positions by selling borrowed securities in hopes of buying them back at a lower price and pocketing the difference. When the market rose instead, these investors scrambled to unwind their short positions. Dealers said trading dried up in the afternoon, with government securities drifting at slightly lower levels. Treasury Securities The benchmark 30-year bond ended slightly lower at 97 30/32, compared with 97 31/32 Monday. Short-term securities also posted small declines. The latest two-year notes ended at 99 21/32, down from 99 23/32 on Monday. The yield on the two-year notes rose to 8.17% from 8.14%. Treasury bill rates were slightly higher when compared with Monday\'s average auction rates. The discount rate on three-month Treasury bills was 7.58% yesterday for a bond-equivalent yield of 7.82%, while the rate on six-month bills ended at 7.48% for a bond-equivalent yield of 7.86%. Corporate Issues The junk bond market mirrored the stock market, falling sharply as equity prices plunged. Top-quality high-yield names ended 1/2 to 3/4 point lower, while middle-tier and lower-tier junk bond issues were battered even more and tumbled more than one point. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average plummeted 52.48 points to end at 2603.96. Among the issues that were hard hit yesterday: RJR Nabisco\'s 17 3/8% convertible pay-in-kind debentures, which ended down 2 3/8 points at 108 1/2 after falling as low as 108 on the New York Stock Exchange. RJR\'s 17% exchangeable pay-in-kind debentures closed down 2 1/2 points at 84 3/4 after sinking as low as 82 5/8. Because equity arbitrage accounts are heavy investors in RJR\'s pay-in-kind bonds, the securities tend to plunge whenever the stock market tumbles, and they surge when equity prices soar. Recession-prone junk bonds continued to take a beating yesterday. American Standard\'s 12.875% senior subordinated debentures, maturing in 2000, skidded 1 3/4 points to 88 1/4 after losing three points Monday. In a recent report, Citicorp Securities Markets Inc. said the company would be negatively affected by higher interest rates and surging energy costs because it relies heavily on energy in making plumbing ceramics. Junk bonds of another building materials manufacturer, USG, also sank. The company\'s 13.25% senior subordinated debentures closed at 51, down two points. Meanwhile, junk bonds of AmBase plummeted after Moody\'s Investors Service Inc. said it has changed the direction of its review of the company\'s debt ratings to possible downgrade from uncertain. Ambase\'s 14.875% senior subordinated notes lost 8 3/8 points to close at 71 1/8 on the New York Stock Exchange after plunging nearly 15 points in active trading last week. Foreign Bonds Yields on some West German government bonds exceeded 9% as international investors continued to dump their holdings. Among new issues, West Germany issued 10-year bonds yesterday for its postal agency that had a coupon rate of 9%. That was the highest coupon seen on government or government agency debt in eight years. Although domestic investors were big buyers of the postal bonds, statistics compiled by the nation\'s central bank show that foreign investors have been selling large amounts of West German bonds this year. The Bundesbank said international investors sold a net 8.4 billion marks ($5.37 billion) in the first six months of 1990, a sharp reversal from the 22.5 billion marks of bonds they bought in 1989. The selling was sparked by fears stemming from monetary union between East and West Germany. It comes just as West Germany\'s borrowing needs are expected to soar because of East German-related expenses. Private economists see net public sector borrowing around 80 billion marks this year and 120 billion marks in 1991, significantly above pre-monetary union forecasts of 40 billion marks for this year. The last time foreigners were net sellers of West German bonds was nine years ago, when they sold a comparatively paltry 1.45 billion marks of bonds. In trading, West German bonds ended modestly lower. The benchmark 8 3/4% bond due in 2000 fell 0.17 point to 98.60 to yield 8.96%. The 8 1/2% bond due in 2000 fell 0.07 point at 96.70 to yield 9.01%. Municipals Municipal bonds ended as much as 3/4 point lower. A rise in Treasury market yields above 9% and oil price declines pushed tax-exempt issues into a tailspin, traders said. While Treasurys later recovered, municipals were unable to reverse the downward trend. The New Jersey Turnpike Authority\'s 7.20% issue of 2018 was 3/8 point lower at 97 5/8 bid to yield 7.37%. ""We\'re just catching up to governments,"" one trader said. ""We weren\'t trading off as much as Treasurys had been, and we just had some people selling because they thought the market was going to go weaker"" because of the Persian Gulf crisis, he added. Mortgage-Backed Securities The mortgage securities market posted losses after staging a considerable rebound from the most depressed levels of the day in sympathy with the gyrations of the Treasury market. After being down as much as 5/8 point, 9 1/2% pass-through securities for September delivery issued by all three agencies were down 7/32. The volatility has kept many inactive, market players say. Meanwhile, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. is offering $501 million of floating-rate and inverse floating-rate funding note pass-through certificates through Lehman Brothers. The issue is the agency\'s third funding note certificate offering. But it is the first time that a transaction in the secondary mortgage market has been structured with recombinable inverse floater classes. Also, $218 million of home-equity loan pass-through certificates, priced to yield 9.26%, are being offered through Shawmut National Remic Trust 1990-A by Morgan Stanley & Co. Shawmut Bank is the seller of the underlying home equity loans, and Connecticut National Bank is the servicer. Both banks are units of Shawmut National, based in Hartford, Conn.']","['new york -- bond prices gyrated in nervous trading, reacting to changes in interest rates and news reports out of the middle east. the treasury's benchmark 30-year bond fell nearly 3/4 point in early trading, but rebounded during midday to end slightly lower. the yield on the bond ended at 8.94%, slightly higher than monday's 8.93% closing yield. mortgage and tax-exempt municipals underperformed the treasury market and posted modest losses. but junk bonds posted moderate to sharp declines, taking their cues from the troubled stock market. most top-tier junk bonds posted declines of 1/2 to 3/4 point, while prices of many middle-tier and lower-tier bonds sank one to two points. the bond market opened lower on rumors, later denied, that a u.s. warplane had been shot down over the persian gulf. the prospect of war between the u.s. and iraq alarmed investors because it raised the chances that oil prices would rise further, which in turn, would put more upward pressure on inflation. but as the yield on the benchmark 30-year bond exceeded the psychologically important 9% level, the market began to bounce back.

66,1990-08-21,"['The Federal Reserve System almost always finds itself in some sort of box. Some people will want the central bank to ease money while others will urge it to tighten up. Usually, the Fed finds a way to work itself out of such trouble. This time, however, it may have waited too long. Until March, things seemed to be going fairly well. The economy had slowed, but recession forecasts were few. The Shadow Open Market Committee, a group of academic and business economists often critical of the Fed, said at its semiannual meeting, ""Monetary policy remains consistent with moderate recovery and declining inflation."" That\'s about as nice a comment as it ever makes about the Fed. But things soon began to change, and not really for the better. Nearly everyone realized that the 8.2% spurt of the consumer price index in the first quarter, on an annual-rate basis, was a temporary phenomenon, produced by cold-weather increases in food and energy costs. These factors faded in the second quarter, but new price difficulties arose. Labor costs, which had been unusually quiet through the long business expansion, were climbing. Even before the Mideast crisis sent oil prices soaring, analysts were predicting rising inflation the rest of this year. So far, that looks like a good forecast. As the real Federal Open Market Committee met yesterday, it had to ponder that consumer prices rose at an annual rate of close to 5% in July -- when energy prices were falling. That compared with a 3.8% rise for the full second quarter. Ordinarily, the Fed\'s next move would seem automatic. Inflationary pressures are growing, so the inflation-hating Fed tightens up, right? Not necessarily. Administration officials for weeks have been reminding the Federal Reserve that it has some responsibility for the health of the economy. The rise in the inflation-adjusted gross national product slowed to an annual rate of 1.2%, and the Mideast oil shock has increased talk of recession. Treasury Secretary Brady and other officials argue that the Fed should cut the federal funds rate, the fee charged on short-term loans of bank reserves. The Fed had been expected to reward the administration and Congress for a budget-deficit cut by reducing the funds rate. But the deficit cut, never anything like a sure thing, now seems even more unlikely in the wake of the Mideast military buildup. So the funds rate has been allowed to edge downward by only a quarter-point in the face of the weakening economy. It was a difficult exercise, not without its ridiculous aspects. The Federal Reserve uses the funds rate to signal its monetary policy. The funds rate does have some influence on other short-term rates, but its influence on long rates is limited. But as the economy has weakened in recent weeks, short-term rates have tended to decline. To keep the funds rate from declining more than the Fed wanted, the central bank has had to pull reserves out of the banking system. Got that? The Fed has not only been resisting pressures to ease by reducing the funds rate, but it has moved in the opposite direction by tightening bank reserves. That leads to the Federal Reserve\'s current unhappy situation. The central bank can\'t move against the increased inflationary pressures without, in all probability, triggering a recession. If the Fed, instead, moves significantly to spur the sagging economy, the bond market and analysts generally will assume the Federal Reserve has caved in to administration pressure and inflation will take off. Is there anything the Fed could have done to avert this debacle? It could have paid more attention to bank reserves. Reserves have been flat-to-declining all this year. Talk about credit crunches; without reserves, banks don\'t make loans. The Fed should have permitted reserves to grow steadily at a modest rate, accepting cheerfully any federal funds rate declines that went along with such a policy. What should the Fed do now? If it chooses to ease, the inflationary pressures increase. If it chooses to tighten, the recessionary pressures increase. Easing, of course, offers no guarantee of avoiding recession. It may merely ensure that inflation will rise so high that everyone will find it intolerable. The result could be a deep recession like 1981-82. Similarly, tightening is not a perfect solution. The Federal Reserve presumably would prefer to move gradually, with the result that the recession\'s anti-inflation benefits will be delayed. In 1981 gradualism was urged on Paul Volcker, then chairman of the Fed, as a cure for double-digit inflation. Mr. Volcker decided gradualism wouldn\'t work and moved quickly. History could repeat itself. The best bet is that the Fed will mark time, hoping for some development in the domestic economy that will make the appropriate action more readily visible. Monetary policy in the next few weeks is likely to be shaped by events, not by new Fed policy. There are times when nothing is the best thing a government agency can do. There\'s no telling what those events might be. Real war in the Mideast might make the recession worries disappear in an inflationary blur. Congress might return from vacation, notice that the Fed hadn\'t moved, and take a small step toward budget control, even in the midst of the Mideast situation. One thing is certain. As a Federal Reserve economist said privately last week, ""We should keep a closer watch on bank reserves."" It would have been nice if that thought had occurred to someone three or four months ago.']","['the federal reserve system almost always finds itself in some sort of box. some people will want the central bank to ease money while others will urge it to tighten up. usually, the fed finds a way to work itself out of such trouble. this time, however, it may have waited too long. until march, things seemed to be going fairly well. the economy had slowed, but recession forecasts were few. the shadow open market committee, a group of academic and business economists often critical of the fed, said at its semiannual meeting, ""monetary policy remains consistent with moderate recovery and declining inflation."" that's about as nice a comment as it ever makes about the fed. but things soon began to change, and not really for the better. nearly everyone realized that the 8.2% spurt of the consumer price index in the first quarter, on an annual-rate basis, was a temporary phenomenon, produced by cold-weather increases in food and energy costs. these factors faded in the second quarter, but new price difficulties arose. labor costs, which had been unusually quiet through the long business expansion, were climbing. even before the mideast crisis sent oil prices soaring, analysts were predicting rising inflation the rest of this year. so far, that looks like a good forecast. as the real federal open market committee met yesterday, it had to ponder that consumer prices rose at an annual rate of close to 5% in july -- when energy prices were falling. that compared with a 3.8% rise for the full second quarter. ordinarily, the fed's next move would seem automatic. inflationary pressures are growing, so the inflation-hating fed tightens up, right?

68,1989-12-19,"['NEW YORK -- Concerns about bad real-estate loans continued to depress the debt of some Northeast banks, causing the securities to trade at junk-bond levels. In recent days, the bonds of Bank of Boston and Shawmut National Corp. have been hit so hard that yields have soared to double-digit ranges. The long-term senior securities of Bank of New England, which were downgraded by Moody\'s Investors Service Inc. to ""speculative"" grade on Monday, were offered yesterday at a price to yield about 16%. ""The current pricing reflects considerable uncertainty"" about the ability of the nation\'s regional banks to cope with mounting loan losses, said James McDermott, a banking analyst at Keefe Bruyette & Woods. He said selling pressure on bank debt is likely to continue until analysts comprehend the extent of the real estate problem. New England banks have been suffering from troubled real estate loans for months, but the problems are expected to spread to the mid-Atlantic region and even the Midwest and California. Shawmut National\'s 9.85% subordinated capital notes due in 1999, which traded at par as recently as last week, were quoted yesterday at a price to yield 14%. Midlantic Banks Inc. securities, which had yields of about 10% last week, now are quoted at prices to yield 11 3/4%. Although the mid-sized regional banks are being hurt the hardest, some traders said the weakness has spilled over into the high-quality banking sector as well. In the Treasury market, bond prices ended little changed. Traders said prices were virtually unchanged during the morning, before slipping at midday as it became apparent that the Federal Reserve had not decided to ease credit conditions as some investors had expected. ""There\'s disappointment that there was no movement out of the Fed,"" said Robert Chandross, a vice president at Lloyds Bank PLC. Some investors thought the central bank might wrap up its two-day Federal Open Market Committee meeting yesterday by signaling a monetary policy easing. Thus, when the Fed did not add reserves to the banking system during its normal pre-noon intervention period, bond prices came under selling pressure. But David Jones, a senior vice president and economist at Aubrey G. Lanston & Co., said such expectations were premature. However, he added, ""the Fed will be scrutinized in coming days to see if a decision to ease was made at the meeting."" Uncertainty about the timing of the Fed\'s next policy move took its toll on the Treasury\'s two-year note sale. Investor participation in the note sale was below par, as evidenced by the low 2.31-to-1 bid-to-cover ratio. The ratio, which reflects the number of bids the Treasury receives for each one it accepted, is used to measure investor demand. The average bid-to-cover ratio at the 12 previous two-year note auctions was 2.72-to-1. Another indication of weak demand was the ""tail,"" or the difference between the average yield and highest yield accepted at the auction. The highest yield was 7.73%, slightly above the average yield of 7.71%. Since there wasn\'t enough demand at the average yield, the Treasury was forced to accept some bids at higher yields to complete the auction, thus accounting for the ""tail,"" analysts said. The average yield at the two-year note auction was the lowest for such a sale since March 1988, explaining why individual inventors turned a cold shoulder to the auction. Non-competitive tenders, which come mainly from individual investors, totaled $609 million. That was the lowest noncompetitive bid at a two-year note auction in over a year. In when-issued trading, the new two-year notes traded at a price to yield 7.72%. Junk, Corporate Issues Junk bonds finished the day about 1/8 point lower while investment-grade corporate issues ended 1/8 point to 1/4 point lower. Junk bond traders said they continued to see selling pressure in selective actively traded retail issues. R.H. Macy & Co.\'s 14 1/2% senior subordinated debentures due in 1998 were being bid for at 92, off 1/2 point, while the retailer\'s 14 1/2% subordinated debentures due in 2001 dropped one point to 85 1/2. Macy bonds have been hurt since the company reported a first-quarter loss of $33.1 million last week. Highly volatile junk bonds of RJR Holdings Capital Corp. have also been battered during the market\'s recent downturn. RJR\'s 13.71% convertible pay-in-kind debentures due in 2009 slipped one point to close at 89, while RJR\'s 13.71% exchangeable pay-in-kind debentures due in 2007 slid 3/4 point to finish at 76. Treasury Securities Treasury bond prices were little changed in quiet pre-holiday trading. The benchmark 30-year bond ended at a price of 103 7/32 compared with 103 6/32 on Monday. The issue\'s yield was unchanged at 7.83%. The latest 10-year notes ended at a price of 100 20/32 to yield 7.76% compared with 100 19/32 to yield 7.77%. Short-term rates rose. The discount rate on three-month Treasury bills ended at 7.66% for a bond-equivalent yield of 7.90% compared with an average discount rate of 7.62% and yield of 7.88% at Monday\'s auction. The discount rate on six-month Treasury bills ended at 7.48% for a bond-equivalent yield of 7.86% compared with an average discount rate of 7.43% and bond yield of 7.83% at Monday\'s auction.

Ginnie Mae\'s 10% securities ended at 103 11/32, up 1/32, while Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.\'s 9% issue was unchanged at 98 4/32. Federal National Mortgage Association\'s 9% issue was quoted at 98 22/32, also unchanged. The Fannie Mae 9% issue was trading at an unusually wide premium above the Freddie Mac issue because of a scarcity of the Fannie Mae issue. Dealers noted a modest squeeze in the Fannie Mae 9% issue last week ahead of the regular December settlement. Foreign Bonds Newspaper reports that the Bank of Japan was planning to raise its discount rate at least half a percentage point to 4.25% slammed the Japanese bond market, but it recovered somewhat by the end after the central bank and Finance Ministry denied the stories. At the Tokyo Stock Exchange close, the benchmark 4.8% issue due in 1999 was trading at 95.46, down 0.65 points, for a yield of 5.64%. Elsewhere: -- In West Germany, prices reverted to their fixing levels after rising 0.10 point in early trading.

Municipal Issues The tax-exempt market was little changed in a session in which more than $561 million in new debt was priced. In one of the largest offerings of the week, a PaineWebber group tentatively priced $288 million Pennsylvania Convention Center Authority revenue bonds to yield from 6.10% in 1993 to 7% in 2005-2008. On the competitive front, a Citicorp Securities Inc. group had the winning bid for $110 million Build Illinois sales tax revenue bonds, due 1990-2010 and 2019. The issue appeared to be off to a strong sales start, with a balance of about $20 million remaining, according to the lead underwriter. The bonds were reoffered to yield from 5.90% in 1991 to 7.04% in 2019. Bonds due in 1990 were not formally reoffered. A PaineWebber group priced an issue of $88 million New York State Dormitory Authority various bonds. Preliminary pricing set yields between 5.70% for special obligation bonds due in 1990 and 6.90% for FHA-insured bonds due in 2000.']","['new york -- concerns about bad real-estate loans continued to depress the debt of some northeast banks, causing the securities to trade at junk-bond levels. in recent days, the bonds of bank of boston and shawmut national corp. have been hit so hard that yields have soared to double-digit ranges. the long-term senior securities of bank of new england, which were downgraded by moody's investors service inc. to ""speculative"" grade on monday, were offered yesterday at a price to yield about 16%.

69,1989-12-19,"[""WASHINGTON, Dec. 19 -- The Consumer Price Index rose by four-tenths of 1 percent in November, as food and shelter grew more costly while energy prices edged down, the Labor Department said today.   The Consumer Price Index rose by four-tenths of 1 percent in November, as food and shelter grew more costly while energy prices edged down, the Labor Department said today.   The increase, which was a bit more than expected, was believed to have been of some concern to those participating in an important Federal Reserve strategy meeting today.   With the economy generally seen as sluggish, the Fed has allowed interest rates to decline slightly, but an inflation signal viewed as too strong could give the Fed pause in easing further. The dominant view among economists, however, was that the rise in inflation last month was not high enough to prevent the Fed from easing credit some more in coming days or weeks. Pressure on Credit Markets   Still, the Fed, whose Open Market Committee completed two days of meetings today, did not enter the credit markets, disappointing those who had hoped for an immediate move toward lower interest rates. As a result, traders said, the markets for Government securities, particularly short-term instruments, were under pressure. [ Page D16. ] Major parts of the economy, including automotive and other manufacturing sectors, are in the doldrums, economists noted. The housing market is also in a downturn, with the Government reporting today that housing starts dropped by 4.7 percent last month. [ Page D8. ] And last Friday's Government report on prices received by producers showed small declines at both the finished goods and intermediate goods levels, indicating that down the road consumer prices should follow suit. Hints by Administration   ''Inflation remains under control,'' Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman, said today, with recent results holding ''some promise'' of lower interest rates. The Bush Administration has throughout the year been dropping hints that it would like to see the Fed become somewhat more accommodative in supplying the banking system with credit.   After the White House comment, the stock market, which had been off significantly in the first few hours of trading, bounced back on what traders said was new hope for lower interest rates. [ Page D10. ] Nevertheless, today's report on prices was at least mildly troubling, with service prices rising six-tenths of 1 percent and energy unlikely to act as a brake on prices in coming months. The late-autumn weather has been exceptionally cold in various parts of the country.   Robert G. Dederick, chief economist for the Northern Trust Company in Chicago, called today's report ''a little dose of reality for those who thought inflation was being rapidly curtailed.'' Although commodity price inflation has dwindled to a rate of only nine-tenths of 1 percent in the six months ended in November, from 7.6 percent for the six months ended in May, overall inflation in services during these periods has eased only to a 4.8 percent rate, from 5.1 percent.   Services account for about 55 percent of the consumer price gauge -they are not directly included at all in the producer price indexes - while commodities account for only 45 percent.   Mr. Dederick suggested that the Fed might be disinclined to ease credit immediately after today's report, even if the Federal Open Market Committee had decided at the nonpublic session, one of eight conducted each year, that the economy needed additional stimulus to avoid slipping into a recession.   On Wednesday the Commerce Department will make its second revision of the third quarter's gross national product number and will also revise its initial quarterly figure on corporate profits, which it published last month. Climb in Health Costs   One of the biggest inflationary forces is medical care, which is highly labor intensive. Health costs, which account for 6 percent of the price index, climbed by eight-tenths of 1 percent in November, to bring the increase over the latest 12 months to 8.5 percent. This compared with 4.7 percent for overall consumer inflation in the same period. Hospital and related services were up by 1 percent in November.   Food and beverages, constituting 18 percent of the index, rose by six-tenths of 1 percent last month - as much as September and October combined - as the meat, poultry, fish and egg component turned and dairy products climbed sharply for the third straight month. Fresh vegetables also rose sharply.   A rise of five-tenths of 1 percent in housing - 42 percent of the index -resulted mainly from steep increases in the prices of electricity and natural gas; fuel oil rose at a slower pace than in October. Transportation Rise Slows   In transportation, 17 percent of the index, inflation slowed to two-tenths of 1 percent from seven-tenths, mainly because gasoline prices dropped by 2.1 percent. New cars rose by eight-tenths of 1 percent, but analysts predicted that cars would resume their May-through-September declines because of poor recent sales.   Prices of used cars rose last month by six-tenths of 1 percent, the first increase since February, while finance and insurance costs each jumped by 1 percent.   Clothing prices were little changed last month after posting big increases in September and October, with the introduction of new fall and winter merchandise. Dry cleaning and other apparel services rose sharply. Apparel has the same price index weight as medical care, 6 percent.   Chart of consumer prices for 1989 (Source: Bureau of Labor Statistics) (pg.

70,1989-07-06,"['Tokyo stocks closed Thursday\'s session firmer in thin, directionless trading, brokers said. In a duplication of Wednesday\'s trading, shares fell in London and Frankfurt. Tokyo\'s Nikkei index was up 113.77 points to close at 33423.48. The index gained 119.33 points Wednesday. The Tokyo stock price index of all issues listed in the first section was up 11.29 at 2489.31. First section volume was estimated at 550 million shares, down from 666 million Wednesday. In early trading in Tokyo Friday, the Nikkei index rose another 113.76 points to 33537.24. External factors kept large domestic investors out of the market, brokers said on Thursday. Investors are cautious ahead of U.S. employment figures due out Friday and any change in the interest rate outlook resulting from the Federal Open Market Committee meeting in the U.S. Wednesday and Thursday, brokers said. The stronger yen in Tokyo encouraged investors, but brokers said lingering uncertainty about the direction of the currency market dampened the effect of a firmer Japanese unit. The market opened firmer on the stronger yen, and was bolstered by further index-buying by large investors setting up investment trust funds, brokers said. Brokers characterized morning trading as ""rotational"" as investors shifted attention to lagging sectors and issues. Electrical power, textiles and mining issues were among the laggards sought. These issues remained strong into the afternoon. Buying of large-capitalization stocks such as steels and shipbuilding pushed these issues higher in the morning, but they were sold off in the afternoon, brokers said. Nippon Steel was up 9 yen at 819 yen ($5.91), Kawasaki Steel was down 4 at 903, and NKK was flat at 811. Electrical power issues made strong gains. Tokyo Electric Power was up 270 to 5,890, Chubu Electric was up 90 to 4,090, and Kansai Electric was up 170 to 2,540. London prices sagged in the afternoon to end the session slightly lower, pulled down mainly by the negative influence of Wall Street in a thinly traded market. The Financial Times 100-share index closed 1.7 points lower at 2161.2. The 30-share index was down 3.3 points at 1794.7. Volume totaled a respectable 565.3 million shares, but this figure was inflated by a large morning trade of narrowly capitalized third-line stocks. By comparison, turnover Wednesday amounted to a light 347.4 million. Shares moved up from the outset of trading, buoyed by Wall Street\'s rebound Wednesday from its lowest levels. In addition, unconfirmed takeover rumors, particularly in the food manufacturing sector, injected a bit of enthusiasm into an otherwise directionless trading session. The dollar also made its presence felt, following the U.S. currency\'s sharp slide Wednesday. Despite the dollar\'s slight rebound Thursday, the market took a dim view of internationally oriented stocks, most of which declined on the day. The London market again followed Wall Street on Thursday, rising to its best level after the Dow Jones Industrial Average opened higher but dropping back late in the day as the Big Board moved lower. The U.S. is expected to dominate London trading again Friday, as participants await the release of U.S. employment data for June. The data are being closely watched for signals on the interest rate outlook. The major gaining stock was Ranks Hovis McDougall, which rose 24 pence to 481 pence ($7.82). The stock was bolstered in moderate volume by unconfirmed rumors that Sunningdale Holdings, a group connected to British investors Jacob Rothschild and James Goldsmith, was about to make a bid for the U.K. food manufacturer. Sunningdale already holds 29.9% of Ranks Hovis. Other food stocks were pulled higher by the takeover talk. United Biscuits gained 8 to 381, and Cadbury Schweppes moved up 9 to 373. Frankfurt prices closed narrowly lower after a day of hectic, see-saw trading. The DAX index, which was nearly 11 points lower in the early part of the session, closed down 2.06 at 1493.29. Investors took profits on the strong gains made earlier in the week and drove down the market early in the session, traders said, especially after the federal statistics office published an upward revision in West German inflation figures for June. ""One shouldn\'t overestimate this one figure, but it shows that inflation is still a major issue here,"" one broker at a Frankfurt bank said. The Bundesbank raised its discount rate only last week, but many analysts expect another rate increase this year because of the continued inflationary trend. But buying set in at the lower levels, and following a second wave of profit-taking around midday, the market ended near its day-earlier close. Foreign investors appeared to be interested in German shares in hope that a rise in the mark against the dollar will yield foreign-exchange gains, brokers said. At the end of the day, automobile shares had the largest losses amid worries that the lower dollar will cut into the export earnings of the major car makers. Porsche, which exports half of its luxury sports cars to the U.S., tumbled 14.50 marks to 770 ($409), and Bayerische Motoren Werke dropped 7.5 to 554. Volkswagen slid 5 to 422, and Daimler-Benz eased 0.50 mark to 703. Elsewhere, prices closed higher in Brussels, Stockholm, and Paris, lower in Amsterdam and Zurich and mixed in Milan. Stockholm prices closed at a record high in moderate trading on pent-up buying interest in the major shares. Brokers were surprised by the relatively high volume when they had expected a slow market in the summer doldrums. Among Pacific markets, shares closed higher in Hong Kong, Singapore, Sydney and Manila, were lower in Seoul and Taipei, and little changed in Wellington.

71,1989-07-06,"['The Federal Reserve appears to be easing further its grip on credit in the face of a slowing economy, according to government officials and Wall Street analysts. The central bank\'s policy-making committee met Wednesday and again yesterday to set credit policy for the coming weeks. But even before that meeting concluded, the bellwether federal funds interest rate began to drop. That suggests Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan may have used his discretionary authority to bring down interest rates slightly in advance of the policy meeting, laying the groundwork for further Fed easing today. ""I think they are clearly leaning in the direction of ease,"" said Steven Wood, a money market economist at Bank of America. ""I would expect definitive signs of a Fed ease to occur"" today after release of the June employment report, said Donald J. Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Manhattan Bank. The most likely result of the Fed\'s move is that the federal funds rate, which is the rate banks charge on loans to each other, will fall to 9 1/4% from its recent level of about 9 1/2%. But the Federal Open Market Committee also may have given Chairman Greenspan authority to drop the rate another quarter percentage point in the coming weeks if there are more signs the economy is weakening. The Fed began easing its credit policy last month, reversing a year-long drive to push short-term interest rates up more than three percentage points to fight inflation. That move came after a spirited battle between Fed governors who favored an easier policy and several district Fed presidents opposed to easing. In recent weeks, more signs of an economic slowdown have begun to appear, apparently convincing Fed officials that further easing was needed. ""There are a lot of signals around that the economy is softening,"" said Scott Pardee, co-chairman of Yamaichi International (America) Inc. and a former Fed official. Citing slow money growth and falling commodity prices, Mr. Pardee said: ""All these suggest an easing would be in line. The economic figures justify it, the monetary figures justify it, and there\'s been some signs of abatement in inflationary pressures."" Expectations of the Fed\'s move are so widespread in the financial markets that it may prove anticlimactic and have only a small effect on interest rates other than the federal funds rate.

Prices of Treasury securities inched higher in moderate trading yesterday, as many participants interpreted the open-market activity by the Federal Reserve Board as a sign that the central bank has decided to push interest rates lower.   Analysts have been anticipating a further easing in monetary policy by the Fed because the economic statistics of continue to be weak. When the central bank chose not to drain reserves from the banking system around noontime, the period when it normally conducts its open-market operations, analysts took the decision as an indication that the Fed was easing its policy.   ''The Fed's absence from the market at a time when they needed to drain reserves suggests they are moving to push the Federal funds rate down to 9 1/4 percent,'' said David M. Jones, chief economist at Aubrey G. Lanston & Company. ''That could happen over the next day or two.'' Looking for a Shift   Fed watchers like Mr. Jones were more sensitive to the central bank's activities yesterday than usual because the Fed's policy-making arm, the Federal Open Market Committee, concluded two days of meetings in Washington. The windup of those sessions has occasionally provided evidence of a shift in policy.   The Fed's absence from the market attracted analysts' attention, but it had little actual effect on the Federal funds rate, the interest rate the central bank most directly controls.   Late yesterday the closely watched rate drifted as low as 9 5/16 percent, after remaining in the 9 1/2 percent to 9 3/8 percent range it has occupied for most of the week. The Federal funds rate is the rate that banks charge each other for overnight loans.   The credit markets were also helped by renewed stability in the dollar after several days of weakness. Treasury Issues Rise   Late in the day, the Treasury's bellwether 8 7/8 percent bonds that mature in 2019 were offered at a price of 108 26/32, up 14/32, to yield 8.08 percent.   Prices of secondary note issues also moved higher. In late trading, the 8 5/8 percent five-year notes were offered at 102 31/32, up a quarter-point, to yield 7.89 percent. And the 8 1/4 percent two-year notes were offered at 100 5/8, up 2/32, to yield 7.90 percent.   Short-term Treasury bill rates inched slightly higher yesterday, after falling sharply on Wednesday.   Three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 7.78 percent late yesterday, up 3 basis points. Six-month bills were offered at 7.53 percent, up one basis point. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. Employment Figures Awaited   Despite the gains, the rise in note and bond prices yesterday was tempered by the specter of this morning's release of June employment statistics. The consensus among Wall Street economists was that nonfarm payroll employment rose by 200,000 jobs last month.   ''The employment number is a pivotal one,'' said John R. Williams, a vice president and economist at the Bankers Trust Company. ''Those who think the economy is still moving along at a good pace will have to throw in the towel if the payroll employment number is under 150,000. And those who believe we are slipping into recession will have to rethink their position if that figure is 250,000 or higher.''   Because of the importance of the payroll number, Mr. Williams said, he did not attach much significance to the Fed's decision to stay out of the market yesterday.   ''I think they will wait to see the employment report before they move,'' he said. Corporate Bonds Also Gain   Elsewhere, traders said that prices of secondary corporate bonds moved up by about a quarter-point in light trading. Activity in the secondary market for tax-exempt municipal bonds was described by traders as extremely lethargic, with prices of most issues closing an eighth to a quarter of a point higher on the day.   New-issue activity was dominated by utility issuers, who since the beginning of June have issued close to $2.5 billion in new debt securities.   Three such issues were priced yesterday, including a $100 million issue of 30-year first-mortgage bonds by the Northern States Power Company.   The 9 1/8 percent bonds, which mature on July 1, 2019, were priced at $99.165 to yield 9.207 percent, 1.10 percentage points above the prevailing yield on the 8 7/8 percent 30-year Treasury bond at the time of pricing. The bonds are nonrefundable for five years.   Goldman, Sachs & Company acted as lead manager for the underwriting, which is rated AA-1 by Moody's Investors Service and AA by the Standard & Poor's Corporation.   In other developments, the Federal Reserve reported that all three measures of the nation's money supply rose in the week ended June 26. The report had no effect on prices of fixed-income securities.   graph of tax-exempt yields from 3/89 to 7/89 (Source: The Bond Buyer)  ""]","[""prices of treasury securities inched higher in moderate trading yesterday, as many participants interpreted the open-market activity by the federal reserve board as a sign that the central bank has decided to push interest rates lower.   prices of treasury securities inched higher in moderate trading yesterday, as many participants interpreted the open-market activity by the federal reserve board as a sign that the central bank has decided to push interest rates lower.   analysts have been anticipating a further easing in monetary policy by the fed because the economic statistics of continue to be weak. when the central bank chose not to drain reserves from the banking system around noontime, the period when it normally conducts its open-market operations, analysts took the decision as an indication that the fed was easing its policy.   ''the fed's absence from the market at a time when they needed to drain reserves suggests they are moving to push the federal funds rate down to 9 1/4 percent,'' said david m. jones, chief economist at aubrey g. lanston & company. ''that could happen over the next day or two.'' looking for a shift   fed watchers like mr. jones were more sensitive to the central bank's activities yesterday than usual because the fed's policy-making arm, the federal open market committee, concluded two days of meetings in washington. the windup of those sessions has occasionally provided evidence of a shift in policy.   the fed's absence from the market attracted analysts' attention, but it had little actual effect on the federal funds rate, the interest rate the central bank most directly controls.   late yesterday the closely watched rate drifted as low as 9 5/16 percent, after remaining in the 9 1/2 percent to 9 3/8 percent range it has occupied for most of the week. the federal funds rate is the rate that banks charge each other for overnight loans.   the credit markets were also helped by renewed stability in the dollar after several days of weakness. treasury issues rise   late in the day, the treasury's bellwether 8 7/8 percent bonds that mature in 2019 were offered at a price of 108 26/32, up 14/32, to yield 8.08 percent.   prices of secondary note issues also moved higher. in late trading, the 8 5/8 percent five-year notes were offered at 102 31/32, up a quarter-point, to yield 7.89 percent. and the 8 1/4 percent two-year notes were offered at 100 5/8, up 2/32, to yield 7.90 percent.   short-term treasury bill rates inched slightly higher yesterday, after falling sharply on wednesday.   three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 7.78 percent late yesterday, up 3 basis points. six-month bills were offered at 7.53 percent, up one basis point. a basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. employment figures awaited   despite the gains, the rise in note and bond prices yesterday was tempered by the specter of this morning's release of june employment statistics. the consensus among wall street economists was that nonfarm payroll employment rose by 200,000 jobs last month.

74,2001-11-06,"[""The Federal Reserve cut interest rates again yesterday, pushing down short-term rates as far this year as it has usually done before the economy comes out of a recession. Stock market investors now seem to believe a recovery will begin by the middle of next year. Despite some hesitation after the announcement of the half-point reduction, share prices ended the day with a solid rally -- making it the most enthusiastic reaction of the year for any of the cuts that have come at regularly scheduled meetings of the central bank's policy making Federal Open Market Committee. The cut leaves the rate on overnight loans between banks at 2 percent, the lowest since 1961. The three major market averages, the Dow Jones industrial average, the Standard & Poor's 500 and the Nasdaq composite index, ended the day up 1.5 percent or more. They had been mixed to down after the first five expected moves this year, but rose, albeit not as strongly as yesterday, after the last move, on Oct. 2. Lower interest rates are expected to stimulate the economy by making it less expensive for individuals and businesses to borrow money. One rate the Fed directly controls is now down more than two-thirds from where it began the year. That is about the same amount as rates fell before recent recessions ended. In part, yesterday's market advance reflected more mystery than usual surrounding the Fed meeting. While all Fed forecasters expected a cut, they were split between factions that expected a quarter-point cut -- or 25 basis points -- and those that expected the cut to be twice as much. ''It means that the Fed is nervous about the economy,'' said William C. Dudley, the chief United States economist of Goldman, Sachs, after the Fed announced the bigger move. ''I think there was probably a big debate about 25 or 50.'' A possible sign of dissent in the Fed was the fact that only one of the 12 Fed regional banks, the one based in Richmond, Va., had asked for a half-point reduction in the discount rate, the interest on loans by the Fed to banks. On Oct. 2, eight of the 12 banks had requested cuts. Under the Fed's rules, the Open Market Committee has complete discretion over the federal funds rate, the rate at which banks lend to each other overnight. But moves in the discount rate must be initiated by regional banks. If there was substantial dissent, and that will only become clear when minutes of yesterday's meeting are released, that may make a large cut at the next meeting, on Dec. 11, less likely. Many economists expect a quarter-point cut at that meeting. The Fed's only comment yesterday was a terse statement notable largely for two changes from its October statement. It mentioned that business is weak overseas and that increased security spending ''may restrain advances in productivity for a time.'' While neither point had been made before in the Fed's announcements of rate cuts, both were widely understood by investors and did not seem to bother traders. The stock market has rallied since it hit bottom on Sept. 21, a week after trading resumed following the Sept. 11 attacks, and those rising prices appear to have both reflected and reinforced hopes for an economic recovery. Since those bottoms, the Dow and S.& P. 500 are up about 16 percent, while the Nasdaq index has leaped 29 percent. With yesterday's cut, the federal funds rate has fallen from a cyclical peak of 6.5 percent to 2 percent. While previous recessions have often started when rates were far higher -- and therefore had more percentage points to fall, one way to compare cuts is by the percentage decline. Comparing that to past recessions is a bit tricky, because the Fed did not always use the federal funds rate as a target, and it tended to be more volatile. But Robert J. Barbera, the chief economist of Hoenig & Company, noted that this decline is generally in line with those of the past. In the recessions that ended in 1970, 1975 and 1991, the declines from the peak monthly average of the federal funds rate to the low monthly average ranged from 64 percent to 70 percent, he said. The two exceptions were the mini-recession of 1980 and the longer one that ended in 1983, when the declines were 49 percent and 55 percent, respectively. The Fed has now cut rates 10 times this year -- seven at regularly scheduled meetings and three between meetings. The first two surprise moves, in January and April, produced market surges that faded within weeks or months. The third, on Sept. 17, came the day the market reopened after the attacks, and may have limited the falls that day. This recession -- assuming as most economists do that one has begun -- differs from previous downturns in several ways. Normally recessions begin with weakness in the housing and auto sectors, as higher interest rates lead to depressed sales. But this time it was the industrial economy that went first, and consumer spending held up surprisingly well for most of this year. The Fed's aggressive cuts in rates have helped to support housing, which has only recently begun to weaken, and car sales are now strong -- although that is widely viewed as stemming from aggressive price cutting by automakers, which are losing money despite the strong sales. Paradoxically, the strength of demand in those two sectors makes it less likely that they will be able to lead the recovery when it arrives, since there appears to be little pent-up demand. But, Mr. Dudley at Goldman, Sachs said, there are other areas that are likely to provide stimulus, starting with the effect of lower energy prices and additional production by companies after they finish reducing inventories that had been too large when the slowdown began. And, he added, there is the delayed, but still expected, fiscal stimulus package from Washington. For now, anyway, the stock market seems to be confident that the economy will revive. And while yesterday's decision by the Fed to go for a bigger cut may be evidence of greater concern about economic weakness, investors believe it simply makes the eventual recovery that much more certain.""]","[""the federal reserve cut interest rates again yesterday, pushing down short-term rates as far this year as it has usually done before the economy comes out of a recession. stock market investors now seem to believe a recovery will begin by the middle of next year. despite some hesitation after the announcement of the half-point reduction, share prices ended the day with a solid rally -- making it the most enthusiastic reaction of the year for any of the cuts that have come at regularly scheduled meetings of the central bank's policy making federal open market committee. the cut leaves the rate on overnight loans between banks at 2 percent, the lowest since 1961. the three major market averages, the dow jones industrial average, the standard & poor's 500 and the nasdaq composite index, ended the day up 1.5 percent or more. they had been mixed to down after the first five expected moves this year, but rose, albeit not as strongly as yesterday, after the last move, on oct. 2. lower interest rates are expected to stimulate the economy by making it less expensive for individuals and businesses to borrow money. one rate the fed directly controls is now down more than two-thirds from where it began the year. that is about the same amount as rates fell before recent recessions ended. in part, yesterday's market advance reflected more mystery than usual surrounding the fed meeting. while all fed forecasters expected a cut, they were split between factions that expected a quarter-point cut -- or 25 basis points -- and those that expected the cut to be twice as much.

75,2002-09-24,"['NEW YORK -- Small-capitalization stocks fell, but managed to weather the storm in the U.S. stock markets because of strength in biotechnology and other technology shares. Still, the small-cap picture isn\'t much brighter than the large-cap one. The Russell 2000 remains at four-year lows, and the Standard & Poor\'s SmallCap 600 index finished just two points above its one-year low. But market trackers are giving small-caps some credit for holding up on a relative basis in an environment plagued by profit disappointments, a sluggish economy, and the threat of war. The Russell 2000 Index ended down 2.10 points, or 0.59%, at 356.58, while the Standard & Poor\'s SmallCap 600 Index dropped 1.11 points, or 0.6%, to 183.79. The Nasdaq Composite Index of both large and small stocks finished down 2.76 points, or 0.23%, at 1182.17. While most of Wall Street wasn\'t surprised with the Federal Open Market Committee\'s decision to leave the federal-funds rate unchanged at 1.75%, there were hopes that the Federal Reserve\'s comments could provide the market with some optimism.

76,2002-09-24,"['NEW YORK -- Prices of U.S. Treasury securities settled moderately higher yesterday, with sentiment for government debt buoyed by signs that the door to further rate cuts by the Federal Reserve has opened a little wider. At 4 p.m., the benchmark 10-year note was up 15/32 point, or $4.6875 per $1,000 face value, at 106 1/32. Its yield fell to 3.64% from 3.69% late Monday, as yields move inversely to prices. The 30-year bond\'s price was up 29/32 point at 111 22/32 to yield 4.63%, down from 4.68% on Monday. The trading session focused on the monetary policy meeting of the Fed\'s Federal Open Market Committee. As expected, the FOMC left its target short-term rate unchanged at 1.75% and maintained that risks are still tilted in favor of further economic weakness. However, two members of the FOMC, Federal Reserve Governor Edward Gramlich and Dallas President Robert McTeer, dissented from the decision and sought a rate cut, and the policy statement flagged geopolitical risks. It was the first dissent by a Fed governor since 1995. The news helped to send stocks lower. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 189.02 to 7683.13. Buying in Treasurys was concentrated in the 10-year note, pushing its yield briefly below 3.60%, a level not seen since 1958. Vinnie Verterano, a trader at Nomura Securities International Inc., said heavy buying in the form of short covering was seen from dealers immediately after the Fed\'s announcement, but no retail activity. Mr. Verterano said the market rallied because ""two people wanted to ease"" and a sign emerged that a rate cut is imminent if the economy shows further weakness. Although the market subsequently pulled back from its highs, the move was attributed to profit taking and traders said renewed weakness in stocks and expectations of a rate cut would sustain the overall bid tone for government debt. ""The Fed is keeping the door open to an easing, but they are reluctant to cut rates as long as equities remain unstable,"" said William Strazzullo, market strategist at State Street in Boston. However, the current climate of poor economic data, weakening corporate earnings and geopolitical concerns are likely to force the Fed\'s hand in the coming months, he said. ""They will be dragged to an ease when the market has already priced in such a move,"" he said. Some fixed-income analysts saw the two dissents as a sign that the FOMC itself is heading back toward another round of rate cuts in the months ahead. The dissents are likely to spark a new debate about a renewed rate-cutting campaign by the Fed, said Dominic Konstam, head of interest-rate strategy at Credit Suisse First Boston in New York. ""The point now is no longer if, but when the Fed will cut rates,"" said Mr. Konstam. ""We now expect that when the Fed starts to ease, it will likely be a cycle of several rate cuts."" Mr. Konstam expects to see the two-year Treasury note -- widely seen as a barometer of Fed expectations -- trade below the current 1.75% Fed-funds rate as those expectations get priced into the market. John Ryding, chief market economist at Bear Stearns, said the two dissenting FOMC votes were surprising. However, ""do I think the Fed will be more likely to cut by the end of the year,"" given the two dissents at the FOMC meeting? ""No,"" he said. That will largely rely on the next two unemployment reports, he added.  Agency Securities Fannie Mae\'s repurchase of $846 million in debt securities yesterday will help a bit to correct a large mismatch between its assets and liabilities, but market professionals say it\'s only a drop in the bucket compared with what needs to be done if interest rates don\'t rise. The buyback is Fannie\'s first since June, representing the longest lag between Fannie Mae debt repurchases since the government-sponsored enterprise implemented the program in March 2001. After announcing plans earlier yesterday to buy as much as $1 billion in longer-term debt, Fannie Mae accepted offers totaling $846 million in notes with maturities between 2009 and 2012. Corporate Bonds Consumer-products manufacturer Gillette Co. sold $500 million of five-year notes at a spread of 0.85 percentage point above comparable Treasury securities. The issue was increased in size from an originally planned $300 million. The lead manager was Lehman Brothers. Meanwhile, postage-meter company Pitney Bowes Inc. sold $400 million of 10-year notes at a spread of 1.02 percentage points above comparable Treasurys. The joint lead managers were Deutsche Bank Securities and J.P. Morgan. The issue had been boosted in size from $350 million. Neither Gillette nor Pitney Bowes is a significant issuer of debt, and, as a result, their issues have scarcity value in the eyes of some investors. Meanwhile, El Paso Corp. faces the prospect of downgrades to its investment-grade credit ratings following a judge\'s recommendation on Monday that the company pay penalties for withholding natural-gas capacity during California\'s energy crisis. Moody\'s Investors Service and Standard & Poor\'s put El Paso\'s debt on review, citing concerns about the ruling and declining cash flow at the Houston-based natural-gas producer and pipeline company. --- Tyler Lifton, Julie Haviv and Michael C.

78,2002-09-24,"[""The Dow Jones industrial average plunged to a four-year low yesterday, as investors digested a surprise dissent from two Federal Reserve policy makers. Two members of the Federal Open Market Committee, which met yesterday to discuss interest rate policy, voted against the decision of the majority of the committee to keep the Fed's benchmark interest rate at 1.75 percent. They wanted to reduce it. The dissent, from Edward Gramlich, a Fed governor, and Robert McTeer, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, was read both negatively and positively by investors, as was evident in the gyrations in the market after the 2:15 p.m. announcement. But by the end of the session, it appeared that the negative interpretation was holding sway for now. The Dow dropped 189.02 points, or 2.4 percent, to 7,683.13, its lowest close since October 1998, while the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 14.41 points, or 1.7 percent, to 819.29. The Nasdaq composite index, which eked out small gains earlier in the day, slipped 2.76 points, or 0.2 percent, to 1,182.17, a six-year low. Both the Dow and the Nasdaq are now below the levels they fell to in the summer, when the overall market dropped to a five-year low. The S.& P. 500 is just 21.59 points above the five-year low it reached in July. Investors were also faced yesterday with another dose of weak data on the economy as consumer confidence declined and there were more disappointments on corporate earnings. The negative reading of the dissenting votes at the central bank is that there are policy makers who think economic performance is weak enough to require another rate cut to assure the recovery continues. That means without a rate cut, growth could slow and corporate earnings expectations, which are already falling, could drop further. The positive reading is that the unusual dissent makes it more likely that other policy makers will support a rate cut at the next committee meeting in November if economic data continues to be disappointing. Louis Crandall, the chief economist at Wrightson Associates, took the positive view. The dissents, he said, ''make clear that a rate cut is an option'' at the next Fed meeting in November. Recent public comments of Fed policy makers had led many analysts to conclude that a rate cut was unlikely then. The Fed officials may have added to the negative sentiment in the market by saying that the pace of the recovery and job growth is uncertain because of ''the emergence of heightened geopolitical risks,'' a reference that has to include a possible war with Iraq. Investors could interpret this to mean that a war could temporarily derail the recovery. As stocks tumbled, interest rates moved even lower. These low rates are giving a lift to the economy by stimulating both home and auto sales and mortgage refinancing. The yield on the Treasury's 10-year note fell to 3.65 percent in late afternoon from 3.70 percent on Monday. It was the lowest yield on a government security with a 10-year maturity in more than 40 years, according to the Federal Reserve. The price, which moves in the opposite direction, rose 15/32, to 106. The yield on the Treasury's two-year note fell to 1.87 percent from 1.90 percent. The consumer confidence index compiled by the Conference Board fell to 93.3 in September from 94.5 in August; it is down for the fourth consecutive month. Consumer spending accounts for about two-thirds of the economy. The bad news on earnings came from several companies. Weyerhaeuser, the wood-products company, said that earnings for the third quarter would range from 5 cents to 10 cents a share, well below the 35 cents a share expected on Wall Street. It stock fell $5.94, or 11.9 percent, to $43.79. Maytag said that its earnings would be 65 cents to 70 cents a share. Analysts were forecasting 79 cents a share. Its stock fell $1.22, or 5 percent, to $23.10.

What was not disclosed at the end of the two-day meeting is whether committee members have shifted to a neutral stance from their previous position of maintaining a bias toward raising rates. But given the prevailing evidence of benign inflation and the expected economic slowdown due to Asia's financial crisis, bond market analysts said such a change would not surprise them. ''In any event, monetary policy is likely to remain on hold for quite some time before economic conditions change sufficiently to dictate otherwise,'' said Donald Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Asset Management. The bond market's attention has now shifted to tomorrow's labor statistics for January, the freshest reading from the Government on the economy's stamina. Mr. Fine said payroll growth was expected to remain strong but might have slowed from its strong pace in the last months of 1997. The average hourly earnings data, which will be released tomorrow, may also receive more attention than usual given the recent spurt in the Employment Cost Index, a measure of inflation closely followed by the Fed. The bond market showed little reaction yesterday to the Treasury's announcement of the size of its quarterly refunding auction next week, $35 billion, which had been expected. In when-issued trading ahead of the auction, the three-year note was offered at a price to yield 5.31 percent, the 10-year note at a price to yield 5.52 percent and the 30-year bond at 5.87 percent. In municipal bond dealings, the City of New York sold $1.05 billion in debt, the bulk in tax-exempt general obligation bonds, some taxable bonds not offered to the public and some zero-coupon bonds, through underwriters led by Salomon Smith Barney. Yields ranged from 3.90 percent for an issue due in 1999 to 5.04 percent in 2011. The zero-coupon bond due in 2008 does not make interest rate payments, but held to maturity yields 4.75 percent.

81,2008-09-16,"[""Federal Reserve policy makers kept their benchmark lending rate unchanged at 2 percent on Tuesday, highlighting the conflicting pressures of an epic financial crisis and nagging inflation. Although the decision initially disappointed investors, analysts said it reflected the Fed's determination to separate basic monetary policy from the specific credit and cash problems on Wall Street. Even as the Fed announced its decision to stand pat, officials were rushing to complete a huge loan package for American International Group, the troubled giant insurance company. Some economists said the decision on rates also reflected the unhappy truth that a cut in the overnight federal funds rate might have merely highlighted the Fed's limited ability to solve a problem that entails the entire housing and mortgage markets. By holding steady on interest rates, the Fed is reflecting the uncomfortable fact that interest rates have little to do with the credit crisis stemming from staggering losses on poorly underwritten mortgages and mortgage-backed securities. The central bank's Federal Open Market Committee ''has decided to stand pat despite the market turmoil,'' said Sung Won Sohn, an economist at California State University, Channel Islands, who studies financial markets. ''Lower interest rates at this time would not solve any problems in the financial markets,'' he said. ''The market is not short of liquidity; it is short of confidence.'' Even though consumer prices actually declined slightly in August, largely because of a drop in oil prices, the Fed noted that inflation had been high and that the outlook for prices ''remains highly uncertain.'' ''The downside risks to growth and the upside risks to inflation are both of significant concern,'' said the Federal Open Market Committee, which sets interest rates. Policy makers said they would ''monitor economic and financial developments carefully,'' adding that they would ''act as needed to promote sustainable economic growth and price stability.'' Below the surface, the Fed continued to flood the markets with extra cash through its open-market operations in New York. On Tuesday morning, the Fed injected an additional $50 billion into the markets simply to keep the federal funds rate at its target level of 2 percent. The effective funds rate had climbed as high as 4 percent when markets opened. The Fed indicated that it was watching closely to see if the broader economy would further stumble because of Wall Street's illness, which could happen if businesses and home buyers were unable to obtain credit. ''The financial markets aren't frozen because the federal funds rate is too high,'' said Michael T. Darda, chief economist at MKM Partners, an investment firm in Greenwich, Conn. ''The markets are frozen because there is a crisis of confidence. It's not a matter of whether the short rate is 2 percent or 1.5 percent.'' By any measure, the economy has already slowed sharply. The United States has lost an average of 75,000 jobs a month since January, for a total loss of 605,000 jobs through August. The unemployment rate hit 6.1 percent last month, up from 4.9 percent in January. Some sectors of the economy have been surprisingly strong. Exports have received a boost from the dollar's sharp drop against other major currencies, which makes American products cheaper in foreign markets, and from healthy growth in other parts of the world. But most forecasters predict that the export boom will probably fade as slower growth in the United States spills over to foreign markets. The technology sector, which had been strong despite the economy's other problems, on Tuesday showed some signs of weakening. Dell warned that worsening conditions across the globe might hurt its third quarter -- a message that set off a 10 percent drop in the price of Dell shares.

82,2002-12-10,"[""WASHINGTON, Dec. 10 -- The Federal Reserve kept interest rates unchanged today, leaving its main short-term rate at its lowest level in 41 years as policy makers wait for more signs of economic strength. In a statement after today's meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, which sets monetary policy, the Fed repeated its view that the economy was working through a ''soft spot'' and that existing monetary policy was loose enough at the moment. Last month, the Federal Reserve made an aggressive move by reducing the federal funds rate on overnight loans between banks by half a percentage point, to just 1.25 percent. Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, has called the move an ''insurance premium'' in case the economy proves to be weaker than expected. Given the big rate cut last month and the continued signs of economic weakness, the decision today to stand pat came as no surprise. But analysts said the absence of new guidance from the Fed reinforced their view that rates would be kept down for at least the next several months. ''I think our central bank is very content with where it has set policy,'' said Carl R. Tannenbaum, chief economist at ABN Amro North America. Economic data over the last month has continued to be mixed. On the positive side, productivity growth has been surprisingly brisk, the stock market has rallied somewhat from its October lows and the economy grew at a remarkably robust annualized rate of 4 percent in the third quarter. But other signs are less encouraging. The government reported last week that the unemployment rate climbed an unexpectedly large amount in November, to 6 percent. Consumer confidence is lower than it was six months ago, and business investment remains stagnant. Most economists say that growth in the fourth quarter will once again be anemic as automobile sales sputter and consumer spending slows. Looming behind all that are the uncertainties of a possible war with Iraq and growing unease about economic stagnation in Japan and parts of Europe, particularly Germany. In its statement today, the Federal Reserve reiterated its view that the economy is caught in a sluggish phase but will gradually pick up. ''The limited number of incoming economic indicators since the November meeting, taken together, are not inconsistent with the economy working its way through its current soft spot,'' the Fed said, in a display of the tangled ambiguity in which Mr. Greenspan often couches his comments. Ian Shepherdson, chief United States economist for High Frequency Economics, wrote in a research note, ''We take this to be an unnecessarily tortuous way of saying that the leading indicators generally look a bit better while most of the coincident numbers still stink.'' The National Association of Business Economics, in its most recent survey of economists, reduced its forecast for annualized growth in the current quarter to just 1.4 percent from 2.7 percent. Mr. Tannenbaum of ABN Amro predicts that growth in this quarter may only be half that much. ''Even with very inexpensive financing, there still isn't a willingness to make capital expenditures,'' Mr. Tannenbaum said. And despite signs of fairly buoyant holiday shopping after Thanksgiving, consumers may be losing energy as well. Automobile sales are down substantially, in part because sales were inflated to record levels earlier this year as manufacturers lured consumers with zero percent financing deals. Car sales were a pillar of consumer spending, but part of the effect of the sales-incentive deals was simply to pull forward sales that might have taken place later in the year. Fed officials have been couching their analysis in terms of probabilities, saying that there is a low but not insignificant possibility that the nation could slip back into a recession. Mr. Greenspan, in explaining last month's rate cut, has said inflation is now so low -- running at slightly more than 2 percent -- that the inflationary risks of the rate cut were far outweighed by the added economic activity that it could promote. The problem is that businesses have not been reacting much to the low interest rates. Manufacturing has been contracting for the last several months, prices for a wide range of goods are declining and businesses are bent on squeezing more productivity out of fewer workers. Mr. Greenspan and other top Fed officials are openly concerned about the possibility of Japanese-style deflation. Real interest rates, after accounting for inflation, are already close to zero. But if the Fed is forced to drop its nominal rate to zero as well, it will have to resort to other tools for pumping money into the economy like buying longer-term Treasury bills. Mr. Greenspan and other Fed officials have said they have more than enough ammunition left, even in the unlikely event that interest rates decline to zero. But they acknowledge they would find themselves in uncharted territory.""]","[""washington, dec. 10 -- the federal reserve kept interest rates unchanged today, leaving its main short-term rate at its lowest level in 41 years as policy makers wait for more signs of economic strength. in a statement after today's meeting of the federal open market committee, which sets monetary policy, the fed repeated its view that the economy was working through a ''soft spot'' and that existing monetary policy was loose enough at the moment. last month, the federal reserve made an aggressive move by reducing the federal funds rate on overnight loans between banks by half a percentage point, to just 1.25 percent. alan greenspan, the fed chairman, has called the move an ''insurance premium'' in case the economy proves to be weaker than expected. given the big rate cut last month and the continued signs of economic weakness, the decision today to stand pat came as no surprise. but analysts said the absence of new guidance from the fed reinforced their view that rates would be kept down for at least the next several months.

84,2002-12-10,"['NEW YORK -- Treasurys ended mixed as investors shifted from shorter maturities to 30-year bonds after Federal Reserve policy makers left the target for the overnight borrowing rate unchanged at a 41-year low. Although the Fed\'s action was in line with market expectations, the statement in which it announced the decision didn\'t highlight the economy\'s weakness as much as many had expected, traders and analysts said. At 4 p.m., the benchmark 10-year note was down 4/32 point, or $1.25 per $1,000 face value, at 99 17/32. Its yield rose to 4.058% from 4.042% Monday, as yields move inversely to prices. The 30-year bond\'s price was up 14/32 point at 107 to yield 4.912%, down from 4.940% Monday. Fed policy makers voted unanimously to leave the federal-funds, or overnight lending, rate target at 1.25%. They also left the largely symbolic discount rate unchanged at 0.75%. In a statement, the Fed said the risk of a renewed downturn remains ""balanced"" with the risk of inflation. That was interpreted by people in the market as suggesting no need for additional rate cuts by the Fed. ""The committee continues to believe that this accommodative stance of monetary policy, coupled with still-robust underlying growth in productivity, is providing important ongoing support to economic activity,"" the policy setting Federal Open Market Committee said. ""People were expecting a more accommodative comment from [policy makers] in terms of focusing on the weak economy,"" said Paul Calvetti, head of Treasury trading at Deutsche Bank in New York. ""But they seemed to signal that the current level of rates is enough to get through the soft patches."" But some in the market said there was very little new information in the Fed\'s statement in terms of whether it is done easing. Merrill Lynch fixed-income strategist Jim Caron said there is still a risk the Fed will ease one more time next year if the economy doesn\'t pick up. Michael Cheah, portfolio manager at SunAmerica Asset Management in Jersey City, N.J., said the Fed had missed an opportunity to assure markets that it isn\'t in a hurry to raise rates, given current high labor productivity. The Fed announcement sparked some light selling in Treasurys -- centered on shorter maturities -- while the 30-year bond\'s price gained some. As long-term yields dropped in relation to short-term yields, the margin between short- and long-term rates narrowed. That trend may continue, with more people shifting out along the maturity spectrum to 30-year bonds, some said. Despite talk of hefty fiscal stimulus, which had been pressuring long-term yields higher, tax cuts are a longer-term prospect, said David Ging, fixed-income strategist at Credit Suisse First Boston. Meanwhile, the fact that Fed policy is expected to stay on hold immediately influences where investors are looking to place money, he noted. Anthony Crescenzi, market strategist at Miller Tabak & Co. in New York, said the Fed seemed to be agreeing with sentiment in the markets this fall. ""The two-month rally in equities, the fall in Treasurys, the narrowing of credit spreads and the rise in commodity prices are predicated in part on the notion that the economy is emerging from the slowdown that began in the summer,"" he said. Economic data yesterday had little effect on trading. Wholesale inventories fell 0.3% in October after a revised 0.4% gain in September. Private economists had forecast a rise of 0.3% for October. Separately, the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond\'s index of manufacturing shipments fell to minus-one for November from positive-six in October.  Corporate and Junk Bonds Five of the investment companies in an unofficial group seeking to block Qwest Communications International\'s nearly $13 billion debt exchange offer were identified in court documents filed this week. They are Elliott Associated LP, Franklin Mutual Advisers LLC, Metropolitan Life Insurance, Metropolitan West Asset Management LLC and MFC Global Investment Management, according to an amended complaint filed with the court. The five represent about $773 million of the notes subject to the exchange offer, which would enable Qwest to reorganize about half of its debt without filing for bankruptcy. The group, whose members hold about $3 billion of the bonds subject to the exchange, allege in the complaint that the swap offer and its documents violate securities law and breach the company\'s fiduciary duties to bondholders. ""Other members of the committee for a variety of reasons are not in a position to publicly identify themselves as plaintiffs and have a federal and constitutional right to remain anonymous and to proceed with this litigation as a committee,"" the amended complaint said. ""Defendants have demanded public disclosure of the names solely to harass members of the committee and to interfere with their right to protect themselves from the defendants\' illegal exchange offer and other violations of law and breaches of fiduciary duty."" Qwest spokesman Steve Hammack said: ""We believe we have the right to know the names of the parties who are suing us and we intend to abide by any guidelines the courts put forth with regard to discovery."" Qwest has said it intends to file a motion to dismiss the complaint and believes claims in the complaint ""are without merit."" A hearing on the request to block the swap is set for a week from today. --- Nicole Bullock contributed to this article.']","['new york -- treasurys ended mixed as investors shifted from shorter maturities to 30-year bonds after federal reserve policy makers left the target for the overnight borrowing rate unchanged at a 41-year low. although the fed's action was in line with market expectations, the statement in which it announced the decision didn't highlight the economy's weakness as much as many had expected, traders and analysts said. at 4 p.m., the benchmark 10-year note was down 4/32 point, or $1.25 per $1,000 face value, at 99 17/32. its yield rose to 4.058% from 4.042% monday, as yields move inversely to prices. the 30-year bond's price was up 14/32 point at 107 to yield 4.912%, down from 4.940% monday. fed policy makers voted unanimously to leave the federal-funds, or overnight lending, rate target at 1.25%. they also left the largely symbolic discount rate unchanged at 0.75%. in a statement, the fed said the risk of a renewed downturn remains ""balanced"" with the risk of inflation. that was interpreted by people in the market as suggesting no need for additional rate cuts by the fed.

""but they seemed to signal that the current level of rates is enough to get through the soft patches."" but some in the market said there was very little new information in the fed's statement in terms of whether it is done easing. merrill lynch fixed-income strategist jim caron said there is still a risk the fed will ease one more time next year if the economy doesn't pick up. michael cheah, portfolio manager at sunamerica asset management in jersey city, n.j., said the fed had missed an opportunity to assure markets that it isn't in a hurry to raise rates, given current high labor productivity. the fed announcement sparked some light selling in treasurys -- centered on shorter maturities -- while the 30-year bond's price gained some. as long-term yields dropped in relation to short-term yields, the margin between short- and long-term rates narrowed. that trend may continue, with more people shifting out along the maturity spectrum to 30-year bonds, some said. despite talk of hefty fiscal stimulus, which had been pressuring long-term yields higher, tax cuts are a longer-term prospect, said david ging, fixed-income strategist at credit suisse first boston. meanwhile, the fact that fed policy is expected to stay on hold immediately influences where investors are looking to place money, he noted. anthony crescenzi, market strategist at miller tabak & co. in new york, said the fed seemed to be agreeing with sentiment in the markets this fall. ""the two-month rally in equities, the fall in treasurys, the narrowing of credit spreads and the rise in commodity prices are predicated in part on the notion that the economy is emerging from the slowdown that began in the summer,"" he said. economic data yesterday had little effect on trading. wholesale inventories fell 0.3% in october after a revised 0.4% gain in september. private economists had forecast a rise of 0.3% for october. separately, the federal reserve bank of richmond's index of manufacturing shipments fell to minus-one for november from positive-six in october.  corporate and junk bonds five of the investment companies in an unofficial group seeking to block qwest communications international's nearly $13 billion debt exchange offer were identified in court documents filed this week. they are elliott associated lp, franklin mutual advisers llc, metropolitan life insurance, metropolitan west asset management llc and mfc global investment management, according to an amended complaint filed with the court. the five represent about $773 million of the notes subject to the exchange offer, which would enable qwest to reorganize about half of its debt without filing for bankruptcy. the group, whose members hold about $3 billion of the bonds subject to the exchange, allege in the complaint that the swap offer and its documents violate securities law and breach the company's fiduciary duties to bondholders. ""other members of the committee for a variety of reasons are not in a position to publicly identify themselves as plaintiffs and have a federal and constitutional right to remain anonymous and to proceed with this litigation as a committee,"" the amended complaint said. ""defendants have demanded public disclosure of the names solely to harass members of the committee and to interfere with their right to protect themselves from the defendants' illegal exchange offer and other violations of law and breaches of fiduciary duty."" qwest spokesman steve hammack said: ""we believe we have the right to know the names of the parties who are suing us and we intend to abide by any guidelines the courts put forth with regard to discovery."" qwest has said it intends to file a motion to dismiss the complaint and believes claims in the complaint ""are without merit."" a hearing on the request to block the swap is set for a week from today. --- nicole bullock contributed to this article.']",33.0,,,,,,,,,1
85,1994-08-16,"['Prices of Treasury securities rose sharply yesterday, after the Federal Reserve announced its fifth interest rate increase of the year.   The price of the 30-year bond climbed 120/32 , to 10118/32 , for a yield of 7.37 percent, down from 7.50 percent on Monday. The yield was the lowest in nearly two weeks. Before the Fed began raising interest rates, starting with an increase in the funds rate on Feb. 4, the yield was 6.35 percent.   The drop of 13 basis points in the yield on the 30-year bond nearly matched the drop of 18 basis points on May 17, when the Fed increased short-term rates by half a percentage point. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.   A technical analyst with Salomon Brothers, Alex Saitta, said that in the last 25 times the Fed had raised its target for the Federal funds rate, the 30-year bond had rallied 12 times and fallen 13.   The Fed announced the increase in the discount rate to 4 percent, from 3.50 percent, and the increase in its target for the Federal funds rate to 4.75 percent, from 4.25 percent, at an early afternoon news conference. The discount rate is the interest charged on loans to member banks. The Federal funds rate is the interest on overnight loans between banks. Evidence of Expansion   The Fed said it had made the moves based upon a background of evidence of continuing strength in the economic expansion and high levels of resource utilization.   The increase in the discount rate and Federal funds target rate ""are expected to be sufficient, at least for a time, to meet the objective of sustained, noninflationary growth,"" the Fed said in a release.   But some economists said the statement could be a signal that another rate increase was unlikely when the Fed\'s policy making Federal Open Market Committee meets again in September. The situation could change, they said, by the next meeting -- after the Congressional elections -- in November.   Donald Fine, chief market analyst for Chase Securities, said ""that this move clearly demonstrates the Fed\'s determination to avoid inflationary pressures, and in fact was somewhat stronger than many had expected.""   ""The economy may be slowing somewhat,"" he added, ""but the Fed thinks current economic growth still exceeds what it believes is the economy\'s noninflationary long-run growth path.""   Mr. Fine said he thought the Fed believed that a growth rate of 2.5 percent was noninflationary, and until that rate was achieved, the Fed would lean toward further tightening. So, if the economy and capacity utilization continue to rise, there could be another move before the end of year. Limiting Risk   Before the interest rate increase yesterday, many market participants had said that bonds would rally only if the Fed made a move of half a percentage point. Some analysts had said the Fed would only make a quarter-point move, not wanting to risk slowing the economy too much.   The analysts who had leaned toward a half-point increase said that anything less would be regarded as too small to contain the higher inflation that would result if the economy kept growing. The market, they said, may also have interpreted a smaller move to mean that the Fed was not being aggressive enough with inflation, which erodes fixed income investments.   Joseph V. Battipaglia, managing director of Sterling Advisors, said yesterday\'s move by the Fed was probably the most widely anticipated of the five rate increases this year. And, he said, if the Fed had not acted, it would have raised questions about what it was up to.   ""Now, it leaves no doubt,"" he said. ""We\'re getting the proper response in bonds, with the short end up and long end coming off.""   Concern about how much the Fed planned to raise interest rates overshadowed the impact of a report yesterday that showed construction of new houses rose 4.7 percent in July, which was more than expected, to an annualized rate of 1.415 million. The consensus among many analysts was for an increase of 2.1 percent, and an annualized rate of 1.379 million.   Elliott Platt, chief economist at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, said that while housing starts for July were slightly stronger than expected, the increase had not tempered his belief that residential construction activity would no longer be a significant stimulative force for the economy.

86,1994-08-16,"['WASHINGTON, Aug. 16 -- The Federal Reserve raised the interest rates it controls today, hoping to prevent the economy\'s continuing strength from leading to inflation but making it more expensive for Americans to borrow money.   The central bank raised two short-term rates by half a percentage point each, more than most analysts had expected. The moves produced rallies in stock and bond markets, as investors acted on their beliefs that inflation would stay low and long-term rates would not keep rising.   The rate increases also prompted banks across the country to raise their prime rate, the rate that determines the cost of home equity loans, small-business loans and credit card balances.   Congressional Democrats and business groups reacted angrily, saying the Federal Reserve action risked a drastic slowdown of the economy. But the public response of the White House was calm, with officials emphasizing the Federal Reserve\'s independence and predicting continued economic growth.   High White House officials had signaled in recent days that they could accept an increase of a quarter of a percentage point. But a few officials, like Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich, who among President Clinton\'s campaign advisers was most enthusiastic about a Government role to stimulate the economy, said they thought inflation was not a threat.   An official who insisted on anonymity said the Administration began anticipating an increase of half a percentage point this morning, after the Commerce Department reported that builders had started 4.7 percent more houses and apartments in July than they had in June, despite higher mortgage rates.   Today\'s action makes further rate increases less likely during the autumn Congressional campaign, the official said, a position that the Federal Reserve\'s announcement early this afternoon appeared to support.   The rate increases today will translate immediately into higher interest rates for small-business loans and home-equity loans. Rates for adjustable-rate mortgages and credit card balances will rise more slowly over the coming months and years, as lenders wait for regularly scheduled reviews of the terms of those loans. Fixed-rate mortgages may actually become a little cheaper, mirroring today\'s drop in interest rates on 30-year Treasury bonds as lenders worry less that inflation will erode their returns.   Higher rates could hurt Democrat ic efforts to contain the losses the party is widely expected to suffer in the November elections for the House and Senate, and could further depress President Clinton\'s political standing.   ""I think it\'s bad for the economy, and if it\'s bad for the economy, then it\'s bad for elected officials,"" SenatorPaul S. Sarbanes, a Maryland Democrat up for re-election, said in a telephone interview.   Today\'s increase was the fifth move this year by the Federal Reserve to raise short-term interest rates. The Federal Open Market Committee, the Federal Reserve\'s policy-making body, met this morning and voted to raise the Federal funds rate, which banks charge one another for overnight loans, to 4.75 percent from 4.25 percent. The Federal Reserve Board also voted to lift the discount rate, the rate the Fed charges for its own loans to banks, to 4 percent from 3.5 percent.   The Federal Reserve controls the Federal funds rate by buying and selling government securities. Wall Street Reacts   In the markets today, the interest rate on 30-year Treasury bonds fell to 7.37 percent from 7.50 percent on Monday, while the Dow Jones industrial average rose 24.28 points, to 3,784.57. John Lipsky, an economist at Salomon Brothers in New York, said the Federal Reserve\'s actions made the economy seem less likely to overheat and inflation less likely to erode the returns on long-term investments. So investors are more willing to invest in stocks and accept lower interest rates on bonds.   ""There are a lot of investors who would like to believe the Goldilocks view of the economy -- not too hot, not too cold, but just right,"" Mr. Lipsky said.   With factories near full use, unemployment low and commodity prices rising, concerns about higher inflation in the months ahead led the Federal Reserve to act today, analysts agreed. The economy grew at an annual rate of 3.7 percent during the second quarter, a level many experts say is greater than the maximum that is sustainable without igniting inflation.   ""These measures were taken against the background of evidence of continuing strength in the economic expansion and high levels of resource utilization,"" the Federal Reserve said in a statement about today\'s rate increases. ""The actions are intended to keep inflationary pressures contained, and thereby foster sustainable economic growth.""   Over the last 12 months, consumer prices have risen 2.8 percent, with the July rise put at three-tenths of 1 percent.   In looking for signs of future inflation, Federal Reserve officials try to gauge whether enough resources like unemployed labor, unused factory capacity and commodities are available to allow further economic growth. Unemployment stood at 6.1 percent in July, factories are running at the highest level in five years and commodity prices have been rising.   These signs have convinced a growing number of Federal Reserve officials that the economy is now operating at close to its full potential and may soon exceed that level if factories add overtime and compete for scarce materials. When the economy has operated above full capacity, notably in the late 1970\'s and to a lesser extent in the late 1980\'s, inflation has tended to rise.   ""The dangers of running over are that you start running into higher rates of inflation,"" said Alan Blinder, the vice chairman of the Federal Reserve, in an interview at the beginning of last week. Eye on the Elections   The announcement today also offered a hint that the Federal Reserve may wait before raising rates again, possibly until after the Congressional elections on Nov. 8. ""The Federal Reserve will continue to monitor economic and financial developments to gauge the appropriate stance of policy,"" the Fed\'s statement said. ""But these actions are expected to be sufficient, at least for a time, to meet the objective of sustained, noninflationary growth.""   Eugene J. Sherman, director of research at M. A. Schapiro & Company, a New York brokerage firm, said that with today\'s move, ""I would expect the Fed to step aside now, with the next likely move at the November meeting, on Nov. 15.""   The other rate increases this year came on Feb. 4, March 22 and April 18, with the Federal Reserve raising the Federal funds rate by a quarter of a percentage point each time, and on May 17, when the discount and Federal funds rates were raised half a point.   In Congressional testimony in July, Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, who is often called the second-most-powerful man in the country and the most powerful when it comes to the economy, said that it would be better to raise rates too much than too little.   ""If we fail to recognize emerging inflationary forces, remedying that will be far more difficult and far more of a problem for the long-term stability of the economy in 1995 and beyond,"" he said.   Only a few Administration officials strongly disagree. Mr. Reich, who has sharply criticized the view that inflation is a risk, without actually criticizing the Federal Reserve by name, said in a recent interview that American workers produce more now in an hour than they did a year ago but their wages have not risen proportionately. So recent wage increases only begin to close that gap and do not threaten inflation, he said. Varied Viewpoints   But elsewhere in the Administration, notably at the White House and the Treasury Department, there have been much stronger worries that the economy might overheat, feeding inflation and provoking the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates drastically. Much higher rates could produce a recession that would hurt President Clinton\'s re-election prospects if the downturn lasted through the 1996 election, these officials warn.   Laura D\'Andrea Tyson, the head of the Council of Economic Advisers, has taken a particularly conciliatory approach to the Federal Reserve. For several weeks, she has said repeatedly that another quarter-point rate increase by the Fed would be consistent with the Administration\'s forecast in mid-July that the rate on three-month Treasury bills would average 4 percent.   But simple arithmetic shows that given this year\'s rises in interest rates, any further rate increase by the Fed, including today\'s, produces a full-year average of more than 4 percent. During an interview on Friday, Ms. Tyson acknowledged that this might be a problem for her forecast. She said that she still expected her forecast of 3 percent growth this year to be accurate but that interest rates might be higher because so much of the economic growth has come early in the year, putting pressure on the Fed to raise rates.

87,2003-03-18,"['Though Vanguard Group continues to warn against piling into bond mutual funds, investors seemingly won\'t be deterred. For more than six months, the second-largest fund group in terms of assets -- after Fidelity Investments -- has repeatedly warned investors not to pile into fixed-income funds. Vanguard\'s worry: Many investors looking for safety and higher returns might falsely assume bonds are riskless investments, not realizing that even a modest increase in interest rates would take a serious bite out of fixed-income values. Safety-seeking fund shareholders have kept throwing money at the firm\'s bond portfolios, anyway. Bonds historically have lower returns than stocks, but bond portfolios have trounced stock funds for three consecutive years, largely thanks to several years of cuts that have dropped interest rates to near historic lows. At their regularly scheduled meeting yesterday, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan and his Federal Open Market Committee colleagues decided to keep short-term interest rates at their ultralow levels. But it will be painful for bond investors whenever the Fed eventually does reverse field and begins to boost rates. As bond prices and interest rates move in opposite directions, such moves will depress prices of bonds sitting in fund portfolios. A bond-risk primer posted on Vanguard\'s Web site in October warned that the value of a long-term bond fund might fall 20% if rates went up just two percentage points. Earlier, the firm cautioned investors about bond-fund risks in an August article titled ""Irrational Exuberance in the Bond Market."" More recently, Vanguard Chairman and Chief Executive John J. Brennan noted in a January market commentary that interest rates are likely to rise this year. Ian MacKinnon, head of Vanguard Fixed Income Group, chimed in, too, warning that rising rates would hurt current bond values during an October news conference in New York. Bonds might not cool on his watch, though; Vanguard announced yesterday that Mr. MacKinnon will retire June 30 after 21 years with the firm. Mr. MacKinnon will be succeeded by fellow Vanguard veteran Robert A. Auwaerter. In addition, George U. Sauter, leader of Vanguard\'s quantitative equity group and manager of the $65.7 billion Vanguard 500 Index Fund, was given added duties, becoming the firm\'s chief investment officer, a new position. Despite its persistent warnings, Vanguard\'s bond offerings netted more than $23.7 billion last year, compared with $14.3 billion for its stock funds, according to fund consultants Financial Research Corp. The $28.9 billion Vanguard GNMA Fund, for example, netted a combined $11.3 billion in 2001 and 2002, according to FRC. The fund has averaged a 9% annual gain over the past three years, compared with a 15% annual loss for the Standard &Poor\'s 500-stock index, according to researcher Morningstar Inc. Meanwhile, the Vanguard Inflation-Protected Securities Fund, which was launched at the end of June 2000, has already $3.5 billion in assets, nearly three times the size of the average taxable bond fund.

89,2003-03-18,"['WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged, but, in an unusual move, declined to give any hint of what it was likely to do next -- a sign of how the conflict with Iraq has muddied the outlook. The Federal Open Market Committee left its target for the federal-funds rate at 1.25%; the rate is charged on overnight loans between banks. But the Fed didn\'t give its usual assessment of whether future risks to the economy were tilted toward inflation, economic weakness, or were balanced between the two. Instead, it said it couldn\'t ""usefully characterize the current balance of risks"" until geopolitical uncertainties lifted. A new Wall Street Journal/NBC poll taken after President Bush\'s speech to the nation on Monday night showed the American public equally uncertain about war\'s economic effects. A 44% plurality said military action in Iraq would have a negative effect on the economy, while 40% said it would have a positive effect. The remaining 16% envisioned no effect or weren\'t sure. The Fed\'s unusual decision reflected the huge role that central-bank officials believe war with Iraq will play in determining how the economy performs. The Fed said in a statement accompanying its decision that economic data have been ""mixed"" and jobs data ""disappointing."" But it stuck to the view it has held since September that it was the Iraq situation that is holding back the economy. ""The hesitancy of the economic expansion appears to owe importantly to oil-price premiums and other aspects of geopolitical uncertainties,"" the Fed said. ""As those uncertainties lift . . . the accommodative stance of monetary policy, coupled with ongoing growth in productivity, will . . . engender an improving economic climate over time."" Last month, Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan told Congress that only after uncertainties related to Iraq lifted would the central bank know if something else was holding back growth, requiring more interest-rate cuts. With war likely at any time, Fed officials apparently decided they could wait a bit longer for an answer. If the war goes badly, stocks plummet, oil prices soar, or a wave of terrorist attacks strike the U.S., the Fed could cut rates immediately. It said that ""in the current circumstances, heightened surveillance is particularly informative."" Still, markets lowered the odds of a rate cut on or before the Fed\'s next meeting on May 6. Economists had expected the Fed to shift the balance of risks toward weakness from neutral, and some expected a quarter-percentage-point rate cut. Many also had expected the Fed to say it would ""closely monitor"" economic developments, words that foreshadowed rate cuts it made between its regularly scheduled meetings in January and April of 2001. The Fed, in effect, signaled its readiness to cut rates without cementing such an expectation. Indeed, officials are far less certain than they were in 2001 that their next move is to lower rates. When the fed-funds rate was cut to 1.25% from 1.75% last November, Mr. Greenspan described it as insurance against the ""quite small"" possibility that the economy was poised for ""significant decline."" Tom Gallagher, policy analyst at investment research firm ISI Group, said the Fed\'s willingness to cut now is much more conditional on events, such as the outcome of war with Iraq. There was also speculation that the omission of the balance of risks reflected disagreement among Fed officials about how weak the economy is and the urgency of rate cuts. Indeed, some Fed officials disagree with Mr. Greenspan that war worries are behind the economy\'s woes; they suspect something else, perhaps the burst stock bubble and excess investment of the 1990s. If the war goes well and the economy still doesn\'t show the expected rebound, officials will be ready to cut rates, and probably by a half percentage point. ""I think there was some disagreement"" on where the risks are, said Deutsche Bank chief U.S. economist Peter Hooper, and the Fed came up with ""an innovative response to a sticky problem."" Indeed, the Fed\'s 12 voting policy makers were unanimous in their decision. But omitting the bias was also a recognition of reality. Ordinarily, policy makers have a forecast and can quantify where and what the risks to that forecast are. With so much riding on the unknown outcome of the war, however, officials evidently didn\'t feel confident about any forecast or the risks to it. --- Journal Link: See the full text of the Federal Reserve\'s statement, in the Online Journal at WSJ.com/JournalLinks.

90,2003-03-18,"[""WASHINGTON, March 18 -- The Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged today, but it also departed from its standard practice by saying that the uncertainties about Iraq were so great that it could not assess the risks of an economic downturn. It was the first time that the Fed has refused to comment on the ''balance of risks'' between inflation and recession since February 2000, when it began announcing the assessment after every decision on monetary policy. The decision leaves the benchmark federal funds rate on overnight loans between banks at 1.25 percent, the lowest in 41 years. But many analysts and traders had been expecting a broad hint about the Fed's willingness to pump money into the system if the economic news did not improve. In a statement after the meeting of its Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed said, ''In light of the unusually large uncertainties clouding the geopolitical situation, the committee does not believe it can usefully characterize the current balance of risks.'' Today's decision reinforces previous statements by Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, that the economy's weakness stems primarily from jitters leading up to a war with Iraq and that the outlook will improve once the issues are resolved. The Federal Reserve acknowledged that recent economic signals have been ''mixed'' and that unemployment is ''disappointing.'' But it said the sluggishness of economic recovery ''appears to owe importantly to oil price premiums and other aspects of geopolitical uncertainties.'' Once those ''uncertainties lift,'' it said, the current monetary policy should be ''sufficient to engender an improving economic climate over time.'' In a hint that it could still move quickly if necessary, the Fed said that ''heightened surveillance is particularly informative.'' That appeared to be a more nebulous and detached reformulation of statements in the past that it would ''closely monitor'' events, a phrase that analysts have come to interpret as preannouncing a rate cut. ''Mystifying,'' said Robert S. Gay, a strategist at Commerzbank Securities in New York. ''They have completely left the door open to anything they want to do.'' Others said the statement simply reflected the unknowns posed by the Iraq situation. ''The Fed is flying blind, like the rest of us,'' said Robert J. Barbera, chief economist at ITG/Hoenig. Fed officials are hoping that a war will be extremely short, that oil prices will drop quickly and that financial markets will enjoy an extended ''relief rally'' as a result of the end of waiting. By contrast, many private economists have become increasingly worried that war anxieties are not the only problem dragging down the economy, and they pointed to several disturbing signs. The government reported today that housing starts fell by 11 percent last month, the steepest one-month drop since 1994, though part of that decline was a result of the heavy snowstorms in the eastern part of the nation last month. But retail sales are slumping, manufacturing continues to be stagnant and the number of unemployed workers jumped by 308,000 people last month. Surveys of businesses by the Federal Reserve's regional banks have also been bleak. The Fed's beige book, a compilation of anecdotal reports from around the country, described consumer spending as weak, manufacturing activity as lackluster, business spending as quite soft, and hiring policies as cautious. The nation's factories are running at just 75 percent of capacity, well below normal. On Monday, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York reported a significant deterioration in conditions facing manufacturers in New York. One quarter of manufacturers in the survey said conditions had worsened, while another 50 percent said conditions had not improved from the existing weak levels. Given the breadth of discouraging news, some economists worried today that the Federal Reserve was being too sanguine about the effect of that war jitters were having on economic growth. ''Given the degree of softness in the data, that's an awfully big counterweight that they must have,'' said Robert V. DiClemente, chief United States economist at Salomon Smith Barney. Mr. Greenspan is expected to pay extremely close attention to the trend in oil prices, which have declined over the last week but are still hovering above $30 a barrel, an unusually high level. Analysts say Mr. Greenspan will also pay special heed to the stock market, insofar as it offers an early indicator of increased investor confidence. Futures traders also appeared baffled about the Fed's intentions. In Chicago, prices on fed funds futures -- which are essentially a bet about the future direction of the benchmark interest rate -- jumped erratically after today's announcement but eventually settled at prices that imply a 25 percent chance of a rate cut in April. The Open Market Committee, which sets monetary policy, is not scheduled to meet again until May. But Mr. Greenspan can convene an impromptu session, linking the committee's members by telephone, any time before then.""]","[""washington, march 18 -- the federal reserve left interest rates unchanged today, but it also departed from its standard practice by saying that the uncertainties about iraq were so great that it could not assess the risks of an economic downturn. it was the first time that the fed has refused to comment on the ''balance of risks'' between inflation and recession since february 2000, when it began announcing the assessment after every decision on monetary policy. the decision leaves the benchmark federal funds rate on overnight loans between banks at 1.25 percent, the lowest in 41 years. but many analysts and traders had been expecting a broad hint about the fed's willingness to pump money into the system if the economic news did not improve. in a statement after the meeting of its federal open market committee, the fed said, ''in light of the unusually large uncertainties clouding the geopolitical situation, the committee does not believe it can usefully characterize the current balance of risks.'' today's decision reinforces previous statements by alan greenspan, the fed chairman, that the economy's weakness stems primarily from jitters leading up to a war with iraq and that the outlook will improve once the issues are resolved. the federal reserve acknowledged that recent economic signals have been ''mixed'' and that unemployment is ''disappointing.'' but it said the sluggishness of economic recovery ''appears to owe importantly to oil price premiums and other aspects of geopolitical uncertainties.'' once those ''uncertainties lift,'' it said, the current monetary policy should be ''sufficient to engender an improving economic climate over time.'' in a hint that it could still move quickly if necessary, the fed said that ''heightened surveillance is particularly informative.'' that appeared to be a more nebulous and detached reformulation of statements in the past that it would ''closely monitor'' events, a phrase that analysts have come to interpret as preannouncing a rate cut.

92,1989-05-16,"['NEW YORK -- Both the stock and dollar rallies fizzled while bond prices marked time ahead of more inflation data. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 10.44 points to 2453.45 in moderate trading, ending a three-day rise of more than 97 points. Intervention by the Federal Reserve helped lower the dollar from its 29-month high. Long-term bond prices were up modestly. Traders said they had expected a temporary halt to the stock market\'s feverish rally as some investors took profits. But they pointed out that the decline was held in check by continued buying interest from other investors fearful of missing any further gains. ""People are beginning to look at the market more positively,"" said Harold MacKinney, head of the investment policy committee at Fleet National Bank in Providence, R.I. ""Their cash hoards are making them nervous, and they\'ve been looking for something to buy."" Investors bid bond prices higher despite concern about what the consumer price index will disclose about inflation tomorrow. The average estimate calls for consumer prices in April to have risen about 0.6%, or an annual rate of more than 7.2%. But bond traders hope that the surprisingly low 0.4% increase in wholesale prices in April may set the stage for more modest consumer price increases, too. Bond traders looking for signs the Federal Reserve is easing were disappointed yesterday. Although the Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed\'s policy-making arm, met to set short-term monetary goals, government officials said it is still too early to begin easing interest rates. Most analysts expect the Fed to wait for more evidence the economy is slowing before making any policy change.

93,1997-08-19,"[""WASHINGTON, Aug. 19 -- The Federal Reserve voted today to leave interest rates unchanged, continuing a remarkable economic experiment in which the central bank has kept interest rates low despite shrinking unemployment and unusually strong economic growth. Today's meeting of the Fed's policy-making committee was the third consecutive time that the central bank has passed up a chance to raise short-term interest rates. The last increase in the key short-term rate that the Fed controls came in March, a quarter-point rise, to 5.50 percent. The Fed's action today was no surprise. A wide variety of recent economic measurements have shown that inflation remains at barely noticeable levels, below an annual rate of 2 percent in the first half of the year. That is the lowest inflation rate since the early 1960's, and wholesale prices have declined this year, the first time that has happened in more than four decades. But the Federal Reserve's job is to anticipate economic trends and to act on such assumptions months in advance. So its decision today to hold its fire may only spur arguments over whether it is missing signs that wages and prices will increase toward the end of this year or in the beginning of 1998. So far, such evidence is scant. But the concessions made by the United Parcel Service to striking teamsters late Monday, hours before the Federal Open Market Committee met here, are bound to figure in those arguments in coming months. Some economists were already suggesting today that the wage increases won by the union could signal the end of a remarkable period during which companies have been hard pressed to find qualified new workers, yet there has been little effective pressure from workers for higher wages. Other economists, however, suggested today that the teamsters' gains were more symbolic than precedent-setting, and that global overcapacity, particularly in the production of automobiles, would keep prices down even if companies were forced to pay their workers somewhat more. The U.P.S. agreement would raise average hourly wages over the life of the five-year contract for full-time workers by $3.10, to $23, and for part-time workers by $4.10, to $15. As usual, the Fed did not explain its reasoning today, simply announcing that the Federal Open Market Committee had met and adjourned. But that was enough to help extend this week's rebound on Wall Street. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 114.74 points, closing at 7,918.10. Taken together with Monday's gains, the index is now up 223 points from Friday, when it lost 247 points in a broad-ranging selloff. The stock market's potential reaction may have had some influence on today's decision to hold interest rates steady. The chairman of the Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan, has made no secret of his fear that the air could come out of the high-flying market too quickly; that may have been why he declined last month, in Congressional testimony, to repeat his warning that investors risked ''irrational exuberance.'' Among economists and traders, there has been widespread speculation in recent weeks that Mr. Greenspan now fears that even a modest increase in interest rates could bring about the selloff he has been trying to avoid. ''Clearly, the market is overvalued,'' said Sung Won Sohn, chief economist at the Norwest Corporation. ''And with everyone this jittery and unsure, it would have been a very, very poor time to raise rates.'' But Mr. Sung is among those predicting that rates may rise modestly after the Open Market Committee's next meeting, on Sept. 30. ''By that time, there will be more evidence about growth in the third quarter,'' Mr. Sung said. That growth figure is widely forecast to be around 3 percent, meaning that growth over the past four quarters would average around 3.6 percent. If such figures hold, the Fed will have to face anew the question of whether huge investments by American businesses in recent years -- combined with new technology, the effects of which are not easily measured -- have given the economy greater capacity for noninflationary growth than would be expected under conventional economic theories. Over the last year, Mr. Greenspan has suggested that the economy may be able to grow beyond its traditional speed limits without risking trouble. ''There is scant evidence,'' he said in an assessment in May that still applies today, ''of any imminent resurgence of inflation.'' The question is when he might decide that such experimentation has reached its limits. A few months ago, economists were predicting he would do so this month. But Mr. Greenspan has acted less like a theoretician than a pragmatist, and the indicators he surveys each day have shown little sign of change. Many of the same economists who believed that rates would be increased in July are now saying that the raise will come at the Fed's meeting in September. But whenever the Fed does decide to raise rates, Mr. Greenspan will have to marshal evidence to justify the move. He was harshly criticized in Congress for a series of increases in 1994 and early 1995, and the White House was visibly uneasy. Now, after a spate of revisionist history, Mr. Clinton's economic policy makers say those increases were vital to sustaining the current expansion. So far, both organized labor and business have insisted that no interest rate increase is necessary, a position the National Association of Manufacturers restated today. ''The Federal Reserve has acted wisely by choosing not to act at all,'' the association said in a statement. ''Clearly, there are no major cost increases in the pipeline. In fact, as these price declines feed through to the final sales level, the inflation rate should slow even further.'' The association said its own forecasts predicted that in the year 2000, inflation ''will still be in the range of 2 percent.'' 05:55 EDT August 20, 1997""]","[""washington, aug. 19 -- the federal reserve voted today to leave interest rates unchanged, continuing a remarkable economic experiment in which the central bank has kept interest rates low despite shrinking unemployment and unusually strong economic growth. today's meeting of the fed's policy-making committee was the third consecutive time that the central bank has passed up a chance to raise short-term interest rates. the last increase in the key short-term rate that the fed controls came in march, a quarter-point rise, to 5.50 percent. the fed's action today was no surprise. a wide variety of recent economic measurements have shown that inflation remains at barely noticeable levels, below an annual rate of 2 percent in the first half of the year. that is the lowest inflation rate since the early 1960's, and wholesale prices have declined this year, the first time that has happened in more than four decades. but the federal reserve's job is to anticipate economic trends and to act on such assumptions months in advance. so its decision today to hold its fire may only spur arguments over whether it is missing signs that wages and prices will increase toward the end of this year or in the beginning of 1998. so far, such evidence is scant. but the concessions made by the united parcel service to striking teamsters late monday, hours before the federal open market committee met here, are bound to figure in those arguments in coming months. some economists were already suggesting today that the wage increases won by the union could signal the end of a remarkable period during which companies have been hard pressed to find qualified new workers, yet there has been little effective pressure from workers for higher wages. other economists, however, suggested today that the teamsters' gains were more symbolic than precedent-setting, and that global overcapacity, particularly in the production of automobiles, would keep prices down even if companies were forced to pay their workers somewhat more. the u.p.s. agreement would raise average hourly wages over the life of the five-year contract for full-time workers by $3.10, to $23, and for part-time workers by $4.10, to $15. as usual, the fed did not explain its reasoning today, simply announcing that the federal open market committee had met and adjourned. but that was enough to help extend this week's rebound on wall street. the dow jones industrial average rose 114.74 points, closing at 7,918.10. taken together with monday's gains, the index is now up 223 points from friday, when it lost 247 points in a broad-ranging selloff. the stock market's potential reaction may have had some influence on today's decision to hold interest rates steady. the chairman of the federal reserve, alan greenspan, has made no secret of his fear that the air could come out of the high-flying market too quickly; that may have been why he declined last month, in congressional testimony, to repeat his warning that investors risked ''irrational exuberance.'' among economists and traders, there has been widespread speculation in recent weeks that mr. greenspan now fears that even a modest increase in interest rates could bring about the selloff he has been trying to avoid.

94,1997-08-19,"['WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve left its key short-term interest rate unchanged, amid further evidence that economic growth is moderating and prices are being held down. Yesterday\'s gathering of the Federal Open Market Committee was the third straight time that the policy makers opted not to raise rates, following a quarter-point increase in late March. And while some economists continue to argue that economic conditions -- tight labor markets and signs of greater consumer spending -- could force another rate increase this year, many analysts now believe that the central bank may stay on hold for a time. ""This is a case where the physician, having done the physical exam, finds perfect health and therefore has no need to prescribe any change in medication, diet or exercise,"" said Neil M. Soss, chief U.S. economist for Credit Suisse First Boston Corp. ""You\'ve got growth, you\'re providing jobs, there\'s low inflation -- what more could you ask?"" A string of recent data affirming that perspective has been released in recent weeks, and still more came out yesterday morning. The Commerce Department said housing starts were flat in July, keeping pace with June\'s high level but showing no signs of accelerating. Separately, the Labor Department said prices for imports fell 0.2% last month, after staying flat for two months. Low import prices -- because of the strong dollar and falling energy prices -- have been a big factor in keeping inflation low. Although the Fed decision was long anticipated by analysts, the stock market rose sharply yesterday, seeming to shake off, for now at least, the inflation fears that have dragged down prices in recent days. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended the day at 7918.10, up 114.74. Following tradition, a Fed spokesman said only that the policy makers met yesterday and had ""no further announcement,"" and Fed officials would give no explanation for their decision. The inaction means that the Fed\'s target for the federal funds rate -- the rate at which banks lend to each other overnight -- remains at 5.5%. The main question likely shaping Fed policy in the coming months is whether economic growth remains around the moderate pace of the second quarter or accelerates again to the rapid levels reached at the end of last year and the beginning of this year. Clear evidence of a pickup, most economists believe, would likely lead to inflationary pressures and force the central bank to raise rates. ""They will have to implement some further monetary restraint to rein in excessively strong demand,"" said Brian M. Jones, an economist at Salomon Brothers Inc. ""We think there will be 3% to 4% growth for the rest of the year, and that renewed acceleration of demand will hit an economy that has little slack."" But others say that, while consumer spending is increasing, companies are likely to cut back inventory spending sharply in the coming months, moderating growth. Besides, ""there are no signs of inflationary pressures"" despite the high growth rates registered earlier this year, said Mickey Levy of NationsBanc Capital Markets Inc. ""Looking forward, I see no need for the Fed to do anything through the first half of 1998."" The Fed\'s open market committee has three more meetings scheduled for this year, the next on Sept. 30. The housing sector ""is almost like the economy,"" said David Seiders, chief economist for the National Association of Home Builders. ""We feel like we\'re moving pretty much sideways at the maximum sustainable pace."" The July and June rate of new home building -- a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1,447,000 units -- marked a rebound from a May dip, but remained a bit below the pace set between February and April. Housing starts in July dipped from June in every region except for the Northeast, where business jumped 41% from the previous month. Excluding oil, import prices declined 0.1%, mainly because of a fall in computer prices. Oil prices fell 0.7%. These figures aren\'t seasonally adjusted.

96,1994-09-27,"['Prices of Treasury long-term securities fell yesterday after the Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged.   The 30-year bond fell 18/32 , to a price of 962/32 , for a yield of 7.84 percent, up from 7.79 percent on Monday and the highest since June 23, 1992. The rates on shorter-term Treasury bills fell, however, as investors sold long-term notes and bonds into less volatile three-month and six-month bills.   The market moved after the Fed announced in the afternoon that its Federal Open Market Committee has decided not to raise its target for short-term interest rates, which is now 4.75 percent. An increase would have been the sixth of this year as the Fed sought to fight future inflation by slowing economic growth.   Donald Fine, chief market analyst for Chase Securities, said because the Fed did not tighten yesterday doesn\'t mean that it will not happen. ""I suspect they\'ll hike rates a few more times,"" he said. ""The last time the Fed raised rates was on Aug. 16, and they said then it would suffice for a time.""   ""People were keyed up for the Fed to tighten at the meeting simply because capacity utilization at 84.7 percent, close to the historic inflation threshold, and thought the Fed would get nervous about that,"" Mr. Fine said.   ""Given global competition, my instincts tell me that the inflation threshold today is higher than in the past."" Equally as important, he added, is that the factory sector today is not as great a percentage of the economy as it was in the past. As a result, Mr. Fine said, ""You can\'t look at capacity utilization by itself as a guide to inflation.""   One sign of concern about inflation may have been the surge in the price of gold to over $400 an ounce just after the announcement by the Fed that it would not raise interest rates. The concern by some that the Fed was not being tough enough in its fight against inflation may have also pushed long-term yields higher yesterday, traders said. Longer maturities, which are viewed by some as a gauge of investor concerns regarding inflation, also came under pressure yesterday from the supply side, as the Treasury gets ready to sell $11 billion of five-year notes today. In addition, dealers and traders braced for more economic reports, like the August durable goods report due today, followed later this week by the second-quarter gross domestic product, new home sales, corporate profits, personal income and the Chicago purchasing management report.   Joseph V. Battipaglia, managing director of Sterling Advisors, saw the weakness in bond prices as a message to the Fed. ""The prospect of waiting another four weeks for additional economic data or more intepretations of the data has thrown the market into confusion,"" he said. ""Had the Fed come out with a defintive statement as to what they were doing and why, it would have been enough to generate a sharp bond rally,"" he said. ""The bond market doesn\'t like to be left in the dark and with the end of the quarter approaching, your certainly not going to see many buyers.""   In the market\'s wait for some indication by the Fed of its intentions on interest rates, dealers had a difficult time setting up before yesterday\'s auction of new two-year notes.   As it turned out, those who bought before the Fed made its announcement managed to make some money, said Matthew F. Alexy, a government trading strategist for CS First Boston. ""In general terms the auction was average and probably ok given some much uncertainty in the market,"" he said.   At auction the high yield for a two-year issue was 6.55 percent, up from 6.27 percent last month and the highest since 6.94 percent in July 1991.   During the early part of trading, the budget director, Alice Rivlin, was quoted on the news services as saying that the Fed had not tightened too much yet, and also saying that she sees no imminent threat of inflation. She described the Fed\'s decision on whether or not to tighten furthers a tough call.   Yesterday the Conference Board\'s consumer confidence index edged down to 88.4 in September from 90.4, slightly lower than expected. The market got a brief pop on some quick short-covering before settling lower. A poll by Reuters showed economists had expected a 90.2 September reading.

""The F.O.M.C. meeting ended at 1 P.M.,"" the statement said. ""There will be no further announcements.""   A virtually identical statement followed the committee\'s meeting in early July. At that time the committee also chose to leave short-term interest rates unchanged, while giving Mr. Greenspan explicit permission to raise them in the ensuing weeks.   Mr. Greenspan did not do so, and the committee raised short-term interest rates by half a percentage point at its next meeting, on Aug. 16. Today\'s meeting was the first one since then.   The Fed\'s apparent decision not to raise short-term interest rates today makes it likely that the interest rates that Americans pay on their credit cards, adjustable-rate mortgages and home-equity loans will also remain unchanged for the time being.   The central bank has repeatedly raised rates because of concerns that the pace of inflation, now slightly less than 3 percent a year, may soon accelerate. Some members of the open market committee fear higher inflation may lie in the future because factories are operating closer to full capacity than they have in five years, a situation that could lead people to start bidding up the prices of scarce labor and materials.   Other members of the committee worry that the Fed may have supplied too much credit to banks last year, increasing the amount of money in circulation and allowing Americans to bid up the price of gold and commodities. Both methods of analysis have produced similar conclusions in Fed officials that interest rates should rise.   Those officials who look at whether factories are operating at full capacity -- a group that is believed to include Alan S. Blinder, the vice chairman, and possibly Mr. Greenspan -- may have looked at figures issued today by the Conference Board, a New York-based research group supported by businesses, as evidence that the economy is not going to overheat soon. The Conference Board announced that its figures showed consumer confidence fell for the third consecutive month, suggesting that consumers may not be bidding up the prices for the limited output of factories any time soon.   Until this year, the Fed never issued any announcement at the end of such policy meetings, leaving investors to guess its intentions from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York\'s purchases and sales of Treasury bonds every morning. While the open market committee could theoretically have decided on an interest-rate increase this morning but decided not to announce it, this seems unlikely given the strong support that many Fed officials are expressing privately in favor of announcing interest-rate increases.   The increase in interest rates on Aug. 16 was the fifth this year, following increases on Feb. 4, March 22, April 18 and May 17. Taken together, these increases have pushed up the Federal funds rate, which banks pay each other for overnight loans, to 4.75 percent from 3 percent.   The Fed has also raised the discount rate, which banks pay to borrow money overnight from the Fed, by half a percentage point on May 17 and again on Aug. 16. The two changes have increased the discount rate to 4 percent from 3 percent at the beginning of this year.   John Lipsky, the chief economist at Salomon Brothers, said that he thought Mr. Greenspan was likely to raise interest rates before the Nov. 15 meeting of the Fed\'s policy-making committee, particularly if the Labor Department reports strong growth in employment in September. The department\'s report will be released on Oct. 7.   While the White House took no position before today\'s meeting on whether interest rates should rise, some officials, including Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen and Laura D\'Andrea Tyson, the chairwoman of the Council of Economic Advisers, have said repeatedly in recent days that they do not foresee any sharp rise in inflation in the coming months.   The Fed has come under slowly mounting pressure from businesses to slow the pace of interest rate increases or stop them entirely.   An informal survey by the National Association of Manufacturers of 81 of the 115 executives who attended a conference here on Saturday found that 40 wanted the Federal Reserve to stop raising interest rates. Another 29 executives wanted the Fed to wait until later this year or early next year before raising rates further, while only 12 executives wanted the Federal Reserve to continue raising interest rates soon.   Jerry Jasinowski, who was the Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Policy in the Carter Administration and is now the president of the Washington-based trade group, welcomed today\'s silence from the Fed.

98,1997-07-02,"['WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve left its key short-term interest rate unchanged, confirming that its fears of imminent inflation have subsided. But economists are divided over whether the central bank will still have to tighten monetary policy in the coming months to damp growth. Yesterday\'s meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee was the second consecutive time that Fed officials chose to leave monetary policy alone after pushing through a controversial quarter-point increase in the federal-funds rate in March. The Fed\'s target for the federal-funds rate, or the rate at which banks lend to each other overnight, remains at 5 1/2%. Although the inaction was widely anticipated, the stock market rallied after the decision was disclosed. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, down nearly 20 points just before the 2:15 p.m. announcement, ended the day up 73.05 points to close at 7795.38. The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond gained 12/32, or about $3.75 for a $1,000 bond, to close at 98 27/32. The yield fell to 6.71% from 6.73%. The Fed\'s decision to keep interest rates at current levels stems from two recent economic developments. First, numerous signs indicate that economic growth in the second quarter slowed from the red-hot 5.9% pace of the first period. Just yesterday, for example, the Commerce Department reported that factory orders fell 0.7% in May, reversing a 1.4% jump in April. The second trend giving comfort to the Fed has been inflation\'s moderation, despite strong growth earlier in the year and an unemployment rate below 5% -- a level most mainstream economists consider likely to trigger higher wages and prices. The main questions facing policy makers as they look ahead is how long that environment can last. In his last public comments on the economy, Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan made clear in an early May speech that he felt there was ""little slack in our capacity to produce,"" and any hints of strain on the economy\'s capacity would push him into a more aggressive anti-inflation stance. A raft of data to be released before the Fed next revisits monetary policy on Aug. 19 will help show whether the economy continues to wind down to a level Mr. Greenspan is more comfortable with, or whether it is once again skirting close to what he perceives as the edge. Today, the government gives its first detailed look at the June economy with its monthly labormarket report. A sharp increase in job growth or another drop in the unemployment rate -- now at a quarter-century low -- would likely fuel speculation that the Fed will have to lift rates next month or in September. In a recent survey of Fed watchers by Macroeconomic Advisers LLC, 11 of the 18 participating economists said they expected the Fed to raise rates again sometime during the summer. ""We\'re going to see a good rebound in personal consumption in the third quarter,"" said Chris Varvares, an economist with the St. Louis forecasting firm. ""While it\'s clear the economy has slowed from the first-quarter pace, it\'s still growing at trend or slightly above trend,"" he added. ""There\'s a very good case to be made that more tightening is in order."" Others say that growth is likely to slow enough to prevent overheating. ""I don\'t think there\'s significant pent-up demand for household durables left, and there are signs that capital-goods orders have slowed,"" said Richard D. Rippe, an economist at Prudential Securities Inc. While he doesn\'t think another rate increase is needed, he added that ""it\'s still possible because the Fed has to ask what sort of risk it wants to take."" Some analysts argue that, even if rapid growth resumes, the basic workings of the American economy have changed enough so that conditions that might have sparked inflation in the past are no longer worrisome. Mr. Greenspan himself, despite his constant public warnings of looming inflationary dangers, leans toward this camp. His decision to push up interest rates just once in more than two years shows a greater experimental flexibility than prior Fed leaders would have accepted. ""The economy is now capable of sustaining higher growth rates without higher inflation,"" said William T. Wilson, an economist with Comerica Inc. in Detroit. ""Nobody in manufacturing, nobody in the service industries has any power to raise prices,"" he added. ""Pricing power has reached an all-time low."" The Fed, as is its custom, didn\'t explain the rationale behind yesterday\'s decision. Mr. Greenspan is scheduled to give a public update of his thinking on July 22, when he gives his semiannual economic outlook to Congress. The drop in May factory orders was accentuated by a surprisingly big 0.7% drop in orders for nondurable goods, like food and paper, after a 0.8% rise in April. Orders for durable goods -- products designed to last several years, such as cars and computers -- also fell by 0.7% in May, following a 1.8% jump in April. Earlier, the Commerce Department had estimated durable-goods orders had fallen by 0.6% in May. Unfilled orders were flat in May, indicating that backlogs -- a sign of potentially inflationary bottlenecks -- aren\'t growing. All figures in the report are adjusted for seasonal factors, but not for inflation.  Here are the Commerce Department\'s latest figures for manufacturers in billions of dollars, seasonally adjusted.

99,2005-02-02,"[""WASHINGTON, Feb. 2 -- The Federal Reserve raised short-term interest rates on Wednesday, its sixth increase since June, and signaled that it intends to keep raising rates in the months to come.   The central bank nudged the federal funds rate, the rate charged on overnight loans between banks, by a quarter of a point, to 2.5 percent.   In a statement that accompanied Wednesday's decision, the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee repeated previous declarations that it could afford to raise rates at ''a pace that is likely to be measured.'' By echoing its policy statement from December almost word for word, the Fed indicated that it has not yet developed a plan to either accelerate or pause in its slow-but-steady approach to raising rates in small increments at each meeting. Policymakers also stuck to their relatively sanguine outlook on the economy, saying that growth appeared to be solid and inflation expectations were ''well-contained.''   Since starting to tighten policy, the Fed has more than doubled overnight lending rates from their near-record low of 1 percent eight months ago. Even with the latest rate increase, short-term borrowing costs are barely equal to the pace of inflation and still well below historical averages. More important, long-term interest rates for corporate bonds and home mortgages have declined in recent months.   Analysts said there was so much money available for lending that financial institutions were reducing margins on loans for relatively high-risk corporate borrowers.   ''There is so much liquidity in the marketplace that the only way lending institutions can compete is by lowering rates,'' said William Zadrozny, chief executive of Siemens Financial Services, which provides financing for business equipment and an array of other needs. ''People are reaching to employ their money.''   The Fed's decision had little impact on stock and bond markets, because investors viewed the rate increase as a foregone conclusion.   The Standard & Poor's 500 index rose slightly after the announcement, and investors continued to snap up long-term Treasury bonds in the expectation that inflation and interest rates would remain relatively low.   The confidence of bond investors continues to surprise many analysts.   The spread between interest rates for risk-free 10-year Treasury bonds and riskier corporate bonds is at its narrowest since 1998, according to data compiled by Richard Yamarone, chief economist at Argus Research, an economic consulting firm in New York.   ''It's too much money chasing too few goods,'' said Mr. Yamarone, harking back to the description of inflation originally coined by the economist Milton Friedman.   The spread between rates on 10-year Treasury bonds and corporate junk bonds -- those rated below Baa by Moody's Investors Service -- has declined from 3.01 percent in March 2001 to 1.76 percent as of last week.   Even though some Fed officials have begun to worry that rising costs to hire workers and slowing growth of productivity could fuel inflation, the central bank said on Wednesday that the upside and downside risks to both inflation and growth were still ''roughly equal.''   ''Even after this action, the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative and, coupled with robust underlying growth in productivity, is providing ongoing support to economic activity,'' the committee said in its statement.   By reiterating that monetary policy is still ''accommodative,'' the Fed signaled that interest rates had not yet reached a neutral level that neither encourages inflation nor slows down the economy.   Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Fed, has refused to say what a neutral rate would be in practice. But most analysts expect the Fed to keep raising the overnight rate until it reaches at least 3.5 percent or perhaps 4 percent.   Mr. Greenspan is expected to shed more light about the Fed's plans when he testifies before House and Senate banking committees on Feb. 16 and Feb. 17.   Fed officials face several big uncertainties as they plot their interest-rate strategy. They need to dissect conflicting pressures on inflation: Consumer prices have climbed more slowly in recent months, but last year's increase in oil prices has not yet had its full impact.   Potentially more important, Fed officials must grapple with the possibility of a slowdown in productivity growth and rising costs to hire workers.   Faster productivity growth allows the nation to produce more goods and expand more rapidly than would otherwise be possible without sparking higher inflation.   The nation's productivity soared at a pace of more than 4 percent a year in 2002 and 2003, nearly twice as fast as economists consider normal for the United States, but it slowed to 1.8 percent in the third quarter of 2004 and may have declined even more since then.   Economists say it is normal for productivity to rise in the early stages of an economic recovery, as companies try to meet rising demand for goods without adding more workers. Improvements in productivity usually slow down in the later stages of a recovery as employers pay higher wages to recruit scarce workers.   Faster productivity growth allowed Mr. Greenspan to defy conventional wisdom in the middle and late 1990's by keeping interest rates relatively low even though the economy was booming. But Fed officials are already wondering whether the pace will stabilize at the relatively strong rate of about 2.5 percent that became normal in the late 1990's.   Ben S. Bernanke, a Fed governor, gave a detailed analysis of the issue in a speech last month and cautiously sided with optimists who predict that productivity will remain at its late 1990's levels.   ''I think the productivity optimists have a good case,'' Mr. Bernanke said, citing research that showed that technological advances would continue to spread throughout the economy even if the overall pace of technological advance slows somewhat.   But William Dudley, chief United States economist at Goldman Sachs, warned last week that productivity might slow more than many analysts predict.   Among other potential drags on productivity, Mr. Dudley cited the federal government's large and stubborn budget deficits that drain capital from private investment, the need for companies to divert more money into energy-saving equipment and a slowing pace of technological change.   Mr. Greenspan appeared to signal that he remains open to both sides of this debate.   Graph tracks the percentage change in the Federal funds target rate from 2001-2004.

''even after this action, the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative and, coupled with robust underlying growth in productivity, is providing ongoing support to economic activity,'' the committee said in its statement.   by reiterating that monetary policy is still ''accommodative,'' the fed signaled that interest rates had not yet reached a neutral level that neither encourages inflation nor slows down the economy.   alan greenspan, chairman of the fed, has refused to say what a neutral rate would be in practice. but most analysts expect the fed to keep raising the overnight rate until it reaches at least 3.5 percent or perhaps 4 percent.   mr. greenspan is expected to shed more light about the fed's plans when he testifies before house and senate banking committees on feb. 16 and feb. 17.   fed officials face several big uncertainties as they plot their interest-rate strategy. they need to dissect conflicting pressures on inflation: consumer prices have climbed more slowly in recent months, but last year's increase in oil prices has not yet had its full impact.   potentially more important, fed officials must grapple with the possibility of a slowdown in productivity growth and rising costs to hire workers.   faster productivity growth allows the nation to produce more goods and expand more rapidly than would otherwise be possible without sparking higher inflation.   the nation's productivity soared at a pace of more than 4 percent a year in 2002 and 2003, nearly twice as fast as economists consider normal for the united states, but it slowed to 1.8 percent in the third quarter of 2004 and may have declined even more since then.   economists say it is normal for productivity to rise in the early stages of an economic recovery, as companies try to meet rising demand for goods without adding more workers. improvements in productivity usually slow down in the later stages of a recovery as employers pay higher wages to recruit scarce workers.   faster productivity growth allowed mr. greenspan to defy conventional wisdom in the middle and late 1990's by keeping interest rates relatively low even though the economy was booming. but fed officials are already wondering whether the pace will stabilize at the relatively strong rate of about 2.5 percent that became normal in the late 1990's.   ben s. bernanke, a fed governor, gave a detailed analysis of the issue in a speech last month and cautiously sided with optimists who predict that productivity will remain at its late 1990's levels.   ''i think the productivity optimists have a good case,'' mr. bernanke said, citing research that showed that technological advances would continue to spread throughout the economy even if the overall pace of technological advance slows somewhat.   but william dudley, chief united states economist at goldman sachs, warned last week that productivity might slow more than many analysts predict.   among other potential drags on productivity, mr. dudley cited the federal government's large and stubborn budget deficits that drain capital from private investment, the need for companies to divert more money into energy-saving equipment and a slowing pace of technological change.   mr. greenspan appeared to signal that he remains open to both sides of this debate.   graph tracks the percentage change in the federal funds target rate from 2001-2004.

The statement accompanying the rate change was almost identical to that issued after the Fed\'s meetings in December and November.

All 12 voting members of the 19-member Federal Open Market Committee, the central bank\'s decision-making body, agreed to the funds-rate increase. The Fed also raised the less-important discount rate, charged on central-bank loans to commercial banks, to 3.5% from 3.25%. Many commercial banks responded by raising their prime rate, a benchmark for many consumer and business loans, to 5.5% from 5.25%. The Fed\'s message yesterday, nearly matching its statements since November, reflects two things. One is that economic growth and inflation have behaved as expected recently. While some Fed officials were alarmed at signs of inflation in December, those fears may have been allayed as the dollar has stopped falling, commodity prices stopped rising, and anecdotal reports of businesses raising prices became less widespread. The second is the importance the Fed has put on being predictable. It has told markets it would raise rates at a ""measured"" pace. As a result, investors expect the funds rate to rise to 2.75% at the Fed\'s March 22 meeting, 3% on May 3 and to about 3.5% by year\'s end. As long as the Fed is satisfied with those expectations, it may be reluctant to change its message unless compelled to by significant shifts in the economy. Economist David Greenlaw of Morgan Stanley said in a note to clients that concerns about inflation and speculative activity are probably growing at the Fed, but ""are not yet sizable enough to alter the gradual tightening approach."" Like other analysts, he said it\'s up to Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan to elaborate on these issues when he testifies before Congress on Feb. 16 and 17. Despite the unchanged Fed statements, some important shifts are under way in how the Fed views the world, though it isn\'t clear how these moves, taken together, will affect interest rates. First, the economic expansion is clearly firmly entrenched, and in as little as a year from now, it may have used up the spare capacity left over from the 2001 recession. In an economy operating at full strength, companies will find it easier to raise prices. That prospect would keep the Fed focused on raising rates. Second, growth in productivity, or output per hour worked, has slowed. That means companies must add more workers than before to boost sales, and may try to pass the added labor cost on through higher prices. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. economist Bill Dudley wrote in a recent report that while such a slowing is normal at this stage of the business cycle, it nonetheless ""would likely lead Fed officials to push up the federal-funds rate target by more than expected."" But against those factors, interest rates are no longer abnormally low. At 2.5%, the funds rate is above inflation of 1.5%, according to the Fed\'s preferred measure (though below the 3.3% rate recorded by the better-known consumer-price index). It\'s also higher than the official rate of many foreign central banks. ""At some point the FOMC will need to alter [its] language to say that policy has become less accommodative or no longer accommodative,"" said David Rosenberg, Merrill Lynch &Co.\'s chief North American economist, in a report yesterday.

102,2005-02-02,"['NEW YORK -- The Federal Reserve\'s interest-rate increase gave the Treasury market the green light to pursue its favorite activity: flattening the yield curve. This trade favors longer-dated Treasurys such as the 10-year note and the 30-year bond over shorter-dated peers, which are more vulnerable to tighter monetary policy. The Fed\'s quarter-point increase in the federal-funds target rate sent shorter-dated Treasurys lower by the end of active trade, but investor preference for longer-dated securities pushed the 30-year bond into positive territory. Yield on the long bond exited active trade at 4.581%, its lowest closing level since July 2, 2003. Yields move inversely to prices. The similar wording of the statement accompanying the Federal Open Market Committee\'s decision to increase its federal-funds target to 2.5% enhances the popularity of the curve-flattener trade that has ruled Treasurys for months. Not only did the FOMC retain the ""measured pace"" language used to convey its intention to raise rates gradually, but the February statement was nearly identical to the one released at its last meeting in December. For traders, that meant the long end of the market still is the safest place to park funds. Longer-dated securities are more sensitive to the corrosive effects of inflation. At 4 p.m., the benchmark 10-year note was down 2/32, or $0.625 for each $1,000 invested, at 100 27/32. Its yield stood at 4.145% from 4.140% Tuesday. The 30-year bond\'s price was up 9/32 point at 112. After the Fed announcement, some banks, including J.P. Morgan Chase, Bank of America and Wachovia, raised prime lending rates, the base rates for many corporate and consumer loans, to 5.5% from 5.25%. Although many market participants had expected the Fed to stick with its measured outlook on rates, some feared the minutes from the December meeting released last month pointed to an emerging hawkish tone from the central bankers. ""The FOMC statement was more benign than some investors feared,"" said Michael Cheah, portfolio manager at AIG Sun America Asset Management in Jersey City, N.J. Glenn Haberbush, economist at Mizuho Securities in Hoboken, N.J., said additional quarter-point increases ""are to be expected at the March 22 and May 3 FOMC meetings."" With the FOMC meeting over, investors now turn to the other two big events on the calendar: the monthly employment report scheduled for release tomorrow and the bulge of new supply coming down the pipeline next week. A tally of 200,000 new jobs is forecast for January. The average monthly payroll increase for the past 12 months has been 186,000, solid but not enough to push long-dated Treasury yields sharply higher. The Treasury Department announced earlier yesterday it will sell $51 billion of new securities in its quarterly refunding next week to refund $11.44 billion in maturing issues and raise $39.56 billion. The refunding will comprise $22 billion three-year notes maturing Feb. 15, 2008, to be sold Feb. 8; $15 billion of five-year notes maturing Feb. 15, 2010, to be sold Feb. 9; and $14 billion of 10-year bonds maturing Feb. 15, 2015, to be sold Feb. 10.

105,2005-03-22,"[""A front-page article yesterday about a warning on inflation by the Federal Reserve as it raised short-term interest rates for a seventh time misidentified the government agency that reports the Producer Price Index, which measures wholesale prices. It is the Department of Labor, not Commerce.   WASHINGTON, March 22 -- The Federal Reserve raised new worries about inflation on Tuesday, setting off alarms in the stock and bond markets that the central bank might drive up interest rates faster than investors had been expecting.   The Fed nudged up short-term interest rates for the seventh time in the last year, raising the federal funds rate on overnight loans between banks to 2.75 percent from 2.5 percent. It restated its intention to keep raising them at a ''measured'' pace in the months ahead.   But in a departure from previous declarations, the central bank said there were rising inflationary pressures beyond those tied directly to the recent jumps in oil prices.   ''Though longer-term inflation expectations remain well contained, pressures on inflation have picked up in recent months and pricing power is more evident,'' the policy-making Federal Open Market Committee said in a statement.   The Fed also changed its assessment of risks to the economy. Last month, it said the risks to inflation and growth were ''roughly equal.'' On Tuesday, it said the risks ''should be kept roughly equal,'' but said its outlook was dependent on ''appropriate monetary policy action.'' That implied that the Fed might have to take tougher action.   The hawkish new language jolted investors, who immediately raised their bets on the possibility of bigger rate increase by the end of June and higher long-term interest rates.   Continuing a slide in recent weeks, the Dow Jones industrial average and the Nasdaq both dropped by 0.9 percent after the Fed announcement. The Dow, which had been approaching 11,000 not long ago, closed at 10,470.51 yesterday. [Page C1.]   Yields on 10-year Treasury bonds, which are closely tied to mortgage rates, jumped to 4.64 percent from 4.47 after the announcement. That came on top of a rise from about 4.10 percent in mid-February.   ''There's a greater prospect that they will raise faster in the relatively near term,'' said Laurence H. Meyer, a former Fed governor and now vice chairman of Macroeconomic Advisers, a forecasting firm. ''In addition, there is a prospect that the cumulative increase will be larger than expected.''   The statement came shortly after the release of new data showing that wholesale prices climbed much more slowly in February than they had in January.   The Commerce Department reported that the Producer Price Index climbed 0.4 percent in February, mostly because of a sharp run-up in oil prices. Though much less than the rise of 0.8 percent in January, the two-month gain pushed up producer prices at the fastest pace in years. Excluding energy and food, producer prices climbed only 0.1 percent.   Fed officials pay much less heed to producer prices than to consumer prices, and they have argued that oil prices have fairly little enduring impact on inflation.   But there have been other indicators of rising price pressures. Import prices, which had climbed very slowly despite a significant drop in the value of the dollar, have started to rise more rapidly. Commodity prices, measured by the Reuters-CRB index, have climbed to their highest level in 24 years.   Possibly more important to Fed officials is the increased ability of companies to pass on higher costs to customers. Fed officials were fixated on the absence of ''pricing power'' two years ago, when worries about declining prices were dominant.   The Fed's most recent beige book, a collection of anecdotal reports, said that companies across the country were facing higher supply costs but that manufacturers in many districts were ''finding it increasingly easy to pass along price increases.''   In an effort to reassure investors, the central bank once again said that it could afford to raise rates at a ''pace that is likely to be measured.'' Investors have interpreted that phrase to mean a series of quarter-point rate increases that would bring overnight rates to about 3.5 percent by the end of this year.   The Fed also played down worries about the inflationary impact of higher oil prices, which policy makers view as essentially a one-time event.   Fed officials have frequently used communications as a way to manage expectations without actually changing rates. But the central bank's tone about the underlying trend revealed a growing concern.   In January and February, the Fed said it expected underlying inflation to be ''relatively low.'' On Tuesday, it said it expected inflation to be ''contained,'' a more vague and less confident assertion. More important, it conditioned its benign outlook on inflation and growth on ''appropriate'' monetary policy -- a hint that tougher action may be required.   ''The Fed is recognizing that inflation pressures are picking up,'' said Richard Berner, chief United States economist at Morgan Stanley. ''The statement says pretty explicitly that they are committed to making sure that it doesn't pick up any further.''   In advance of Tuesday's policy meeting, analysts had been fixated on whether Fed officials would abandon any reference to raising rates at a ''measured'' pace.   Numerous Fed officials have acknowledged that they would have to drop that language at some point, because the series of rate increases would eventually bring the Federal funds rate back near a ''neutral'' level that neither stimulates nor slows down the economy.   But with inflation indicators ticking up in the recent weeks, analysts had begun to speculate that a removal of the ''measured'' language would signal a bigger rate increase, perhaps half a point.   In effect, the Fed distanced itself from its past language without quite dropping it. By keeping the language about a measured pace, but adding new cautions about inflation, analysts said the Federal Reserve had essentially retreated from the implicit promise of raising rates by only a quarter-point at a time.   Even without the prospect of inflation, Fed officials had been planning to keep raising short-term rates until they reached a neutral level.   Historically, the federal funds rate has averaged about 23/4 percentage points above the rate of inflation, according to Mr. Meyer of Macroeconomic Advisers.   But Mr. Meyer said the Federal Reserve's idea of neutral is probably much closer to 13/4 percent above the inflation rate. That would be higher than today's federal funds rate, perhaps about 4 percent.   Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, has refused to hint at what a neutral rate might be but warned last month about the dangers of ''complacency'' and expressed bewilderment that long-term interest rates had actually been falling even as short-term rates were rising.   Investors may have taken the hint. Long-term rates have been inching up since Mr. Greenspan's comments in mid-February.   ''When Greenspan is short on complacency, I would recommend to my clients that they be long on volatility,'' said David A. Rosenberg, chief United States economist at Merrill Lynch.

The committee believes that, even after this action, the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative and, coupled with robust underlying growth in productivity, is providing ongoing support to economic activity.

The rise in energy prices, however, has not notably fed through to core consumer prices.

With underlying inflation expected to be contained, the committee believes that policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that is likely to be measured.

107,2005-03-22,"['NEW YORK -- The Federal Reserve\'s admission for the first time in years of concern about inflation has solidified a truism in the Treasury market: Higher yields are here to stay. The Federal Reserve raised its key interest rate to 2.75%, and stuck to its intention to keep lifting the rate in ""measured"" increments as the economic recovery gains strength. But Treasury yields, which move inversely to prices, shot higher, spooked by the central bank\'s worry that ""though longer-term inflation expectations remain well contained, pressures on inflation have picked up in recent months and pricing power is more evident."" The statement marked the first formal admission of concern from the Fed about inflation and appears to contrast with remarks from a host of central-bank officials of late. The government bond market\'s reaction was to push prices down and yields higher, with the benchmark 10-year yield breaking above 4.60% for the first time since July 2004, as the market braced for the possibility of the Fed raising rates more aggressively than had been expected. The 10-year yield is now above where it was before the Fed started raising rates last June. The inflation concerns in the statement ""are getting us ready for a change in the risk assessment,"" said Gerald Lucas, head of agency and Treasury strategy at Banc of America Securities. At 4 p.m. yesterday, the benchmark 10-year note was down 25/32 at 95 2/32. Its yield rose to 4.627% from 4.525% Monday. The 30-year bond was down 1 4/32 point at 106 29/32 to yield 4.901% from 4.828% Monday. The warning about inflation didn\'t encourage everyone to sell Treasurys: California-based bond-fund behemoth Pimco picked up $500 million of 10-year Treasurys, managing director Bill Gross told Dow Jones Newswires in an interview. Although the purchase represents only 0.1% of the total $450 billion of assets under management at Pimco, Mr. Gross said ""it still reflects an attitude that things are better than they were."" Pimco has been an opportunistic buyer and seller of Treasurys since last year, using a broad range between 4.0% to 5.0% on the 10-year yield to locate where valuations look more or less attractive. Mr. Gross said he estimates fair value for the 10-year note is around 5.50%, but he says ongoing buying by foreign central banks will prevent the benchmark yield from reaching that mark. In fact, he said investors should brace for a tamer bear market than past experience has taught them as a result of official purchases from Japan and China as well as a Federal Reserve that has kept interest rates accommodative, despite the 1.75 percentage point cumulative rate hikes. Mr. Gross said the influence of the Fed and the Asian central banks on prices cannot be ignored. ""I wish they [Asian central banks] were out of the game and I wish the Fed were back to its standard practice in terms of higher real short term interest rates,"" he said, referring to the fact that inflation-adjusted interest rates remain historically low. The Fed\'s rate hike comes into a bond market that\'s arguably much more reflective of the Fed\'s tightening cycle than at the last policy-setting meeting at the beginning of February. Back then, the 10-year note was yielding around 4.11%; it went as low as 3.98% on Feb. 10. Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan famously dubbed the resistance of long-term yields to the pull of gravity of the Fed\'s rate hike cycle a ""conundrum,"" during Congressional testimony last month. He subsequently explained that it was ""utterly unprecedented"" for long-term interest rates to go down when the Fed was pushing short-term rates higher. The bond market paid attention, and since Mr. Greenspan mentioned his concerns, has pushed the yield on the 10-year note up over 0.6 percentage point. The Federal Open Market Committee\'s statement will likely prompt investors to push yields even higher, arguably rendering returns in the bond market more attractive for money managers who have shunned government bonds for over a year. ""I think there\'s very little doubt Greenspan intends to wake up the bond market,"" said Alan Blinder, a former Fed vice chairman who now teaches economics at Princeton University. The central bank\'s latest statement, Blinder said, ""took a big whack out of the `conundrum.\'"" ""The Fed has launched a wonderfully targeted torpedo at the bond market"" and by extension the housing sector ""in order to resolve the conundrum,"" of low long-term rates, said Dominic Konstam, head of interest-rate strategy at Credit Suisse First Boston in New York. The December three-month eurodollar future contract late yesterday was pricing in a 4.00% federal funds rate by the end of the year, up from a recent estimate of 3.75%. ""Fundamentally, the 10-year is heading above 5%,"" said Mr. Konstam. A test of last year\'s peak for the 10-year yield of 4.90%, could usher in more buyers. ""The bond market is a lot more attractive at that level versus stocks,"" said Jim Cusser, portfolio manager at Waddell &Reed in Kansas City, Mo.

108,2005-03-22,"['The dollar rose across the board, touching a one-month high versus the euro and a five-week high against the yen after the Federal Reserve lifted rates and issued a moderately hawkish statement. The dollar was modestly lower against the euro and little changed against other major currencies before the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee announced its decision. Traders had earlier brushed off a slightly above-consensus report for the February producer-price index. Yet although the Fed lifted its target rate by 0.25 percentage point to 2.75% as expected, the dollar rallied sharply after the FOMC statement noted stronger inflationary pressures. In late New York trading, the euro was at $1.3088 from $1.3170 late Monday in New York. The dollar was at 105.56 yen from 105.09 yen Monday. The dollar was fetching 1.1879 Swiss francs from 1.1777 francs. The pound traded at $1.8852 from $1.8987. Versus the yen, the euro was at 138.19 yen from 138.37 yen late Monday. Analysts said the Fed\'s statement, while it maintained its intention to lift rates at a ""measured"" pace, expressed heightened vigilance about inflation.

In its last policy meeting with Alan Greenspan as chairman, the Fed yesterday raised its short-term interest-rate target to 4.5% from 4.25% and left a free hand to his successor, Ben Bernanke, for deciding the next move. In a statement accompanying the rate increase, the Fed said, ""Some further policy firming may be needed"" to keep growth steady and inflation low -- a signal that another rate increase is still on the table. But it was less definitive than the statement after the Fed\'s Dec. 13 meeting, which said such action was ""likely to be needed."" The wording change suggests that prospects for an increase at the Fed\'s March 28 meeting and after depend on incoming economic data. The Fed expressed no alarm over a sharp slowdown in economic growth in the fourth quarter of 2005, but it remained wary of inflation. Though economic data have been ""uneven, the expansion in economic activity appears solid,"" it said. Underlying inflation ""has stayed relatively low,"" but ""possible increases in resource utilization, as well as elevated energy prices, have the potential to add to inflation pressures."" The shift in language coincided with the end of Mr. Greenspan\'s 18 1/2-year tenure at the central bank, during which the U.S. economy experienced the longest expansion on record and just two mild recessions. At the start of yesterday\'s meeting, Mr. Greenspan was greeted by a standing ovation by other Fed policy makers. Afterward, he went to a lunch reception attended by 180 Fed staff and policy makers. They presented him with a chair with his nameplate from the Fed\'s board room, a baseball glove signed by each of the 12 reserve-bank presidents, and the Fed flag that had flown over the building during the meeting. ""I know this institution will go on doing extraordinary things, and I will look on from the sidelines and cheer,"" Mr. Greenspan said, according to a Fed official. After that, he went to a reception in the atrium of the Fed with about 1,500 retirees and staff. ""We have a very special mission,"" he told them. ""We are in charge of the nation\'s currency, and the central bank, because of that, is involved in everyone\'s daily lives. We are the guardians of their purchasing power."" The 79-year-old Mr. Greenspan plans to set up a consulting firm in Washington, give speeches and write a book. As the Fed meeting ended, the U.S. Senate voted overwhelmingly to confirm Ben Bernanke to succeed Mr. Greenspan. Mr. Bernanke, 52, was most recently chairman of President Bush\'s Council of Economic Advisers. He was a Fed governor from 2002 to 2005. He is to be sworn in at 9 a.m. today. Yesterday\'s decision to raise the target for the federal-funds rate, charged on overnight loans between banks, was unanimous among the 10 voting members of the 17-member Federal Open Market Committee.

Still, with yesterday\'s statement, the Fed signaled that its recent period of exceptionally clear guidance is ending.

For borrowers with floating-rate debt, such as some types of home-equity loans, the Fed\'s 14th consecutive rate increase spells higher interest payments. Commercial banks yesterday began to raise the prime rate, the benchmark rate for certain types of corporate and consumer credit, to 7.50% from 7.25%. At 4 p.m., the benchmark 10-year note was up 3/32 point, or 93.8 cents per $1,000 face value, at 99 26/32. Its yield fell to 4.523% from 4.533% Monday, as yields move inversely to prices. The two-year note lost 1/32 to 99 23/32 to yield 4.528% as short-term interest-rate futures see odds of 80% that the federal-funds rate will rise to 4.75% from the current 4.50%. In what was Alan Greenspan\'s final day as Fed chairman, the Federal Open Market Committee, as expected, raised the federal-funds rate by a quarter-percentage point. The Senate yesterday confirmed Ben Bernanke as Mr. Greenspan\'s successor. Market attention focused on the changes in the accompanying policy statement, which were in line with expectations. The statement omitted the word ""measured"" to describe future policy changes and said that further rate increases ""may be needed"" to keep inflation in check and growth on track. The policy statement reflects the uncertainty over how the FOMC will end its series of rate increases, which began in June 2004 when the federal-funds rate was 1%. ""They have to tread carefully, they don\'t need to raise rates so they become restrictive as there is no inflation, so they are fumbling for a neutral funds rate,"" said Dominic Konstam, head of interest-rate strategy at Credit Suisse First Boston in New York. Still, with the Fed showing a ""bias to tighten policy,"" the funds rate could easily reach 5% or higher, he added. The FOMC statement changes little in terms of investment strategies, which along with future Fed interest-rate moves will remain highly dependent on coming economic data for direction. ""From the fed funds to the two-year note out to the 10-year note, you\'ve got rates that are virtually on top of each other,"" said Colin Lundgren, a portfolio manager at RiverSource Investments in Minneapolis, which has about $100 billion in fixed income under management.

111,2006-01-31,"[""WASHINGTON, Jan. 31 -- Stepping down on Tuesday after 18 years as steward of the nation's economy, Alan Greenspan left his successor a wide berth to set his own policy but some major uncertainties about the future.   Acting with almost choreographic precision, Mr. Greenspan wrapped up his last big initiative as chairman of the Federal Reserve less than an hour before the Senate confirmed Ben S. Bernanke as his successor.   On his last day at the Fed, Mr. Greenspan pushed through one more small increase in short-term interest rates, to 4.50 percent, and signaled that the current series of rate rises was nearing an end.   That gave Mr. Bernanke, a highly respected monetary economist who is to be sworn in on Wednesday, considerable freedom to make his own mark on an economy that performed much better during most of the Greenspan era than many experts thought possible when he took over at the Fed in 1987.   But the handoff also meant that Mr. Bernanke would face murkier choices at a time of substantial risks that increase the chances for serious missteps.   Laurence H. Meyer, a former Fed governor and now a top forecaster at Macroeconomic Advisers, remarked: ''The challenge is in making day-to-day policy at a time when mistakes are most likely to be made. We are close in many ways to a soft landing. But that's really a razor's edge.''   He and other specialists saw a variety of such challenges.   The nation's housing market, which was propelled by low interest rates to something of a frenzy in recent years, is poised for a slowdown that many economists fear could chill the broader economy.   The United States current-account deficit -- the gap between what Americans spend and what they produce in goods and services -- soared well past $700 billion in 2005 and requires about $2 billion a day in new foreign financing. The federal budget deficit has also been on an upward path.   Energy prices, which declined during most of Mr. Greenspan's tenure, have climbed back to new records and seem likely to remain high. And the nation's dependence on imported oil is greater than ever, a problem that President Bush addressed Tuesday night in the State of the Union address.   Wages of low- and middle-income workers are barely keeping pace with inflation, and in some places are falling behind. Wage inequality appears to be widening between the top and bottom ranks of the work force, partly because of a relentless contraction in blue-collar factory jobs.   The cross-currents in the economy, and the lack of a well-defined policy road map from this point on, will make Mr. Bernanke's new job especially difficult. He has previously served as a Fed governor and as the White House's chief economist, but is little known to most Americans and is sure to face second-guessing by some in the financial markets and some political figures.   Mr. Greenspan, in his last act as Fed chairman on Tuesday, came close to wrapping up his final major policy challenge: gradually reversing the drastic rate reductions that he had used to fight the recession of 2001 as well as the fallout from terrorist attacks and corporate scandals.   With the rate increase on Tuesday, the 14th since June 2004, the federal funds rate for overnight loans between banks is roughly in line with longtime patterns.   In a statement accompanying its decision, the Fed's policy-making committee made clear that its march to higher interest rates was almost over, but warned that it would keep its options open.   ''The committee judges that some further policy firming may be needed to keep the risks to the attainment of both sustainable economic growth and price stability roughly in balance,'' the panel, the Federal Open Market Committee, said.   But in a notable change that Fed officials have been debating for months, the policy makers, for the first time in nearly three years, dropped their reference to raising rates at a ''measured'' pace.   This change amounted to closing the last chapter of the Greenspan era at the Fed, which began shortly before the stock market meltdown in 1987, propelled the economic boom of the 1990's and endured through the shocks of terrorist attacks, corporate accounting scandals and the still-unfinished war in Iraq.   Mr. Greenspan spent much of his time after 2001 reacting to the collapse of the stock market bubble and to a battered economy by cutting interest rates to levels not seen since the 1950's.   Then he spent the last two years gradually trying to reverse the policy of cheap money that contributed to the housing boom, raised the risk of reviving inflation and threatened to add important elements of economic uncertainty. It would be his last big task, he told lawmakers early in 2004, and it would not be a ''gimme'' -- golfers' jargon for a short, all-but-certain putt.   At the moment, Mr. Greenspan seems to have lined up his shot accurately. The Fed's short-term interest benchmark is much closer to the presumed ''neutral'' rate, one that neither slows the economy nor leads to higher inflation.   Reported unemployment, at 5 percent, is back down to levels that economists once equated with ''full employment.'' Inflation, despite high energy prices, has remained tame.   In an attempt to give Mr. Bernanke as much flexibility as possible, Fed policy makers issued a statement soaked in so much ambiguity that Wall Street analysts variously described it as the end of rate increases, a warning of new ones, or something in between.   Some analysts paid attention to the statement's lack of the word ''measured'' and its wording that further rate increases ''may'' be needed rather than, as the Fed said in December, were ''likely'' to be needed. Those were hints, this argument went, that the rate increases were just about over.   Others noted that the Fed continued to warn about inflation pressures, and that it would base decisions on new data. Some took that as a warning that it was not finished.   But the Fed's most important message may have been that it wanted to stop telegraphing its policy decisions in advance, a practice it has followed for the last three years.   ''The committee will no longer give us a forward-looking statement,'' noted Sung Won Sohn, a leading economist who is chief executive of Hanmi Bank in Los Angeles. ''This also gives a lot of flexibility to Chairman Bernanke, who will give more weight to economic data as they are released.''   Mr. Bernanke, a former economics professor at Princeton University, has been a champion for years of greater openness at the Fed.   But the ambiguity of the economic outlook and the fact that the Fed is at the tail end of a basic shift in policy may mean that he takes over at a moment when the Fed becomes less open and more cagey about its plans.   As for Mr. Greenspan, he spent much of his last day at work saying farewell to the staff and receiving a cornucopia of farewell gifts.   Among his going-away gifts was an old chair from the Fed's boardroom; an old baseball glove signed by each president of the Federal Reserve's 12 district banks; a frame with 12 dollar bills, each from a separate Fed district; and the Federal Reserve's flag, which flew during the policy meeting on Tuesday.   Mr. Greenspan, 79, plans to start a consulting firm in Washington but has promised that he will not comment on monetary policy.   ''I know this institution will go on doing extraordinary things,'' he said at lunch with other Fed board members. ''I will look on from the sidelines and cheer.''

''this also gives a lot of flexibility to chairman bernanke, who will give more weight to economic data as they are released.''   mr. bernanke, a former economics professor at princeton university, has been a champion for years of greater openness at the fed.   but the ambiguity of the economic outlook and the fact that the fed is at the tail end of a basic shift in policy may mean that he takes over at a moment when the fed becomes less open and more cagey about its plans.   as for mr. greenspan, he spent much of his last day at work saying farewell to the staff and receiving a cornucopia of farewell gifts.   among his going-away gifts was an old chair from the fed's boardroom; an old baseball glove signed by each president of the federal reserve's 12 district banks; a frame with 12 dollar bills, each from a separate fed district; and the federal reserve's flag, which flew during the policy meeting on tuesday.   mr. greenspan, 79, plans to start a consulting firm in washington but has promised that he will not comment on monetary policy.   ''i know this institution will go on doing extraordinary things,'' he said at lunch with other fed board members. ''i will look on from the sidelines and cheer.''   photos: greenspan: the valedictory grin.

116,2008-04-30,"[""CORRECTION APPENDED Because of an editing error, an article on Thursday about the Federal Reserve's decision to lower a key interest rate known as the federal funds rate described it incorrectly. It is the rate at which banks lend to each other, not the rate at which the Fed lends to banks on overnight loans. (When the Fed lends to banks overnight, it uses what is called the discount rate.) CORRECTED BY THE NEW YORK TIMES Tue May 06 2008  WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve, mixing concern about the feeble economy with worries about rising inflation, reduced short-term interest rates Wednesday for the seventh time since September, while signaling a pause in any additional rate cuts for now. The Fed's action brought the federal funds rate -- the rate it charges banks for overnight loans -- to 2 percent, from 2.25 percent, the lowest level since November 2004. It defended that step as necessary to counter the ailing housing sector and the ''considerable stress'' shadowing financial markets. The move followed new indications that the economy remained fragile at best. The Commerce Department reported early Wednesday that the economy expanded only 0.6 percent on an annualized basis in the first three months of 2008, short of an overall downturn but still far from healthy. The Dow Jones industrial average, which was trading up 178 points shortly after the Fed's announcement, dropped sharply in late trading, ending down 11.81 points at 12,820.13. The new economic data and the Fed's move reflect what most Americans have been experiencing. They are spending more on gasoline and food and less on almost everything else. Their homes have declined in value, and businesses are investing less and shedding jobs. The move came with a repetition of the discord that has accompanied some of the Fed's interest rate cuts in the past, each time provoking criticism among conservative economists and other commentators. Two regional Fed bank presidents on the policy-setting committee again dissented from the decision to cut interest rates. They and many other economists have called on the Fed to shift its focus from countering a possible recession to heading off inflation spurred by the high costs of food and energy. The Fed's statement signaled that it was on the verge of doing just that, but wanted to nudge rates lower one more time to show its concern about weakness and instability in the markets and the economy at large. The Federal Open Market Committee -- comprising Fed board members and presidents of regional Federal Reserve banks -- employed careful language cues to suggest that it was finished lowering rates, for now anyway. ''The substantial easing of monetary policy to date, combined with ongoing measures to foster market liquidity,'' the committee said, ''should help to promote moderate growth over time and to mitigate risks to economic activity.'' This was widely taken to mean that the actions since last summer -- cutting the fed funds rate to 2 percent, from 5.25 percent; opening new lending facilities to banks; intervening in the fire sale of Bear Stearns; and acting generally to make it easier for financial firms to buy and sell securities -- was enough for the time being. The fact that in its statement Wednesday, the Fed also omitted references to the ''downside risks'' to the economy and to its intention to respond to those risks ''in a timely manner'' -- words used in March when rates were last cut -- was also a sign of a pause in rate-cutting. At the same time, the Fed appeared to leave itself enough room to act to stimulate the economy if the situation deteriorates. ''The Fed is leaving it up to financial markets to determine what they do next,'' said Michael T. Darda, chief economist at MKM Partners, a private equity and research firm. ''I don't know if we call this a hint of a pause. It was more like a soft gesture.'' Two anti-inflation hawks on the Open Market Committee -- Richard W. Fisher, president of the Dallas Fed, and Charles I. Plosser, president of the Philadelphia Fed -- voted against lowering the rates, as they had last month when the rates were cut to 2.25 percent, from 3 percent. But some economists skeptical about the need to stimulate the economy, and sharing the Fed dissenters' concerns about inflation, said that by itself the latest Fed action would not have much of an impact. ''I think it will do little good in terms of economic expansion and the credit market's problems,'' said Martin Feldstein, professor of economics at Harvard and president of the National Bureau of Economic Research. ''I think it will exacerbate somewhat the commodity price boom,'' he added. ''It would be better not to do it than do it. But if they feel they have to do it one more time and quit, that wouldn't be the end of the world.'' The latest step by the Fed follows a period of aggressive rate cuts, but also a time of mixed signals and what some say have been missteps. In October, for example, the Fed said ''the upside risks to inflation'' had to be balanced against ''the downside risks to growth.'' Shortly thereafter, in a somewhat embarrassing reversal, the losses from bad housing loans among banks and institutions in Europe and the United States forced the Fed to cast its inflationary fears aside and inject more funds into the markets. The most recent crisis culminated in mid-March with the Fed's taking an extraordinary role in arranging the sale of the investment firm Bear Stearns to JPMorgan Chase. The Fed accepted $29 billion in mortgage-related securities of uncertain value as collateral in the deal, averting what Ben S. Bernanke, the Fed chairman, said was the possibility of a global financial panic. Some critics of the Fed's policies of the last few years say it has been too quick to respond to momentary economic trends, and overly sensitive to fears of a recession. Its policies of ever-lower interest rates have contributed to the decline in the value of the dollar as investors have bought higher-yielding government securities in Europe and is seen by some analysts as sowing the seeds of higher inflation in the future. ''My view is that the Fed is back doing the silly things it did in the 1970s, of trying to make judgments that have long-term consequences based on short-term data,'' said Allan H. Meltzer, professor of political economy at Carnegie Mellon University. ''This is the most exaggerated economic downturn in my 50 years of watching Fed policy,'' he said, adding that the housing crisis has hit hard in only about five states, whereas higher food and energy prices pose a danger of inflation spreading throughout the country. But many other analysts said that they shared the Fed's concerns that the chances of a recession remained paramount and that the Fed should be careful not to let down its guard. ''The Fed's statement today was not as clear as it could have been,'' said Nouriel Roubini, professor of economics at the Stern Business School at New York University. ''You could read it as them moving into neutral. But it also signals that if monetary and fiscal policy does not lead to the expected effect, they could be back, cutting rates again.'' The Fed did not mention fiscal policy, but one reason for the pause in rate-cutting, many experts say, is that the central bank -- like the Treasury Department -- is watching to see the effects of the $168 billion economic stimulus package enacted this year. Rebate checks, part of the package, began going out this week. Democrats and Republicans, meanwhile, have increasingly accused each other of inaction over possible further steps on the economy. President Bush is demanding that Democrats extend his tax cuts indefinitely beyond their scheduled expiration at the end of 2010, while Democrats are resisting that move and pressing for an additional $30 billion in spending.

(when the fed lends to banks overnight, it uses what is called the discount rate.) corrected by the new york times tue may 06 2008  washington -- the federal reserve, mixing concern about the feeble economy with worries about rising inflation, reduced short-term interest rates wednesday for the seventh time since september, while signaling a pause in any additional rate cuts for now. the fed's action brought the federal funds rate -- the rate it charges banks for overnight loans -- to 2 percent, from 2.25 percent, the lowest level since november 2004. it defended that step as necessary to counter the ailing housing sector and the ''considerable stress'' shadowing financial markets. the move followed new indications that the economy remained fragile at best. the commerce department reported early wednesday that the economy expanded only 0.6 percent on an annualized basis in the first three months of 2008, short of an overall downturn but still far from healthy. the dow jones industrial average, which was trading up 178 points shortly after the fed's announcement, dropped sharply in late trading, ending down 11.81 points at 12,820.13. the new economic data and the fed's move reflect what most americans have been experiencing. they are spending more on gasoline and food and less on almost everything else. their homes have declined in value, and businesses are investing less and shedding jobs. the move came with a repetition of the discord that has accompanied some of the fed's interest rate cuts in the past, each time provoking criticism among conservative economists and other commentators. two regional fed bank presidents on the policy-setting committee again dissented from the decision to cut interest rates. they and many other economists have called on the fed to shift its focus from countering a possible recession to heading off inflation spurred by the high costs of food and energy. the fed's statement signaled that it was on the verge of doing just that, but wanted to nudge rates lower one more time to show its concern about weakness and instability in the markets and the economy at large. the federal open market committee -- comprising fed board members and presidents of regional federal reserve banks -- employed careful language cues to suggest that it was finished lowering rates, for now anyway. ''the substantial easing of monetary policy to date, combined with ongoing measures to foster market liquidity,'' the committee said, ''should help to promote moderate growth over time and to mitigate risks to economic activity.'' this was widely taken to mean that the actions since last summer -- cutting the fed funds rate to 2 percent, from 5.25 percent; opening new lending facilities to banks; intervening in the fire sale of bear stearns; and acting generally to make it easier for financial firms to buy and sell securities -- was enough for the time being. the fact that in its statement wednesday, the fed also omitted references to the ''downside risks'' to the economy and to its intention to respond to those risks ''in a timely manner'' -- words used in march when rates were last cut -- was also a sign of a pause in rate-cutting. at the same time, the fed appeared to leave itself enough room to act to stimulate the economy if the situation deteriorates. ''the fed is leaving it up to financial markets to determine what they do next,'' said michael t. darda, chief economist at mkm partners, a private equity and research firm. ''i don't know if we call this a hint of a pause. it was more like a soft gesture.'' two anti-inflation hawks on the open market committee -- richard w. fisher, president of the dallas fed, and charles i. plosser, president of the philadelphia fed -- voted against lowering the rates, as they had last month when the rates were cut to 2.25 percent, from 3 percent. but some economists skeptical about the need to stimulate the economy, and sharing the fed dissenters' concerns about inflation, said that by itself the latest fed action would not have much of an impact. ''i think it will do little good in terms of economic expansion and the credit market's problems,'' said martin feldstein, professor of economics at harvard and president of the national bureau of economic research. ''i think it will exacerbate somewhat the commodity price boom,'' he added. ''it would be better not to do it than do it. but if they feel they have to do it one more time and quit, that wouldn't be the end of the world.'' the latest step by the fed follows a period of aggressive rate cuts, but also a time of mixed signals and what some say have been missteps. in october, for example, the fed said ''the upside risks to inflation'' had to be balanced against ''the downside risks to growth.'' shortly thereafter, in a somewhat embarrassing reversal, the losses from bad housing loans among banks and institutions in europe and the united states forced the fed to cast its inflationary fears aside and inject more funds into the markets. the most recent crisis culminated in mid-march with the fed's taking an extraordinary role in arranging the sale of the investment firm bear stearns to jpmorgan chase. the fed accepted $29 billion in mortgage-related securities of uncertain value as collateral in the deal, averting what ben s. bernanke, the fed chairman, said was the possibility of a global financial panic. some critics of the fed's policies of the last few years say it has been too quick to respond to momentary economic trends, and overly sensitive to fears of a recession. its policies of ever-lower interest rates have contributed to the decline in the value of the dollar as investors have bought higher-yielding government securities in europe and is seen by some analysts as sowing the seeds of higher inflation in the future. ''my view is that the fed is back doing the silly things it did in the 1970s, of trying to make judgments that have long-term consequences based on short-term data,'' said allan h. meltzer, professor of political economy at carnegie mellon university. ''this is the most exaggerated economic downturn in my 50 years of watching fed policy,'' he said, adding that the housing crisis has hit hard in only about five states, whereas higher food and energy prices pose a danger of inflation spreading throughout the country. but many other analysts said that they shared the fed's concerns that the chances of a recession remained paramount and that the fed should be careful not to let down its guard. ''the fed's statement today was not as clear as it could have been,'' said nouriel roubini, professor of economics at the stern business school at new york university. ''you could read it as them moving into neutral. but it also signals that if monetary and fiscal policy does not lead to the expected effect, they could be back, cutting rates again.'' the fed did not mention fiscal policy, but one reason for the pause in rate-cutting, many experts say, is that the central bank -- like the treasury department -- is watching to see the effects of the $168 billion economic stimulus package enacted this year. rebate checks, part of the package, began going out this week. democrats and republicans, meanwhile, have increasingly accused each other of inaction over possible further steps on the economy. president bush is demanding that democrats extend his tax cuts indefinitely beyond their scheduled expiration at the end of 2010, while democrats are resisting that move and pressing for an additional $30 billion in spending. photos: ben s. bernanke, the fed chairman, arrived for the open market committee meeting in washington on wednesday.

118,1998-12-22,"[""WASHINGTON, Dec. 22 -- The Federal Reserve voted today to hold interest rates steady, judging that three rate reductions in the fall had given the economy a big enough kick to keep it growing at a healthy pace into the new year. The central bank's decision to shift monetary policy into neutral is the latest sign that the sense of crisis felt by economic policy makers in the United States and worldwide over the summer is easing. Although analysts still expect the American economy to slow substantially in 1999, perhaps enough to require further rate cuts next year, the continuation of the nation's long expansion no longer appears to be in any immediate danger. Neither the impeachment of President Clinton nor the military attack on Iraq dented the confidence of investors on Wall Street or shoppers in the malls. Growth in the current quarter appears robust. Fears of a credit squeeze in the bond market have abated. And while manufacturers and farmers still suffer from exports lost as a result of the financial turmoil of the last year and a half, the latest trade figures suggested that the worst may be past, even for them. ''When they reviewed all the factors -- the domestic economy, credit availability and the foreign situation -- it is noteworthy that the Fed concluded this time that those factors did not look as worrisome as they had looked,'' said Maury N. Harris, an economist at Paine Webber. ''It's significant that in such a short period of time the world improved enough that they didn't feel the need to ease any further.'' Today's decision leaves the Federal funds target rate, for overnight loans among banks, at 4.75 percent and the discount rate, on loans from the Fed system to banks, at 4.5 percent. The decision to stand pat, after reducing the Federal funds rate by a total of three-quarters of a percentage point in three autumn rate cuts, had been widely anticipated, and it provoked little reaction on Wall Street. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 55.61 points, to 9,044.46; bond prices and the dollar fell. Looking into 1999, the situation abroad remains unsettled at best, creating considerable uncertainty as to the outlook for the American economy and for monetary policy. Japan has proved unable to reverse its long economic decline. Russia's debt crisis is intensifying. Emerging markets from Thailand to Brazil are vulnerable to a recurrence of the financial seizures they suffered in the last year and a half. As a result, economists said, the Fed will be watching closely for any renewed threats to stability at home and abroad, and could well begin cutting rates again in the first half of 1999. With inflation dormant and oil prices low, the Fed will have considerable leeway to cut rates to keep economic growth from falling below the level most economists think it can sustain over the long run, roughly 2.5 percent. This year the economy is likely to grow at nearly 4 percent. ''The feeling of an uncontrolled spiral in international capital markets as well as in economies in Asia and Latin America has abated a good bit,'' said Stuart G. Hoffman, an economist at the PNC Corporation. Still, Mr. Hoffman sees a good chance that the Fed could cut rates again by spring. The policy-making Federal Open Market Committee is scheduled to meet next on Feb. 2-3, and then on March 30. ''The economy will be slowing,'' he said. ''The consumer inflation rate will remain low and be accompanied by continued declines in basic commodity prices. And there will still be some mildly unsettled conditions in financial markets.'' On the other hand, a few forecasters, citing the economy's remarkable resilience and its recent history of defying predictions of an imminent slowdown, are predicting that the Fed might have to raise rates during 1999 to pinch off growing inflationary pressures. But that view remains very much in the minority. The Fed cut rates three times, by a quarter of a percentage point each time, between Sept. 29 and Nov. 17. After the last cut, though, the Fed signaled that it would probably take a time out, saying it expected financial conditions ''to be consistent with fostering sustained economic expansion.'' Since then most indicators have pointed toward faster economic growth than was anticipated a few months ago, when the financial markets were in turmoil and economists were beginning to predict the demise of a business expansion that is now almost eight years old. The strong stock market and solid increases in wages have bolstered consumer confidence and spending, more than offsetting the weakness in manufacturing. Despite a wave of corporate layoff announcements, job growth has remained strong. ''Combined with the surprising narrowing in the trade deficit, a full accounting of the data thus far for the current quarter suggests that G.D.P. is moving up in the range of 3 percent to 4 percent,'' Salomon Smith Barney economists wrote recently. But problems abroad -- including signs of economic weakness in Europe -- are likely to leave Fed policy makers wary, their report stated, adding, ''Against this backdrop, the U.S. economy remains much more vulnerable than the latest consumer and external trade data imply.''""]","[""washington, dec. 22 -- the federal reserve voted today to hold interest rates steady, judging that three rate reductions in the fall had given the economy a big enough kick to keep it growing at a healthy pace into the new year. the central bank's decision to shift monetary policy into neutral is the latest sign that the sense of crisis felt by economic policy makers in the united states and worldwide over the summer is easing. although analysts still expect the american economy to slow substantially in 1999, perhaps enough to require further rate cuts next year, the continuation of the nation's long expansion no longer appears to be in any immediate danger. neither the impeachment of president clinton nor the military attack on iraq dented the confidence of investors on wall street or shoppers in the malls. growth in the current quarter appears robust. fears of a credit squeeze in the bond market have abated. and while manufacturers and farmers still suffer from exports lost as a result of the financial turmoil of the last year and a half, the latest trade figures suggested that the worst may be past, even for them.

119,2008-08-05,"['The Morning Brief, a look at the day\'s biggest news, is emailed to subscribers by 7 a.m. every business day. Sign up for the e-mail here. The Federal Reserve\'s explanation of monetary policy yesterday struck the kind of cautious rhetorical balance more often associated with election-year politicking: simultaneous bids to assure both those who worry more about economic growth and those more spooked by inflation. In keeping its benchmark interest rate at the 2% level set in April, the Federal Open Market Committee made the kind of slight linguistic alterations that Fed watchers like to study as closely as Kremlinologists once scrutinized who stood next to whom on May Day. The FOMC still sees U.S. economic activity expanding but views softening labor markets and the persistent ""considerable stress"" in financial markets as potential threats. And FOMC members regard ""tight credit conditions, the ongoing housing contraction, and elevated energy prices"" to be just as burdensome on future economic growth as they did in June. But the FOMC moved a key part of its June and April statements from the section about its policy leanings to the part where it describes its view of the economy: ""Over time, the substantial easing of monetary policy, combined with ongoing measures to foster market liquidity, should help to promote moderate economic growth."" Meanwhile, descriptions of inflation more alarmingly expressed in the present tense in June merited less urgent syntax in yesterday\'s statement. ""Inflation has been high, spurred by the earlier increases in the prices of energy and some other commodities, and some indicators of inflation expectations have been elevated,"" the Fed said. And ""the committee [still] expects inflation to moderate later this year and next year,"" even if ""the inflation outlook remains highly uncertain."" Thus, ""although downside risks to growth remain, the upside risks to inflation are also of significant concern to the committee,"" the Fed said -- straddling the fence of conflicting economic worries as much as at any time in the recent past. Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke and his colleagues -- only one of whom voted against yesterday\'s actions out of preference for an anti-inflationary increase in the cost of borrowed money -- aren\'t alone among the world\'s conflicted central bankers. Elevated energy and food prices have stoked inflation fears everywhere, but few economies are out of the credit-crunch woods or immune to contagion from American economic ills. A German news report suggests official figures due out next week will show that country\'s economy contracted in the second quarter, as the Financial Times reports. A key reading of Japan\'s economic health fell in June, contributing to that government\'s pronouncement of a ""worsening"" view of the economy, as the Nikkei reports. In the U.S., investors nonetheless took heart from the Fed\'s statement and sent the Dow Jones Industrial Average up more than 300 points in hope, as The Wall Street Journal puts it, that ""the worst could be over for stocks."" Of course, ""this was hardly the first time since the bear market began in October that stocks have staged a strong rebound,"" the Journal notes. And it adds that skeptical investors warned ""this could be another false start,"" with a potential recession looming, housing prices continuing to fall and the financial system still in disarray. --- Cracking a Global Identity-Theft Ring U.S. authorities yesterday charged 11 people with stealing more than 40 million credit-card and debit-card account numbers off the computers systems of Barnes &Noble, TJ Maxx, Sport Authority and other retailers, in what Attorney General Michael Mukasey called ""the single largest and most complex identity-theft case ever charged in this country."" The case took three years to crack, and brought investigators to three continents, bringing home what the Los Angeles Times describes as ""the global nature of the Internet\'s underground economy as agents tracked leads from China to Ukraine and picked up suspects in Turkey and Germany as well as the U.S."" One reason it took so long, The Wall Street Journal adds, is that the man identified as the ringleader, Albert Gonzalez of Miami, had been a confidential informant for the Secret Service. ""His indictment states that during the course of his \'cooperation,\' he obtained \'sensitive\' information that he used \'to warn off conspirators and ensure that they would not be identified and arrested in the course of that investigation,\'"" the Journal reports. Mr. Gonzalez and alleged conspirators are accused of locating ""retailers\' wireless networks by driving by with a laptop with Wi-Fi installed,"" and then hacking ""into the networks and [installing] sniffer software to collect payment card numbers as well as password and account information as the data was passing through the retailers\' networks,"" Women\'s Wear Daily reports. While ""some of the data were sold to other criminals in the U.S. and in Eastern Europe,"" the ring is also accused of withdrawing ""tens of thousands of dollars at a time from ATMs using blank cards in whose magnetic strips they encoded stolen card numbers,"" the publication adds. --- Also of Note . . . New York Times: Soaring oil prices will leave the Iraqi government with a cumulative budget surplus of as much as $79 billion by year\'s end, according to an American federal oversight agency, though Iraq has spent only a minute fraction of that on reconstruction costs, which are now largely borne by the United States. The unspent windfall, which covers surpluses from oil sales since 2005, appears likely to reinforce growing debate about the approximately $48 billion in American taxpayer money devoted to rebuilding Iraq since the American-led invasion. Wall Street Journal: Citigroup is in negotiations with state and federal regulators to resolve allegations of wrongdoing in the auction-rate-securities market that could result in its buying back several billion dollars of the illiquid securities from investors and paying a sizable fine, according to people familiar with the matter. South China Morning Post: Letters written by two ethnic-Uighur men arrested on suspicion of carrying out Monday\'s attack on police in the western Chinese province of Xinjiang showed they had answered a call for holy war against China, the city\'s Communist Party chief said, in linking the pair with a banned militant group. Sixteen officers were killed and 16 injured in the attack outside a hotel and the border police barracks. Los Angeles Times: After nearly seven years of investigating, FBI officials plan to present evidence today to the surviving victims of the 2001 anthrax attacks that they believe proves a Maryland scientist launched the deadly mailings that gripped the nation in the immediate aftermath of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. Washington Post: The Bush administration joined former top CIA officials in denouncing a new book\'s assertion that White House officials ordered the forgery of Iraqi documents to suggest a link between Iraqi President Saddam Hussein and the lead hijacker in the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. The claim was made by Pulitzer Prize-winning author Ron Suskind, whose book ""The Way of the World"" also contends that the White House obtained compelling evidence in early 2003 that Iraq possessed no significant stocks of nuclear or biological weapons but decided to invade the country anyway. The Hill: Congress is poised to approve a federal apology for slavery just weeks before voters consider electing the nation\'s first black president. When the Senate takes up the issue in September, it could address a centuries-old wound at a time when the presidential contest is already focused on race. At the same time, it could also play a major role in Senate politics, with a handful of white, Southern Republicans facing tough re-election challenges in a year when record turnout is expected among black voters. Le Monde: A Rwandan investigating commission yesterday accused the French government of being aware of preparations for the 1994 genocide and even participating in the violence. Houston Chronicle: The state of Texas defied an international court and executed Jose Ernesto Medellin late last night after the U.S. Supreme Court denied a stay of execution for the killer in the 1993 Houston gang rape-murders of two teenage girls. Mr. Medellin, 33, was pronounced dead by lethal injection nine minutes after receiving the fatal cocktail and nearly four hours after his scheduled 6 p.m. execution. Dow Jones Newswires: Shares in Anglo-South African miner Lonmin opened almost 49% higher this morning after Anglo-Swiss miner Xstrata said it had launched an unsolicited takeover bid for the world\'s third-largest primary producer of platinum. Wall Street Journal: In a move that could set the stage for the sale or dismantling of a leading European maker of personal computers, Siemens has informed Fujitsu that it wants out of their nine-year-old joint venture, people familiar with the matter say. Variety: Sony became the sole owner of the world\'s second largest music company, putting it in a position to integrate music with electronics and possibly begin to offer shared rights deals with artists, after it agreed to buy the 50% stake in Sony BMG held by German media giant Bertelsmann in a deal valued at $1.2 billion. Nature: People with synaesthesia can\'t help but get two sensory perceptions instead of one, with some perceiving colors when they hear words or musical notes or read numbers; rarer individuals can even get tastes from shapes.

""inflation has been high, spurred by the earlier increases in the prices of energy and some other commodities, and some indicators of inflation expectations have been elevated,"" the fed said. and ""the committee [still] expects inflation to moderate later this year and next year,"" even if ""the inflation outlook remains highly uncertain."" thus, ""although downside risks to growth remain, the upside risks to inflation are also of significant concern to the committee,"" the fed said -- straddling the fence of conflicting economic worries as much as at any time in the recent past. fed chairman ben bernanke and his colleagues -- only one of whom voted against yesterday's actions out of preference for an anti-inflationary increase in the cost of borrowed money -- aren't alone among the world's conflicted central bankers. elevated energy and food prices have stoked inflation fears everywhere, but few economies are out of the credit-crunch woods or immune to contagion from american economic ills. a german news report suggests official figures due out next week will show that country's economy contracted in the second quarter, as the financial times reports. a key reading of japan's economic health fell in june, contributing to that government's pronouncement of a ""worsening"" view of the economy, as the nikkei reports. in the u.s., investors nonetheless took heart from the fed's statement and sent the dow jones industrial average up more than 300 points in hope, as the wall street journal puts it, that ""the worst could be over for stocks."" of course, ""this was hardly the first time since the bear market began in october that stocks have staged a strong rebound,"" the journal notes. and it adds that skeptical investors warned ""this could be another false start,"" with a potential recession looming, housing prices continuing to fall and the financial system still in disarray. --- cracking a global identity-theft ring u.s. authorities yesterday charged 11 people with stealing more than 40 million credit-card and debit-card account numbers off the computers systems of barnes &noble, tj maxx, sport authority and other retailers, in what attorney general michael mukasey called ""the single largest and most complex identity-theft case ever charged in this country."" the case took three years to crack, and brought investigators to three continents, bringing home what the los angeles times describes as ""the global nature of the internet's underground economy as agents tracked leads from china to ukraine and picked up suspects in turkey and germany as well as the u.s."" one reason it took so long, the wall street journal adds, is that the man identified as the ringleader, albert gonzalez of miami, had been a confidential informant for the secret service. ""his indictment states that during the course of his 'cooperation,' he obtained 'sensitive' information that he used 'to warn off conspirators and ensure that they would not be identified and arrested in the course of that investigation,'"" the journal reports. mr. gonzalez and alleged conspirators are accused of locating ""retailers' wireless networks by driving by with a laptop with wi-fi installed,"" and then hacking ""into the networks and [installing] sniffer software to collect payment card numbers as well as password and account information as the data was passing through the retailers' networks,"" women's wear daily reports. while ""some of the data were sold to other criminals in the u.s. and in eastern europe,"" the ring is also accused of withdrawing ""tens of thousands of dollars at a time from atms using blank cards in whose magnetic strips they encoded stolen card numbers,"" the publication adds. --- also of note . . . new york times: soaring oil prices will leave the iraqi government with a cumulative budget surplus of as much as $79 billion by year's end, according to an american federal oversight agency, though iraq has spent only a minute fraction of that on reconstruction costs, which are now largely borne by the united states. the unspent windfall, which covers surpluses from oil sales since 2005, appears likely to reinforce growing debate about the approximately $48 billion in american taxpayer money devoted to rebuilding iraq since the american-led invasion. wall street journal: citigroup is in negotiations with state and

officers were killed and 16 injured in the attack outside a hotel and the border police barracks. los angeles times: after nearly seven years of investigating, fbi officials plan to present evidence today to the surviving victims of the 2001 anthrax attacks that they believe proves a maryland scientist launched the deadly mailings that gripped the nation in the immediate aftermath of the sept. 11

suggest a link between iraqi president saddam hussein and the lead hijacker in the sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. the claim was made by pulitzer prize-winning author ron suskind, whose book ""the way of the world"" also contends that the white house obtained compelling evidence in early 2003 that iraq possessed no significant stocks of nuclear or biological weapons but decided to invade the country anyway. the hill: congress is poised to approve a federal apology for slavery just weeks before voters consider electing the nation's first black president. when the senate takes up the issue

122,2009-08-12,"[""Following is the text of the Federal Reserve's statement on Wednesday announcing it was holding its base federal funds target rate at a record low between zero and 0.25 percent: Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in June suggests that economic activity is leveling out. Conditions in financial markets have improved further in recent weeks. Household spending has continued to show signs of stabilizing but remains constrained by ongoing job losses, sluggish income growth, lower housing wealth and tight credit. Businesses are still cutting back on fixed investment and staffing but are making progress in bringing inventory stocks into better alignment with sales. Although economic activity is likely to remain weak for a time, the committee continues to anticipate that policy actions to stabilize financial markets and institutions, fiscal and monetary stimulus, and market forces will contribute to a gradual resumption of sustainable economic growth in a context of price stability. The prices of energy and other commodities have risen of late. However, substantial resource slack is likely to dampen cost pressures, and the committee expects that inflation will remain subdued for some time. In these circumstances, the Federal Reserve will employ all available tools to promote economic recovery and to preserve price stability. The committee will maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and continues to anticipate that economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period. As previously announced, to provide support to mortgage lending and housing markets and to improve overall conditions in private credit markets, the Federal Reserve will purchase a total of up to $1.25 trillion of agency mortgage-backed securities and up to $200 billion of agency debt by the end of the year. In addition, the Federal Reserve is in the process of buying $300 billion of Treasury securities. To promote a smooth transition in markets as these purchases of Treasury securities are completed, the committee has decided to gradually slow the pace of these transactions and anticipates that the full amount will be purchased by the end of October. The committee will continue to evaluate the timing and overall amounts of its purchases of securities in light of the evolving economic outlook and conditions in financial markets.

124,1998-11-17,"[""WASHINGTON, Nov. 17 -- The Federal Reserve cut interest rates again by a quarter of a percentage point today to help keep a gradual economic slowdown from turning into a recession, but the central bank signaled it might hold off on further reductions in coming months. The cut was the third in seven weeks, and like the previous two it was driven by the concern that the global financial crisis was making it hard for companies to raise money, threatening the long expansion in the United States. In reducing rates but suggesting that investors should not count on further cuts, the Federal Reserve was walking a line between calming Wall Street's fears of global turmoil and giving too much stimulation to an economy that has shown surprising resilience in the face of shocks from abroad. With the outlook for further rate cuts now uncertain, the markets reacted with ambivalence. Down 75 points just before the Fed's announcement at 2:20 this afternoon, the Dow Jones industrial average pushed 75 points into positive territory after the announcement, then fell back again and closed at 8,986.28, off 24.97 points for the day. [Page C12.] Still, the rate cuts over the last several months have helped fuel a remarkable rebound in the stock market while providing considerable reassurance to other countries. After plunging in late summer, the Dow is back within striking distance of its high of 9,337.97, amid a general sense that the worst of the global crisis may have passed. The Federal Reserve said today that it would cut the main short-term rate it controls, the Federal funds target rate for overnight loans between banks, to 4.75 percent from 5 percent. It said it would also reduce its discount rate on loans to banks from the Federal Reserve system to 4.5 percent from 4.75 percent. The move should help bolster the economy by making it slightly cheaper for businesses and consumers to borrow. Several banks quickly reduced the prime rate they charge business borrowers to 7.75 percent from 8 percent. The cut in the discount rate was something of a surprise, analysts said, and underscored the Federal Reserve's determination to deal with a credit squeeze that has eased in the last few weeks but is still pronounced by historical standards. Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, has been particularly concerned for the last several months about the jittery bond market, where investors have been shunning all forms of debt except those that are the safest and the most easily sold. ''Although conditions in the financial markets have settled down materially since mid-October, unusual strains remain,'' the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee said in explaining the cut. The statement, however, added that after three quarter-point reductions in the Federal funds rate since late September, the economy should be on more of an even keel. Financial conditions, the Fed statement said, ''can reasonably be expected to be consistent with fostering sustained economic expansion while keeping inflationary pressures subdued.'' Although some economists still think the Fed will lower rates again at its next meeting, on Dec. 22, many analysts took the statement to mean that the Fed would cut rates again  only if the markets or the economy show new signs of distress. ''It was a clever statement to break up any presumption that the Fed has to continue easing,'' said Kenneth T. Mayland, chief economist at Keycorp in Cleveland. The Fed, Mr. Mayland said, will look closely at the strength of holiday retail sales and at the stability of the financial markets. If it sees clear evidence that the economy is deteriorating, he said, the Fed will no doubt consider cutting rates again in December and may well ease them again further down the road if the economy continues to slow. But the central bank does not want to be forced into moving again in December just because the markets assume it will, Mr. Mayland said. ''The Fed's options are now open,'' he said. The central bank's policy committee met today just minutes after the Labor Department reported that inflation was negligible in October, with the Consumer Price Index rising just two-tenths of a percent. The news was presumably reassuring to Fed officials, who have seen the absence of wage and price pressures as a somewhat perplexing but welcome development that has given them considerable flexibility in responding to the global crisis. Some economists say the Fed should nonetheless pay more attention to the possibility that the combination of interest rate cuts and continued underlying strength in the economy will push up inflation next year. Mickey D. Levy, chief economist at the BankAmerica Corporation, said the financial markets were returning to normal and that companies were again lining up to sell their bonds. Growth in the money supply, a critical gauge of future inflation, is running at high levels, he said. At the same time, he said, consumption of goods and services in the United States remained robust and unemployment remained low, a traditional recipe for inflation. While Fed officials say they have been remarkably united over the last several months in their decisions to cut rates, analysts said the more strident inflation fighters within the central bank were no doubt growing nervous about taking the easing policy too far. Mr. Greenspan, however, appears to have set aside, at least for now, his concern that stock prices were getting too high. Instead he seems intent  on insuring that an incipient credit squeeze in the bond market and among banks is contained and reversed before considering the easing process complete. Maury N. Harris, an economist at Paine Webber, said the Fed might have been influenced in its decision today by the results of an unreleased survey of bank loan officers, asking whether lenders were tightening lending standards. Mr. Harris also said that while capital markets in the United States appeared to be calming down, conditions abroad remained worrisome. The American economy is also taking a hit from the global crisis in the form of reduced exports. The Commerce Department is scheduled to disclose the nation's trade deficit for September on Wednesday, and most economists are saying that exports, especially to Asia, will remain depressed, while imports in politically sensitive industries like steel will increase. The pressure being placed on American manufacturers from falling exports and increased import competition led big companies and business groups to applaud the rate cut today. Robert J. Eaton, the co-chairman of DaimlerChrysler A.G., said the rate cut was clearly ''a signal they're willing to do whatever is necessary to keep this economy moving.''""]","[""washington, nov. 17 -- the federal reserve cut interest rates again by a quarter of a percentage point today to help keep a gradual economic slowdown from turning into a recession, but the central bank signaled it might hold off on further reductions in coming months. the cut was the third in seven weeks, and like the previous two it was driven by the concern that the global financial crisis was making it hard for companies to raise money, threatening the long expansion in the united states. in reducing rates but suggesting that investors should not count on further cuts, the federal reserve was walking a line between calming wall street's fears of global turmoil and giving too much stimulation to an economy that has shown surprising resilience in the face of shocks from abroad. with the outlook for further rate cuts now uncertain, the markets reacted with ambivalence. down 75 points just before the fed's announcement at 2:20 this afternoon, the dow jones industrial average pushed 75 points into positive territory after the announcement, then fell back again and closed at 8,986.28, off 24.97 points for the day. [page c12.] still, the rate cuts over the last several months have helped fuel a remarkable rebound in the stock market while providing considerable reassurance to other countries. after plunging in late summer, the dow is back within striking distance of its high of 9,337.97, amid a general sense that the worst of the global crisis may have passed. the federal reserve said today that it would cut the main short-term rate it controls, the federal funds target rate for overnight loans between banks, to 4.75 percent from 5 percent. it said it would also reduce its discount rate on loans to banks from the federal reserve system to 4.5 percent from 4.75 percent. the move should help bolster the economy by making it slightly cheaper for businesses and consumers to borrow. several banks quickly reduced the prime rate they charge business borrowers to 7.75 percent from 8 percent. the cut in the discount rate was something of a surprise, analysts said, and underscored the federal reserve's determination to deal with a credit squeeze that has eased in the last few weeks but is still pronounced by historical standards. alan greenspan, the federal reserve chairman, has been particularly concerned for the last several months about the jittery bond market, where investors have been shunning all forms of debt except those that are the safest and the most easily sold. ''although conditions in the financial markets have settled down materially since mid-october, unusual strains remain,'' the policy-setting federal open market committee said in explaining the cut. the statement, however, added that after three quarter-point reductions in the federal funds rate since late september, the economy should be on more of an even keel. financial conditions, the fed statement said, ''can reasonably be expected to be consistent with fostering sustained economic expansion while keeping inflationary pressures subdued.'' although some economists still think the fed will lower rates again at its next meeting, on dec. 22, many analysts took the statement to mean that the fed would cut rates again  only if the markets or the economy show new signs of distress. ''it was a clever statement to break up any presumption that the fed has to continue easing,'' said kenneth t. mayland, chief economist at keycorp in cleveland. the fed, mr. mayland said, will look closely at the strength of holiday retail sales and at the stability of the financial markets. if it sees clear evidence that the economy is deteriorating, he said, the fed will no doubt consider cutting rates again in december and may well ease them again further down the road if the economy continues to slow. but the central bank does not want to be forced into moving again in december just because the markets assume it will, mr. mayland said.

125,1990-12-18,"['NEW YORK -- The dollar fell quickly late yesterday afternoon, when the Federal Reserve announced a long-awaited cut in the U.S. discount rate to 6.5% from 7%. Coming at the end of an otherwise staid trading day, the Fed\'s announcement caused traders to scurry into action, dropping the U.S. currency across the board. Late in New York, the dollar was quoted at 1.4762 marks, down from 1.4870 marks late Monday in New York. The U.S. currency was also changing hands at 132.62 yen, down from 133.15 yen in New York late Monday. Sterling was trading at $1.9430, up from $1.9305 late Monday. In midmorning trading in Tokyo Wednesday, the dollar was trading at 133.20 yen, up from 133.03 yen late Tuesday in Tokyo. The Fed said the reduction was made to address credit constraints in the weak U.S. economy and slow growth in monetary aggregates. It also was taken to realign the discount rate with market interest rates, the Fed said. With federal funds at 7 1/4%, there wasn\'t much leeway for a further relaxation of U.S. monetary policy unless the discount rate was cut. The discount rate is the interest rate the Fed charges member banks for loans, while the federal funds rate is the rate banks charge one another for overnight loans. An eventual drop in the discount rate, therefore, had been widely expected. With the Fed\'s policy-making Federal Open Market Committee meeting Monday and yesterday, many traders commented that a rate cut this week was likely, but few expected it to come yesterday. Fueling speculation of a rate cut during the day was the improved inflation picture shown by the U.S. consumer price index for November. Showing only a 0.3% rise, compared with increases of 0.6% in October and 0.8% in September, the figures were perceived as giving the Fed added maneuverability to lower rates -- leeway that had been narrowed by last Friday\'s disheartening 0.5% rise in November producer prices. Nevertheless, because of the thinness of the market, traders weren\'t bothering to risk the exposure of positioning for a potential rate cut. Before the rate reduction was announced, one New York trader commented that ""people might be thinking about {a discount rate cut} but very few people are acting on"" that suspicion. Because the Fed dropped the news into a calm, highly illiquid market, it\'s hard to gauge how sharp a sell-off the dollar ultimately will suffer, said Al Shealy, foreign exchange manager at Union Bank of Switzerland in New York. ""It\'s certainly bearish news for the dollar,"" but the dollar has withstood bearish news in the past, said Mr. Shealy. Predicting the downside potential of this one impulse is difficult, traders said. If the easier credit conditions stimulate the U.S. economy, they eventually could benefit the U.S. unit. Before the Fed stole center stage with its rate reduction, the market was serene, tucked in tight ranges and already focused on the coming holidays, traders said. The dollar had fallen slightly on an unexpectedly wide U.S. trade deficit but was supported by the market\'s nagging apprehension over a war in the Persian Gulf. ""Nobody wants to be either a hero or a goat . . . squandering everything they\'ve made all year in the last week,"" said Alfonso Alejo, assistant vice president in corporate foreign exchange at Mitsui Taiyo Kobe Bank in New York. Many participants already have closed their books for the year, content to lock in whatever profits or losses they have sustained, rather than risk exposure in the thin illiquid market.

126,1990-12-18,"['Acknowledging in effect that the American economy is in recession, the Federal Reserve sent a clear signal yesterday that reversing the decline -- rather than fighting inflation -- is now its top concern.   The signal came in the form of a reduction in the discount rate to 6 1/2 percent, from 7 percent. This is the rate the central bank charges for loans to commercial banks, but since banks rarely borrow from the Federal Reserve -- unless they are in trouble -- the discount rate has become largely a signpost for policy decisions.   The signal this time was a strong one, coming as it did as the Fed\'s top policy makers concluded one of their periodic reviews of the economy. The Fed had taken a few tentative steps recently to push down rates and thus encourage consumers and business people to borrow money to spend and invest, stimulating the economy. But the action yesterday -- the first change in the discount rate in 22 months -- was seen as an unequivocal statement that policy has changed. \'The Debate Is Over\'   ""The debate is over within the Federal Reserve,"" said Robert DiClemente, an economist at Salomon Brothers. ""Their action is a clarion call that they want rates down and they want people to borrow and spend.""   The announcement at 3:25 P.M. listed ""weakness in the economy"" as the main reason for the discount rate cut. Further evidence of that weakness came yesterday morning as the Labor Department reported that the Consumer Price Index had risen a mild three-tenths of 1 percent in November. [ Page D4. ]   Wall Street in general exulted, and so did Congress and the Bush Administration. The White House has been pressing for lower rates to avert a recession.   Within seconds of the Fed\'s announcement, the Dow Jones industrial average shot up 28 points, and it ended the day 33.41 higher, at 2,626.73. [ Page D8. ] Interest rates on Treasury securities fell, in anticipation of further steps by the central bank, perhaps as early as today, to bring down the rates that more directly affect consumer and business loans. [ Page D15. ]   At their meeting yesterday, the Fed policy makers, known as the Federal Open Market Committee, had before them recent data showing that unemployment was on the rise, industrial production had plunged, Christmas retail sales were weak and inflation had declined at last.   Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher said the cut in the discount rate ""demonstrates the intention of the Fed to assist in reinvigorating economic growth through lower interest rates."" Representative Lee H. Hamilton, Democrat of Indiana and chairman of the Joint Economic Committee of Congress, issued a similar statement, endorsing the Fed\'s action.   For weeks, Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, and most of the other policy makers had resisted using their power to reduce interest rates, largely out of concern that the higher oil prices resulting from the Persian Gulf crisis would raise the nation\'s inflation rate. The small rise in the Consumer Price Index apparently helped to convince Mr. Greenspan and his colleagues that recession had become more of a danger than the inflationary impact of the Gulf crisis.   As recently as late November, Mr. Greenspan had been reluctant in public testimony to call the nation\'s economic slowdown a recession, describing it instead as a ""meaningful downturn."" Although he apparently acknowledges the recession now, he has indicated that he expects it to be a short, mild one. Other Reductions Expected   Many analysts predicted that the discount rate cut, which is effective today, would be followed by a reduction in the Federal funds rate and a reduction in the prime rate -- the basis for rates on bank loans to favored corporate customers. Many adjustable-rate consumer loans, like mortgages and home equity loans, are also pegged to the prime, which has been at 10 percent since January.   The Federal funds rate, currently about 7 1/4 percent, is what banks and other financial institutions charge each other for loans. Since banks borrow frequently from each other, this rate is of crucial importance in determining their cost of funds. And it is a rate directly controlled by the Federal Reserve.   When the Fed allows the Federal funds rate to decline, the banks gain the leeway to reduce their prime rate and other loan rates.   Some economists contend that the Fed has waited too long to recognize the recession and take steps to fight it. The greatest concern is that even with lower interest rates, many consumers and businesses will be reluctant to borrow during a downturn that shrinks profits and endangers jobs. Additional Easing Suggested   Recognizing this problem, Henry Kaufman, an economic consultant, said, ""In this case a lot of additional easing will be needed.""   Fearing inflation, the Federal Reserve had held the Federal funds rate at 8 1/4 percent from last December until July 13, when it was lowered to 8 percent. Of the four quarter-point reductions this year, one was in response to the agreement to cut the budget deficit and another was aimed at offsetting the credit crunch -- the tendency of many banks, hurt by mounting losses from real estate loans, to restrict credit even to companies planning potentially profitable projects.   Many economists had thought the Fed would reduce the Federal funds rate more over the summer and fall, but Iraq\'s invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2 once again made inflation the top issue for Mr. Greenspan and for most other policy makers -- the five governors and the 12 presidents of the Fed\'s regional banks.   But as the economy weakened, so did the inflation rate. Except for oil prices, the Consumer Price Index rose by a mild 4 percent, at an annual rate, from September through November. Recognizing that the slowdown and credit crunch were becoming increasingly more severe -- even threatening the solvency of some banks -- the Fed reduced the Federal funds rate early this month to 7 1/4 percent and also took the unusual step of reducing the level of cash reserves that banks had to hold in non-interest-bearing accounts to make loans. But over the last two decades, the Fed has come to use changes in the discount rate as its clearest policy signal, and its failure to change the rate left doubts, until now, about just how concerned it might be about the economic slowdown.   Some economists had said a discount rate cut was imminent, because the Federal Reserve rarely lets the Federal funds rate fall below the discount rate. Indeed, the announcement yesterday said that the discount rate was being cut, in part, to realign it with market interest rates. Technically, however, this is not strictly necessary, since banks have refrained from borrowing at the discount window, lest it be seen as evidence that they are in trouble and cannot borrow easily in the marketplace.   The Federal Reserve last changed the discount rate on Feb. 24, 1989, pushing it to 7 percent, from 6 1/2 percent. At that time, the big worry was inflation. The central bank was pushing up other rates as well then, trying to discourage consumers and businesses from the robust spending that drives up prices.   The Federal Reserve\'s governors vote on discount rate changes, acting on the requests of the regional banks, which actually lend the money. Yesterday\'s announcement said a rate cut had been requested by the directors of nine of the regional banks -- in Boston, New York, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Kansas City and Dallas. The three others, in Philadelphia, Cleveland and San Francisco, later in the afternoon endorsed the rate cut.   Besides weakness in the economy and the constraints banks have placed on lending, the Fed\'s announcement yesterday also listed ""slow growth in the monetary aggregates"" as a reason for cutting the discount rate. The aggregates, also known as the nation\'s money supply, had been growing below the Fed\'s target levels. A primary reason for the slow growth is that the money supply is affected, in part, by lending levels, which have declined in a weak economy.

127,2003-05-06,"['NEW YORK -- The dollar fell hard, with the euro leaping above $1.14 for the first time since January 1999, after the Federal Reserve flagged deflation as a possible risk and Treasury Secretary John Snow appeared to signal a benign policy. In the wake of the Federal Open Market Committee\'s announcement, the dollar stumbled quickly, with the euro shattering resistance around $1.1395. The dollar also hit a four-year low against the Swiss franc, a 5 1/2-year low versus the Canadian dollar and three-year lows against the Australian dollar. It also touched two-month troughs versus the yen and sterling. Comments by Mr. Snow didn\'t seem to slow the dollar\'s decline. In an interview on CNBC, he said that the U.S. administration has had a position ""going back many years to support a strong dollar."" But he added ""we recognize that the dollar\'s value is best set in an open competitive currency market."" The fact that Mr. Snow\'s statement came on a day when the euro hit a fresh four-year high was viewed by some in the market as a significant endorsement of a more benign policy by the Bush administration toward the dollar. Meanwhile, ""the Fed is giving more emphasis to deflation concerns than ever before,"" said Sung Won Sohn, chief economist at Wells Fargo in Minneapolis. ""The Fed believes the economic rebound they see won\'t be strong enough to head off deflation."" Late yesterday, the dollar was trading at 117.52 yen, down from 118.67 yen late Monday in New York but above two-month lows of 117.31 yen hit earlier in the session. The euro was trading at $1.1437, sharply up from $1.1282 late Monday. Against the Swiss franc, the dollar was at 1.3243 francs, down from 1.3425 francs late Monday. Sterling was at $1.6135, up compared with $1.6063 Monday. Some analysts said the euro may not be able to hold on to these gains however, particularly given the speed of its climb.

129,2003-05-06,"[""WASHINGTON, May 6 -- The Federal Reserve held short-term interest rates steady today, but took the unusual step of saying that it had become worried about the risks of a sustained fall in prices, commonly known as deflation. The statement signals that the Fed stands ready to cut rates soon if the economy does not quickly recover from its recent weakness, and it suggests that some officials at the Fed remain considerably more nervous about the economy than Alan Greenspan, the chairman. In announcing that it was keeping the benchmark interest rate on overnight loans between banks at 1.25 percent, the Federal Open Market Committee -- the Fed's rate-setting group -- acknowledged that companies had recently cut both production and employment. ''However, the ebbing of geopolitical tensions has rolled back oil prices, bolstered consumer confidence and strengthened debt and equity markets,'' the committee said. Those developments ''should foster an improving economic climate over time.'' The chief danger facing the economy, the Fed said, is that inflation, which is already low, will fall further as demand for new products remains weak. Many economists say they believe that deflation can cripple an economy by effectively increasing debt levels and causing consumers to reduce their spending in anticipation of future bargains. Low inflation, on the other hand, is widely considered to be the ideal situation. Stocks, after having risen in the morning, moved little after the announcement at 2:15 p.m. that rates would not change, which most analysts had expected. The dollar, however, accelerated its recent decline and fell 1.2 percent against the euro. Traders attributed the sharp move to the Fed's concern about potential deflation. [Page C9.] The worried tone of the Fed's announcement appeared to shed light on an emerging disagreement between Mr. Greenspan and some of his colleagues. Together, the statement and a unanimous vote in favor of holding rates unchanged ''has 'compromise' written all over it,'' said Ian C. Shepherdson, the chief domestic economist at High Frequency Economics in Valhalla, N.Y. Mr. Greenspan has argued that the war in Iraq caused many of the recent economic problems, like rising layoffs. With oil prices having fallen and a protracted war no longer a possibility, consumers and executives will probably accelerate their spending, lifting the economy from its long slump this year, Mr. Greenspan suggested to Congress last week. Some other Fed officials remain nervous that companies are still cutting costs to recover from the excesses of the 1990's boom. At some point, the weakening labor market could cause consumers to pull back their spending and make the economy vulnerable to a new downturn, officials have said in recent speeches. ''This economic recovery has been losing momentum since last summer,'' Anthony M. Santomero, the president of the Philadelphia Fed, said last month. ''Not all of this can be laid at the feet of the Iraq situation. Other events and imbalances were and are still at work.'' But the officials' concerns were not big enough for them to favor a rate cut today, or at least for them to take a public stand by voting for one. Mr. Greenspan, like previous Fed chairmen, has long preferred to keep most debates within the Fed's boardroom and to shape compromises that allow for unanimous votes. ''I think there's disagreement on the board,'' said Joel L. Prakken, chairman of Macroeconomic Advisers, a forecasting firm in St. Louis. ''Greenspan's made it pretty clear that he thinks the main problem is geopolitical uncertainty from which we'll recover.'' In March, at its previous meeting, the Fed also left rates unchanged, but it refused to characterize the risks of a downturn, saying the impending war with Iraq created too much uncertainty. Today, the Fed went into more detail than it typically does when describing the risks facing the economy. It called the upside and downside risks to sustainable growth ''roughly equal,'' suggesting that a new recession this year was no more likely than an unhealthy spike in growth. But weakness remains a bigger worry than an overheated economy because of the small possibility of an ''unwelcome substantial fall in inflation,'' the Fed said, not using the word deflation. Richard Berner, chief United States economist at Morgan Stanley, called the new detail ''a change in the way Fed communicates.'' He added, ''It's an important and welcome step in the Fed moving toward a more understandable policy.'' The Fed began to cut its benchmark interest rate in January 2001, soon after unemployment started rising and the record-long expansion of the 1990's ended. Since then, the Fed has cut the rate 12 times, to 1.25 percent, its lowest level since 1961. By lowering the cost of automobile, credit-card and other short-term loans -- and indirectly causing some of the fall in mortgage rates -- the reductions helped make the recession of 2001 one of the mildest on record. But to the surprise of Mr. Greenspan and most of his colleagues, who have regularly predicted a return to healthy growth over the last two years, the economy has remained in a rut, growing too slowly for companies to hire new workers. The slow growth has also pushed down annual inflation to between 1.5 percent and 3 percent, depending on the measure, and raised fears that the economy could slip into a deflationary trap similar to the one hurting Japan. Echoing the opinion of most economists, the Fed called the risk minor today, but officials have said that they want to be vigilant because, having studied Japan's experience, they consider deflation harder to reverse than to prevent. ''We're living in amazing times,'' said Ian Morris, the chief domestic economist at HSBC. Deflation ''has never been an issue since the 1930's,'' he added. Most private-sector forecasters also expect the economy to gain strength in the coming months, but many say that they have already been surprised by the long slowdown. ''There's a lot to suggest that the precursors to a second-half recovery are falling into place,'' Mr. Prakken said. ''But there's no evidence of an actual rebound. There's a lot of uncertainty. It's difficult to make a good forecast in a postbubble environment.'' The Fed's rate-setting committee next meets on June 24 and 25. Forecasters are divided over whether a cut is likely then, although most seem to expect no change.""]","[""washington, may 6 -- the federal reserve held short-term interest rates steady today, but took the unusual step of saying that it had become worried about the risks of a sustained fall in prices, commonly known as deflation. the statement signals that the fed stands ready to cut rates soon if the economy does not quickly recover from its recent weakness, and it suggests that some officials at the fed remain considerably more nervous about the economy than alan greenspan, the chairman. in announcing that it was keeping the benchmark interest rate on overnight loans between banks at 1.25 percent, the federal open market committee -- the fed's rate-setting group -- acknowledged that companies had recently cut both production and employment.

The Fed cut its short-term interest-rate target 0.75 percentage point to 2.25%, not the full point that markets had been expecting.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 300 points ahead of the rate cut on a growing conviction the Fed\'s prior efforts to funnel cash to credit markets would work. Though stocks lost a chunk of their gains right after the 2:15 p.m. rate-cut announcement, they surged back to close up 420.41 points, or 3.5%, at 12392.66.     Financial stocks did especially well.

Both reported first-quarter earnings that, while off more than 50% from a year ago, were better than expected, prompting descriptions of the market surge as a relief rally.     The dollar improved against both the euro and Japanese yen after the Fed announcement. The U.S. currency has fallen sharply in recent weeks as global investors questioned the Fed\'s commitment to resisting inflation, a worry that has sent money pouring into gold, oil and other inflation hedges. Oil sold off briefly after the announcement but then rose to close up $3.74 a barrel at $109.42.     Though less than expected, the interest-rate cut was substantial. Yesterday was only the second time the Fed has cut so much since it began announcing its rate moves in 1994. The central bank now has cut short-term interest rates a full three points since September, the fastest pace of easing in decades.     This reflects the speed with which a slump in housing and subprime mortgages has spiraled into a broad credit crunch, weakening financial institutions and making it harder for a broad swath of businesses and households to borrow. Most economists now think the U.S. is in a recession, with the debate shifting to how deep it will be.     Recognizing that, the Fed signaled in its end-of-meeting statement that the prospect of more rate cuts remains on the table. ""The outlook . . . has weakened further,"" it said. ""Consumer spending has slowed and labor markets have softened. Financial markets remain under considerable stress, and the tightening of credit conditions and the deepening of the housing contraction are likely to weigh on economic growth."" It said ""downside risks to growth remain,"" and the Fed will ""act in a timely manner as needed.""     Nonetheless, the Fed has increasingly come to the view that lower rates alone won\'t restore order to the financial markets and prevent a severe recession. It has rolled out ever more creative and aggressive attempts to infuse cash into market corners where it normally doesn\'t operate, culminating in Sunday\'s decision to lend to investment banks from its ""discount window,"" a privilege previously reserved for commercial banks. Chairman Ben Bernanke also has publicly backed action to use public money to stem a tide of mortgage defaults and foreclosures.     The Fed\'s actions are among several aggressive steps throughout the federal government that are coming to a head this week and could prove critical in combating the crisis. Today the regulator of Fannie Mae and   Freddie Mac, which provide the bulk of funding for home mortgages, is to announce an easing of their capital requirements and the companies are to pledge to raise more capital, people familiar with the matter said. Those steps should enable them to back more mortgages.     Meanwhile, the Bush Administration which has so far resisted using large amounts of public money to save borrowers and lenders from bad loans, may be ready to compromise with Democrats on a more activist approach to the housing crisis. The Fed is ""running out of pages in its playbook to address the growing crisis of credit and confidence,"" Senate Banking Committee Chairman Chris Dodd, who has proposed the Federal Housing Administration insure up to $400 billion in troubled mortgages, said yesterday. Now the Bush administration should be ""equally aggressive.""     Yesterday, the Fed expressed more concern about prices than after its Jan. 30 meeting. ""Inflation has been elevated, and some indicators of inflation expectations have risen,"" it said. While the Fed still expects inflation to ease as commodity prices plateau and as higher unemployment blunts wage and price gains, it said that ""uncertainty about the inflation outlook has increased. It will be necessary to continue to monitor inflation developments carefully.""     With the economy continuing to weaken, the Fed remains concerned about what some officials describe as an ""adverse feedback loop"" of economic weakness, tighter lending and further weakness. It is thus likely to cut interest rates again.     But the elevated concern about inflation in the statement suggests the Fed does think it\'s getting close to the bottom in interest rates. Some analysts speculate the Fed could trim rates before its next scheduled meeting on April 29-30, but many think that\'s unlikely unless the outlook or markets get markedly worse.     The futures markets reduced the expectation they are showing for additional cuts. The futures now see the federal-funds rate, charged on overnight loans between banks, easing to between 1.5% and 1.75% by year\'s end. Before yesterday\'s move, futures investors were betting the rate would fall to 1.25% to 1.5%.     The Fed also lowered the rate charged on direct ""discount window"" loans it makes available to banks and -- since Sunday -- to investment banks. It slashed the rate to 2.5% from 3.25%, keeping it a quarter-point above the federal-funds rate. Commercial banks began lowering their prime interest rates, to which some variable-rate loans are tied, to 5.25% from 6%.     Highlighting the depth of the Fed\'s inflation concerns, two of the 10 voting members of the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee voted against the 3/4-point cut. Charles Plosser and Richard Fisher, presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks of Philadelphia and Dallas, ""preferred less aggressive action at this meeting,"" the Fed said.     A worsening of both inflation and economic growth in the past month has made FOMC decisions more fractious. Each of the past five rate-cut decisions has triggered at least one dissent -- one favoring a bigger cut and the others favoring less. Yesterday\'s was the first meeting with two dissents since 2002.     Messrs. Plosser and Fisher have been the most outspoken about inflation risks, but most other Fed policymakers are also uncomfortable with the recent deterioration in inflation psychology. The decision to trim the federal-fund rate less than markets expected appears, at least in part, a way to convey both that the Fed isn\'t panicking and that the central bank is weighing consequences of its actions on inflation psychology.     The economy is hardly out of the woods. Investor confidence remains fragile just days after the Fed made an unprecedented loan to prevent the collapse of   Bear Stearns Cos., exposing how deeply the credit squeeze had penetrated the U.S. financial system. Sunday\'s statement that the Fed would lend to investment banks, and on the same terms as to commercial banks, was the boldest step the central bank has taken so far to employ its own balance sheet to take some riskier debt off the hands of financial institutions.     The stresses in the credit markets have kept some of the Fed\'s rate-cutting efforts from filtering through to borrowers. The average rate on 30-year mortgages fell to 5.5% in December from 6.4% in July when the crisis began; but then the rate went above 6% in February, even though the Fed had been cutting short-term rates since September.     After the Fed a week ago said it would lend up to $200 billion in Treasury securities to bond dealers in return for mortgage-backed securities, mortgage rates fell to 5.74% from 6.2%, according to Bankrate.com.     Rates on ""jumbo"" mortgages above $417,000 -- until recently, the biggest that could be guaranteed by Fannie Mae and   Freddie Mac -- are higher now than in July, because banks have trouble finding investors to buy securities backed by such loans. The Fed\'s move a week ago to lend to bond dealers also knocked down rates on jumbo loans, to 7.02%.     Bank Credit Analyst, a financial research service, said a decline in rates other than those on super-safe Treasury bonds ""would be the key indication that conditions are finally improving. If that does not happen, then the Fed will be forced to consider more drastic action, including direct purchases of securities.""

135,1994-12-20,"['Prices of Treasury bills and notes rose yesterday as the Federal Reserve\'s policy-making committee adjourned its meeting without altering interest-rate policy.   But the price of the 30-year bond slipped 2/32 of a percentage point, to 96 2/32 , for a yield of 7.84 percent, unchanged from Monday.   Many investors stayed on the sidelines yesterday ahead of any news that could signal a change in monetary policy. The market\'s focus now turns to the next meeting of the Fed\'s policy-making panel, the Federal Open Market Committee, which is scheduled to begin on Jan. 31.   Many market participants think the Fed will choose that time for another increase in short-term interest rates to keep inflation from accelerating.   Treasury bills and notes with maturities of five years or less are more vulnerable to interest rate increases by the Fed. The shorter maturities rose after the Fed announced that the final meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee for 1994 had ended at 12:45 P.M. and that there would be ""no further announcements.""   Ray Worseck, chief economist and manager at A. G. Edwards & Sons Inc. in St. Louis, said there were a number of reasons the Fed took no action on interest rates yesterday. ""For one, they bought themselves a little time with the 75-basis-point hike in November,"" he said, noting that the effects of a rate increase take time to work through the economy.   Also, he said, ""the dollar has not been under pressure since the November meeting."" And he added that the fiasco involving the investment fund of Orange County, Calif., had given the Fed ""another reason not to tighten.""   Today the Treasury will auction $17.25 billion of new two-year notes and tomorrow it will auction $11 billion of new five-year notes. In when-issued trading late yesterday, the two-year notes were being offered at a price to yield 7.57 percent, and the five-year notes were being offered at a price to yield 7.74 percent.   Elsewhere, municipal bonds were little changed amid growing concern that bond funds will increase selling as investor redemptions resume. Some speculate that those redemptions could increase if Orange County misses a coupon payment or if it is in technical default, according to one trader.   In the corporate bond market, USA Mobile Communications Holdings Inc. moved ahead yesterday with a planned bond offering, taking the company a step closer to thwarting an unwelcome $200 million merger bid from Metrocall Inc.   The company priced a $100 million junk bond offering through Morgan Stanley & Company in anticipation of a USA Mobile shareholder vote on Friday to issue the notes.   Metrocall opposes the junk-bond offering, saying USA Mobile\'s interest costs are too high. On Monday, Metrocall warned that it would ""immediately and irrevocably withdraw"" its $14.50-a-share offer for USA Mobile if the bonds are sold.   Metrocall has also has threatened to revoke its offer if USA Mobile proceeds with its planned merger with Premiere Page Inc., a paging company based in Leawood, Kan., that USA Mobile has agreed to buy for about $36 million in cash and stock.

136,1994-12-20,"['WASHINGTON, Dec. 20 -- The Federal Reserve\'s top officials met for nearly four hours today but adjourned without announcing any change in interest rates.   Most economists and traders still expect the Fed to raise rates again, possibly at its next meeting on Jan. 31 and Feb. 1, or perhaps before then.   The Fed is prepared to brake economic growth, Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, warned a Congressional panel on Dec. 7, if necessary to prevent recent increases in raw materials and other manufacturing costs from showing up in consumer prices.   But the central bank\'s top officials also hinted earlier this month that they would probably pass up the chance today to raise short-term interest rates for the seventh time this year. Alan S. Blinder, the Fed\'s vice chairman, emphasized on Dec. 9 that reliable information on the economy\'s health for the fourth quarter would not become available until January.   Financial markets showed little reaction to the Fed\'s decision today. The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond was unchanged at 7.84 percent. [ Page D17. ] Meanwhile, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 23.55 points, to 3,767.15. [ Page D8. ]   The Fed\'s difficulty lies in judging how much the last six interest rate increases will slow the economy. Interest rate changes take up to two years to affect economic growth because companies plan far ahead in making big investment decisions. Strong growth, in turn, can fuel inflation by creating bottlenecks that allow companies to bid up prices.   Lawrence A. Hunter, the Republican staff director of the Joint Economic Committee of Congress, said that the Fed faced the same dilemma now as a bather who has just turned the hot water on full in a shower but still finds the water coming out cold. ""You have to wait a long time or you\'ll burn yourself,"" he said.   Today\'s meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee marked only the third time this year that the Fed\'s top policy-making body had met without announcing an interest rate increase. The statement issued at the end of today\'s meeting was virtually identical to the statements from the previous meetings on July 6 and Sept. 27.   ""The F.O.M.C. meeting ended at 12:45 P.M.,"" today\'s statement said. ""There will be no further announcements.""   At the July 6 and Sept. 27 meetings this year, Fed officials voted to give explicit discretionary power to Mr. Greenspan to raise rates on his own authority before the next meeting.   Although Mr. Greenspan did not use this authority following the meetings on July 6 and Sept. 27, some experts said that he had likely received similar authorization today and might use it next month.   John Lipsky, an economist at Salomon Brothers, said that Mr. Greenspan would be particularly likely to raise interest rates next month if there is a sharp jump in underlying inflation, which excludes changes in volatile food and energy prices.   The Fed was able to leave interest rates untouched today in part because it raised short-term interest rates by three-quarters of a percentage point on Nov. 15, the largest increase since 1981. The size of that increase reassured bond investors that they could make long-term investments without worrying that inflation would erode the returns.   Interest rates on long-term bonds have fallen by nearly a quarter of a percentage point since Nov. 15. Within the Fed, J. Alfred Broaddus Jr., the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, and others who advocated pushing short-term rates up have argued that tighter money is needed to respond to rising long-term rates. Now that the bond market has responded favorably, this faction may not have pushed hard for a rate increase today.   Starting in February, the Fed pushed up its target for the Federal funds rate, which banks pay each other for overnight loans, to 5.5 percent from 3 percent. The Fed has also raised the less important discount rate, which it charges banks for overnight loans, to 4.75 percent from 3 percent.   The interest rates that Americans pay for mortgages, home-equity loans, car loans and other borrowing have climbed steeply this year, but seem unlikely to change much in response to today\'s meeting of Fed officials.   White House officials, in line with the Administration\'s policy of respecting the Fed\'s independence, declined to comment on today\'s decision.   Still, Laura D\'Andrea Tyson, the head of the Council of Economic Advisers, said that recent Labor Department figures on consumer and factory prices showed no signs of accelerating inflation.

[ page d8. ]   the fed's difficulty lies in judging how much the last six interest rate increases will slow the economy. interest rate changes take up to two years to affect economic growth because companies plan far ahead in making big investment decisions. strong growth, in turn, can fuel inflation by creating bottlenecks that allow companies to bid up prices.   lawrence a. hunter, the republican staff director of the joint economic committee of congress, said that the fed faced the same dilemma now as a bather who has just turned the hot water on full in a shower but still finds the water coming out cold. ""you have to wait a long time or you'll burn yourself,"" he said.   today's meeting of the federal open market committee marked only the third time this year that the fed's top policy-making body had met without announcing an interest rate increase. the statement issued at the end of today's meeting was virtually identical to the statements from the previous meetings on july 6 and sept. 27.   ""the f.o.m.c. meeting ended at 12:45 p.m.,"" today's statement said. ""there will be no further announcements.""   at the july 6 and sept. 27 meetings this year, fed officials voted to give explicit discretionary power to mr. greenspan to raise rates on his own authority before the next meeting.   although mr. greenspan did not use this authority following the meetings on july 6 and sept. 27, some experts said that he had likely received similar authorization today and might use it next month.   john lipsky, an economist at salomon brothers, said that mr. greenspan would be particularly likely to raise interest rates next month if there is a sharp jump in underlying inflation, which excludes changes in volatile food and energy prices.   the fed was able to leave interest rates untouched today in part because it raised short-term interest rates by three-quarters of a percentage point on nov. 15, the largest increase since 1981. the size of that increase reassured bond investors that they could make long-term investments without worrying that inflation would erode the returns.   interest rates on long-term bonds have fallen by nearly a quarter of a percentage point since nov. 15. within the fed, j. alfred broaddus jr., the president of the federal reserve bank of richmond, and others who advocated pushing short-term rates up have argued that tighter money is needed to respond to rising long-term rates. now that the bond market has responded favorably, this faction may not have pushed hard for a rate increase today.   starting in february, the fed pushed up its target for the federal funds rate, which banks pay each other for overnight loans, to 5.5 percent from 3 percent. the fed has also raised the less important discount rate, which it charges banks for overnight loans, to 4.75 percent from 3 percent.   the interest rates that americans pay for mortgages, home-equity loans, car loans and other borrowing have climbed steeply this year, but seem unlikely to change much in response to today's meeting of fed officials.   white house officials, in line with the administration's policy of respecting the fed's independence, declined to comment on today's decision.   still, laura d'andrea tyson, the head of the council of economic advisers, said that recent labor department figures on consumer and factory prices showed no signs of accelerating inflation.

137,2000-03-21,"[""WASHINGTON, March 21 -- The Federal Reserve clamped down a bit more on the economy today, raising interest rates a quarter percentage point in an effort to prevent an outbreak of inflation. The move was no surprise to economists and investors, who had heard repeated hints the last month from Alan Greenspan, the central bank's chairman, that he intended to stick to his policy of raising rates in small, steady steps until he saw signs that the supercharged economy was throttling back. The stock market, which some analysts consider Mr. Greenspan's main target in raising rates, shrugged off the news and moved higher after the Fed's announcement this afternoon. Apparently relieved that the central bank did not raise rates a half-point, the Dow Jones industrial average gained 227.10 points, to 10,907.34. The Nasdaq composite index closed at 4,711.68, up 101.68 points. It was the Fed's fifth quarter-point rate increase since June, and it lifted the benchmark federal funds target rate on overnight loans between banks to 6 percent, its highest level in almost five years. The central bank also raised its discount rate on loans to banks from the Federal Reserve system a quarter of a percentage point, to 5.5 percent. The moves put immediate upward pressure on rates paid by consumers and businesses. Banks began raising their prime lending rates a quarter-point, to 9 percent, which will lead to slightly higher rates on many home equity and small-business loans as well as credit cards. The Fed's decision had a less direct effect on mortgage rates and corporate borrowing costs, which are largely set in the bond markets. Those rates have moved up the last year as the Fed has tightened monetary policy and are likely to continue doing so as long as Mr. Greenspan remains on inflation alert. Yields on the 30-year government bond continued to fall, creating an unusual situation in which the Fed's short-term rates were higher than the market's longest-term rates. In a statement, the Fed's policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee said it had raised rates again for the same reason it had done so at its last meeting in February. It said, in effect, that growth was running stronger than the economy could sustain over the long run without creating inflationary bottlenecks. ''The committee remains concerned that increases in demand will continue to exceed the growth in potential supply, which could foster inflationary imbalances that would undermine the economy's record economic expansion,'' the statement said. The committee suggested that further rate increases were likely if the economy did not slow substantially by May 16 -- the next time it meets. The committee, the statement said, ''believes the risks are weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate heightened inflation pressures in the foreseeable future.'' There is little evidence so far of any broad-based surge in inflation outside of the sharp rise in oil prices. But the economy has been growing at rates well beyond what most economists think can be sustained over the long run without generating inflation. The economy grew 6.9 percent in the last quarter of 1999, and analysts think growth in the first three months of this year could be about 5 percent. Consumer spending in particular remains robust. Mr. Greenspan has traced the danger facing the economy to the stock market. His argument -- which is being questioned on Wall Street and in Washington -- is that the recent upturn in the growth rate of productivity, or output for each hour worked, is leading investors to expect higher corporate profits and therefore to bid up stock prices. Higher stock prices, in turn, are leaving investors feeling wealthy and willing to spend, driving up demand for goods and services. In Mr. Greenspan's view, demand is growing faster than the economy can produce supply. The imbalance between demand and supply has been contained so far through two safety valves: declining unemployment, which is providing the workers needed to produce more goods and services, and imports, which are filling the gap between demand and what domestic companies can produce. Mr. Greenspan's point is that the safety valves cannot be counted on much longer to absorb the strains being generated by strong demand and that interest rates must rise until demand falls to a level that the economy can meet. Mr. Greenspan has warned repeatedly that at its current pace, the economy will soon run short of workers, putting upward pressure on wages and ultimately prices. The unemployment rate in February was 4.1 percent, just a touch above its 30-year low. The Fed chairman has also warned that the nation is approaching the limit of how much it can afford to import. His point was underscored today by the release of monthly trade figures for January, showing a deficit of $28 billion, another record and well above what economists had projected. Mr. Greenspan has insisted that the goal of monetary policy is not to drive stock prices down. But he has made clear that in his view the pace of wealth generation stemming from the long run-up in stock prices will have to be tempered if demand is to be restrained -- a distinction that is lost on many analysts. ''The whole issue of whether he is targeting the stock market is a hot question,'' said Bill Cheney, an economist at John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance in Boston. ''It seems to me perfectly clear that he is targeting it, and he merely has to deny pro forma that he is doing so.'' Mr. Cheney said he thought Mr. Greenspan was basically right that the wealth being generated by the stock market was the source of much of the excess demand in the economy. Other economists think that Mr. Greenspan has it all wrong, or that he is focusing attention on the stock market to avoid being criticized in an election year for slowing the economy when there is no concrete evidence of inflation. ''If the Fed were to literally threaten to raise the unemployment rate and slow growth, it wouldn't be a great political posture to take,'' said Brian S. Wesbury, an economist at Griffin, Kubik, Stephens & Thompson, an investment firm in Chicago. There is also sharp disagreement among economists about how much momentum the economy has and how much more rates will have to rise to erase any threat of inflation. ''We're going to see some slower growth numbers pretty quickly, good numbers on inflation, and within three to six months, you'll start hearing talk about actual Fed easing,'' Mr. Wesbury said. But other analysts said the slowdown could still be a long way off and that the Fed might have to raise rates sharply this spring and summer to bring the economy under control. ''Thus far, the core cost and price data have been so benign that the Fed has been able to conduct a gradualist policy, hoping to change behavior through a slow cash flow squeeze on companies and individuals,'' said Ian Shepherdson, an economist at High Frequency Economics, a consulting firm in Valhalla, N.Y. ''But if inflation is beginning to accelerate, however slowly, Mr. Greenspan will at least have to consider taking more drastic action.''""]","[""washington, march 21 -- the federal reserve clamped down a bit more on the economy today, raising interest rates a quarter percentage point in an effort to prevent an outbreak of inflation. the move was no surprise to economists and investors, who had heard repeated hints the last month from alan greenspan, the central bank's chairman, that he intended to stick to his policy of raising rates in small, steady steps until he saw signs that the supercharged economy was throttling back. the stock market, which some analysts consider mr. greenspan's main target in raising rates, shrugged off the news and moved higher after the fed's announcement this afternoon. apparently relieved that the central bank did not raise rates a half-point, the dow jones industrial average gained 227.10 points, to 10,907.34. the nasdaq composite index closed at 4,711.68, up 101.68 points. it was the fed's fifth quarter-point rate increase since june, and it lifted the benchmark federal funds target rate on overnight loans between banks to 6 percent, its highest level in almost five years. the central bank also raised its discount rate on loans to banks from the federal reserve system a quarter of a percentage point, to 5.5 percent. the moves put immediate upward pressure on rates paid by consumers and businesses. banks began raising their prime lending rates a quarter-point, to 9 percent, which will lead to slightly higher rates on many home equity and small-business loans as well as credit cards. the fed's decision had a less direct effect on mortgage rates and corporate borrowing costs, which are largely set in the bond markets. those rates have moved up the last year as the fed has tightened monetary policy and are likely to continue doing so as long as mr. greenspan remains on inflation alert. yields on the 30-year government bond continued to fall, creating an unusual situation in which the fed's short-term rates were higher than the market's longest-term rates. in a statement, the fed's policy-setting federal open market committee said it had raised rates again for the same reason it had done so at its last meeting in february. it said, in effect, that growth was running stronger than the economy could sustain over the long run without creating inflationary bottlenecks.

140,1999-02-03,"[""WASHINGTON, Feb. 3 -- Trapped between conflicting pressures at home and abroad, the Federal Reserve voted today to leave interest rates unchanged, keeping its hands off an economy that is either gratifyingly robust or too strong for its own good. The decision, almost universally expected by economists and investors, caused barely a ripple on Wall Street. But it highlighted the dilemma facing the central bank just months after it cut rates three times to insure that financial turmoil in much of the rest of the world would not derail the long American expansion. Rather than slowing, the economy grew at a torrid 5.6 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter, putting back on the agenda the possibility that inflation, long dormant, could reappear. One faction within the Federal Reserve is also concerned about rapid growth in the money supply, a cause or signal of inflation. As a result, analysts said, Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, and his colleagues on the central bank are almost certainly considering whether they will need to reverse course and raise rates later this year if growth does not slow markedly on its own. Yet the continued fragility of global financial markets, a rapidly expanding trade deficit, concern about causing a big selloff on Wall Street and the almost total absence of any hard evidence of inflation have combined to create a strong case for leaving rates alone or even cutting them further. ''The Fed cannot lower interest rates because of eye-popping economic strength,'' said Sung Won Sohn, an economist at Wells Fargo in Minneapolis. ''They cannot raise rates because of the stock market bubble and what's going on overseas and because politically it's impossible to raise rates given the very low inflation rate right now,'' he said. ''So the best course for them is to stand pat and see how the U.S. and the global economies unfold.'' Today's decision left the benchmark Federal funds target rate on overnight loans among banks at 4.75 percent and the discount rate on loans from the Federal Reserve system at 4.5 percent. The central bank's usual terse announcement this afternoon that the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee had adjourned with nothing to report belied the fundamental nature of the debate that has reemerged within the institution in the last few months: Has the economy entered a new era in which heavy investments in technology allow rapid growth to coexist with low inflation? Or is the United States merely enjoying a remarkable but temporary string of good economic luck that will end with inflationary forces reasserting themselves? The evidence in favor of a fundamental change includes some of the most recent economic statistics. The fourth-quarter growth rate of 5.6 percent brought growth for all of 1998 to 3.9 percent, the third consecutive year in which the economy has expanded at nearly a 4 percent rate. Traditional economic theory holds that the economy cannot grow more than about 2.5 percent a year over the long run without igniting inflation. But the broadest measures of price changes suggest that inflation last year was 1 percent or less. Moreover, the absence of meaningful inflation came despite falling unemployment, which has left the jobless rate, currently 4.3 percent, hovering near 30-year lows. And heavy investments in computers and other cost-saving technology has allowed many companies to improve productivity, setting off a debate about whether the United States has reversed a two-decade-long slide in productivity growth. ''Members of the Fed wake up every morning and look out at a booming economy and ask themselves whether it's a result of computers or of interest rates being low,'' said Brian S. Wesbury, an economist at Griffin, Kubik, Stephens & Thompson, a Chicago investment firm. Mr. Wesbury comes down on the side of those who think technology has increased the economy's capacity for noninflationary growth. He said that relative to inflation, the short-term interest rates controlled by the Fed are still high and could be cut to further stimulate growth without any danger of overheating. Mr. Greenspan has been sympathetic to the argument that productivity growth is accelerating, but he has also warned, as recently as last month, that the recent pace of growth is unsustainable. Economists who think growth is flirting with danger levels said part of the reason is that the Fed cut rates one too many times last fall in reaction to the global financial turmoil. In their view, inflation could accelerate this year, especially because some factors that tamped it down last year -- particularly falling oil and food prices -- are unlikely to be replicated this year. If money supply growth continues at double-digit rates, they said, the danger will be compounded. Wherever they come down in the debate, though, most economists think the Fed will hold steady for months unless there is some clear change in the economy's course. ''The Fed's policy debate is rich with crosscurrents and is characterized by uncertainties,'' said Mickey D. Levy, an economist at Bank of America. ''They will remain on hold until something breaks.''""]","[""washington, feb. 3 -- trapped between conflicting pressures at home and abroad, the federal reserve voted today to leave interest rates unchanged, keeping its hands off an economy that is either gratifyingly robust or too strong for its own good. the decision, almost universally expected by economists and investors, caused barely a ripple on wall street. but it highlighted the dilemma facing the central bank just months after it cut rates three times to insure that financial turmoil in much of the rest of the world would not derail the long american expansion. rather than slowing, the economy grew at a torrid 5.6 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter, putting back on the agenda the possibility that inflation, long dormant, could reappear. one faction within the federal reserve is also concerned about rapid growth in the money supply, a cause or signal of inflation. as a result, analysts said, alan greenspan, the federal reserve chairman, and his colleagues on the central bank are almost certainly considering whether they will need to reverse course and raise rates later this year if growth does not slow markedly on its own. yet the continued fragility of global financial markets, a rapidly expanding trade deficit, concern about causing a big selloff on wall street and the almost total absence of any hard evidence of inflation have combined to create a strong case for leaving rates alone or even cutting them further. ''the fed cannot lower interest rates because of eye-popping economic strength,'' said sung won sohn, an economist at wells fargo in minneapolis. ''they cannot raise rates because of the stock market bubble and what's going on overseas and because politically it's impossible to raise rates given the very low inflation rate right now,'' he said. ''so the best course for them is to stand pat and see how the u.s. and the global economies unfold.'' today's decision left the benchmark federal funds target rate on overnight loans among banks at 4.75 percent and the discount rate on loans from the federal reserve system at 4.5 percent. the central bank's usual terse announcement this afternoon that the policy-setting federal open market committee had adjourned with nothing to report belied the fundamental nature of the debate that has reemerged within the institution in the last few months: has the economy entered a new era in which heavy investments in technology allow rapid growth to coexist with low inflation? or is the united states merely enjoying a remarkable but temporary string of good economic luck that will end with inflationary forces reasserting themselves? the evidence in favor of a fundamental change includes some of the most recent economic statistics. the fourth-quarter growth rate of 5.6 percent brought growth for all of 1998 to 3.9 percent, the third consecutive year in which the economy has expanded at nearly a 4 percent rate. traditional economic theory holds that the economy cannot grow more than about 2.5 percent a year over the long run without igniting inflation. but the broadest measures of price changes suggest that inflation last year was 1 percent or less. moreover, the absence of meaningful inflation came despite falling unemployment, which has left the jobless rate, currently 4.3 percent, hovering near 30-year lows. and heavy investments in computers and other cost-saving technology has allowed many companies to improve productivity, setting off a debate about whether the united states has reversed a two-decade-long slide in productivity growth. ''members of the fed wake up every morning and look out at a booming economy and ask themselves whether it's a result of computers or of interest rates being low,'' said brian s. wesbury, an economist at griffin, kubik, stephens & thompson, a chicago investment firm. mr. wesbury comes down on the side of those who think technology has increased the economy's capacity for noninflationary growth. he said that relative to inflation, the short-term interest rates controlled by the fed are still high and could be cut to further stimulate growth without any danger of overheating. mr. greenspan has been sympathetic to the argument that productivity growth is accelerating, but he has also warned, as recently as last month, that the recent pace of growth is unsustainable. economists who think growth is flirting with danger levels said part of the reason is that the fed cut rates one too many times last fall in reaction to the global financial turmoil. in their view, inflation could accelerate this year, especially because some factors that tamped it down last year -- particularly falling oil and food prices -- are unlikely to be replicated this year. if money supply growth continues at double-digit rates, they said, the danger will be compounded. wherever they come down in the debate, though, most economists think the fed will hold steady for months unless there is some clear change in the economy's course.

141,2003-01-29,"['NEW YORK -- Disappointment that the Federal Reserve left interest rates and its economic-risk assessment unchanged helped drive prices of Treasurys broadly lower. Some analysts also cited coming Treasury auctions as an important factor in the selling. The Treasury is expected next week to announce sales of five- and 10-year notes. ""In general [the selloff] has not a lot to do with the Fed\'s decision, but an overhang of supply,"" said Jim Caron, fixed-income strategist at Merrill Lynch in New York. In addition, the market was particularly vulnerable yesterday because many people had been purchasers of Treasurys because of rising international tensions, he added. At 4 p.m., the benchmark 10-year note was down 17/32 point, or $5.31 per $1,000 face value, at 99 23/32. Its yield rose to 4.033% from 3.967% Tuesday, as yields move inversely to prices. The 30-year bond\'s price was down 24/32 point at 106 29/32 to yield 4.918%, up from 4.871% Tuesday. Most investors had expected the Fed\'s policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee to leave its interest-rate target unchanged yesterday, at the conclusion of a two-day policy meeting. Still, some thought the Fed might shift its policy stance to an easing bias from neutral. When the Fed stood pat, that triggered some liquidation of so-called long positions, or trades made in expectations that prices would rise, said Paul Calvetti, head of government-securities trading at Deutsche Bank in New York. ""The neutral directive in today\'s policy statement validates the notion that the Fed expects the economy to perform well in the coming months,"" said Tony Crescenzi, chief market analyst at Miller Tabak in New York. So, ""though the Fed may have disappointed some investors by sticking with a neutral directive rather than shifting to an ease directive, the neutral directive is a bullish statement on the economy."" Among those disappointed were some people who had bought two-year notes in a Treasury auction yesterday ahead of the Fed announcement in hope of benefiting from any Treasurys-friendly outcome, analysts said. The Treasury awarded $27 billion of two-year notes at a rate of 1.710%, in line with market expectations. The results of the auction were ""respectable,"" considering that the sale took place just before the Fed announcement, said David Winter, a government-securities trader at Zions First National Bank in Jersey City, N.J. Meanwhile, the Treasurys market faces a spate of economic data today. Those include an advance report on growth in fourth-quarter gross domestic product, which is seen as having slowed to a rate of 0.6% from 4% in the third period. The fourth-quarter employment-cost index is seen up 0.9% after a third-quarter rise of 0.8%. Also crucial to the Treasurys market will be the direction of major stock indexes, analysts said. In recent months, Treasurys frequently have traded inversely to stocks as declines in stock indexes prompted flight to the relative safety of government securities. At the end of this week, if the Standard &Poor\'s 500-stock index isn\'t meaningfully above 860, stocks could see another leg down, pushing Treasurys prices higher, said William Strazzullo, market strategist at State Street Global Markets in Boston.

142,2003-01-29,"[""WASHINGTON, Jan. 29 -- The Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged today, though it suggested that the biggest restraint on economic growth stemmed from uncertainties about a possible war with Iraq. In leaving the federal funds rate on overnight loans between banks at 1.25 percent, the lowest level in 41 years, the Fed's monetary policy committee said the balance of risks had not changed significantly since its last meeting in December. ''Oil price premiums and other aspects of geopolitical risks have reportedly fostered continued restraint on spending and hiring by business,'' the Fed said in a statement after today's meeting. Essentially reiterating what Fed officials have said since they last reduced interest rates, in November, the Federal Open Market Committee went on to say that the combination of easy monetary policy and improving productivity should help the economy recover once the ''geopolitical risks'' are lifted. Today's decision was not a surprise to most analysts, who have been predicting that the Federal Reserve will keep interest rates at their current level for the next few months. Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, has on several occasions described the economy as being in a ''soft patch,'' and he has described the decision to reduce rates from 1.75 percent to 1.25 percent as an ''insurance premium'' for preventing a more serious economic slowdown. Economic growth all but stopped and unemployment jumped in the three months ended in December after a surprisingly strong third quarter. The government will release its first estimate of fourth-quarter growth on Thursday, and many economists predict that it will show an annualized growth rate well below 1 percent. There have been some signs that conditions are improving. Housing starts surged last month, and orders for manufactured goods have increased slightly after a long stretch of stagnation. Perhaps more important, investors are showing signs of greater optimism. The spread in interest rates between different categories of bonds has narrowed in the last several weeks, which is usually a sign that investors perceive that risks have diminished. Mr. Greenspan has long paid close attention to bond spreads, and the narrowing of those spreads is more important than usual in the current atmosphere of uncertainty about Iraq. But those hints of encouragement have been offset by stagnant or declining prices for many products, factories running at levels far below full capacity and rising unemployment. The Fed's so-called beige book report, a compilation of anecdotal evidence about the economy collected by its 12 regional banks, showed sluggish growth in most regions from November through early January. ''Most Districts characterized growth as 'sluggish' or economic activity as 'soft,' '' the report said. It described consumer spending as ''consistently weak,'' with most parts of the country reporting flat or declining sales. The report said manufacturers were still struggling with weak demand and that investment in capital equipment used in factories remained stagnant in most parts of the country. Stuart G. Hoffman, an economist at PNC Financial Services in Pittsburgh, said the economy continued to send mixed signals about the likelihood of a recovery. ''I don't think anybody can conclude that the economy has come out of its soft spot yet,'' he said. Fed officials are keenly aware of the dangers posed by war anxieties, which they view as a matter outside their control. Even with interest rates at extraordinarily low levels, corporations could delay investments and expansion for several months if they remain uncertain about the likelihood or the duration of a possible war. At worst, that could lead to a second economic slowdown or double-dip recession. At the moment, the world's financial markets are betting that the Fed will continue to keep interest rates low for at least the next several months.

The Fed left its target for the federal-funds rate charged on overnight loans between banks at a 45-year low of 1%, as widely expected. It also said risks to economic growth were balanced, but that it was more concerned about a fall than rise in inflation. The risk of falling inflation, which could ultimately lead to deflation, would be the ""predominant"" concern for now, the Fed said in a statement accompanying its decision. Most important, the Federal Open Market Committee, the central bank\'s policy-making body, reaffirmed the commitment that low interest rates could be maintained ""for a considerable period."" Chairman Alan Greenspan first made the commitment in July, and committee statements repeated it in August and September. The latest statement was almost identical to those issued the previous two months, except for a slightly more upbeat assessment of the labor market, which it said is ""stabilizing."" In September, it said the labor market was ""weakening."" The latest statement also said demand is ""firming"" and business pricing power is ""muted."" The Fed\'s cautious tone comes despite expectations that government statisticians will report tomorrow that the U.S. economy grew at a blazing 6.2% annual rate in the third quarter. The Fed is maintaining easy monetary policy in the face of such upbeat data to ensure that the expansion, after a false start last year, uses up the idle business capacity and high unemployment that are now putting downward pressure on wage and price increases. Underlying inflation is running at about 1%, at the bottom of the 1% to 2% range many Fed officials prefer. Some Fed officials have been uncomfortable with making a commitment to low rates for fear that it will be inappropriate if the economy takes off or inflation resurfaces. Indeed, reports of those concerns in The Wall Street Journal, along with upbeat economic data, had prompted some investors to expect the Fed to drop or alter the ""considerable period"" commitment. That it was repeated in yesterday\'s statement shows that most on the committee remain comfortable with the words. Furthermore, the FOMC is generally unified on rates: All 12 voting members agreed to keep the rate unchanged. The lack of any shift in language relieved some investors. Bond yields declined, stocks rallied, and futures contracts based on the federal-funds rate suggest investors pushed out their expectation about the Fed\'s first rate increase to May from March. Even that seems too early, economists at Morgan Stanley said in a note to clients yesterday, given that Fed officials have stressed they don\'t need to pre-emptively tighten monetary policy as in previous expansions. Mr. Greenspan is unlikely to change the ""considerable period"" commitment until he is confident the likely resulting rise in long-term interest rates poses no threat to the expansion. The Fed hasn\'t addressed ""when and how to change the language, but that\'s for another day,"" former Fed Governor Laurence Meyer said. He predicted the central bank could drop its warning of low inflation and the ""considerable period"" language in January or March, although an actual increase in rates may not come until January, 2005. The Commerce Department yesterday said new orders for durable goods, those designed to last three or more years, rose 0.8% in September from August, the fourth increase in five months. An important category of orders, capital goods excluding defense and aircraft, soared 3.9%, the biggest increase since March. They are now up 5% from a year earlier. Business investment has been the primary source of economic weakness since the economy slid into recession in 2001 and struggled out at the end of that year. Economists and the Fed believe the expansion won\'t be assured until business investment takes the burden of growth away from consumers. Fed officials have also worried that lack of job growth this year could weigh on consumer spirits, undercutting spending and the expansion. But in recent weeks, job creation has picked up, and yesterday the Conference Board reported signs that that is lifting consumers\' spirits.

145,2003-10-28,"['NEW YORK -- Led by short maturities, Treasurys rallied after Federal Reserve policy makers issued an assessment of economic and interest-rate prospects that was very similar to one issued in September. The Fed left its federal funds target rate unchanged at 1.0%, as expected. What did surprise investors was the fact that the Fed changed so little in the wording it used to describe the U.S. economic outlook, particularly its view that falling prices represent a riskto future growth. That phrasing sparked quick buying in Treasurys -- though much was by investors and traders rushing to reverse positions taken in expectation of a different Fed statement, analysts said. At 4 p.m., the benchmark 10-year note was up 16/32 point, or $5 per $1,000 face value, at 100 13/32. Its yield fell to 4.198% from 4.260% Monday, as yields move inversely to prices. The 30-year bond\'s price was up 17/32 point at 103 31/32 to yield 5.103%, down from 5.139% Monday. In its statement yesterday afternoon, the Fed\'s policy setting Federal Open Market Committee said, ""The committee judges that, on balance, the risk of inflation becoming undesirably low remains the predominant concern for the foreseeable future"" even though upside and downside risks for sustainable growth ""are roughly equal."" Bond investors and traders had speculated that the Fed would tone down its worries about disinflation, the slowing of price increases, to signal a subtle change in its thinking on monetary policy, in a sort of ""exit strategy"" from its current accommodative monetary-policy stance. As a result, many people had sold government securities, particularly in the short end of the market, which is the most sensitive to expectations about monetary-policy changes.

Once they saw the Fed statement, investors and traders scrambled to buy shorter maturities. Craig Coats, head of fixed income at Keefe, Bruyette &Woods in New York, said by citing disinflation concerns, the Fed also encouraged investors to undertake another strategy that involves borrowing funds in markets where interest rates are lower and using the money to buy Treasurys. ""People are putting carry trades back on,"" said Mr. Coats. Earlier in the session, Treasurys languished amid stronger-than-expected economic data. The government reported that orders for durable goods, or items meant to last three years or longer, rose 0.8% to $176.26 billion in September. Although the September rise was a little smaller than the 1.3% rise Wall Street had expected, actual shipments of nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft rose a strong 2.5%. Bear Stearns economists noted that for the third quarter as a whole, durable-goods orders increased 14.9% at an annual rate, the strongest quarterly showing since the April-June period in 2000. ""These data represent further evidence of a cyclical upswing in manufacturing,"" the economists said. ""Additionally, regional manufacturing surveys released so far for October point to an acceleration in factory activity at the start of the fourth quarter.""

The headline index rose to 81.1 from an upwardly revised 77.0 in September.   Foreign Bonds The upgrade earlier this month of Russia to investment-grade standing by Moody\'s Investors Service was justified by the country\'s ""willingness and ability"" to pay off foreign debt, said Jonathan Schiffer, Moody\'s lead analyst on Russia. The upgrade came well before the Russian government last weekend arrested OAO Yukos Chairman Mikhail Khodorkovsky, fanning renewed fears of political risk. News of the arrest hit Russian stocks and the country\'s Eurobonds. ""The consensus view is that structural reforms are moving slowly,"" Mr. Schiffer said.

147,2003-10-28,"[""WASHINGTON, Oct. 28 -- The Federal Reserve kept short-term interest rates at 1 percent on Tuesday, the lowest level in 45 years, and suggested that it would continue to do so until at least sometime next year.   In a statement accompanying the decision, the Fed was optimistic for the first time this year about job creation and employment, saying, ''The labor market appears to be stabilizing.''   But the Fed did not mention that economic growth appears to have accelerated to a blistering annual pace of 6 percent in recent months, or refer to a raft of data showing that business spending and investor confidence has climbed sharply.   Instead, it reiterated its view of the last several months that there is more risk that inflation will be too low rather than too high, and it repeated its intention to continue its policy of rock-bottom interest rates for ''a considerable period.''   That was a signal that the Fed is not ready even to warn about rate increases and even less ready to raise rates.   Though not entirely unexpected, the statement helped push up a stock market that was already climbing in anticipation of more giant mergers like the one announced on Monday between FleetBoston Financial and Bank of America.   Some economists warned that the Fed is waiting too long to prepare financial markets for a retightening of monetary policy.   ''The upcoming data will soon enough force the Fed to change its stance,'' wrote Ian Shepherdson, an economist at High Frequency Economics in Valhalla, N.Y. ''Otherwise it will begin to look ridiculous.''   On Thursday, the Commerce Department is expected to report that economic growth in the third quarter was the fastest since late 1999. Most forecasters think the economy grew at an annual rate of 6 percent, and some think it climbed even faster.   Shortly before the Fed announced its decision, the Commerce Department reported that orders for durable goods -- expensive products with an expected lifetime of three years or more -- climbed 0.8 percent in September. Excluding orders for transportation goods, which are volatile, orders climbed 1.2 percent.   ''Business pricing power and increases in core consumer prices remain muted,'' the central bank's Federal Open Market Committee said. ''On balance, the risk of inflation becoming undesirably low remains the predominant concern for the foreseeable future.''   Tuesday's decision appeared to reflect a lingering concern on the part of Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, that the recent increase in spending could be short-lived.   Mr. Greenspan won praise during the 1990's for adjusting monetary policy in advance of changes in the economy. But this time around, Mr. Greenspan appears to want more concrete verification that unemployment is about to decline below its current level of 6.1 percent and that consumer prices will not sink into a downward spiral of deflation.   Minutes from the Fed's August meeting make it clear that Mr. Greenspan and other Fed officials are paying particularly close attention to companies' limited ability to raise prices.   Excluding food and energy, which are always volatile, consumer prices are climbing at an annual rate of about 1 percent, and prices for many manufactured goods are not increasing at all.   But investors are already starting to bet on rising inflation over the longer term. Long-term interest rates have climbed significantly since mid-June, even though the Federal Reserve has kept its overnight rates extremely low.   The growing divergence between low short-term rates and higher long-term rates, including rates for home mortgages, reflects a growing tension between what the Federal Reserve is doing and what investors think the Fed will do.   In its statement on Tuesday, the Fed repeated previous formulations that ''spending is firming.'' But John Vail, an economist at Mizuho Securities, said a more accurate description would be that spending is booming.   The big question is when and how Fed officials will signal a shift in policy. Mr. Greenspan came in for intense criticism from financial investors last summer, who had become convinced the Fed was about to push down long-term interest rates as well as the Federal Funds rate for overnight loans. When Mr. Greenspan subsequently let it be known that he did not see a need for such action, long-term rates suddenly jumped and bond investors lost billions.   Now, analysts and investors are fixated on the Fed's assurances that monetary policy will remain easy ''for a considerable period.'' Any retreat from that language could jolt the markets, but most analysts believe a rate increase is inevitable.   Robert DiClemente, senior United States economist at Citigroup, said it was still too early to expect a shift. ''This language is not window-dressing, and jettisoning it is not a housecleaning matter,'' he wrote in a note to investors on Tuesday.

148,1996-01-31,"[""WASHINGTON, Jan. 31 -- Worried that the economy has slowed and needs a modest spark, the Federal Reserve lowered short-term interest rates today by one-quarter of a point. The move amounts to tossing out a bit of a lifeline at a time when housing and retail sales are flagging and consumer confidence is sinking. It is the central bank's second rate cut in less than six weeks. The move is expected to ease borrowing costs for consumers and business, and indeed banking companies, including Citicorp and BankAmerica, shaved the lending rates for their best customers today to 8.25 percent from 8.5 percent. The Federal Reserve's most important action, trimming the rate at which banks lend money to each other overnight to 5.25 percent, could also continue to buoy the stock market, which has set records the last three days, partly in anticipation of a rate cut. Stocks rose again today, with the Dow Jones industrial average climbing 14.09 points. The Federal Reserve's top rate-setting committee also lowered the discount rate, which it charges on its own loans to banks, to 5 percent from 5.25 percent. The cuts aprovided a significant symbol of reassurance from Washington -- in contrast to the recent Government shutdowns and budget battles that have left many Americans feeling even more anxious about the future. The moves were welcomed as well by a White House concerned at strategy meetings over the effect a faltering economy could have on the Presidential campaign. (Page D6.) As large banks cut their prime lending rates, similar reductions are likely to follow in mortgages, home equity loans, small-business loans and some credit card balances, and some economists said they expected the Federal Reserve and private lenders to continue trimming rates over the next several months. The biggest question, they said, is just how much the economy has slowed -- and whether the central bank has acted quickly and strenuously enough to keep it from stalling. Only a handful of economists are worried about a recession now. But over the last two weeks, a steady drumbeat of statistics has made it clear that the nation's economic growth rate has fallen sharply. Most economists estimate that economic growth slid to a rate of about 2 percent in 1995's fourth quarter from a robust 3.2 percent in the previous three months. Many also fear that mounting consumer debt loads and disruptions from snowstorms have pushed it down to about 1 percent so far in 1996. The slowdown is most evident in consumer spending, which makes up two-thirds of the nation's economic activity. Home sales have declined, and retailers reported meager sales gains during the vital holiday shopping season. More ominously, one index this week shows consumer confidence at its lowest level in two years. Factory orders have also weakened, and new claims for jobless benefits recently hit a six-month high as layoffs continue. Still, some economists -- and clearly some members of the Federal Reserve's key policy committee -- believe the economy could right itself and resume a steady growth pace without a bigger cut in interest rates. But most economists said they thought more stimulation would be needed, including another round of cuts at the committee's next meeting, set for late March. ''Given the soft economy, the decision to cut interest rates was essential,'' said Jerry Jasinowski, the president of the National Association of Manufacturers. He said today's cuts ''will begin to correct the vicious cycle of slow growth in employment and incomes and anemic consumer demand.'' He added that the outlook for the first half of 1996 is ''poor in many respects.'' He also said he thought that the Federal Reserve still needed to lower the Federal funds rate, the key rate that banks charge each other for overnight loans, by another quarter-point, to 5 percent, to ease the debt burden on many consumers. Donald H. Straszheim, chief economist at Merrill Lynch, said he also expected to see ''multiple rounds of Fed easing in coming months.'' And Lawrence Chimerine, an economist at the Economic Strategy Institute in Washington, said he thought that the Federal Reserve ''is still behind the curve'' on rates. Mr. Chimerine said that if key economic statistics remained weak for January and February, ''That would be very significant, and they wouldn't be able to blame it on winter storms and the Government shutdown.'' He said he also thought that the Federal Reserve should quit taking ''baby steps'' in cutting rates -- and take another half of a percentage point off the funds rate as soon as possible. He said the Federal Reserve's incremental pace was ''unnecessarily keeping the risk too high'' for a more serious slowdown. He added that it also was ''keeping the markets guessing'' about what would happen next -- and prompting many consumers to hold off on home refinancings or major purchases out of expectations of lower rates. But the Federal Reserve has traditionally been more conscious of combating inflation than promoting growth. And one important condition for further rate cuts is clearly that inflation remain ''contained,'' as the Federal Reserve described it in today's statement. Before the Federal Reserve announced its rate cuts today, the Labor Department reported that producer prices had risen one-half of 1 percent in December. But most analysts discounted that, saying it was caused by quirks in the seasonal adjustment of energy prices. Excluding volatile energy and food prices, producer prices edged up only one-tenth of 1 percent in December. Producer prices are the prices that manufacturers and farmers charge for goods they sell to retailers, distributors or other buyers. Similarly, the inflation in consumer prices was running at only a modest 2.6 percent through last November. So far, the Federal Reserve clearly is betting that the slowdown in growth will keep it from rearing up again soon. But to some economists, the Federal Reserve's recent trend toward lowering rates represents a risky departure from its usual caution and suggests that its chairman, Alan Greenspan, might be keeping a closer eye than normal on political and market pressures. Indeed, the Federal Reserve's rate-setting board, known as the Federal Open Market Committee,  raised the Federal funds rate seven times to keep the brakes on inflation as the economy grew rapidly in 1994 and early 1995, before trimming twice last year. The last cut came on Dec. 19, a day after the stock market fell 101 points and needed support to resume its record-setting climb. Most analysts said that if the Federal Reserve had not cut rates today, the stock market might well have plunged again. And while President Clinton is widely expected to reappoint Mr. Greenspan, a Reagan Administration appointee, to a third four-year term starting in March, he has not yet formally done so. Ken Bercuson, an economist at the Swiss Bank in New York, said that in cutting rates, ''the Fed is taking on risk on the inflation side that previous incarnations of the F.M.O.C. would not have taken.'' Mr. Bercuson said he feared that increases in wages and raw materials could help inflation start inching up again, perhaps even to 4 percent this year. 05:00 EST February 1, 1996""]","[""washington, jan. 31 -- worried that the economy has slowed and needs a modest spark, the federal reserve lowered short-term interest rates today by one-quarter of a point. the move amounts to tossing out a bit of a lifeline at a time when housing and retail sales are flagging and consumer confidence is sinking. it is the central bank's second rate cut in less than six weeks. the move is expected to ease borrowing costs for consumers and business, and indeed banking companies, including citicorp and bankamerica, shaved the lending rates for their best customers today to 8.25 percent from 8.5 percent. the federal reserve's most important action, trimming the rate at which banks lend money to each other overnight to 5.25 percent, could also continue to buoy the stock market, which has set records the last three days, partly in anticipation of a rate cut. stocks rose again today, with the dow jones industrial average climbing 14.09 points. the federal reserve's top rate-setting committee also lowered the discount rate, which it charges on its own loans to banks, to 5 percent from 5.25 percent. the cuts aprovided a significant symbol of reassurance from washington -- in contrast to the recent government shutdowns and budget battles that have left many americans feeling even more anxious about the future. the moves were welcomed as well by a white house concerned at strategy meetings over the effect a faltering economy could have on the presidential campaign.

In a fully expected move, the FOMC raised its federal funds target to 4.25% from 4%, the 13th such increase since June 2004 when the overnight borrowing rate was 1%.

Interest-rate futures continued to price in a further quarter-point rate increase at the January meeting of the FOMC, with opinion split as to whether the funds rate will reach 4.75% in March.

Mr. Pil said the FOMC is likely to raise rates to 4.75% by March and then pause at that level, when Ben Bernanke will have taken the reins from retiring Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan. The spread between two-year and 10-year note yields was steady at 0.11 percentage point. Further rate increases should compress this relationship close to zero and possibly invert the yield curve, if the 10-year yield falls below that of the two-year note, Mr. Konstam of CSFB said. ""The curve typically inverts right at the end of the tightening cycle,"" he added.

150,2005-12-13,"[""WASHINGTON, Dec. 13 -- After raising interest rates for the 13th time in a row on Tuesday, the Federal Reserve said that its work was not yet finished.   As expected, the Fed raised the benchmark federal funds rate on overnight bank loans to 4.25 percent, from 4 percent. At the same time, it dampened the hopes of some on Wall Street that it was near the end of its campaign to control inflation by tightening its monetary policy.   ''The committee judges that some further measured policy firming is likely to be needed,'' the policymaking Federal Open Market Committee said in a statement.   In a clear effort to increase its flexibility in the months ahead, the Fed left its message even more ambiguous than usual.   For the first time since it began raising rates in June 2004, it did not refer to its monetary policy as ''accommodative,'' which has meant that interest rates were still lower than they should be to keep inflation low over the long run.   Investors jumped at that change, because it implied that Fed officials thought rates were closer to a ''neutral'' level that neither stokes inflation nor slows economic growth. Stock and bond prices both rose after the announcement.   But on closer scrutiny, the Fed seemed not to have changed its basic message so much as to have given itself more room to maneuver.   In effect, some analysts said, the Federal Reserve was keeping options open for the expected retirement on Jan. 31 of Alan Greenspan as chairman and the installation of Ben S. Bernanke as his successor.   ''We haven't learned a lot new today,'' said Ethan Harris, chief United States economist at Lehman Brothers. ''Greenspan's last meeting is in January. I don't think it would be fair to Ben Bernanke to hand him the old directive, and say if you don't hike rates you're going to look like a wimp on inflation.''   One big issue on Tuesday was whether the central bank would retreat from its forward-looking guidance about raising the overnight rate at a ''measured'' pace.   As it happened, the Fed sounded a bit tougher on Tuesday. Not only did it all but promise additional ''measured'' rate increases, it also warned that inflation could be pushed higher by energy costs, a tight labor market and rising demand for manufacturing capacity.   ''Possible increases in resource utilization as well as elevated energy prices have the potential to add to inflation pressures,'' the Fed said in its statement.   ''The central bank seems more worried than before that resources feeding the U.S. economic expansion are getting scarce,'' Bernard Baumohl, executive director of the Economic Outlook Group, a consulting firm in Princeton Junction, N.J., wrote in a note to clients.   Mr. Baumohl speculated that Fed officials became more nervous after the government reported that job creation jumped in November. With unemployment down to 5 percent, the jump suggested that workers might be able to bargain for higher wages.   Factory utilization -- the amount of manufacturing capacity being used -- has edged up to nearly 80 percent, not far from levels that lead to production bottlenecks.   By all accounts, Fed officials are entering a more uncertain new phase, when the need to raise rates even higher is less clear but inflation remains a source of worry.   United States economic growth has been surprisingly strong, despite the wallop of Hurricane Katrina and the steep rise in oil and natural gas prices over the last year.   But the nation's blistering housing market, which has been behind much of the recent economic growth, shows signs of finally cooling down. Sales of existing homes have slowed, inventories of houses on the market have grown and builders are bracing for a slower pace of construction next year.   The evidence on consumer spending, the other critical force behind recent growth, remains ambiguous. On Tuesday, the National Retail Federation estimated that retail sales climbed 0.3 percent in November. But excluding car purchases, which were increased by temporary sales promotions, retail sales declined 0.3 percent for the month.   According to minutes from the Fed's policy meeting on Nov. 2, officials agreed that their longstanding guidance on future rate increases ''would have to be changed before long.''   Mr. Greenspan and other Fed officials have remained confident about the outlook for continued economic growth next year. Most analysts predict that the economy will continue to expand at a fairly rapid annual pace of 3.5 percent in early part of 2006 but then slow somewhat in the second half of the year.   Mr. Greenspan and other Fed officials have also tried to play down the idea of a ''neutral'' interest rate.   Many analysts argue that a neutral rate is about two percentage points above the core rate of inflation, which excludes the volatile prices of food and energy. With core inflation running at about 2 percent a year, a Fed funds rate of 4.25 percent would be close to some definitions of neutral.   But Mr. Greenspan and Mr. Bernanke have both argued that ''neutral'' means different things at different times, and may have limited value as a guide to policy.   In a written response last week to questions posed by Senate lawmakers, Mr. Greenspan said that practical issues ''limit its usefulness.''   As a result, Fed decisions are likely to be increasingly affected by the flow of economic data, making them less predictable.   ''A year ago, it was not that difficult to predict six months in advance where they were going to be,'' said Jan Hatzius, a senior economist at Goldman Sachs. ''That's going to be harder when you are at 5 percent and you think the economy is going to be weak enough to get them to cut rates.''

152,1994-11-15,"['WASHINGTON, Nov. 15 -- Determined to prevent strong economic growth from feeding inflation, the Federal Reserve raised short-term interest rates today by the largest amount since 1981 and left open the possibility of further increases. Banks followed by raising the rates they charge for loans.   The increases are likely to show up immediately in the rates charged millions of Americans on everything from home equity loans to credit cards to small-business loans. Already, interest rates on 30-year mortgages that were available at slightly more than 7 percent at the start of the year have risen to 9.05 percent.   While rising rates are intended to slow economic growth, the Federal Reserve\'s five previous increases, which began in February, have had mixed results. Some industries, like auto making, that depend on customers who need loans have had robust sales, while others, like home building, have begun to slow. Critics of the Federal Reserve say that interest rate changes take up to 18 months to show results and that the previous increases may yet do so.   The central bank today raised by three-quarters of a percentage point each of two short-term interest rates that it controls. Stocks, bonds and the dollar bounced up and down in value following the Federal Reserve\'s action but closed with little change.   The decision by the Federal Reserve came five hours after it reported that American factories operated at 84.9 percent of capacity in October, the highest level in nearly 15 years. When factories are working at top speed, production bottlenecks often occur and can lead to inflation as companies bid up the prices of scarce materials and skilled workers. [ Page D6. ]   ""These measures were taken against the background of evidence of persistent strength in economic activity and high and rising levels of resource utilization,"" the Federal Reserve said in a statement.   The Clinton Administration responded to the Federal Reserve\'s action with restrained statements. Although President Clinton expressed hope this morning that Federal Reserve officials would ""do their best to keep the recovery going,"" Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen and the chief White House economic adviser, Laura D\' Andrea Tyson, issued statements emphasizing the Federal Reserve\'s independence, avoiding any direct comment on interest rates while stressing the economy\'s overall health.   Senator Alfonse M. D\'Amato, the New York Republican scheduled to head the Senate Banking Committee next year, cautiously endorsed the Fed\'s move today. Senator Byron Dorgan, Democrat of North Dakota, warned that higher rates would hurt American workers.   Even before the rate decision was made today, more than 100 people from labor unions and community groups protested the anticipated increase outside the Federal Reserve headquarters, the first such rally against rising interest rates since the early 1980\'s.   A series of speakers pointed out that while the nation\'s unemployment rate may be relatively low now at 5.8 percent, 7.6 million Americans remain unemployed, while millions more are stuck in low-wage jobs.   The National Association of Manufacturers also criticized the move, contending that factories may have more capacity than Federal Reserve statisticians realize, given heavy corporate investment this year.   Alice M. Rivlin, President Clinton\'s budget director, warned today that more inflation might result if Congressional Republicans stimulated the economy by enacting tax cuts without matching spending cuts. That might push the Federal Reserve to continue raising interest rates. ""It would certainly put enormous upward pressure on interest rates and the Fed would have to continue to raise rates,"" she said.   The Federal Reserve today acted on two rates. It raised its target for the Federal funds rate, which banks charge each other for overnight loans, to 5.5 percent from 4.75 percent. And it raised the discount rate, which the Federal Reserve charges banks for overnight loans, to 4.75 percent from 4 percent. Both rates stood at 3 percent at the beginning of this year.   Big banks responded today by raising their prime rates to 8.5 percent from 7.75 percent.   Adjustable-rate mortgages are typically pegged to the interest rates on six-month and one-year Treasury bills, which had already risen in recent weeks in anticipation of action by the Federal Reserve today.   On the other hand, savers are clear beneficiaries of the higher rates. Since Jan. 1, the interest rates on one-year certificates of deposit have climbed to nearly 5 percent from about 3 percent, meaning that a $10,000 deposit held for a year would now earn an additional $185.   The Federal Reserve said that the vote to raise the discount rate was 7 to 0, meaning that both of President Clinton\'s appointees to the Federal Reserve Board, Alan S. Blinder and Janet L. Yellen, supported the move. The Federal Open Market Committee, which consists of the 7-member board and 5 of the 12 presidents of the Federal Reserve regional banks, determines the Federal funds rate. The committee will not disclose today\'s vote until Dec. 23, when it releases minutes of today\'s meeting.   In contrast to the Federal Reserve\'s last two interest rate increases, today\'s announcement had no indication that this would be the central bank\'s last such action for a while. But Wall Street economists said that the size of today\'s increase made it less likely that the Federal Reserve\'s top officials would raise rates again at their next meeting on Dec. 20, waiting instead at least until the following meeting on Jan. 31.   While the Federal Reserve has raised rates by a full percentage point in the past, most recently on May 5, 1981, Fed officials were unable to find any prior case today of a move of three quarters of a point.   The action appeared to represent a compromise between those officials most worried by inflation, led by J. Alfred Broaddus Jr., the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, and officials more inclined to wait and see whether the strong economic growth actually produced inflation.   Officials worried about inflation have pushed for big increases in short-term rates that would shock bond traders into believing that inflation is under control, thereby halting the upward creep in long-term interest rates. Mr. Broaddus successfully pushed last spring for the Federal Reserve to abandon its initial quarter-point increases in favor of half-point increases in May and August, and he is believed to have favored an increase of a full percentage point today.   Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve\'s chairman, has said that the central bank should err, if at all, on the side of raising rates too much. It is easier to reverse an unexpected drop in economic output by lowering interest rates than it is to stop an inflationary spiral with higher rates, he testified last summer.   Mr. Broaddus and three other Federal Reserve regional bank presidents, all advocates of higher rates, will rotate off the open market committee at the end of this year. Three of their four replacements are believed to be more concerned about maintaining the current economic expansion and less interested in higher rates.   One of the Federal Reserve\'s biggest worries is that prices for commodities and some industrial materials, like plywood and ball bearings, have been increasing steadily this year. Consumer prices have not yet reflected these increases, mostly because labor accounts for two-thirds of the cost of consumer goods and wages have been rising fairly slowly this year.   But the Labor Department reported on Nov. 4 that average hourly wages had spurted up 8 cents in October, to $11.24. As a result, Fed officials worry about whether inflation will remain limited to commodity prices.   ""I don\'t think that can last very long; it\'s going to have to show through or recede,"" Edward W. Kelley Jr., a Federal Reserve Board governor, said on Nov. 4.   Graph: ""Six Jumps in \'94, and the Cost So Far""   When the Fed raises rates to combat inflation, rates on loans paid by consumers follow. Yesterday\'s Fed increase was the sixth this year. Graph shows how the first five affected the cost of some sample loans.

""it would certainly put enormous upward pressure on interest rates and the fed would have to continue to raise rates,"" she said.   the federal reserve today acted on two rates. it raised its target for the federal funds rate, which banks charge each other for overnight loans, to 5.5 percent from 4.75 percent. and it raised the discount rate, which the federal reserve charges banks for overnight loans, to 4.75 percent from 4 percent. both rates stood at 3 percent at the beginning of this year.   big banks responded today by raising their prime rates to 8.5 percent from 7.75 percent.   adjustable-rate mortgages are typically pegged to the interest rates on six-month and one-year treasury bills, which had already risen in recent weeks in anticipation of action by the federal reserve today.   on the other hand, savers are clear beneficiaries of the higher rates. since jan. 1, the interest rates on one-year certificates of deposit have climbed to nearly 5 percent from about 3 percent, meaning that a $10,000 deposit held for a year would now earn an additional $185.   the federal reserve said that the vote to raise the discount rate was 7 to 0, meaning that both of president clinton's appointees to the federal reserve board, alan s. blinder and janet l. yellen, supported the move. the federal open market committee, which consists of the 7-member board and 5 of the 12 presidents of the federal reserve regional banks, determines the federal funds rate. the committee will not disclose today's vote until dec. 23, when it releases minutes of today's meeting.   in contrast to the federal reserve's last two interest rate increases, today's announcement had no indication that this would be the central bank's last such action for a while. but wall street economists said that the size of today's increase made it less likely that the federal reserve's top officials would raise rates again at their next meeting on dec. 20, waiting instead at least until the following meeting on jan. 31.   while the federal reserve has raised rates by a full percentage point in the past, most recently on may 5, 1981, fed officials were unable to find any prior case today of a move of three quarters of a point.   the action appeared to represent a compromise between those officials most worried by inflation, led by j. alfred broaddus jr., the president of the federal reserve bank of richmond, and officials more inclined to wait and see whether the strong economic growth actually produced inflation.   officials worried about inflation have pushed for big increases in short-term rates that would shock bond traders into believing that inflation is under control, thereby halting the upward creep in long-term interest rates. mr. broaddus successfully pushed last spring for the federal reserve to abandon its initial quarter-point increases in favor of half-point increases in may and august, and he is believed to have favored an increase of a full percentage point today.   alan greenspan, the federal reserve's chairman, has said that the central bank should err, if at all, on the side of raising rates too much. it is easier to reverse an unexpected drop in economic output by lowering interest rates than it is to stop an inflationary spiral with higher rates, he testified last summer.   mr. broaddus and three other federal reserve regional bank presidents, all advocates of higher rates, will rotate off the open market committee at the end of this year. three of their four replacements are believed to be more concerned about maintaining the current economic expansion and less interested in higher rates.   one of the federal reserve's biggest worries is that prices for commodities and some industrial materials, like plywood and ball bearings, have been increasing steadily this year. consumer prices have not yet reflected these increases, mostly because labor accounts for two-thirds of the cost of consumer goods and wages have been rising fairly slowly this year.   but the labor department reported on nov. 4 that average hourly wages had spurted up 8 cents in october, to $11.24. as a result, fed officials worry about whether inflation will remain limited to commodity prices.   ""i don't think that can last very long; it's going to have to show through or recede,"" edward w. kelley jr., a federal reserve board governor, said on nov. 4.   graph: ""six jumps in '94, and the cost so far""   when the fed raises rates to combat inflation, rates on loans paid by consumers follow. yesterday's fed increase was the sixth this year. graph shows how the first five affected the cost of some sample loans.

153,1994-11-15,"['The long end of the Treasury market rallied yesterday after the Federal Reserve announced its sixth and largest interest rate increase of the year, easing traders\' fears of inflation.   By late in the day, the 30-year bond was up 8/32 , to a price of 9327/32 , for a yield of 8.05 percent, down from 8.07 percent on Monday. Despite the rise in the long end of the Treasury market, prices in shorter maturities were mixed.   The central bank raised short-term rates three-quarters of a percent, a quarter-point more than many had predicted. Expectations were running high as the Federal Open Market Committee met to determine monetary policy for the months ahead.   While investors and dealers were expecting a rise of at least 50 basis points in the discount and Federal funds rates, they were hoping for something a little more aggressive -- and got it. The Fed lifted the discount rate that it charges banks for loans to 4.75 percent and the Federal funds rate that banks charge each other for money, usually overnight, to 5.5 percent.   With yesterday\'s increase, the Fed has now pushed short-term rates up 250 basis points since February in its quest to slow down the economy and head off inflation. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.   Donald Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Securities, said he did not think the tightening was over yet. ""The economic trends that prompted the F.O.M.C. to move today will still be quiet evident in five weeks, and as a result, I would not rule out another rate hike at the next meeting on Dec. 20,"" he said.   The 75-basis-point increase was the biggest since May 1981, when the Fed raised the discount rate by 100 points, to 14 percent. Inflation then was in double digits; at an annual rate, it is now less than 3 percent. Mr. Fine noted that yesterday\'s increase appeared to many in the financial markets to be a compromise between those on the committee who wanted 50 basis points and those who sought 100. ""Unless the economy slows noticeably between now and the next F.O.M.C. meeting, it stands to reason that those who were willing to go 100 today would likely be just as willing to move again in December,"" he said.   Market analysts noted the list of options open to the Fed included increases of 50 basis points in the funds and discount rates, 75 basis points in both, 100 in both, or a split of 50 in the funds and 100 for the discount.   Alan Krol, a portfolio manager for Trevor, Stewart, Burton & Jacobsen Inc., an investment management firm, said yesterday that even with the Fed\'s tightening process now nine months old, ""We still don\'t have all the signs of inflation that everyone has alluded to.""   Mr. Krol added, ""We also think the issue has been and remains: Is the Fed in front of the curve or behind it?"" His answer is that 50 basis points were already priced into the market and that the extra 25 points yesterday added to the Fed\'s credibility.   Before the Fed meeting, which ended around 1 P.M., traders\' continuing concerns over inflation were heightened by two economic reports, higher-than-expected October retail sales and industrial production. Still, investors were reluctant to take any position before knowing where interest rates were headed and how fast, so there was little activity in the market.   Industrial production rose seven-tenths of 1 percent in October, after a revised decline of one-tenth of 1 percent in September, as capacity use rose to 84.9 percent in October from a revised 84.5 percent in September. Many economists had expected that industrial production on average would rise six-tenths of 1 percent, and that capacity would go up to 84.9 percent.   October retail sales rose 1.1 percent, the Commerce Department reported, or six-tenths of a percent without including autos. That was substantially ahead of economists\' expectations of six-tenths of 1 percent over all and four-tenths of 1 percent excluding autos.

In terms of the Fed easing, the question is now whether they will ease at the Dec. 19 F.O.M.C. meeting,"" said Carl Palash, chief economist at MCM Money Watch in New York, a market research and analysis firm.   The price of the 30-year bond slipped 1/32 , to 10727/32 , leaving its yield unchanged at 6.29 percent.   Treasury prices were also weighed down by a report on consumer prices for October that was above expectations. The Labor Department said its Consumer Price Index rose three-tenths of 1 percent. Analysts had expected an increase of two-tenths of 1 percent. The core rate, which excludes the volatile categories of food and energy prices, also rose three-tenths of 1 percent for the month.   ""What the C.P.I. numbers did underscore,"" Mr. Palash of MCM Money Watch said, ""was that there are still inflation risks in the economic outlook.""   ""In particular, with retail inventories on the lean side there shouldn\'t be a lot of discounting during the upcoming holiday season,"" he said. As a result, the inflation rate could end the year at 3 percent, up from 2.7 percent in 1994, he said.   ""Bottom line, it suggest that the low inflation numbers we saw over the summer might have been a lag effect of the economic slowdown in the spring,"" Mr. Palash added.   Other data released yesterday were October industrial production output, which fell three-tenths of 1 percent, and capacity use, which fell to an 83.6 percent rate. The production number had been forecast as being down two-tenths of 1 percent and capacity was forecast at an 83.4 percent rate.   Yesterday, the Treasury sold $18.75 billion of one-year bills, with an average rate of 5.15 percent, down from 5.30 percent last month and the lowest since almost 18 months. The sale of the bills was well received, traders and analysts said, but it had little effect on the overall market.   The Treasury plans to resume its delayed quarterly sales of three-year notes and 10-year notes next week. The three-year notes will be sold on Monday, in addition to the regular weekly auction of three-month and six-month bills. The 10-year notes will be sold on Tuesday.   In-when issued trading yesterday, the three-year notes were offered at a price to yield 5.59 percent and the 10-year notes at a price to yield 5.96 percent.

155,1995-11-15,"['WASHINGTON, Nov. 15 -- Despite mounting evidence of some economic slowing, the Federal Reserve decided today against lowering interest rates, which would have made borrowing less costly at the start of the holiday shopping season.   Analysts generally attributed the decision to the Federal Government\'s stalemated budget negotiations and to the absence of compelling evidence that the economy needs to be spurred, though it is less robust than during the summer.   It looks like they\'re waiting until some of the uncertainty over fiscal policy and the economy is cleared up,"" said James F. O\'Sullivan, an economist at J. P. Morgan. ""It\'s debatable whether the economy needs any stimulus.""   Others disagreed, pointing to weak retail sales and heavy levels of consumer debt, and to fresh figures released today that showed flat industrial production and subdued inflation in October. Consumer prices were up three-tenths of 1 percent in the month, a bit more than expected, but not enough to bother economists.   The central bank has cut short-term interest rates only once this year, by one-quarter of a percentage point in early July, after a 12-month pre-emptive strike against inflation in which it had doubled the Federal funds rate, the benchmark overnight lending rate for the banking system, to 6 percent.   The Fed signaled its decision today with its customary terse statement: ""The Federal Open Market Committee meeting ended at 1:30, and there will be no further announcement.""   Representative Pete Stark of California, the ranking Democrat on the Joint Economic Committee of Congress, expressed dismay at the result, which left the Federal funds rate at what he regarded as an overly restrictive 5 3/4 percent.   ""The negative indicators are starting to pile up,"" he said. ""The Fed should have taken action today.""   One possibility is that the Open Market Committee has decided to lean toward an easing of monetary policy, without actually cutting interest rates. That would give Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, discretion to make a cut before the next scheduled meeting, on Dec. 19, should he think conditions warrant it.   Most analysts expect the Fed to cut rates at that meeting, assuming that there is some progress toward reducing the Federal budget deficit, and that there is not a sudden burst of economic vigor. A surge of growth seems unlikely, even though the fourth quarters of 1992, 1993 and 1994 all turned out to be the strongest of the year by a wide margin.   This year the quarter has gotten off to a weak start. The latest evidence was the Fed\'s report today that production at the nation\'s factories, mines and utilities fell three-tenths of 1 percent in October.   That was the first decline since April, though several months have shown negligible gains or no increases and the September result was initially reported as a modest decline that was revised to a small gain. The severity of the October decline, however, was magnified by a strike at the Boeing Company, without which it would have been just one-tenth of 1 percent.   Nonetheless, analysts found little comfort in the report, which also showed that factory output was down two-tenths of 1 percent and about unchanged excluding the aircraft strike.   ""Production was weak across the board,"" Jerry Jasinowski, president of the National Association of Manufacturers, said in a statement. ""This traces back to the fact that inventories were not drawn down in the third quarter. Consequently, industrialists are adopting a cautious posture, keeping production lean until the existing stocks are sold off.""   He said the possibility of slack consumer demand in the coming weeks was ""an additional disincentive"" to stepped-up output.   A decline in the assembly of motor vehicles, to an annual rate of 11.6 million from 12 million, was the biggest factor in the weakened output of consumer goods.   The Fed\'s report also showed that the utilization rate, which represents the percentage of capacity at which industry is operating, fell to 83.6 percent last month from 84.1 percent in September. That matched the July pace as the lowest of the year and was nearly two points below the cyclical peak posted in December 1994 and January 1995.   The operating rate is closely watched as a sign of possible future inflation. While inflationary pressure ebbed in industry, at the consumer level, prices edged up last month.   The Labor Department reported that the Consumer Price Index climbed three-tenths of 1 percent on an overall basis as well as with the erratic food and energy components excluded.   While the increase was a bit bigger than expected, analysts found little to fret about, noting that some of the chief contributors -- airline fares, apparel and meat -- could be expected to reverse course in November.   ""We do not believe this signals significantly higher inflation,"" Laurence H. Meyer & Associates, a St. Louis consultancy, told clients.   Energy prices rose four-tenths of 1 percent, after three months of declines, while food prices rose three-tenths of 1 percent, after an increase of four-tenths of 1 percent in September. Meat prices jumped 1.2 percent, but Patrick C. Jackman, a senior compiler of the index, said he knew of no reason for this to continue.   Prices of medical care rose three-tenths of 1 percent, the same rate as in September, with professional services showing less rapid gains and medical commodities rising more rapidly.   In the New York area, consumer prices moved up two-tenths of 1 percent in October and 2.6 percent over the last 12 months, compared with 2.8 percent for the nation as a whole.   Unlike the Federal Reserve, which generates its own budget and is operating normally despite the partial shutdown of the Government over the budget dispute, the Labor Department will issue no further figures until its statisticians are recalled to work. Mr. Jackman said that if the shutdown extended into next week, the report on consumer prices for November would be jeopardized. Only about half the data had been collected before today.

""this traces back to the fact that inventories were not drawn down in the third quarter. consequently, industrialists are adopting a cautious posture, keeping production lean until the existing stocks are sold off.""   he said the possibility of slack consumer demand in the coming weeks was ""an additional disincentive"" to stepped-up output.   a decline in the assembly of motor vehicles, to an annual rate of 11.6 million from 12 million, was the biggest factor in the weakened output of consumer goods.   the fed's report also showed that the utilization rate, which represents the percentage of capacity at which industry is operating, fell to 83.6 percent last month from 84.1 percent in september. that matched the july pace as the lowest of the year and was nearly two points below the cyclical peak posted in december 1994 and january 1995.   the operating rate is closely watched as a sign of possible future inflation. while inflationary pressure ebbed in industry, at the consumer level, prices edged up last month.   the labor department reported that the consumer price index climbed three-tenths of 1 percent on an overall basis as well as with the erratic food and energy components excluded.   while the increase was a bit bigger than expected, analysts found little to fret about, noting that some of the chief contributors -- airline fares, apparel and meat -- could be expected to reverse course in november.   ""we do not believe this signals significantly higher inflation,"" laurence h. meyer & associates, a st. louis consultancy, told clients.   energy prices rose four-tenths of 1 percent, after three months of declines, while food prices rose three-tenths of 1 percent, after an increase of four-tenths of 1 percent in september. meat prices jumped 1.2 percent, but patrick c. jackman, a senior compiler of the index, said he knew of no reason for this to continue.   prices of medical care rose three-tenths of 1 percent, the same rate as in september, with professional services showing less rapid gains and medical commodities rising more rapidly.   in the new york area, consumer prices moved up two-tenths of 1 percent in october and 2.6 percent over the last 12 months, compared with 2.8 percent for the nation as a whole.   unlike the federal reserve, which generates its own budget and is operating normally despite the partial shutdown of the government over the budget dispute, the labor department will issue no further figures until its statisticians are recalled to work. mr. jackman said that if the shutdown extended into next week, the report on consumer prices for november would be jeopardized. only about half the data had been collected before today.   graphs: ""capacity utilization"" shows total output capacity as apercentage of capacity from may 1994 to dec. oct. 1995.

158,2004-06-30,"['WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve began the long climb back from a historic period of cheap money by raising its target for short-term interest rates to 1.25% from 1%. In a statement, the Fed suggested it will continue to raise the federal-funds rate a quarter-point at a time, saying it can move ""at a pace that is likely to be measured."" But it included a caveat that policy makers ""will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to fulfill its obligation to maintain price stability."" That is a warning that the central bank is apt to move to half-percentage-point increases if inflation accelerates. Both the rate increase and accompanying statement were largely as markets expected, thanks to an unprecedented Fed effort to telegraph its plans over recent months and minimize any shock to the markets. It succeeded: Stock and bond prices barely reacted in the first half-hour after the announcement. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, down 17 points just before the announcement, finished the day up 22.05 points at 10435.48. The yield on the 10-year Treasury bond, a benchmark for long-term borrowing, stood at 4.63% just before the 2:15 p.m. announcement, then rallied late in the day to end at 4.59%, down from Tuesday\'s close of 4.69%. The Fed\'s action was as surprising as getting ""a tie for Father\'s Day,"" UBS AG trader Art Cashin said on CNBC. The Fed noted that recent inflation readings were ""somewhat elevated"" but added that ""a portion of the increase in recent months appears to have been due to transitory factors."" It said risks to economic growth and inflation in coming months are balanced. ""Output is continuing to expand at a solid pace and labor-market conditions have improved,"" it said. All 12 voting members of the policy-making Federal Open Market Committee backed the increase in the federal funds rate, which is charged on overnight loans between banks. In a related move, the central bank also raised its discount rate, charged on its short-term advances to commercial banks, by a quarter percentage point to 2.25%, acting on requests from all 12 reserve banks. Several commercial banks responded by raising their prime lending rate, the benchmark for many business and consumer loans, to 4.25% from 4%. Before long, the Fed\'s rate increase should start rippling through to credit-card rates, adjustable-rate mortgages and, for savers, to money-market account yields and CD rates. But for many businesses and consumers, borrowing costs started to rise in April when investors began to anticipate the Fed\'s move to tighter monetary policy. Although bond yields fell yesterday, they are up almost a percentage point from their March lows. Mortgage rates and corporate-bond rates have followed suit. As a result, applications to refinance mortgages -- a major source of extra spending cash in recent years -- have fallen by about three-quarters since March. However, applications to purchase homes, though down a bit from May, remain well above last year\'s levels. Economists consider a ""neutral"" funds rate -- which neither stimulates nor restrains the economy -- to be between 3% and 5%. Investors expect the funds rate to reach 2.25% by the end of this year, and 3.75% by the end of 2005. Having restated its plans to be ""measured,"" the Fed likely will be reluctant to raise rates more than a quarter-point at its next meeting on Aug. 10. Fed officials believe the credibility of their communications strategy depends on matching their words with actions. Abandoning ""measured"" rate increases right after reiterating the policy, even with a caveat, could weaken that credibility. But officials also realize that with inflation near the top of the 1%-to-2% inflation zone they informally define as price stability, they have less margin for error than they hoped for a few months ago. The 12-month inflation rate, by the Fed\'s preferred measure, excluding the more volatile food and energy components, jumped unexpectedly quickly from January to May, to 1.6% from 1.1%. Moreover it is running at a 2.3% annual rate in the last six months. (Inflation as measured by the better-known Consumer Price Index, including food and energy components, is running at 3.1% in the 12 months through May.) Indeed, by noting yesterday that a ""portion"" of the increase in inflation was transitory -- a likely reference to higher commodity prices, which have eased a bit lately -- the Fed implied a portion also reflected changed economic fundamentals, such as job and wage growth. Since the funds rate has a long way to go to reach neutral, the Fed would have to quickly switch to more aggressive rate increases if it discovered it has been too sanguine about inflation. ""We\'re one bad inflation number away"" from the Fed having to raise interest rates by one-half a percentage point in August, instead of a quarter-point, said Mickey Levy, chief economist at Bank of America. The Fed last raised the funds rate in May 2000, to 6.5%, to cool an economic boom fueled by a bubble in stocks and technology investment spending. Over the next three years it cut the rate 13 times to 1%, the lowest since 1958, first in response to those bursting bubbles, then to a wave of corporate-accounting and governance scandals and the build-up to the Iraq war, which restrained business confidence. As those traumas subsided and job creation took off in March after a year of stagnation, the case for easy policy rapidly melted away. Some critics worry the Fed has waited too long. The funds rate has been below the annual inflation rate for 20 straight months. That\'s the longest such stretch of negative ""real"" interest rates since 1974-76, a period in which the Fed is now widely acknowledged to have been too lax, leading to the double-digit inflation of that era. The real funds rate has averaged 1.8% since 1954. Throughout the Fed, a growing number of people have been fretting over these developments. Last month, the Cleveland Fed\'s research director, Mark Sniderman, published alternative lyrics to Bob Dylan\'s ""The Times They Are a-Changin\' "" in a bank publication, titled, ""The Rates They Are A-changin\'."" They began: ""Come gather \'round people wherever you roam/Recognize that inflation around you has grown."" The Fed may get some extra breathing room from signs that economic growth slowed a bit in the last two months, such as an unexpected slowing in manufacturing activity in the Chicago area, according to a purchasing managers\' report yesterday. Still, former Fed governor Laurence Meyer said he doubts the economy will slow enough to prevent an August rate increase. It\'s more likely, he said, that an inflation scare will put a half-point increase on the table. He noted that growth has slowed while job gains have accelerated, which means growth in productivity is slowing and labor costs accelerating -- a trend Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan is watching closely. Anecdotal information also points to continued upward pressure on prices: In May, 28% of restaurants identified rising food costs as their top challenge, up from 22% in April, according to a survey released by the National Restaurant Association yesterday. If the choice between quarter-point and half-point moves is close, election considerations may tip the Fed toward the smaller move, Mr. Meyer said. Fed officials have historically tried to lower their profile in the run-up to elections to avoid being drawn into controversy. In a recent study, New York Fed economist Rebecca Hellerstein looked at FOMC members\' votes from 1973 to 1994, and concluded there is a ""dead spot"" in the year before presidential elections in which FOMC members are 12% less likely to vote to raise rates for a given forecast of the economy. Both parties have begun spinning higher interest rates in their favor -- Republicans as evidence of a healthy economic recovery, Democrats as evidence that President Bush\'s large budget deficits are driving up the cost of borrowing. But neither Mr. Bush nor his Democratic challenger, Sen. John Kerry, is likely to criticize the Fed itself. Mr. Bush just reappointed the 78-year-old Mr. Greenspan to a fifth term. Mr. Kerry backed that decision.

159,2004-06-30,"['The Federal Reserve\'s first rate hike in more than four years proved to be anticlimactic for financial markets, as it was about as well-advertised as these things can be. The Fed\'s move was anything but trivial, however, as it kicked off a policy transition that gradually will end the Fed\'s sustained stimulus that began back in 2001. There are good reasons to anticipate a relatively muted investor response, however: Market prices already anticipate that short-term interest rates will be pushed back to more normal levels over the coming year. In contrast, the Fed\'s previous policy tightening, in 1994, triggered a massive global bond selloff, as investors were surprised repeatedly by Fed actions in response to an unexpectedly robust economic expansion. --- The market\'s uneventful response to the Fed\'s rate increase makes it easy to miss the key implications of recent developments. In broad terms, the power of monetary policy action to combine both long-term inflation goals with short-term stabilization tasks has been confirmed, even in the context of globalized and deregulated financial markets -- and a series of unusual shocks. It\'s easy to forget that only one year ago, the threat of deflation was judged widely to represent the United States\' most immediate economic danger. In fact, many analysts and investors predicted at that time that the Federal Reserve was about to conduct ""unconventional"" policy easing -- that is, buying securities directly from private investors -- something that had been attempted only once, when the Fed pegged all interest rates during World War II. It didn\'t happen last year, but the worries about low inflation weren\'t illusory -- the core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) chain price index dipped below 1% last winter on a rolling 12-month basis for the first time since the measure\'s inception in 1959. From today\'s vantage point, the U.S. economy\'s renewed economic vigor is a reminder that monetary policy remains a potent short-term stabilization tool. Not only were deflation worries building a year ago, but many expressed concern that Fed policy would be inadequate to overcome the allegedly irresistible contractionary impact of the late 1990s economic and financial imbalances. The classic skeptics\' image of the Fed pushing on a string once again became cliche. Nonetheless, the current U.S. upturn overcame a series of shocks as potentially threatening as those of the late 1920s. The restoration of robust U.S. growth while avoiding deflation should not obscure the Fed\'s success in reaching its key long-term goal of price stability. Twenty-five years after the Federal Reserve -- under Chairman Paul Volcker -- administered draconian rate hikes to combat double-digit inflation, Alan Greenspan was able to describe the U.S. economy as having entered a ""zone of price stability."" Over most of the intervening span, Fed policy could be described as one of ""opportunistic disinflation."" That is, the Fed didn\'t set out to create downturns. However, when slumps occurred -- thereby ratcheting down inflation -- the Fed would act preemptively to hold onto the inflation gains. In practice, this sustained strategy eventually achieved price stability amidst two long economic booms and an unprecedented bull market in financial assets. Of course, the Fed had no intention of triggering a recession when it tightened cautiously in 1999 and early 2000. In that sense, the 2001 economic downturn was an accident. Presumably, the Fed would not have tightened at that time had policy makers known what was coming. Nonetheless, the result was the final step to price stability, as the economy contracted in 2001, Thus, the Fed\'s task has become one of preserving -- not establishing -- low inflation. By implication, a new policy approach will be needed to supplant opportunistic disinflation. For now, the Fed is on a path to end its current stimulus by renormalizing short-term interest rates. Despite claims by some observers that the Fed has waited too long to begin tightening, the Fed\'s move yesterday marks one of the earliest ever undertaken, when judged using the factors that typically guide such actions, including the current inflation rate and the likely margin of excess capacity. For example, the Fed rarely has begun to withdraw its stimulus before employment has returned to its pre-slowdown peak. Today, however, total employment is 1.3 million lower than at the recession\'s onset in early 2001. In other words, Fed officials appear to be intent on preserving price stability, now that it has been attained. The FOMC\'s policy statement made it clear that the Fed ""will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to fulfill its obligation to maintain price stability."" Investors may be confused about the Fed\'s intentions, because the earlier cut in the Fed funds rate to 1% was unprecedented. However, the funds rate is no more stimulative today than in other, similar periods when judged in real (that is, inflation-adjusted) terms. For example, today\'s 1.25% nominal funds rate -- with the year-on-year increase in the Fed\'s favored core PCE price index at 1.5% -- is no lower in real terms than the 3% funds rate was a decade ago when inflation was close to 3%. Presumably, the Fed\'s aim is to withdraw its stimulus at a pace that will return short-term interest rates to neutral by the time the economy reaches full employment. That likely will require the funds rate to be raised to around 4%. Even if it takes a year or more to reach that point, the persistence of substantial slack in the economy ought to keep inflation in check. Gradual Fed tightening well ahead of schedule signals that the central bank is moving its sights back to its primary long-term goal of price stability. In practice this is likely to mean keeping inflation in the 1% to 2% band for year-on-year increases in the core PCE deflator that has been maintained since 1996. Although the Fed has never acknowledged any specific target range, by implication a sustained 1% to 2% year-on-year increase in core inflation would represent a fair approximation. Such an outcome likely would match the Fed\'s fundamental goal of keeping inflation low enough that it does not distort investment decisions. If the Fed is successful in allowing the economy to return to full employment while maintaining price stability, the result will be a positive surprise for investors. Although financial market participants appear to have assumed that the Fed will be tolerant if inflation rises into at least a 2% to 3% range -- a conclusion that is consistent with surveys of inflation expectations -- the Fed\'s early transition back to normal short-term rates contradicts that claim. Securing price stability therefore will establish a constructive backdrop for financial assets. Obviously, equity investors are nervous about the prospect of higher Fed interest rates. However, vigorous noninflationary growth creates a more positive environment for corporate earnings than the slower growth that originally motivated the Fed to lower interest rates to emergency levels. Naturally, long-term interest rates would be expected to rise as the economy improves, but long-term rates have climbed significantly in anticipation of Fed tightening. In this context, the Fed\'s resolve to maintain price stability is the best way to keep bond yields relatively low. --- Mr. Lipsky is chief economist, and Mr. Glassman senior economist, at JP Morgan.

well-advertised as these things can be. the fed's move was anything but trivial, however, as it kicked off a policy transition that gradually will end the fed's sustained stimulus that began back in 2001. there are good reasons to anticipate a relatively muted investor response, however: market prices already anticipate that short-term interest rates will be pushed back to more normal levels over the coming year. in contrast, the fed's previous policy tightening, in 1994, triggered a massive global bond selloff, as investors were surprised repeatedly by fed actions in response to an unexpectedly robust economic expansion. --- the market's uneventful response to the fed's rate increase makes it easy to miss the key implications of recent developments. in broad terms, the power of monetary policy action to combine both long-term inflation goals with short-term stabilization tasks has been confirmed, even in the context of globalized and deregulated financial markets -- and a series of unusual shocks. it's easy to forget that only one year ago, the threat of deflation was judged widely to represent the united states' most immediate economic danger. in fact, many analysts and investors predicted at that time that the federal reserve was about to conduct ""unconventional"" policy easing -- that is, buying securities directly from private investors -- something that had been attempted only once, when the fed pegged all interest rates during world war ii. it didn't happen last year, but the worries about low inflation weren't illusory -- the core personal consumption expenditures (pce) chain price index dipped below 1% last winter on a rolling 12-month basis for the first time since the measure's inception in 1959. from today's vantage point, the u.s. economy's renewed economic vigor is a reminder that monetary policy remains a potent short-term stabilization tool. not only were deflation worries building a year ago, but many expressed concern that fed policy would be inadequate to overcome the allegedly irresistible contractionary impact of the late 1990s economic and financial imbalances. the classic skeptics' image of the fed pushing on a string once again became cliche. nonetheless, the current u.s. upturn overcame a series of shocks as potentially threatening as those of the late 1920s. the restoration of robust u.s. growth while avoiding deflation should not obscure the fed's success in reaching its key long-term goal of price stability. twenty-five years after the federal reserve -- under chairman paul volcker -- administered draconian rate hikes to combat double-digit inflation, alan greenspan was able to describe the u.s. economy as having entered a ""zone of price stability."" over most of the intervening span, fed

160,1997-05-20,"[""WASHINGTON, May 20 -- The Federal Reserve voted today to leave interest rates unchanged, betting that the economy was slowing sufficiently to avert a resurgence of inflation. The central bank's policy-making body had increased the key short-term rate it controls by a quarter point, to 5.50 percent, at its last meeting two months ago, saying that strong growth and low unemployment were creating the conditions that could push wages and prices higher and endanger the economy's expansion. In passing up the chance today to raise rates again, it heeded, at least for now, warnings from some economists that a further increase would have little economic justification or political support because there is almost no sign that inflation is taking root. The decision heartened investors, who sent stock prices surging. After falling early in the day, the Dow Jones industrial average rallied after the Federal Reserve's announcement in the early afternoon, closing at 7,303.46, up 74.58 points. Bond prices rose moderately, and the dollar -- which would have become a more attractive investment if interest rates were higher in this country -- fell. (Page D1.) Analysts said that the Federal Reserve might still feel compelled to raise rates again this year, perhaps at its next policy meeting in July. They said the decision today was driven by clear evidence that economic growth had moderated substantially from the 5.6 percent rate of the first quarter, as well as by reports showing that inflation was almost nonexistent at the producer level and subdued at the consumer level. Some economists also saw today's decision as evidence of an increased willingness on the part of the Federal Reserve and its chairman, Alan Greenspan, to be open to the possibility that the economy could grow without igniting inflation. The alternative to such a decision is to fall back reflexively on the convention that growth rates that are more than about 2.25 percent when unemployment is less than 5 percent will inevitably lead to sharp increases in wages and prices. ''There's an experiment going on here, and the Fed is letting growth roll,'' said Allen Sinai, an economist at Primark Decision Economics, a consulting firm. Mr. Sinai and others said economists were being forced to re-examine their old rules of thumb about growth and inflation because of an array of changes that are reshaping the economy. Huge investments by businesses in new technology appear to have bolstered productivity in ways that official statistics do not capture. Instead of passing cost increases along to consumers, companies increasingly try to wring them out of their own production processes. Workers are more willing to accept modest pay raises, or to tie their compensation to performance or efficiency. The globalization of commerce has intensified competition in many industries. ''So much has changed in our economy that it would be a mistake to assume the old rules apply,'' Mr. Sinai said. ''What Greenspan has shown us again and again in his tenure is the ability to understand how the world does change and still keep his eye on the ball of price-level stability.'' Today's meeting of the Fed's policy-making arm, the Federal Open Market Committee, came against a backdrop of vociferous opposition to further rate increases from across the political spectrum and from both the business community and organized labor. Opponents argued that in raising rates in March to slow demand by making borrowing more expensive, Mr. Greenspan had gone too far with his policy of eradicating inflationary pressures before they took root. The rate increase caused a sharp selloff in the stock market, which has recovered since then. While Mr. Greenspan's willingness to hold off on further rate increases no doubt has its limits, today's decision was applauded by many of the groups that had criticized the rate increase in March. ''From living rooms to board rooms, anyone concerned with economic growth and continued high employment can breathe easier,'' said Jerry Jasinowski, the president of the National Association of Manufacturers. ''The Fed recognized that there is no need to fix an unbroken economy.'' In holding rates steady today, the Federal Reserve was clearly betting on a repeat of the events in the economy last year: a period of unusually strong growth followed by a slowdown that bled off any mounting inflationary pressure, averting the need for action. Still, the risks in the strategy are  substantial. The economy grew 3.8 percent in the last quarter of 1996, and then by 5.6 percent in the first three months of this year. With unemployment at 4.9 percent in April, traditional economic forecasts predicted that employers would begin bidding up wages to attract the workers needed to keep increasing their output, and that wage increases would feed through to consumers in the form of higher prices. At its meeting in March, the Fed decided that the risks of accelerating inflation were sufficient to justify a small step to cool down the economy. It therefore raised the target for the Federal funds rate -- the rate that banks charge each other for overnight loans -- to 5.50 percent from 5.25 percent. As Mr. Greenspan put it in a speech this month defending the move, ''The risk to the economy from inaction came to outweigh the risk from action.'' But since then nearly all the economic evidence has suggested that inflation remains well contained, that the consumer spending binge that drove growth earlier in the year has cooled off and that companies have built big inventories that they must sell before placing new orders -- all factors suggesting that the economy is not overheating. At a minimum, the Federal Reserve decided today that it could afford to wait at least until its July meeting to get a clearer indication of whether the economy was slowing sufficiently on its own to eliminate the inflation threat, analysts said. ''The real question is what the incoming information will look like over the next six weeks,'' said Richard D. Rippe, an economist at Prudential Securities. Analysts said the decision today may also have been influenced by the agreement between the Clinton Administration and the Republican leadership in Congress on a plan to eliminate the Federal budget deficit. Mr. Greenspan has pushed hard for deficit reduction, saying a credible plan to balance the budget would help bring down interest rates. To raise rates immediately after a bipartisan budget agreement could have undermined the considerable respect Mr. Greenspan enjoys on Capitol Hill, they said. ''Mr. Greenspan has proven himself very adept over the years in sensing which way the political wind is blowing, and apparently he decided that the Fed needed more ammunition before tightening again,'' economists at First Union Capital Markets said in a report today. 04:34 EDT May 21, 1997""]","[""washington, may 20 -- the federal reserve voted today to leave interest rates unchanged, betting that the economy was slowing sufficiently to avert a resurgence of inflation. the central bank's policy-making body had increased the key short-term rate it controls by a quarter point, to 5.50 percent, at its last meeting two months ago, saying that strong growth and low unemployment were creating the conditions that could push wages and prices higher and endanger the economy's expansion. in passing up the chance today to raise rates again, it heeded, at least for now, warnings from some economists that a further increase would have little economic justification or political support because there is almost no sign that inflation is taking root. the decision heartened investors, who sent stock prices surging. after falling early in the day, the dow jones industrial average rallied after the federal reserve's announcement in the early afternoon, closing at 7,303.46, up 74.58 points. bond prices rose moderately, and the dollar -- which would have become a more attractive investment if interest rates were higher in this country -- fell.

161,2000-11-15,"['NEW YORK -- Bond prices rallied, even as Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged, amid growing signs the U.S. economy is slowing. Investors have begun to bet that the Fed\'s next move will be to lower rates, as long as the economy keeps cooling off.    In late trading, the 10-year Treasury note rose 11/32, or $3.438 for a bond with $1,000 face value, at 100 7/32. The bond\'s yield, which moves in the opposite direction of its price, fell to 5.702%. The price of 30-year Treasury bonds rose 23/32, to yield 5.765%, while two-year notes was unchanged at 5.885%.    The Fed left the fed-funds rate, or its target Fed funds overnight interbank rate, at 6.5%, and also kept in place it bias toward a ""risk of heightened inflation pressures"" and the higher interest rates that would be needed to fight such pressures.    The Fed\'s decision was widely anticipated, but while some investors were disappointed the Fed kept its so-called bias tilted in favor of further rate increases others took heart by the wording in the Fed\'s statement accompanying its announcements, figuring the chances for a rate cut down the line had been raised.    In its statement, the Fed acknowledged softer ""business and household demand and tightening conditions in financial markets"" over recent months, and said those factors ""suggest that the economy could expand for a time at a pace below the productivity-enhanced rate of growth of its potential to produce.""    ""The FOMC [Federal Open Market Committee] now recognizes that the economy is growing below the speed limit, and it also recognizes the risks of a greater slowdown,"" says Peter Hooper, chief U.S. economist at Deutsche Bank, adding, ""If signs of slowing growth continue and if the labor market begins to loosen up a bit in the next month, we could well see a shift to neutral at the Dec. 19 meeting.""    ""They opened the door"" toward a neutral stance on rates, agreed Henry Wilmore, chief U.S. economist at Barclays Capital in New York, adding, ""They\'ll probably do it in the first half of next year, though lowering rates might be in the second half of the year.""    The federal-funds futures contract for February traded at a yield of 6.43% late yesterday, unchanged on the day. That suggests about a 30% chance that the Fed will lower rates by the end of February, according to traders.    The little-changed outlook for Fed policy makers helped push the yield curve, or the plot of yields compared with maturities in the Treasury market, into a flatter, or more inverted, position.    Traders said the yield-curve flattening was a reversal of steepening trades that had been put on by speculative traders in recent days, in bets that the Fed would somehow alter its outlook for interest rates.    Treasurys across the yield curve got a further modest boost after weaker-than-expected U.S. industrial production data were released at 9:15 a.m. EST, showing output declined 0.1% in October. An afternoon downturn in stocks also was seen as a supportive factor for bonds.    Some traders pointed to a troubling announcement by two big banks, Bank of America Corp. and First Union Corp., that it may classify sizable loans to a single borrower as nonperforming. The move, and a fall in shares of many banks yesterday, could suggest problems below the economy\'s surface that will soon appear. If such problems emerge, it could reduce pressures on inflation, loosen the labor market and encourage the Fed to lower rates.    Indeed, some traders said the Treasury market, which has been strong in the past two days, has more room to rally.    ""A lot of money managers have cash to put to work, and there\'s not a lot of hope for stocks right now,"" said Michael McGlone, market analyst, Aubrey G. Lanston & Co. ""I like the momentum in the market.""    While the primary arena of the investment-grade corporate-bond market was flush with fresh supply, the secondary market remained directionless, with uncertainty weighing on investors\' minds.    Yield spreads to Treasurys ended weaker, with the bank sector hardest hit on the back of concerns over loans by First Union and Bank of America to a company, widely believed to be Sunbeam Corp.    Levels on bonds of Bank of America and First Union gapped wider by as much as 0.20 percentage point during the session, traders said.    The broader market was marginally weaker, but it largely shrugged off the Fed\'s decision to leave interest rates and its bias unchanged, which market observers expected.    In the primary arena, Brooklyn, N.Y.-based utility KeySpan Corp. sold $1.65 billion of debt in three parts.    The $700 million five-year notes were priced at a yield margin of 1.60 percentage points over Treasurys, the $700 million 10-year at 1.90 over Treasurys and $250 million of 30-year debt at 2.15 over Treasurys.    The offering was multiple times oversubscribed, which reflects investors\' preference to stick to high-quality credits in defensive sectors, said Bob LoBue, head of North American high-grade debt syndicate at J.P. Morgan Securities, the book runner on KeySpan\'s deal.    Capital One Bank brought a $1.25 billion offering of asset-backed credit-card securities with some unusual features. Although planned at $750 million, the issue was increased in size because of strong investor demand, said an official at lead manager Chase Securities.    One unusual aspect was a swap transaction in which the issuer exchanged floating-rate for fixed-rate debt. Usually, a seller of fixed-rate debt looks to swap into floating.    A Chase official said in the current market climate, Capital One found it could sell floating-rate notes at more favorable terms.    Alex Roever, head of ABS research as Banc One Capital Markets, which was one of the co-managers, said the swap transaction was included in the issuing trust in accord with requirements of the new accounting standard FASB 133, which deals with gain on sale accounting.    Mr. Roever said the pricing of the three-year triple-A-rated notes was quite good at a spread of 0.10 percentage point over the one-month London interbank offered rate. He noted that last week, a similar transaction from Providian Bank commanded a spread of 0.12 percentage point over Libor.    ---    Shella Calamba and David Feldheim contributed to this article.

""i like the momentum in the market.""    while the primary arena of the investment-grade corporate-bond market was flush with fresh supply, the secondary market remained directionless, with uncertainty weighing on investors' minds.    yield spreads to treasurys ended weaker, with the bank sector hardest hit on the back of concerns over loans by first union and bank of america to a company, widely believed to be sunbeam corp.    levels on bonds of bank of america and first union gapped wider by as much as 0.20 percentage point during the session, traders said.    the broader market was marginally weaker, but it largely shrugged off the fed's decision to leave interest rates and its bias unchanged, which market observers expected.    in the primary arena, brooklyn, n.y.-based utility keyspan corp. sold $1.65 billion of debt in three parts.    the $700 million five-year notes were priced at a yield margin of 1.60 percentage points over treasurys, the $700 million 10-year at 1.90 over treasurys and $250 million of 30-year debt at 2.15 over treasurys.    the offering was multiple times oversubscribed, which reflects investors' preference to stick to high-quality credits in defensive sectors, said bob lobue, head of north american high-grade debt syndicate at j.p. morgan securities, the book runner on keyspan's deal.    capital one bank brought a $1.25 billion offering of asset-backed credit-card securities with some unusual features. although planned at $750 million, the issue was increased in size because of strong investor demand, said an official at lead manager chase securities.    one unusual aspect was a swap transaction in which the issuer exchanged floating-rate for fixed-rate debt. usually, a seller of fixed-rate debt looks to swap into floating.    a chase official said in the current market climate, capital one found it could sell floating-rate notes at more favorable terms.    alex roever, head of abs research as banc one capital markets, which was one of the co-managers, said the swap transaction was included in the issuing trust in accord with requirements of the new accounting standard fasb 133, which deals with gain on sale accounting.    mr. roever said the pricing of the three-year triple-a-rated notes was quite good at a spread of 0.10 percentage point over the one-month london interbank offered rate. he noted that last week, a similar transaction from providian bank commanded a spread of 0.12 percentage point over libor.    ---    shella calamba and david feldheim contributed to this article.

162,2000-11-15,"[""WASHINGTON, Nov. 15 -- Citing clear evidence that the economy has shifted into a lower gear, the Federal Reserve voted today to hold interest rates steady, but with unemployment low and energy prices high the central bank said it was not yet ready to proclaim that inflation was no longer a threat. The Fed's policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee did not allude to the uncertainty over the outcome of the presidential election or to the recent uncertainty in the stock market, but instead projected a business-as-usual tone in a statement that stressed the gradual cooling of the economy. The statement said economic growth appeared to have slowed to a rate below what most economists consider its noninflationary speed limit of about 4 percent a year. The Fed imposed six rate increases, totaling 1.75 percentage points, between June 1999 and May of this year, in an effort to bring economic growth into a range that would diminish inflation pressures. But the committee stressed that it still saw ''a risk of heightened inflation pressures'' stemming from the low rate of joblessness -- 3.9 percent in October -- and the rise earlier this year in oil prices. As a result, the committee said, it would remain on alert for inflation, a signal to Wall Street that it is not yet ready to contemplate reducing interest rates. Some investors had been betting that the Fed would sound the all-clear on inflation, and the outcome of today's meeting led to a broad fall in stock prices from their levels just before the committee's statement was released about 2:15 p.m. The Dow Jones industrial average, which had been up 115 points, dropped into negative territory after the Fed announced its decision. The Dow later recovered somewhat, closing at 10,707.60, up 26.54 points. Analysts said that if the economy remained on its current path, the Fed could consider dropping its policy bias toward raising rates as soon as its next meeting, on Dec. 19, and shift to a neutral policy that assumes the risks of inflation are no greater than the risk of the economy slowing too much. The committee's statement contained ''clear signs that the Fed is beginning to think that the conditions necessary to prompt a change in its stance might not be too far away,'' said Ian Shepherdson, an economist at High Frequency Economics, a consulting firm in Valhalla, N.Y. The statement was a classic of the on-the-one-hand, on-the-other-hand genre. It gave something both to hard-core inflation fighters within the Fed and those at the central bank who say they believe that a surge in productivity, the basic measure of business efficiency, will permit the economy to continue running at a brisk pace with little risk of inflation. ''The utilization of the pool of available workers remains at an unusually high level, and the increase in energy prices, though having limited effect on core measures of prices to date, still harbors the possibility of raising inflation expectations,'' the committee said in a statement. ''However, softening in business and household demand and tightening conditions in financial markets over recent months suggest that the economy could expand for a time at a pace below the productivity-enhanced rate of growth of its potential to produce,'' the statement said. Nonetheless, it continued, ''the risks continue to be weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate heightened inflation pressures in the foreseeable future.'' Today's decision left the Fed's benchmark federal funds target rate on overnight loans among banks at 6.5 percent and its discount rate on loans to banks from the Federal Reserve system at 6 percent. This is the fourth consecutive meeting at which the Fed has held rates steady, since raising both rates by half a percentage point in May. As they met this morning, Fed officials got more evidence that the slowdown was real. Industrial production declined 0.1 percent in October, the Fed said, with production of consumer goods down 0.5 percent, in part because of a drop in output of cars and trucks. The industrial production figures came on top of a raft of other statistics in the last few months showing that economic growth appears to be slowing. After growing at a 4.8 percent annual rate in the first quarter and a 5.6 percent annual rate in the second quarter, the economy expanded at a 2.7 percent rate in the third quarter. Although unemployment remains near a 30-year low, the pace of job creation has slackened, and if the economy continues to grow at a rate below its noninflationary potential, the unemployment rate would probably rise. And although consumer confidence remains at high levels, retail sales appear to be softening, in part because the stock market is no longer generating as much wealth. ''The evidence that the Fed called tentative and preliminary for a couple of meetings is now fairly conclusive: the economy's rate of growth has slowed,'' said Stuart G. Hoffman, chief economist at the PNC Financial Services Group in Pittsburgh. But it is not yet clear that the slowdown will eradicate the inflation pressures that have kept the Fed on alert. There is some tentative evidence that the tight labor market may be starting to push up compensation costs at a pace exceeding gains in productivity. And the surge in oil prices has put upward pressure on broad inflation gauges, though increases in most consumer prices have remained restrained. There are also enough risks lurking at home and abroad that analysts are reluctant to pronounce without caveats that the economy has achieved a ''soft landing'' in which growth can be expected to continue at a moderate but healthy rate and inflation would remain dormant. Among the risks is a sharp decline in the stock market, which has been particularly jumpy lately because of earnings disappointments and the uncertainty over the outcome of the presidential election. Other risks include the possibility of economic difficulties abroad, especially in Latin America, where Argentina is struggling to keep its economy and financial system on an even keel, and in Asia, where Japan's recovery remains lackluster and other nations are being hit hard by higher oil prices. To some extent, the outlook depends on how well productivity growth holds up as the economy slows. If the improvement in productivity fades, any downturn could be worsened, and could lead to continued inflation pressures even as the economy throttles back. In such a case, the Fed might be handcuffed, unable to stimulate the economy with lower rates.""]","[""washington, nov. 15 -- citing clear evidence that the economy has shifted into a lower gear, the federal reserve voted today to hold interest rates steady, but with unemployment low and energy prices high the central bank said it was not yet ready to proclaim that inflation was no longer a threat. the fed's policy-setting federal open market committee did not allude to the uncertainty over the outcome of the presidential election or to the recent uncertainty in the stock market, but instead projected a business-as-usual tone in a statement that stressed the gradual cooling of the economy. the statement said economic growth appeared to have slowed to a rate below what most economists consider its noninflationary speed limit of about 4 percent a year. the fed imposed six rate increases, totaling 1.75 percentage points, between june 1999 and may of this year, in an effort to bring economic growth into a range that would diminish inflation pressures. but the committee stressed that it still saw ''a risk of heightened inflation pressures'' stemming from the low rate of joblessness -- 3.9 percent in october -- and the rise earlier this year in oil prices. as a result, the committee said, it would remain on alert for inflation, a signal to wall street that it is not yet ready to contemplate reducing interest rates. some investors had been betting that the fed would sound the all-clear on inflation, and the outcome of today's meeting led to a broad fall in stock prices from their levels just before the committee's statement was released about 2:15 p.m. the dow jones industrial average, which had been up 115 points, dropped into negative territory after the fed announced its decision. the dow later recovered somewhat, closing at 10,707.60, up 26.54 points. analysts said that if the economy remained on its current path, the fed could consider dropping its policy bias toward raising rates as soon as its next meeting, on dec. 19, and shift to a neutral policy that assumes the risks of inflation are no greater than the risk of the economy slowing too much. the committee's statement contained ''clear signs that the fed is beginning to think that the conditions necessary to prompt a change in its stance might not be too far away,'' said ian shepherdson, an economist at high frequency economics, a consulting firm in valhalla, n.y. the statement was a classic of the on-the-one-hand, on-the-other-hand genre. it gave something both to hard-core inflation fighters within the fed and those at the central bank who say they believe that a surge in productivity, the basic measure of business efficiency, will permit the economy to continue running at a brisk pace with little risk of inflation.

165,2008-01-30,"['Seeking to nip an incipient recession in the bud, the Federal Reserve cut interest rates for the second time in nine days, in one of its most aggressive campaigns in decades to boost the nation\'s economy.    The Fed lowered its target for short-term interest rates by 0.5 percentage point to 3% yesterday, and left the door open to further cuts.    In its statement accompanying the move, the Fed said ""downside risks to growth remain,"" and that the central bank would ""act in a timely manner as needed to address those risks."" Investors widely expect the Fed to lower its benchmark rate again in March by 0.25 percentage point to 2.75%.    Yesterday\'s rate cut comes as the latest news suggests the economy continues to skirt recession despite a steep slump in housing and the continuing credit crunch, but financial markets remain fragile.    Stocks rose on news of the cut, which some investors had expected to be smaller, but the market tumbled late in the day after a downgrade of Financial Guaranty Insurance Co. by Fitch Ratings intensified worries about the credit ratings of bond insurers, which insure about $2.4 trillion of debt. Such downgrades could leave banks exposed to additional losses on the mortgage-backed debt they hold, further eroding their capital and limiting their ability to lend.    The Dow Jones Industrial Average, up as much as 201 points after the Fed announcement, ended the day down 37.47 points at 12442.83.    The government reported yesterday that the economy grew at a slower-than-expected 0.6% annual rate in the fourth quarter of 2007. Most of the weakness stemmed from companies trimming inventories, which makes future production cuts less likely. Consumer spending slowed, though to a still-respectable pace.    A private payroll survey also found employment jumped in January. That led some economists to expect the Labor Department tomorrow to report robust job growth for the month, after a slump in December.    Last week, on the heels of a global stock selloff, the Fed made a surprise 0.75-percentage-point cut in its target for the federal-funds rate, charged on overnight loans between banks. That it went ahead with yesterday\'s rate cut despite some encouraging economic data underlines its worries that slumping housing prices and associated losses on mortgages could yet drag the entire economy down. The Fed\'s 2.25 percentage points in rate reductions since September roughly equal the initial pace of cuts in early 2001 -- following the bursting of the tech bubble -- as the most rapid in two decades.    The big question now facing the Fed is whether it has done enough. Officials yesterday signaled continuing concerns about growth.    ""Financial markets remain under considerable stress, and credit has tightened further for some businesses and households,"" the Fed said in its statement. ""Recent information indicates a deepening of the housing contraction as well as some softening in labor markets,"" it added, echoing previous comments. But yesterday\'s statement also dialed back the sense of urgency, dropping the ""appreciable"" from what it said last Tuesday were ""appreciable downside risks to growth.""    The latest statement included a reminder of how much the Fed has done to date: ""Today\'s policy action, combined with those taken earlier, should help to promote moderate growth over time and to mitigate the risks to economic activity.""    Some analysts took that to mean the Fed doesn\'t expect to cut rates as low as 2.25%, as markets currently anticipate. ""While the Fed certainly left the door open for further action, the policy assessment did seem to tilt toward reining in expectations of significant additional action,""  Morgan Stanley economist Dave Greenlaw said in a note to clients.    But Tom Gallagher, an analyst at brokerage ISI Group, said, ""You can\'t be confident the Fed is done until you feel the market has a good handle on the extent of the financial crisis,"" which it clearly hasn\'t yet.    Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke, who celebrates his second anniversary in the job tomorrow, now faces a delicate challenge. If his policy is successful, the economy will escape recession, few additional rate cuts will be needed and, paradoxically, his actions to date may end up looking excessive.    ""If we end up worrying about inflation later this year that could well be the good outcome for the Fed because odds are it will mean that the economy has stabilized,"" said Peter Fisher, a former Fed official who is now co-head of fixed income for money manager  BlackRock Inc. ""It may end up looking like the pre-emptive easing was unnecessary . . . but that\'s the point of taking out insurance against the downside.""    If so, that would require the Fed to quickly reverse some of its rate cuts. ""They acted aggressively on the way down; that suggests they\'ll act as aggressively on the way up,"" said Vincent Reinhart, a former top Fed staffer now at the American Enterprise Institute, a Washington think tank.    But the Fed, like most of Wall Street, has already been fooled by several false dawns since the current credit crisis began in August. That means it\'s unlikely to sound the all-clear while financial markets remain jittery and credit markets remain tight. Yesterday\'s statement, while less dire than last Tuesday\'s, made it clear the next Fed move is far likelier to be a rate cut than an increase.    Until this month, the Fed had expected the troubles in housing and mortgage markets wouldn\'t spill over to the broader economy, and that inflation pressures would continue to percolate. That led it to release statements that continued to play up the risks of inflation, implying that rates might not fall much more.    That changed in January with news that consumer spending, employment and manufacturing activity had all downshifted. Concerns in the financial markets grew, as signified by the sharp drop in stocks at the start of the year.    The possibility that falling house prices will lead to more defaults and foreclosures, loss of bank capital, tighter lending and yet further declines in prices is now Mr. Bernanke\'s dominant concern. Yesterday afternoon, rating firm  Standard & Poor\'s downgraded or threatened to downgrade more than 8,000 mortgage investments.    Mortgage rates have dropped in the past month, and that has enabled many borrowers with adjustable-rate mortgages either to refinance into fixed-rate mortgages or see their current mortgages adjust to rates one to two percentage points lower than would have been the case several months ago, says Doug Duncan, chief economist at the Mortgage Bankers Association. He said while that means foreclosures may be less than expected, the drop in home prices means many borrowers will be unable to take advantage of lower rates, limiting the benefit.    If home prices fall 10%, a mortgage that was originally 95% of the home\'s value is now about 105%, and ""you may be required to bring some equity to the table in order to refinance,"" Mr. Duncan said.    Yesterday, many commercial banks responded to the Fed\'s action by lowering their prime rate, a benchmark for many consumer and business loans, to 6% from 6.5%. But long-term bond yields rose in anticipation that the rate cut would boost growth and the risk of inflation. That could lead to higher, rather than lower, mortgage rates in coming weeks.    Both last week\'s and yesterday\'s Fed statements played down concerns about inflation. The Fed ""expects inflation to moderate in coming quarters, but it will be necessary to continue to monitor inflation developments carefully.""    That view isn\'t universally shared at the Fed. Nine of the Federal Open Market Committee\'s 10 voting members approved yesterday\'s rate cut; Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas President Richard Fisher dissented, arguing for no cut. Three of the Fed\'s 12 reserve banks didn\'t ask for a corresponding half-point reduction in the discount rate, charged on direct Fed loans to banks, to 3.5%.    Indeed, in the past few weeks, expectations for inflation a few years from now, as measured by the behavior of Treasury-protected bonds, have risen by a quarter percentage point.    While Mr. Bernanke won\'t welcome that, he will likely conclude that the weaker economy he now expects, together with stable to lower energy prices, will help suppress those inflation pressures.

""financial markets remain under considerable stress, and credit has tightened further for some businesses and households,"" the fed said in its statement. ""recent information indicates a deepening of the housing contraction as well as some softening in labor markets,"" it added, echoing previous comments. but yesterday's statement also dialed back the sense of urgency, dropping the ""appreciable"" from what it said last tuesday were ""appreciable downside risks to growth.""    the latest statement included a reminder of how much the fed has done to date: ""today's policy action, combined with those taken earlier, should help to promote moderate growth over time and to mitigate the risks to economic activity.""    some analysts took that to mean the fed doesn't expect to cut rates as low as 2.25%, as markets currently anticipate. ""while the fed certainly left the door open for further action, the policy assessment did seem to tilt toward reining in expectations of significant additional action,""  morgan stanley economist dave greenlaw said in a note to clients.    but tom gallagher, an analyst at brokerage isi group, said, ""you can't be confident the fed is done until you feel the market has a good handle on the extent of the financial crisis,"" which it clearly hasn't yet.    fed chairman ben bernanke, who celebrates his second anniversary in the job tomorrow, now faces a delicate challenge. if his policy is successful, the economy will escape recession, few additional rate cuts will be needed and, paradoxically, his actions to date may end up looking excessive.    ""if we end up worrying about inflation later this year that could well be the good outcome for the fed because odds are it will mean that the economy has stabilized,"" said peter fisher, a former fed official who is now co-head of fixed income for money manager  blackrock inc. ""it may end up looking like the pre-emptive easing was unnecessary . . . but that's the point of taking out insurance against the downside.""    if so, that would require the fed to quickly reverse some of its rate cuts. ""they acted aggressively on the way down; that suggests they'll act as aggressively on the way up,"" said vincent reinhart, a former top fed staffer now at the american enterprise institute, a washington think tank.    but the fed, like most of wall street, has already been fooled by several false dawns since the current credit crisis began in august. that means it's unlikely to sound the all-clear while financial markets remain jittery and credit markets remain tight. yesterday's statement, while less dire than last tuesday's, made it clear the next fed move is far likelier to be a rate cut than an increase.    until this month, the fed had expected the troubles in housing and mortgage markets wouldn't spill over to the broader economy, and that inflation pressures would continue to percolate. that led it to release statements that continued to play up the risks of inflation, implying that rates might not fall much more.    that changed in january with news that consumer spending, employment and manufacturing activity had all downshifted. concerns in the financial markets grew, as signified by the sharp drop in stocks at the start of the year.    the possibility that falling house prices will lead to more defaults and foreclosures, loss of bank capital, tighter lending and yet further declines in prices is now mr. bernanke's dominant concern. yesterday afternoon, rating firm  standard & poor's downgraded or threatened to downgrade more than 8,000 mortgage investments.    mortgage rates have dropped in the past month, and that has enabled many borrowers with adjustable-rate mortgages either to refinance into fixed-rate mortgages or see their current mortgages adjust to rates one to two percentage points lower than would have been the case several months ago, says doug duncan, chief economist at the mortgage bankers association. he said while that means foreclosures may be less than expected, the drop in home prices means many borrowers will be unable to take advantage of lower rates, limiting the benefit.    if home prices fall 10%, a mortgage that was originally 95% of the home's value is now about 105%, and ""you may be required to bring some equity to the table in order to refinance,"" mr. duncan said.    yesterday, many commercial banks responded to the fed's action by lowering their prime rate, a benchmark for many consumer and business loans, to 6% from 6.5%. but long-term bond yields rose in anticipation that the rate cut would boost growth and the risk of inflation. that could lead to higher, rather than lower, mortgage rates in coming weeks.    both last week's and yesterday's fed statements played down concerns about inflation. the fed ""expects inflation to moderate in coming quarters, but it will be necessary to continue to monitor inflation developments carefully.""    that view isn't universally shared at the fed. nine of the federal open market committee's 10 voting members approved yesterday's rate cut; federal reserve bank of dallas president richard fisher dissented, arguing for no cut. three of the fed's 12 reserve banks didn't ask for a corresponding half-point reduction in the discount rate, charged on direct fed loans to banks, to 3.5%.    indeed, in the past few weeks, expectations for inflation a few years from now, as measured by the behavior of treasury-protected bonds, have risen by a quarter percentage point.    while mr. bernanke won't welcome that, he will likely conclude that the weaker economy he now expects, together with stable to lower energy prices, will help suppress those inflation pressures.

169,1995-07-06,"['Treasury prices surged yesterday after the Federal Reserve cut short-term interest rates by a quarter of percentage point.   The move matched the expectations of many in the market, which had already priced in a cut of that size. But many trader and analysts are still uncertain about how far the Fed\'s new course will take interest rates.   The central bank reduced the Federal funds rate, which banks charge each other for overnight loans, to 5.75 percent from 6 percent. The discount rate, which the Fed charges banks for short-term loans, was left unchanged at 5.25 percent. It is the first rate reduction since Sept. 4, 1992, and represents an about-face in monetary policy. The Fed had doubled the Federal funds rate over seven rate increases beginning in February 1994.   Some analysts had doubted that a rate cut would come at this meeting because of recent signs that the economy was not slowing as sharply as had been previously believed, increasing the possibility of a resurgance in inflation in the months ahead. Inflation erodes the value of fixed-income investments like bonds. Still, the move by the Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed\'s policy-making group, was a relatively small reduction.   ""The quarter-point move was one that I think all members of the Federal Open Market Committee could live with,"" said Donald Fine, chief market analyst for Chase Securities. ""A half-point move would have been too much for some, while an unchanged policy would have been too little for others.""   The price of the 30-year bond jumped 116/32 , to 11423/32 . Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, fell to 6.49 percent, from 6.60 percent on Wednesday.   Prices of shorter-term maturities, typically the most sensitive to changes in Fed policy, also rallied strongly, driving their rates down.The rate for a three-month bill fell 12 basis points, to 5.36 percent, and the rate for a six-month bill fell 17 basis points, to 5.24 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.   The yield spread between the two-year note and the 30-year bond widened to 98 basis points yesterday from 84 basis points on Wednesday, indicating that investors had indeed been expecting a cut in rates.   And the sharp surge in the short end of the market yesterday suggested that traders expect further cuts this year, said Anthony Chan, vice president and chief economist at Banc One Investment Advisors Corporation in Columbus, Ohio.

170,2002-05-07,"['NEW YORK -- Market watchers were holding their breath, hoping against all hope that stocks would actually be able to hold on to some of the sharp gains made in the session. But that was not to be. After climbing more than 110 points, the Dow Jones Industrial Average managed to finish the session just north of the baseline while the Nasdaq Composite Index ricocheted back and forth before settling in negative territory. It was a game of wait-and-see for much of the session on Wall Street as traders kept a close eye on what the Federal Reserve would say about interest rates and the economy. But it turns out the Fed\'s decision to keep interest rates unchanged at 1.75% and its continued cautious stance on the state of the economy could have been a replay from the last meeting. The Federal Open Market Committee maintained its balanced risk assessment and said that the economy has received an upward impetus due to the swing in inventory investment. But final demand continues to be an uncertainty for the economy. Many market watchers said the Fed\'s decision, while positive, was a nonevent for the market and wouldn\'t provide the catalyst needed to boost the indexes out of their funk. ""There had been a bunch of people waiting for Godot in waiting for the FOMC\'s decision,"" said Jeffrey Saut, chief investment strategist at Raymond James. ""But what we\'re seeing is that the strength we have seen in the economy of late was due to an inventory buildup and final demand is still questionable going forward. We\'re not going to double-dip but I think we\'re seeing that recovery will be muted."" But Mr. Saut added that while indications are for a muted recovery, prices for stocks in the aggregate continued to trade at levels suitable for a sharp rebound. For that reason, investors continued to advocate being conservative and as the session wound up, conservative trading turned more to jittery trading, with the Dow closing up 28.51 points, or 0.29%, to 9836.55 while the Nasdaq Composite Index shed 4.66 points, or 0.3%, to 1573.82 and the Standard & Poor\'s 500 Index dropped 3.18, or 0.3%, to 1049.49. The NYSE Composite Index closed at 565.35, down 2.33, or 0.41%. Mr. Saut said some of the jitters, particularly among technology issues, came in anticipation of Cisco Systems\' fiscal third-quarter earnings that were released after the closing bell. Cisco had been trading higher for most of the session as rumors circulated that the company would beat analyst estimates. As it turns out, there was some basis to those rumors. The stock closed up 19 cents to 13.08. After the bell, the company reported third-quarter earnings, before items of 11 cents a share, two cents better than estimates. Blue chips buoyed the Dow yesterday. Honeywell International was the strongest performer on the Dow, rising 1.80, or 5%, to 37.80. Analysts said investors were bidding up shares of Honeywell due to its relatively cheap valuation, as well as the belief that conglomerates might react favorably to the Fed\'s decision to leave interest rates unchanged. United Technologies also was seen benefiting from continued low interest rates due to its economically sensitive businesses. United Technologies gained 81 cents to 68.15. While unchanged interest rates may have played a role in the strength of some conglomerates, it didn\'t do much for others. General Electric fell 32 cents to 30.65 and the much-beaten-down Tyco continued to trail lower, down 35 cents to 19. International Business Machines was active among the Dow 30, although its strength seemed to defy some discouraging words by Chief Executive Samuel Palmisano. He delivered a gloomy outlook for technology spending to employees late last month and suggested there will have to be cost-cutting by Big Blue to adjust to the sluggishness, The Wall Street Journal reported. Still, IBM managed to rise 50 cents to 76.50. The newly merged Hewlett-Packard climbed as the company boasted that it and recently acquired Compaq Computer won $5.3 billion in new contracts in the three months leading up to the deal\'s completion. The announcement yesterday came as the combined company\'s management teams and continuing product lines were presented to employees and customers. H-P gained 19 cents to 18.41. Microsoft was another winner among blue-chip names. The software giant closed higher on word that it offered to buy Danish software company Navision for $1.3 billion. The move would be a significant step into the European enterprise resource planning, or ERP, market for Microsoft. Microsoft rose 85 cents to 49.47. A number of independent power producers were dragged lower as the specter of Enron continued to wreak havoc on the market. News that Enron may have artificially inflated California power prices last year cast doubt on the sector as a whole and investors were not willing to give companies active in the California market the benefit of the doubt. Among the decliners, Williams dropped 1.61, or 8.7%, to 16.90, Dynegy fell 2.59, or 17%, to 12.26 and Mirant shed 1.34, or 12%, to 9.75. Shares of communications chip maker Broadcom also were under pressure on word that one of its customers, Motorola, penned a deal with Broadcom\'s rival Texas Instruments. Motorola announced that it selected Texas Instruments to power its newest cable modem product. Broadcom\'s stock fell 5.22, or 17%, to 24.72 on concerns that if Texas Instruments managed to get all of Broadcom\'s Motorola business, that would have an 8% to 9% impact on Broadcom\'s revenue. Motorola rose 25 cents to 14.69 while Texas Instruments fell four cents to 27.51. Xerox continued to struggle with more worries after Merrill Lynch analyst Shannon Cross downgraded the stock\'s near-term rating to neutral from buy. The analyst said the stock should continue to trade sideways for awhile as the market grapples with the renegotiation of Xerox\'s $7 billion revolver, as well as the filing of its restated financials from 1997 through 2000 and its 2001 10K and first quarter of 2002 results. Xerox shares tumbled 22 cents to 7.50. Insurance company Metlife helped keep the insurance sector among the top decliners of the session. The company reported first-quarter earnings, before items, of 61 cents, three cents better than expectations. But on its conference call, Metlife said its individual business remains under pressure with flat top-line premium growth. In addition, the company said while it expects to cut operating expenses by $200 million in its individual business, it sees increased costs of about $60 million related to its pension and other post-retirement benefit plans. Metlife shed 2.29, or 6.7%, to 31.86. Providian Financial shares climbed higher after analysts increased their 2002 earnings estimates for the company following the news that the credit-card issuer beat first-quarter estimates and was selling some of its high-risk assets. Providian reported first-quarter continuing operations earnings of two cents a share, above the average analyst estimate of a loss. The stock closed up 54 cents, or 8.5%, to 6.89. Apparel retailers were also strong, aided by AnnTaylor Stores. Morgan Stanley upgraded the company to overweight from equal-weight, citing a strong summer line and the possibility of stronger same-store sales comparisons, as well as higher earnings. AnnTaylor gained 3.10, or 7.3%, to 45.40.']","['new york -- market watchers were holding their breath, hoping against all hope that stocks would actually be able to hold on to some of the sharp gains made in the session. but that was not to be. after climbing more than 110 points, the dow jones industrial average managed to finish the session just north of the baseline while the nasdaq composite index ricocheted back and forth before settling in negative territory. it was a game of wait-and-see for much of the session on wall street as traders kept a close eye on what the federal reserve would say about interest rates and the economy. but it turns out the fed's decision to keep interest rates unchanged at 1.75% and its continued cautious stance on the state of the economy could have been a replay from the last meeting. the federal open market committee maintained its balanced risk assessment and said that the economy has received an upward impetus due to the swing in inventory investment. but final demand continues to be an uncertainty for the economy. many market watchers said the fed's decision, while positive, was a nonevent for the market and wouldn't provide the catalyst needed to boost the indexes out of their funk.

171,2002-05-07,"['NEW YORK -- Treasurys, led by short maturities, rose modestly, as a day filled with economic data, Treasury auctions and a Federal Reserve policy meeting ultimately couldn\'t push the market out of its recent trading range. At 4 p.m., the benchmark 10-year note was up 6/32 point, or $1.88 per $1,000 face value, to 98 22/32. Its yield fell to 5.046% from 5.073% Monday, as yields move inversely to prices. The 30-year bond\'s price also gained 6/32 point, to 97 24/32, for a yield at 5.530%, down from 5.545% Monday. The Fed\'s policy-making Federal Open Market Committee left its target for the federal-funds rate at a 40-year low of 1.75% and signaled that it isn\'t inclined to raise that overnight-lending benchmark for a while. In a statement, policy makers cited concern that the rebound is still tentative and could run out of steam. ""The information that has become available since the last meeting of the committee confirms that economic activity has been receiving considerable upward impetus from a marked swing in inventory investment,"" the Fed panel said. ""Nonetheless, the degree of strengthening in final demand over coming quarters, an essential element in sustained economic expansion, is still uncertain."" Bonds reacted little, but already had recovered from early losses. The rebound came as many who had sold Treasurys before the five-year Treasury-note auction made offsetting purchases in expectation of the Fed decision. ""The decision from the Fed had been so widely expected for so long that we didn\'t see much reaction after the fact,"" said Vince Boberski, managing director at RBC Dain Rauscher in Chicago. As part of its quarterly refunding, Treasury sold $22 billion in new five-year notes, a record in the maturity. It will sell $11 billion of 10-year notes today, reopening an issue originally auctioned in February. The five-year note auction was awarded at 4.375%, in line with gray-market trading levels just before. When the jumbo offering came in as expected, it quelled some fears that the auction would send the market into a tailspin. ""At the last minute, people were able to get the auction where they wanted it to be, and that made for a good buying opportunity,"" said Donald Galante, government strategist at Mizuho Securities in Princeton, N.J. Analysts said that recently, five- and 10-year notes had lagged behind a rally in two-year and shorter maturities. That was because of trades that involved selling longer-dated issues and buying short-dated ones, as expectations for near-term Fed rate increases have diminished. Thus, the five- and 10-year notes being sold this week ""look cheap vs. twos and other short instruments,"" said Gemma Wright, head of market strategy at Barclays Capital in New York. ""That is helping to lure investors."" It may bode well for the 10-year note auction today, analysts said. In when-issued trading -- where dealers trade ahead of the auction -- the 10-year note was fetching 5.06%. Early in the day, the Labor Department said nonfarm productivity surged 8.6% in the first quarter, well-above market expectations of 7%, and the fastest rate in 19 years. But the bond market reacted with ambivalence, as people were mostly focusing on the five-year note auction later. The productivity report is ""good news for corporate profitability, but it will take some time before we see the results in terms of better corporate earnings,"" said Kevin Flanagan, fixed-income strategist at Morgan Stanley.  Corporate and Junk Bonds Investment-grade and junk bonds weakened, even though the Federal Reserve left rates unchanged. Investors cited varied concerns, ranging from continued fallout from Enron\'s collapse to worries about whether some companies can maintain access to capital. ""The price of money isn\'t the problem so much as the question, `Can companies roll their debts?\' "" said Vic Thompson, director of global capital markets at State Street Global Advisors. In new issues, Western Resources Inc. sold $765 million of five-year notes under Rule 144a via Salomon Smith Barney. A secured, $365 million part was priced to yield 3.42 percentage points over Treasurys, or 7.875%. It is rated Ba1 by Moody\'s Investors Service and triple-B-minus by Standard & Poor\'s. An unsecured, $400 million part was priced to yield 5.29 percentage points over Treasurys, or 9.75%. Ratings are Ba2 by Moody\'s and double-B-minus by S&P. Meanwhile, the junk market was awaiting an issue shortly of $470 million from Trump Hotels & Casino Resorts Inc. Trump Castle Associates 113/4% notes due 2003 -- which Trump would buy back at 100 cents on the dollar with proceeds from the planned sale -- were trading at 95 to 97. Some traders said the bonds weren\'t trading at par because of lingering concerns after Trump last year threatened to withhold payments on some $1.8 billion in debt until bondholders agreed to better terms. Others said the entire gambling sector was under pressure because of a threatened strike by the Las Vegas Culinary Union. --- Christine Richard and Nicole Bullock contributed to this article.']","['new york -- treasurys, led by short maturities, rose modestly, as a day filled with economic data, treasury auctions and a federal reserve policy meeting ultimately couldn't push the market out of its recent trading range. at 4 p.m., the benchmark 10-year note was up 6/32 point, or $1.88 per $1,000 face value, to 98 22/32. its yield fell to 5.046% from 5.073% monday, as yields move inversely to prices. the 30-year bond's price also gained 6/32 point, to 97 24/32, for a yield at 5.530%, down from 5.545% monday. the fed's policy-making federal open market committee left its target for the federal-funds rate at a 40-year low of 1.75% and signaled that it isn't inclined to raise that overnight-lending benchmark for a while. in a statement, policy makers cited concern that the rebound is still tentative and could run out of steam.

172,2002-05-07,"[""WASHINGTON, May 7 -- With new data suggesting that inflation will remain under control, the Federal Reserve voted unanimously today to hold its benchmark interest rate unchanged, saying the durability of the economic recovery remained uncertain. On a day when the Labor Department reported a bigger-than-expected surge in the growth rate of productivity, the central bank reiterated that it was not in any rush to raise interest rates, despite a sharp upturn in economic growth in the first quarter. The productivity gain is evidence that companies may be able to restore their depressed profit margins without having to jack up prices. The decision left the federal funds target rate on overnight loans among banks at a 40-year low, 1.75 percent, where it has been for nearly five months. Economists said the Fed would probably not seriously consider raising rates until August, especially if the unemployment rate continued to rise, as it has in recent months. On Wall Street, stock prices were little changed. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 28.51, to 9,836.55. The Nasdaq composite index closed at 1,573.82, down 4.66. In a statement, the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee stressed that the 5.8 percent economic growth rate in the first quarter was largely a one-time boost from companies' beginning to rebuild their inventories as the recession ended. It is not yet clear, the committee said, that economic activity is picking up on a sufficiently broad basis to ensure that a healthy expansion will continue. ''Economic activity has been receiving considerable upward impetus from a marked swing in inventory adjustment,'' the committee said. ''Nonetheless, the degree of the strengthening in final demand over coming quarters, an essential element in sustained economic expansion, is still uncertain.'' The Fed signaled that it expected to have to raise rates at some point, saying that the ''stance of monetary policy is currently accommodative.'' But it said it would maintain its position for now, given that the risks to the economy are evenly balanced between the risk of inflation and the possibility of another downturn. In remaining patient about when to begin reversing the Fed's string of 11 rate cuts last year, the Fed and its chairman, Alan Greenspan, have had the luxury of not having to worry much about inflation. Today's report on productivity, or output per hour, gave them further statistical reassurance that they are unlikely to feel pressed to act anytime soon just because of rising prices. Productivity in the first quarter rose at an 8.6 percent annual rate, its fastest pace since 1983. Productivity growth in last year's fourth quarter was revised, to 5.5 percent from 5.2 percent. Productivity growth measures the economy's ability to produce more goods and services with a given amount of labor. It is the most basic predictor of the economy's ability to expand without generating inflation. The assumption that the growth rate of productivity has fundamentally improved after a two-decade lag has been at the heart of speculation about a technology-driven ''new economy,'' an economy that is able to grow faster and sustain lower levels of unemployment than suggested by traditional economic theory. The surge in productivity has been driven in large part by relentless business competition. In industry after industry, companies have been unable to raise prices and have instead invested heavily in cost-saving technology, often combined with layoffs. In the last seven months, the unemployment rate rose 1.1 percentage points, to 6 percent in April. The result has been to get more production out of fewer workers. As a result, unit labor costs -- how much companies pay to workers per unit of production -- fell at a 5.4 percent annual rate in the first quarter. Lower costs should help companies fatten their profit margins, a development that could get Wall Street out of the doldrums, analysts said. ''We won't see another quarter as strong as the first,'' said a report today from Bruce Steinberg, chief economist at Merrill Lynch, ''but we do believe productivity will grow at a 4 percent rate or better during the rest of the year. If so, earnings should be up strongly, despite a lack of pricing power, and inflation should be a no-show.'' The consensus forecast for the economy for the rest of the year calls for a gradual recovery with a slow upturn in spending by companies on capital equipment, the sector hit hardest by the recession. But some economists remain concerned that the economy is very fragile, and that any shock, like another terrorist attack or a spike in oil prices, could put the United States into a deflationary spiral, in which a lack of demand would fuel a downward slide in prices. Japan has been enduring such a problem for years. Even those economists who do not worry about deflation say the Fed could be on hold for months if the unemployment rate continues to rise, as it typically does for months after the technical end of a recession.  Australia Raises Rate SYDNEY, Australia, Wednesday, May 8 (Bloomberg News) -- The Reserve Bank of Australia increased its benchmark interest rate a quarter of a percentage point from a 28-year low to keep inflation in check as the economy expands faster than expected. The central bank raised the overnight cash target rate to 4.5 percent, the first increase since August 2000, as annual inflation threatens to break through the top of the bank's target range. Australia's economy is expected to grow 3.9 percent this year, the International Monetary Fund said last month. That would be the second-fastest growth rate for industrial nations, behind Korea, whose central bank unexpectedly increased rates on Tuesday. Consumer prices rose 2.9 percent in the first quarter from a year earlier. That is near the top of the central bank's target range for annual inflation of 2 percent to 3 percent.""]","[""washington, may 7 -- with new data suggesting that inflation will remain under control, the federal reserve voted unanimously today to hold its benchmark interest rate unchanged, saying the durability of the economic recovery remained uncertain. on a day when the labor department reported a bigger-than-expected surge in the growth rate of productivity, the central bank reiterated that it was not in any rush to raise interest rates, despite a sharp upturn in economic growth in the first quarter. the productivity gain is evidence that companies may be able to restore their depressed profit margins without having to jack up prices. the decision left the federal funds target rate on overnight loans among banks at a 40-year low, 1.75 percent, where it has been for nearly five months. economists said the fed would probably not seriously consider raising rates until august, especially if the unemployment rate continued to rise, as it has in recent months. on wall street, stock prices were little changed. the dow jones industrial average rose 28.51, to 9,836.55. the nasdaq composite index closed at 1,573.82, down 4.66. in a statement, the policy-setting federal open market committee stressed that the 5.8 percent economic growth rate in the first quarter was largely a one-time boost from companies' beginning to rebuild their inventories as the recession ended. it is not yet clear, the committee said, that economic activity is picking up on a sufficiently broad basis to ensure that a healthy expansion will continue.

''we won't see another quarter as strong as the first,'' said a report today from bruce steinberg, chief economist at merrill lynch, ''but we do believe productivity will grow at a 4 percent rate or better during the rest of the year. if so, earnings should be up strongly, despite a lack of pricing power, and inflation should be a no-show.'' the consensus forecast for the economy for the rest of the year calls for a gradual recovery with a slow upturn in spending by companies on capital equipment, the sector hit hardest by the recession. but some economists remain concerned that the economy is very fragile, and that any shock, like another terrorist attack or a spike in oil prices, could put the united states into a deflationary spiral, in which a lack of demand would fuel a downward slide in prices. japan has been enduring such a problem for years. even those economists who do not worry about deflation say the fed could be on hold for months if the unemployment rate continues to rise, as it typically does for months after the technical end of a recession.  australia raises rate sydney, australia, wednesday, may 8 (bloomberg news) -- the reserve bank of australia increased its benchmark interest rate a quarter of a percentage point from a 28-year low to keep inflation in check as the economy expands faster than expected. the central bank raised the overnight cash target rate to 4.5 percent, the first increase since august 2000, as annual inflation threatens to break through the top of the bank's target range. australia's economy is expected to grow 3.9 percent this year, the international monetary fund said last month. that would be the second-fastest growth rate for industrial nations, behind korea, whose central bank unexpectedly increased rates on tuesday. consumer prices rose 2.9 percent in the first quarter from a year earlier. that is near the top of the central bank's target range for annual inflation of 2 percent to 3 percent.""]",36.0,1.0,"[""washington, may 7 -- with new data suggesting that inflation will remain under control, the federal reserve voted unanimously today to hold its benchmark interest rate unchanged, saying the durability of the economic recovery remained uncertain.

175,2009-09-23,"['Rising fears of inflation are fueling an investor rush into mutual funds and exchange-traded funds holding Treasury inflation-protected securities. So far this year, more than $17 billion has poured into funds that invest in TIPS, government-issued bonds whose principal grows with rising inflation, according to estimates from research firm Morningstar Inc. That compares with estimated net cash inflows of almost $10 billion for 2008. Their popularity reflects worries that massive U.S. government spending will eventually lead to high inflation, which could erode the value of stocks and ordinary bonds. But if inflation stays at current low levels longer than some investors expect, TIPS may not add much juice to a portfolio -- and could even drop in value. That said, many investors aren\'t in it for the yields, but for the protection they hope the bonds will provide if inflation suddenly surges. For now, TIPS buyers are brushing aside the prospect that the bonds won\'t do well if that much-feared inflation doesn\'t materialize. Indeed, many TIPS have been bid up to prices exceeding their face value. Total net assets for TIPS-focused mutual funds and ETFs were approximately $51 billion at the end of 2008. The mutual funds have gained an average 7.4% total return this year through Sept. 21, according to Morningstar. That showing, while nothing like the dizzying run-up in junk bonds, is much better than that of ordinary government bond funds, which have returned 2.6% so far this year. Richard Seelig, a retired high-school math teacher in Pelham, Mass., bought shares of the iShares Barclays TIPS Bond Fund last December for his Roth individual retirement account. ""I looked at the amount of money the government was spending that it didn\'t have, and I thought, well, that is going to come back to haunt us,"" he says. The Barclays fund, an ETF, has gained 8.2% this year through Sept. 21. TIPS pay a fixed interest rate every six months, known as a ""coupon,"" similar to ordinary Treasurys. But unlike Treasurys, TIPS\' principal value fluctuates with the inflation rate. Over the life of the bond, increases in the value of its principal aren\'t paid out, although investors who own TIPS outside of retirement accounts do pay taxes on any interim gains on the principal, as well as on any interest. When the bond reaches maturity, the inflation-adjusted principal is returned to investors. (If deflation were to occur, the adjustments to the principal would be negative, though a TIPS bond held to maturity will never return less than its original principal.) TIPS mutual funds, by contrast, pay out interest and principal gains on a regular basis. Like Treasurys, TIPS are exempt from state and local taxes. TIPS are issued in maturities of five, 10 and 20 years. A plain-vanilla 10-year Treasury currently yields about 3.5%, while a 10-year inflation-protected security yields about 1.6%, before inflation. The yield gap between 10-year TIPS and Treasurys, now about 1.8 percentage points, is called the break even rate and implies an expected annualized inflation rate of about 1.8% over 10 years. If inflation averages more than 1.8% over the period, then TIPS will outperform standard Treasurys. The lower the break-even rate is, the easier it is for TIPS to outperform the regular variety Treasury. But inflation alone doesn\'t determine how well TIPS perform. Supply and demand also play a role. And demand for TIPS is driven by inflation expectations, rather than actual inflation. Such expectations could drive TIPS prices higher, thereby shrinking yields, since price and yield move inversely. ""There has been a ton of money flowing into TIPS year to date, yet there\'s no inflation,"" says Lawrence Glazer, managing partner at Mayflower Advisors in Boston. Instead, money keeps pouring into the investments based on the expectation that inflation is ahead. If the break-even rate widens, that would imply investors foresee higher inflation. But once the Federal Reserve begins to address inflation, it will raise short-term interest rates, and that would push down the value of existing bonds. In that case, there would be two counterforces acting on TIPS: rising inflation or expectations of inflation pushing up demand and thereby pushing up prices; and rising short-term rates driving down prices. If the Fed pushes rates up faster than inflation rises or raises rates before inflation picks up, TIPS could rack up losses for their owners. They could also decline if inflation turns out milder than investors\' original expectations. Some investors say they want to wait to buy TIPS until they actually start to see the Fed raise interest rates, says Debra Brede, who runs D.K. Brede Investment Management Co., an investment-management firm in Needham, Mass. The risk: If inflation is already escalating when investors decide to buy TIPS, ""the bonds might be more expensive at that point,"" she says. Of course, given the anemic economy and high joblessness, any resurgence in inflation may be distant. ""Certainly not in the next couple quarters,"" says John Canavan, a research analyst at Stone &McCarthy Research Associates in Skillman, N.J. On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve announced that it decided to leave interest rates unchanged. In its accompanying policy statement, the Federal Open Market Committee noted that it ""expects that inflation will remain subdued for some time."" One caveat is that TIPS, which have been around only since 1997, don\'t have a track record during a period of sustained high inflation. Investors do have some other choices. If both inflation and economic growth are high, assets such as commodities and equities could outpace TIPS, says Dan Dektar, chief investment officer of Smith Breeden Associates\' investment management group in Durham, N.C. Investors can buy TIPS directly from the U.S. Treasury at TreasuryDirect.gov without incurring brokerage fees; some brokerage firms also allow clients to purchase new-issue or secondary-market TIPS without incurring fees. The next TIPS auction is for bonds with a 10-year maturity and is scheduled for Oct. 5. Many planners recommend that individual investors hold TIPS in retirement accounts, particularly if the client is in a higher tax bracket. ""TIPS are not tax-friendly,"" said Doug Flynn, a certified financial planner at Flynn Zito Capital Management in Garden City, N.Y. ""You\'re not buying these for tax efficiency, you\'re buying because you\'re scared of inflation."" For those who prefer mutual funds, which provide diversification and professional management, there are a variety of funds that invest in TIPS and a handful of exchange-traded funds. Allianz SE\'s Pacific Investment Management Co., or Pimco, has unveiled three new TIPS ETFs this year, targeting different maturities. One popular TIPS mutual fund is Vanguard Group\'s Inflation Protected Securities Fund, which aims to outdo the Barclays Capital U.S. TIPS Index and has about $25 billion in assets under management. The fund distributes both interest and any inflation adjustment to the principal on a quarterly basis, though most investors choose to reinvest distributions, said Ken Volpert, who heads Vanguard\'s taxable bond group and co-manages the fund. Keep in mind, though, there are circumstances in which an income distribution may not occur, such as when the rate of deflation exceeds the yield before inflation.']","['rising fears of inflation are fueling an investor rush into mutual funds and exchange-traded funds holding treasury inflation-protected securities. so far this year, more than $17 billion has poured into funds that invest in tips, government-issued bonds whose principal grows with rising inflation, according to estimates from research firm morningstar inc. that compares with estimated net cash inflows of almost $10 billion for 2008. their popularity reflects worries that massive u.s. government spending will eventually lead to high inflation, which could erode the value of stocks and ordinary bonds. but if inflation stays at current low levels longer than some investors expect, tips may not add much juice to a portfolio -- and could even drop in value. that said, many investors aren't in it for the yields, but for the protection they hope the bonds will provide if inflation suddenly surges. for now, tips buyers are brushing aside the prospect that the bonds won't do well if that much-feared inflation doesn't materialize. indeed, many tips have been bid up to prices exceeding their face value. total net assets for tips-focused mutual funds and etfs were approximately $51 billion at the end of 2008. the mutual funds have gained an average 7.4% total return this year through sept. 21, according to morningstar. that showing, while nothing like the dizzying run-up in junk bonds, is much better than that of ordinary government bond funds, which have returned 2.6% so far this year. richard seelig, a retired high-school math teacher in pelham, mass., bought shares of the ishares barclays tips bond fund last december for his roth individual retirement account.

176,2009-09-23,"[""Following is the text of the Federal Reserve's statement on Wednesday announcing it was holding its base federal funds target rate at a record low between zero and 0.25 percent: Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in August suggests that economic activity has picked up following its severe downturn. Conditions in financial markets have improved further, and activity in the housing sector has increased. Household spending seems to be stabilizing, but remains constrained by ongoing job losses, sluggish income growth, lower housing wealth and tight credit. Businesses are still cutting back on fixed investment and staffing, though at a slower pace; they continue to make progress in bringing inventory stocks into better alignment with sales. Although economic activity is likely to remain weak for a time, the committee anticipates that policy actions to stabilize financial markets and institutions, fiscal and monetary stimulus, and market forces will support a strengthening of economic growth and a gradual return to higher levels of resource utilization in a context of price stability. With substantial resource slack likely to continue to dampen cost pressures and with longer-term inflation expectations stable, the committee expects that inflation will remain subdued for some time. In these circumstances, the Federal Reserve will continue to employ a wide range of tools to promote economic recovery and to preserve price stability. The committee will maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and continues to anticipate that economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period. To provide support to mortgage lending and housing markets, and to improve overall conditions in private credit markets, the Federal Reserve will purchase a total of $1.25 trillion of agency mortgage-backed securities and up to $200 billion of agency debt. The committee will gradually slow the pace of these purchases in order to promote a smooth transition in markets and anticipates that they will be executed by the end of the first quarter of 2010.

177,2009-09-23,"['The Federal Reserve, in a move aimed at keeping interest rates low for home buyers through early next year, decided to extend and gradually phase out its purchase of mortgage-backed securities. The Fed\'s action signals its belief that the economy, while in recovery, remains fragile and that housing, which has seen some improvement in recent months, has only started to pull out of its slump. ""We definitely need help from the government,"" says Lee Barrett, president of Century 21 Barrett, a real-estate brokerage firm in Las Vegas. ""I don\'t think the market can make it on its own."" He also hopes Congress will extend tax credits for home buyers due to expire at the end of November. The central bank left its interest-rate target unchanged at zero to 0.25% and maintained its expectation that the federal-funds rate, or the rate banks charge each other for overnight loans, would remain low ""for an extended period."" ""Economic activity has picked up following its severe downturn,"" the Federal Open Market Committee said Wednesday in a statement after a two-day meeting. Though conditions in financial markets and the housing sector have improved, household spending ""remains constrained by ongoing job losses, sluggish income growth, lower housing wealth and tight credit,"" the Fed said. Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities rose in price Wednesday, sending yields lower. Stocks slumped. Although the Dow Jones Industrial Average briefly moved above the 9900 level following the Fed\'s afternoon statement, making some investors think about a possible return to 10000, it sagged late in the day and finished down 81.32 points, or 0.83%, at 9748.55. It was the biggest one-day point and percentage decline since Sept. 1. Mainly because of heavy government intervention in the mortgage market, interest rates remain near their lowest levels in decades. Rates on 30-year fixed-rate conforming mortgages currently average 5.24%, down from a recent peak of 5.81% in June but up from the year\'s low of 4.84% in late April, according to HSH Associates, in Pompton Plains, N.J. Sales have increased in California, Florida and some other areas from the very depressed levels of a year ago, largely driven by investors and first-time home buyers chasing bargains on foreclosed properties. But the market remains weak amid worries that new waves of foreclosures will add to supply as banks sort through mountains of paperwork from distressed borrowers seeking easier loan terms.

The euro briefly spiked higher after the Federal Open Market Committee announced it wouldn\'t change ultralow interest rates, but painted a somewhat rosier picture of the U.S. economy in the accompanying statement. U.S. stocks initially rallied on the Fed statement, pulling the euro along to a 12-month high at $1.4845 before reversing those gains as stocks fell back in late trading. Late in New York, the euro was at $1.4743 from $1.4800 late Tuesday. The dollar was at 91.31 Japanese yen from 91.20 yen. The euro was at 134.61 yen from 134.97 yen. The pound was at $1.6357 from $1.6371, while the dollar was at 1.0264 Swiss francs from 1.0233 francs. By pledging to keep interest rates low for an extended period, the Fed sustained the dollar\'s use as a currency to fund bets on higher-yielding assets, or the ""carry trade,"" said Tom Fitzpatrick, global head of currency strategy at Citigroup in New York. ""They\'ve reiterated that rates will be exceptionally low for an extended period,"" he said, supporting the very reason the market was short dollars going into the meeting. At the same time, the Fed offered some support of those riskier assets by indicating there are signs the U.S. economy is improving, Mr. Fitzpatrick said. The euro could top out around $1.50, said Win Thin, senior currency strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman in New York. Because the U.S. economy is likely improving at a faster tick than the euro-zone economy, economic fundamentals don\'t support the euro going much higher, he said. Meanwhile, the ruble hit a nine-month high against the dollar as the Russian currency, almost written off by investors at the start of the year, appeared ripe for the carry trade. The ruble pushed through the psychologically important level of 30 rubles to the dollar for the first time since January, strengthening to 29.9586 before slipping back for a New York finish of 30.021. A nascent Russian economic revival is luring cash into local stocks and bonds and easing concerns the government will flood the foreign-exchange market by increasing spending. Elsewhere, the Norwegian central bank left its key rate unchanged at 1.25% Wednesday, as expected, but said it considered raising rates as an alternative.

181,2008-12-16,"[""Following is the full text of Tuesday's statement by the Federal Reserve: The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to establish a target range for the federal funds rate of 0 to 1/4 percent. Since the committee's last meeting, labor market conditions have deteriorated, and the available data indicate that consumer spending, business investment and industrial production have declined. Financial markets remain quite strained and credit conditions tight. Over all, the outlook for economic activity has weakened further. Meanwhile, inflationary pressures have diminished appreciably. In light of the declines in the prices of energy and other commodities and the weaker prospects for economic activity, the committee expects inflation to moderate further in coming quarters. The Federal Reserve will employ all available tools to promote the resumption of sustainable economic growth and to preserve price stability. In particular, the committee anticipates that weak economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for some time. The focus of the committee's policy going forward will be to support the functioning of financial markets and stimulate the economy through open market operations and other measures that sustain the size of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet at a high level. As previously announced, over the next few quarters the Federal Reserve will purchase large quantities of agency debt and mortgage-backed securities to provide support to the mortgage and housing markets, and it stands ready to expand its purchases of agency debt and mortgage-backed securities as conditions warrant. The committee is also evaluating the potential benefits of purchasing longer-term Treasury securities. Early next year, the Federal Reserve will also implement the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility to facilitate the extension of credit to households and small businesses. The Federal Reserve will continue to consider ways of using its balance sheet to further support credit markets and economic activity. Voting for the F.O.M.C. monetary policy action were: Ben S.

182,2009-12-16,"[""WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve said on Wednesday that it was still wary of raising interest rates because it believed the economy remained fragile but took steps to wind down emergency lending programs. In a statement released after two days of meetings by the Federal Open Market Committee, the central bank said its benchmark overnight interest rate would remain at virtually zero, its level for the last year. The Fed repeated its expectation that it would keep rates ''exceptionally low'' for ''an extended period.'' Most of the language in the report was unchanged from statements released after other recent Fed meetings, although it was marginally more upbeat. Together with recent comments from other economic policy makers -- and Wednesday reports showing increases in housing construction and subdued inflation -- the Fed's release illustrates growing, if cautious, optimism about the economy. The committee said that economic activity, including household spending, had continued to pick up and that the deterioration in the job market was slowing. Improvements in the financial markets have also become ''more supportive of growth,'' the statement said. But businesses are still cutting back on fixed investment, and employers still appear reluctant to hire. ''Though we have begun to see some improvement in economic activity, we still have some way to go before we can be assured that the recovery will be self-sustaining,'' Mr. Bernanke said in a speech at the Economic Club of Washington last week. In its statement Wednesday, the Fed said that it was gradually slowing its purchases of mortgage-backed securities and other agency debt, and that most of its emergency liquidity programs would expire in February. The Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility, created to help banks supply credit to households and small businesses by supporting the issuance of certain asset-backed securities, is still expected to end by June 30. The statement pointedly left open the possibility of changing these plans, however.

If the committee approves Mr. Bernanke for a second term, his nomination will be considered by the full Senate. Mr. Bernanke and the Fed face a difficult balancing act in the quest to return monetary policy to normal after two years of unprecedented intervention in the credit markets. If the Fed waits too long to raise interest rates and draw down its balance sheet, it risks severe inflation.

Additionally, the Fed's favored barometer of inflation, a measure based on consumer spending that excludes food and energy, has increased 1.4 percent over the last year. November's jobs report, which was better than expected but still showed payroll job losses on net, has signaled that the job market may recover in the coming months. Mr. Bernanke is expected to be reconfirmed by Congress to serve another four years as chairman, in spite of some vocal opposition. His current term ends Jan. 31.

''though we have begun to see some improvement in economic activity, we still have some way to go before we can be assured that the recovery will be self-sustaining,'' mr. bernanke said in a speech at the economic club of washington last week. in its statement wednesday, the fed said that it was gradually slowing its purchases of mortgage-backed securities and other agency debt, and that most of its emergency liquidity programs would expire in february. the term asset-backed securities loan facility, created to help banks supply credit to households and small businesses by supporting the issuance of certain asset-backed securities, is still expected to end by june 30. the statement pointedly left open the possibility of changing these plans, however.

184,2006-10-25,"['WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve held short-term interest rates steady for its third consecutive meeting as it continued to bet on a moderation of both inflation and economic growth. Even as it left rates at 5.25% yesterday, the Fed again warned that it is worried about inflation. Since Ben Bernanke became Fed chairman in February, he has faced, first, the threat of rising inflation and then a housing-led economic slowdown. The latest data, and the statement released by the Fed after its meeting yesterday, suggest that the central bank sees the risks on both sides diminishing. That makes it less likely that rates will change in either direction in coming months. Both the rate action and statement were largely expected. Bond prices rallied and bond yields, which move in the opposite direction to prices, fell, apparently because investors had expected more hints of a possible rate increase. Futures markets\' expectations of Fed actions have swung sharply in the past month, from betting on several rate cuts starting as soon as December to seeing a small probability that the Fed might raise rates. In its statement, the Fed said growth has slowed in part because of a ""cooling"" housing market. ""Going forward, the economy seems likely to expand at a moderate pace,"" it said, a notable addition to its statement released after last month\'s meeting. Core inflation, which excludes food and energy, remains ""elevated"" but inflation pressures are likely to moderate thanks to lower energy prices, ""contained"" inflation expectations, and the impact of previous rate increases, the Fed said. ""Some inflation risks remain,"" the Fed said, but whether rates would rise again depends on the outlook and ""incoming information."" For the third straight meeting, Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond President Jeffrey Lacker cast the lone dissent among the 11 voting members of the Federal Open Market Committee. He argued in favor of a quarter-percentage point rate increase in the target federal-funds rate, charged on overnight loans between banks. (One voting seat is empty and seven other members don\'t vote.) Mr. Bernanke has faced shifting challenges since taking office. Core inflation has risen to 2.9% from 2.1%, the highest level in a decade. Although inflation by the Fed\'s preferred price index is lower, it, too, is above the 2% level many Fed officials have said they are comfortable with. That led the Fed to raise rates at its first three meetings under Mr. Bernanke. Then later economic growth, under the weight of falling home and automobile sales, began to slow, to an estimated annual rate of about 2% in the third quarter. That would be the second-lowest level since 2003. The official growth figure will be reported tomorrow. In recent weeks, though, both inflation and growth worries have eased. Energy prices have plunged, and the Fed expects the indirect impact of that drop to pull down core inflation in the coming year or so. Yesterday\'s Fed statement dropped a reference from the previous month to energy and commodity prices as a source of inflation pressure. There is little sign the economy outside housing and cars has slowed much. Some economists said the housing market has shown tentative signs of hitting bottom. Yesterday, the National Association of Realtors said existing-home sales fell 2% in September to an annual rate of 6.18 million, from August. The inventory of existing homes remained at about 7.3 months of sales for the third consecutive month. ""We might be having what some colleagues have described as a false landing rather than soft landing,"" said Carl Tannenbaum, chief economist at LaSalle Bank. He said growth could rebound to 3% in the current quarter as the housing correction ends and consumers benefit from a 25% to 40% drop in gasoline prices. ""The Fed must ask itself: Did things slow down long enough and far enough to reduce pressure on capacity? I think the next move [on rates] is probably up."" Rajeev Dhawan, director of the Economic Forecasting Center at Georgia State University, predicted the Fed would cut rates by January. With long-term rates well below short-term rates -- a relationship that in the past has foreshadowed recession -- ""the risk factors are too high,"" he said. The shifting momentum of growth from strong to weak and back to moderate reflects the remarkable stability the U.S. economy now enjoys, said John Makin, a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. ""As has often been the case over the past five years, the slowdown itself has set into motion market adjustments that may mitigate or even reverse it,"" he wrote in a report. For example, the Fed\'s decision to pause as the housing market weakened led investors to drive down long-term rates on bonds and mortgages. That, with a lag, has helped put a floor under housing. Online lender Quicken Loans Inc.\'s pipeline of mortgage applications has grown 20% to 25% since rates began to ease in late June, said the company\'s chief economist, Bob Walters. The increase has been driven mostly by refinancing applications, while the number of applications for new-home purchases remains steady.

186,2006-10-25,"[""Saying that the economy was likely to continue growing at a ''moderate pace,'' the Federal Reserve held its benchmark interest rate steady yesterday and gave investors reason to think that the rate could remain at its current level of 5.25 percent for months to come.   A statement accompanying the decision by the Federal Open Market Committee was nearly identical to the one the panel released after its policy meeting last month. Since then, new economic data has given Fed officials reason to hope that they have achieved a ''soft landing,'' in which interest rate increases slow the economy and bring down inflation without falling into recession.   ''I think the Fed is feeling very good about the way the economy is developing,'' said Stuart Schweitzer, a strategist at J. P. Morgan Asset and Wealth Management. ''The housing slowdown is proceeding, but it's not spiraling downward, and the rest of the economy is doing O.K.''   The short-term interest rate under the Fed's control, which influences a wide variety of other interest rates, remained unchanged for a third consecutive meeting. The panel had raised that rate -- the federal funds rate on overnight bank loans -- at every meeting from the middle of 2004 through this summer to slow the economy and keep inflation in check.   With the housing market in the midst of a ''substantial correction,'' as the Fed's chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, has put it, overall economic growth has slowed this year. The National Association of Realtors reported yesterday that sales of previously owned homes in September declined 1.9 percent from August, a larger drop than forecasters had expected. The median sale price also fell, to $220,000, from $225,000 a year earlier.   But a sharp drop in oil prices -- with gasoline falling this week to $2.20 a gallon on average, from around $3 early in August -- appears to have reduced the chances that the slowdown could turn into something more severe, economists say. A Labor Department report this month also showed this summer's job market to be healthier than had been thought.   Stock investors yesterday took a largely positive view. The Dow Jones industrials were up 0.06 percent, but broader gauges rose more -- the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was up 0.35 percent, the Nasdaq composite index gained 0.50 percent and the Russell 2000 index of smaller issues was 0.62 percent higher.   If the economy resumes fairly strong growth, the Fed will have more flexibility to raise rates without risking recession in the event that inflation does not follow the declining path many Fed officials are counting on.   ''Readings on core inflation have been elevated,'' the statement yesterday said, and could remain so because many companies are operating close to capacity. ''However, inflation pressures seem likely to moderate over time,'' it added, as a result of falling oil prices, previous interest rate increases and low expectations among consumers that retail prices will rise much.   There were only two substantive changes in the statement: a new sentence on the economic outlook, forecasting ''moderate'' growth, and the removal of energy and commodity prices as two of the factors increasing inflation pressure.   ''The use of the term 'moderate,' I think, was intentionally vague,'' David Greenlaw, an economist at Morgan Stanley, said. ''They wanted to indicate a degree of confidence that growth would not slow too much, but not express an opinion about whether it would resume an above-trend course'' that would cause inflation to accelerate.   Although the drop in gasoline prices has brought down overall inflation, the Fed's preferred measure of inflation -- which excludes energy and food and is less volatile as a result -- is still rising at an annual pace of 2.5 percent, according to the latest Commerce Department data. Mr. Bernanke has suggested that he would like this core inflation to be in a range of 1 percent to 2 percent.   During their two-day meeting that ended yesterday, Fed officials discussed but apparently did not resolve how they might talk in public in more detail about their policy and forecasts. The meeting, originally scheduled to last only a day, was expanded to two days earlier in the year to leave time for the discussion, which formally began in August.   Based on the price of futures contracts tied to Fed policy, traders seem to believe that the Fed will keep its benchmark rate at 5.25 percent into early in the new year before cutting it next summer. After the meeting, the futures prices changed to suggest that traders thought that a rate increase over the next year had become even less likely.   Still, a change in the next six months -- one way or the other -- remains quite plausible, economists say. In speeches and Congressional testimony, Mr. Bernanke has emphasized that the Fed is willing to change its plans based on new economic data.   In a recent Reuters poll of traders at securities firms that participate in Treasury Department auctions, about two-thirds of them said the next rate change was likely to be a cut and a third said it would be an increase, suggesting that most thought that the slowing economy was a bigger threat than inflation.   But the Fed panel's statement suggested that it remained more concerned about inflation than the possibility of a recession. A phrase referring to ''any additional firming'' -- meaning rate increases -- remained in the text. More than anything, that could have been a message to Wall Street that the Fed would remain vigilant about accelerating prices.   When the Fed left the federal funds rate unchanged in August, for the first time in more than two years, some economists criticized Mr. Bernanke for being too soft on inflation during his first year as chairman. At yesterday's meeting, Jeffrey M. Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, was the lone dissenter for the third time in a row, voting for a rate increase.   The recent economic slowdown, which is expected to be reflected in the coming report on third-quarter economic activity to be released tomorrow, has made the Fed's August decision less susceptible to criticism than it was at the time. The central question now is whether the housing slump will spill over into other parts of the economy by causing falling home prices to lead households to reduce spending in other areas.   In yesterday's report on the housing market, the Realtors said sales of existing homes fell 14 percent last month compared with September 2005, to a seasonally adjusted annual pace of 6.2 million. As recently as early last year, the number of sales was rising at more than 10 percent a year.   Sales of condominiums, many bought by investors during the housing boom, have fallen more rapidly than sales of single-family houses.   In a sign that the market could be stabilizing, the number of apartments and houses offered for sale declined slightly last month, to 3.8 million, from 3.9 million in August. Thomas M. Stevens, president of the Realtors group, predicted that the drop in housing inventory would cause prices to start rising again in coming months.   But Joshua Shapiro, chief United States economist with the consulting firm MFR, said the inventory was still large enough to suggest that prices would fall further. Peter Schiff, president of Euro Pacific Capital in Darien, Conn., added, ''There's no evidence that we're bottoming out.''   Over the last year, prices have fallen 5.1 percent in the Northeast, more sharply than in the West (4.3 percent), the Midwest (2.3 percent) and the South (1.6 percent).   ''It's still a seller's market,'' Mr. Schiff said. ''If you're looking to buy, wait. Keep renting. Prices are going to come a lot lower.''

C4)  ""]","[""saying that the economy was likely to continue growing at a ''moderate pace,'' the federal reserve held its benchmark interest rate steady yesterday and gave investors reason to think that the rate could remain at its current level of 5.25 percent for months to come.   a statement accompanying the decision by the federal open market committee was nearly identical to the one the panel released after its policy meeting last month. since then, new economic data has given fed officials reason to hope that they have achieved a ''soft landing,'' in which interest rate increases slow the economy and bring down inflation without falling into recession.   ''i think the fed is feeling very good about the way the economy is developing,'' said stuart schweitzer, a strategist at j. p. morgan asset and wealth management. ''the housing slowdown is proceeding, but it's not spiraling downward, and the rest of the economy is doing o.k.''   the short-term interest rate under the fed's control, which influences a wide variety of other interest rates, remained unchanged for a third consecutive meeting. the panel had raised that rate -- the federal funds rate on overnight bank loans -- at every meeting from the middle of 2004 through this summer to slow the economy and keep inflation in check.   with the housing market in the midst of a ''substantial correction,'' as the fed's chairman, ben s. bernanke, has put it, overall economic growth has slowed this year. the national association of realtors reported yesterday that sales of previously owned homes in september declined 1.9 percent from august, a larger drop than forecasters had expected. the median sale price also fell, to $220,000, from $225,000 a year earlier.   but a sharp drop in oil prices -- with gasoline falling this week to $2.20 a gallon on average, from around $3 early in august -- appears to have reduced the chances that the slowdown could turn into something more severe, economists say. a labor department report this month also showed this summer's job market to be healthier than had been thought.   stock investors yesterday took a largely positive view. the dow jones industrials were up 0.06 percent, but broader gauges rose more -- the standard & poor's 500-stock index was up 0.35 percent, the nasdaq composite index gained 0.50 percent and the russell 2000 index of smaller issues was 0.62 percent higher.   if the economy resumes fairly strong growth, the fed will have more flexibility to raise rates without risking recession in the event that inflation does not follow the declining path many fed officials are counting on.   ''readings on core inflation have been elevated,'' the statement yesterday said, and could remain so because many companies are operating close to capacity. ''however, inflation pressures seem likely to moderate over time,'' it added, as a result of falling oil prices, previous interest rate increases and low expectations among consumers that retail prices will rise much.   there were only two substantive changes in the statement: a new sentence on the economic outlook, forecasting ''moderate'' growth, and the removal of energy and commodity prices as two of the factors increasing inflation pressure.   ''the use of the term 'moderate,' i think, was intentionally vague,'' david greenlaw, an economist at morgan stanley, said. ''they wanted to indicate a degree of confidence that growth would not slow too much, but not express an opinion about whether it would resume an above-trend course'' that would cause inflation to accelerate.   although the drop in gasoline prices has brought down overall inflation, the fed's preferred measure of inflation -- which excludes energy and food and is less volatile as a result -- is still rising at an annual pace of 2.5 percent, according to the latest commerce department data. mr. bernanke has suggested that he would like this core inflation to be in a range of 1 percent to 2 percent.   during their two-day meeting that ended yesterday, fed officials discussed but apparently did not resolve how they might talk in public in more detail about their policy and forecasts. the meeting, originally scheduled to last only a day, was expanded to two days earlier in the year to leave time for the discussion, which formally began in august.   based on the price of futures contracts tied to fed policy, traders seem to believe that the fed will keep its benchmark rate at 5.25 percent into early in the new year before cutting it next summer. after the meeting, the futures prices changed to suggest that traders thought that a rate increase over the next year had become even less likely.   still, a change in the next six months -- one way or the other -- remains quite plausible, economists say. in speeches and congressional testimony, mr. bernanke has emphasized that the fed is willing to change its plans based on new economic data.   in a recent reuters poll of traders at securities firms that participate in treasury department auctions, about two-thirds of them said the next rate change was likely to be a cut and a third said it would be an increase, suggesting that most thought that the slowing economy was a bigger threat than inflation.   but the fed panel's statement suggested that it remained more concerned about inflation than the possibility of a recession. a phrase referring to ''any additional firming'' -- meaning rate increases -- remained in the text. more than anything, that could have been a message to wall street that the fed would remain vigilant about accelerating prices.   when the fed left the federal funds rate unchanged in august, for the first time in more than two years, some economists criticized mr. bernanke for being too soft on inflation during his first year as chairman. at yesterday's meeting, jeffrey m. lacker, president of the federal reserve bank of richmond, was the lone dissenter for the third time in a row, voting for a rate increase.   the recent economic slowdown, which is expected to be reflected in the coming report on third-quarter economic activity to be released tomorrow, has made the fed's august decision less susceptible to criticism than it was at the time. the central question now is whether the housing slump will spill over into other parts of the economy by causing falling home prices to lead households to reduce spending in other areas.   in yesterday's report on the housing market, the realtors said sales of existing homes fell 14 percent last month compared with september 2005, to a seasonally adjusted annual pace of 6.2 million. as recently as early last year, the number of sales was rising at more than 10 percent a year.   sales of condominiums, many bought by investors during the housing boom, have fallen more rapidly than sales of single-family houses.   in a sign that the market could be stabilizing, the number of apartments and houses offered for sale declined slightly last month, to 3.8 million, from 3.9 million in august. thomas m. stevens, president of the realtors group, predicted that the drop in housing inventory would cause prices to start rising again in coming months.   but joshua shapiro, chief united states economist with the consulting firm mfr, said the inventory was still large enough to suggest that prices would fall further. peter schiff, president of euro pacific capital in darien, conn., added, ''there's no evidence that we're bottoming out.''   over the last year, prices have fallen 5.1 percent in the northeast, more sharply than in the west (4.3 percent), the midwest (2.3 percent) and the south (1.6 percent).

190,2007-01-31,"[""WASHINGTON, Jan. 31 -- The Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged on Wednesday, as it has since June, but it was more optimistic than in the past that inflationary pressures were ebbing.   The central bank left the federal funds rate on overnight loans between banks at 5.25 percent, as investors had expected. It also repeated its caution that ''some inflation risks remain,'' a sign that it is likely to keep the benchmark rate at current levels for the foreseeable future.   But in its statement announcing the decision, the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee expressed growing confidence that inflation was running lower -- even as growth was slightly stronger than officials had expected just a few months ago.   ''Readings on core inflation have improved modestly, and inflation pressures seem likely to moderate over time,'' the Fed's statement said. At the same time, it acknowledged signs of ''somewhat firmer economic growth'' and ''tentative signs of stabilization'' in the housing market.   That cheered stock and bond markets, elevating hopes that healthy economic growth would not prompt a resumption of rate increases. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 98.38 points yesterday, or 0.79 percent, to close at 12,621.69. Yields on Treasury debt declined, with the benchmark 10-year Treasury note settling at 4.81 percent, down from 4.87 percent Tuesday, indicating that the market expected long-term interest rates to move slightly lower.   The Federal Reserve's announcement came hours after the Commerce Department reported that the economy grew at a surprisingly brisk annual pace of 3.5 percent in the fourth quarter of 2006.   Many investors have all but written off expectations that the Fed might actually cut interest rates soon, which it would do to offset an economic slump or rising unemployment, neither of which is occurring.   The Fed statement suggested that policy makers were increasingly confident about achieving an elusive ''soft landing'' -- a mild slowdown in growth that would reduce inflation pressures but not set off a recession.   ''What I don't think people were counting on was the Fed, in effect, upgrading their views on the outlook for inflation,'' said Stuart Hoffman, chief economist at PNC Financial in Pittsburgh. ''The way they phrased it, they're really inching toward a balanced risk assessment of inflation versus slower growth.''   While Mr. Hoffman still says that a Fed rate cut this summer is possible, most analysts no longer see any need for the central bank to ease rates.   ''If there were need for stimulus, the consumer is clearly not asking for it,'' said Richard Yamarone at Argus Research in New York. ''You have more than a handful of reasons to raise rates, but what are the reasons for a cut? There are none.''   The Fed repeated verbatim the previous stance of remaining slightly more worried about rising inflation than about slowing growth.   Several governors, as well as the chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, have said that their ''comfort zone'' for inflation is an annual rate of 1 to 2 percent, excluding food and energy.   By that measure of core inflation, consumer prices have risen 2.4 percent in the last year. But prices have climbed more slowly in recent months, partly because of pass-through effects from the drop in gasoline prices late last year.   And while the Commerce Department's new estimate of economic growth last quarter provided additional evidence that the economy was expanding faster than many analysts had expected, it also showed that inflationary pressures remained surprisingly low.

191,2003-08-12,"[""While Federal Reserve policy makers were not very upbeat about the outlook for the economy yesterday, their statement that they would keep their benchmark interest rate low for a long time could help start the stock market moving again.   The three main stock gauges have been locked in a trading range this summer. The Dow Jones industrial average and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index are still below the highs they reached on June 17. The Nasdaq composite index is still below where it was on July 14. Many economists expected the long decline in jobs to turn the corner in July. Instead, they were surprised by another loss.   And the tone of the Fed's statement was not so rosy. It said that the upside and downside risks to the economy were still ''roughly equal'' and that ''on balance'' the threat of deflation, though minor, was greater than inflation in the foreseeable future.   But some analysts argue that the Fed's interest rate commitment should restrain the increase in longer-term rates, giving the weak recovery time to gain strength. With this limit on rate increases, investors are also more likely to believe that the recent rebound in corporate profits, a significant driver of share prices, can continue, setting the stage for a stock market rally.   Corporate profits, as included in the gross domestic product, have been rising the last five quarters, from the quarter in which the National Bureau of Economic Research said the most recent recession ended. Economists forecast that such profits also rose in the second quarter and should climb even higher in the current one.   A seven-quarter run would be the first for before-tax profits since a 10-quarter rise that ended in the fourth-quarter of 1988 and the first for after-tax profits since a nine-quarter run that finished in the second quarter of 1996.   The 14.4 percent rise in after-tax profits through the latest five-quarter run is slightly bigger then the 14.2 percent jump in the first five quarters after the previous recession, which ended in the first quarter of 1991.   Operating earnings in the second quarter are up 9 percent for the 458 companies in the S.& P. 500 that have reported so far, compared with figures in the period a year earlier, according to Thomson First Call. The final number could be slightly higher, which would be the fifth consecutive quarterly rise for this measure.   The outlook for the third quarter is growth of 13.5 percent, a forecast that has actually inched slightly higher since the beginning of last month.   But investors may not be convinced yet because the general profit environment is not as strong as it was around the 1990-91 recession. In the 32 quarters from the fourth period of 1989 through the third quarter of 1997, there were only four quarterly declines in G.D.P. profits, and one of those was a slip of just 0.02 percent. In the 32 quarters ended in March, there were 12 quarterly declines.   In addition, the level of after-tax profits, which was $490.2 billion in the first quarter of this year, is still well below the levels reached in the bull market fueled by technology stocks.   ''I think the negative attitude regarding profitability is because we still have that dot-com high-water mark for profits in our head, and until we get past it, profits will always be bad,'' said James W. Paulsen, chief investment officer at Wells Capital Management in Minneapolis.   Andrew Engel, senior research analyst at the Leuthold Group in Minneapolis, said the slight overvaluation of the stock market right now might be holding investors back. He argued that ''earnings levels are growing well enough to support higher valuations.''   ''But,'' he added, ''I don't think investors recognize it yet.''   Another plus for stocks is that it appears that bonds are finally losing favor with investors. From 2001 through last month, there were net inflows of $294.4 billion into taxable bond funds and $42.2 billion into municipal bond funds. In the same period, the flow into domestic equity funds slowed to $98.5 billion.   But as of Aug. 6, the four-week moving average of net inflows to bond funds had reversed, with a $1.4 billion outflow, according to AMG Data Services. In the week ended Aug. 6, outflows reached $3.6 billion.   Robert Adler, the president of AMG, said ''there is no evidence yet'' of a broad-based return to stocks. But he said the strong flows into mutual funds that invest in stocks with high dividends, which have become attractive since taxes were cut on them, and small-cap funds could signal the beginning of a return to stocks.   The performances of the stock and bond markets since mid-June, the high for the Dow and the low for interest rates, also show that many investors think that the economy is set for a revival. That expectation accounts for much of the sharp rise in interest rates since then.   In the stock market, Thomas McManus, equity strategist at Banc America Securities, said that the ''trading range is obscuring a divergence going on underneath.''   Stocks that are sensitive to economic growth have soared, showing that many investors are betting on a rebound. The Morgan Stanley index of this sector, which includes 3M, Caterpillar, Ford Motor, International Paper and Whirpool, has jumped 5.2 percent since mid-June, while the S.& P. 500 is off 2.1 percent.   The policy makers on the Federal Open Market Committee made their commitment to low rates yesterday with 13 words in their statement: ''The committee believes that policy accommodation can be maintained for a considerable period.''   The rally in the stock market after the Fed's announcement put the Dow within easy striking distance of its June high. So maybe the positive signals are being heeded.   Graph: ''Where Now?''   With bond prices falling, investors have started moving money out of bond funds, but stock funds have not been big beneficiaries so far.   Graph tracks 4-week moving averages of fund flows for stock funds and taxable bond funds.   (Source by AMG Data Services)  ""]","[""while federal reserve policy makers were not very upbeat about the outlook for the economy yesterday, their statement that they would keep their benchmark interest rate low for a long time could help start the stock market moving again.   the three main stock gauges have been locked in a trading range this summer. the dow jones industrial average and the standard & poor's 500-stock index are still below the highs they reached on june 17. the nasdaq composite index is still below where it was on july 14. many economists expected the long decline in jobs to turn the corner in july. instead, they were surprised by another loss.   and the tone of the fed's statement was not so rosy. it said that the upside and downside risks to the economy were still ''roughly equal'' and that ''on balance'' the threat of deflation, though minor, was greater than inflation in the foreseeable future.   but some analysts argue that the fed's interest rate commitment should restrain the increase in longer-term rates, giving the weak recovery time to gain strength. with this limit on rate increases, investors are also more likely to believe that the recent rebound in corporate profits, a significant driver of share prices, can continue, setting the stage for a stock market rally.   corporate profits, as included in the gross domestic product, have been rising the last five quarters, from the quarter in which the national bureau of economic research said the most recent recession ended. economists forecast that such profits also rose in the second quarter and should climb even higher in the current one.   a seven-quarter run would be the first for before-tax profits since a 10-quarter rise that ended in the fourth-quarter of 1988 and the first for after-tax profits since a nine-quarter run that finished in the second quarter of 1996.   the 14.4 percent rise in after-tax profits through the latest five-quarter run is slightly bigger then the 14.2 percent jump in the first five quarters after the previous recession, which ended in the first quarter of 1991.   operating earnings in the second quarter are up 9 percent for the 458 companies in the s.& p. 500 that have reported so far, compared with figures in the period a year earlier, according to thomson first call. the final number could be slightly higher, which would be the fifth consecutive quarterly rise for this measure.   the outlook for the third quarter is growth of 13.5 percent, a forecast that has actually inched slightly higher since the beginning of last month.   but investors may not be convinced yet because the general profit environment is not as strong as it was around the 1990-91 recession. in the 32 quarters from the fourth period of 1989 through the third quarter of 1997, there were only four quarterly declines in g.d.p. profits, and one of those was a slip of just 0.02 percent. in the 32 quarters ended in march, there were 12 quarterly declines.   in addition, the level of after-tax profits, which was $490.2 billion in the first quarter of this year, is still well below the levels reached in the bull market fueled by technology stocks.   ''i think the negative attitude regarding profitability is because we still have that dot-com high-water mark for profits in our head, and until we get past it, profits will always be bad,'' said james w. paulsen, chief investment officer at wells capital management in minneapolis.   andrew engel, senior research analyst at the leuthold group in minneapolis, said the slight overvaluation of the stock market right now might be holding investors back. he argued that ''earnings levels are growing well enough to support higher valuations.''   ''but,'' he added, ''i don't think investors recognize it yet.''   another plus for stocks is that it appears that bonds are finally losing favor with investors. from 2001 through last month, there were net inflows of $294.4 billion into taxable bond funds and $42.2 billion into municipal bond funds. in the same period, the flow into domestic equity funds slowed to $98.5 billion.   but as of aug. 6, the four-week moving average of net inflows to bond funds had reversed, with a $1.4 billion outflow, according to amg data services. in the week ended aug. 6, outflows reached $3.6 billion.   robert adler, the president of amg, said ''there is no evidence yet'' of a broad-based return to stocks. but he said the strong flows into mutual funds that invest in stocks with high dividends, which have become attractive since taxes were cut on them, and small-cap funds could signal the beginning of a return to stocks.   the performances of the stock and bond markets since mid-june, the high for the dow and the low for interest rates, also show that many investors think that the economy is set for a revival. that expectation accounts for much of the sharp rise in interest rates since then.   in the stock market, thomas mcmanus, equity strategist at banc america securities, said that the ''trading range is obscuring a divergence going on underneath.''   stocks that are sensitive to economic growth have soared, showing that many investors are betting on a rebound. the morgan stanley index of this sector, which includes 3m, caterpillar, ford motor, international paper and whirpool, has jumped 5.2 percent since mid-june, while the s.& p. 500 is off 2.1 percent.   the policy makers on the federal open market committee made their commitment to low rates yesterday with 13 words in their statement: ''the committee believes that policy accommodation can be maintained for a considerable period.''   the rally in the stock market after the fed's announcement put the dow within easy striking distance of its june high. so maybe the positive signals are being heeded.   graph: ''where now?''   with bond prices falling, investors have started moving money out of bond funds, but stock funds have not been big beneficiaries so far.   graph tracks 4-week moving averages of fund flows for stock funds and taxable bond funds.

192,2003-08-12,"[""WASHINGTON, Aug. 12 -- The Federal Reserve left its overnight interest rate unchanged at 1 percent today, but it cheered financial markets by strongly suggesting that it would not raise interest rates until at least some time next year.   Today's decision -- almost universally anticipated by analysts and investors -- leaves short-term rates at their lowest levels since the 1950's.   But the Fed also gave investors a big clue about its plans for the months ahead and that clue came as a pleasant surprise to the markets.   In its statement accompanying today's decision, the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee repeated almost verbatim its previous assessment of the economy. It added a new sentence, however, on top of its familiar formulations, declaring that ''the committee believes that policy accommodation can be maintained for a considerable period.''   Investors and analysts immediately pounced on that comment as confirmation that the Federal Reserve would keep interest rates low even if, as seems increasingly likely, the economy picks up speed in the next several months.   The stock market climbed modestly after the Fed's announcement. The broad Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained 1 percent, to close at 990.35.The Nasdaq composite index rose 1.53 percent, to close at 1,687.01.   Perhaps more telling, traders bid up the price of futures contracts on the overnight federal funds rates. Where traders had given a 90 percent likelihood of a rate increase by next April, analysts said prices after today's announcement reflected only a 60 percent chance of that happening.   ''The Fed is attempting to say that we have the ability to stay with these rates for a while,'' said James E. Glassman, senior economist at J. P. Morgan.   At the same time, the Federal Reserve reinforced the impression that officials are not inclined to take any unusual or unorthodox measures to fight the fading risk of deflation, or an across-the-board decline in prices.   Although today's statement reiterated almost verbatim past statements about the risks of an ''unwelcome fall in inflation,'' it offered no suggestion that the central bank would lower the federal funds rate below 1 percent or that it might pump money into the economy by buying longer-term Treasury securities.   As a result, today's announcement is unlikely to reverse the recent sharp surge in rates on longer-term Treasury notes; that, in turn, has caused a rapid rise in rates for mortgage loans.   The bond markets has suffered one of its worst routs in years during the past several weeks, a development that has sent home mortgage rates surging even though short-term interest rates are at their lowest level in about 45 years.   Analysts differ on who is to blame for the bond market's plunge into turmoil, but most agree that a crucial reason is either miscommunication by the Fed or misinterpretation by investors of what the Fed is actually saying about its intentions to fight deflation.   Many bond investors became convinced in May and June that the Federal Reserve was preparing to buy up longer-term Treasury bonds, a move that would allow it to keep flooding the markets with money even if the overnight federal funds rate dropped close to zero.   But those hopes waned after the Open Market Committee's last meeting, when the Fed reduced the federal funds rate by only one-quarter of a percentage point.   Any remaining hopes were dashed in July, when Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, told a Congressional committee that there would probably be no need to resort to unconventional methods.   Paul Taylor, chief economist for the National Automobile Dealers Association, said the Fed's policy on short-term rates might even help keep longer-term rates high because it slightly increases the chance of future inflation.   ''The F.O.M.C. generosity on liquidity for the economy may have the unfortunate result of keeping the 10-year Treasury rate near its current elevated levels,'' Mr. Taylor wrote in an assessment today. Because higher rates on mortgage loans have already slowed the trend of homeowners refinancing their homes and pulling out cash, Mr. Taylor said car sales could soon be affected.   As it has before, the Fed said that current monetary policy is relaxed enough to provide ''important ongoing support to economic activity'' and it said that the upside and downside risks to sustainable growth are ''roughly equal.''   William C. Dudley, chief United States economist at Goldman, Sachs, said the central bank seemed intent primarily on underlining Mr. Greenspan's view that inflation is not a significant risk at the moment and that the Fed can afford to keep short-term rates at extremely low levels without igniting a new round of price increases. He said he did not expect another increase until 2005.   ''The markets viewed that as significant,'' Mr. Dudley said. ''My own view is that it follows pretty logically'' from statements by Mr. Greenspan as well as other top officials at the Federal Reserve.

194,2003-08-12,"['NEW YORK -- The dollar ended North American trading higher against most of its major counterparts, remaining bound to recent narrow ranges before and after a closely watched statement on the economy from the Federal Reserve. The decision by the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee to hold short-term interest rates at a 45-year low of 1% had been widely expected, with analysts focusing instead on the language of the statement accompanying the decision. Saying that ""the evidence accumulated over the intermeeting period shows that spending is firming although labor-market indicators are mixed,"" the Fed gave notice it would keep interest rates low for a ""considerable period."" Following recent U.S. economic data that some market participants viewed as grounds for cautious optimism of a U.S. economic recovery, analysts found little in the Fed statement to warrant a significant readjustment of currency positions. ""The Fed offered no surprises,"" said Ram Bhagavataula, senior economist with Royal Bank of Scotland in New York. ""Even though bond markets have become considerably more anxious, the Fed is telling the same story, which is disinflation, so accommodative policy can be maintained for a considerable period. Their policy hasn\'t changed one bit."" After some knee-jerk buying and selling immediately after the Fed\'s announcement, the dollar returned to pre-FOMC levels, exiting from New York trading at the upper end of the day\'s ranges. ""The currency markets are just chopping around in the ranges we\'ve been in for the past few weeks,"" said Tim Mazanec, senior currency strategist with Investors Bank &Trust in Boston. Analysts will likely watch retail-sales and business-inventories numbers due today for any signs of continued improvement in the U.S. economy. Late yesterday, the euro was trading at $1.1295, off session lows of $1.1282 from early in New York, but down from $1.1361 late Monday. The dollar was at 118.69 yen, virtually unchanged from 118.67 yen late Monday. Against the Swiss franc, the dollar was buying 1.3691 francs, up from 1.3581 francs, while sterling was changing hands at $1.6029, down from $1.6094 late Monday. The European currency seemed to fail to draw much strength from reports that French industrial production proved stronger than expected, rising 1.2% in June after falling a revised 1.3% in May, and by other figures showing that French inflation remained steady over the past two months, at 1.9% in July. Though the yen\'s recent strength would appear to be bolstered by data showing the Japanese economy grew 0.6% in the second quarter of this year, well above the expected rise of 0.2%, many analysts said potential intervention by the Bank of Japan on behalf of Japan\'s Ministry of Finance -- which has repeatedly intervened to weaken the Japanese currency against the dollar -- will continue to put brakes on any appreciable yen gains.

195,2000-06-28,"[""NEW YORK -- Volatility declined sharply in the options market in reaction to the Federal Open Market Committee's decision to leave interest rates unchanged.    The Chicago Board Options Exchange's Market Volatility Index, or VIX, which measures certain Standard & Poor's 100 option prices to determine investor sentiment, declined 1.30 to 23.52.    When the index declines, it often indicates that traders are optimistic about the stock market, but many options traders refrained from making any major commitments ahead of the coming short week because options lose a little bit of their value each day. The financial markets close early Monday and all day Tuesday in observance of Independence Day.    As expected, the Fed kept its target overnight bank lending rate, or fed-funds rate, at 6.5%. The committee, however, indicated that it may raise rates again to control inflation. Many people on Wall Street expect the Fed will raise interest rates at its next meeting.    The CBOE's equity put/call ratio was 0.40. The ratio is a contrarian sentiment indicator that holds that the smart approach to the market is to do the opposite of the crowd. If everyone is bullish, a contrarian trader is bearish on the assumption that the crowd is always wrong. The ratio is considered bullish above 0.75; neutral from 0.40 to 0.75 and bearish below 0.40.    The CBOE's index put/call ratio was 0.87, but the reading may not be accurate because index-trading volume was low. The ratio, also a contrarian sentiment indicator, is considered bullish above 1.5, neutral from 0.75 to 1.5 and bearish if it is below 0.75.

197,2001-12-11,"[""WASHINGTON, Dec. 11 -- With unemployment rising and the outlook for recovery muddled, the Federal Reserve continued its campaign of interest rate cuts today as President Bush and the two parties in Congress made progress in reviving negotiations on an economic stimulus package. The Fed reduced its main lending rate by a quarter of a percentage point, to 1.75 percent, the 11th time this year it has cut borrowing costs. In announcing the move, the Fed, the nation's central bank, noted signs that the downturn may be reaching a bottom, the first time the Fed has done so since the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11. But it added that the positive signs were tentative, and it left the door open to further rate cuts in the new year. As the Fed was meeting, Mr. Bush instructed Secretary of the Treasury Paul H. O'Neill to go to Capitol Hill with a modified offer on the proposed economic recovery package. The president's press secretary, Ari Fleischer, said Mr. Bush was willing to move toward the Democrats on several components of the package, including reducing rather than repealing the alternative minimum tax for corporations, limiting individual income tax reductions and increasing the amount of money the administration would be willing to devote to helping laid-off workers. ''The president has listened to the Democrats,'' Mr. Fleischer told reporters in South Carolina, where Mr. Bush was speaking. ''He hopes the Democrats will now be willing to listen to him.'' Mr. Bush met at the White House tonight with a bipartisan group of senators about the economic stimulus package, and White House officials said they were encouraged by the talks. House Republicans also signaled that they were open to a compromise, and Senator Tom Daschle, Democrat of South Dakota the majority leader, said he saw ''the makings of an agreement.'' The two parties must still overcome substantial differences before they can agree on a stimulus plan, with the main sticking point being Republican insistence on accelerating some of the tax cuts for individuals contained in the tax reduction bill Mr. Bush signed in June. Administration officials said the president was now willing to limit individual tax cuts to dropping the current 27 percent rate to 25 percent. The 27 percent rate affects single people with taxable income of $27,950 and above and couples with income of $46,700 and above. Mr. Bush was essentially moving his position into line with Congressional Republicans, who had given up on their calls for accelerated cuts in the top brackets. Democrats, saying Mr. Bush's earlier tax cut was fiscally irresponsible and tilted toward the wealthy, want to block the acceleration of rate cuts. Some members of both parties and some administration officials acknowledge that the economy might bounce back without any fiscal stimulus. But with neither party eager to run the risk of being blamed for inaction should the economy continue to deteriorate, the two sides emphasized today that there was enough common ground to forge a compromise. ''I think we're narrowing down the points of disagreement,'' said Senator Trent Lott, Republican of Mississippi, the minority leader. Mr. Daschle said the real breakthrough was the willingness of Republicans in the House to reconsider the tax-cutting stimulus bill they passed in October, a piece of legislation that Democrats have portrayed as a giveaway to the wealthy and corporate interests at the expense of unemployed and low-income workers who need help the most. The House majority leader, Representative Dick Armey of Texas, said on Monday that if talks remained stalled, he would consider stripping some provisions out of the House bill that were most objectionable to Democrats, including a cut in the capital gains tax and granting corporations billions in immediate refunds as part of the repeal of the corporate alternative minimum tax. Senator Daschle said he was willing to give Republicans most of what they wanted in terms of tax incentives for businesses to invest in new factories and equipment. He said that in return he would like the administration and Congressional Republicans to drop their insistence on income tax rate reductions and instead include in the package a Republican proposal to suspend, for one month, the Social Security payroll taxes levied on workers and their employers. Mr. Daschle said he also wanted assurances that Republicans would support the full package of assistance to laid-off workers, including subsidies for health insurance premiums and expansion of unemployment benefits for part-time workers. ''With those two conditions, we've got a deal,'' Mr. Daschle said. But both sides cautioned that the negotiations, which have been ridden with personal animosity and deep ideological divisions, could again break down. Mr. Lott warned that Republicans might not go along with any deal that required them to give up accelerated income tax reductions. ''I think that would be a very big problem for Senate Republicans,'' Mr. Lott said. With no assurance that Congress and the administration will enact a stimulus bill, the burden for lifting the economy has remained on the Federal Reserve, which has now pushed its federal funds target rate on overnight loans among banks to 1.75 percent, the lowest level in nearly four decades. The Fed also cut its discount rate on overnight loans to banks from the Federal Reserve system by a quarter of a percentage point, to 1.25 percent. The moves were intended to reduce borrowing costs across the economy, helping to stimulate more economic activity among consumers and businesses. Banks immediately followed by reducing their prime lending rates to business customers to 4.75 percent from 5 percent, a move that also puts downward pressure on some home equity, credit card and adjustable-rate mortgage loans. Most mortgage rates, though, are set by trading in the bond market, and are unlikely to move much because of the Fed's action. In its statement today, the central bank's policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee hinted that its nearly yearlong series of rate cuts, which has brought the federal funds rate down by 4.75 percentage points, from 6.5 percent at the start of the year, may be drawing to a close. Today's cut of a quarter-point in the fed funds rate followed three consecutive half-point reductions after the attacks on Sept. 11. Some analysts said the Fed had little choice today but to scale back to quarter-point moves, since it is starting to run out of room to reduce rates at all. But its statement also made clear that the Fed thinks it has more leeway to cut rates if necessary, in part because inflation has remained dormant. ''Economic activity remains soft, with underlying inflation likely to edge lower from relatively modest levels,'' the statement said. ''To be sure, weakness in demand shows signs of abating, but those signs are preliminary and tentative.'' The statement went on to use the Fed's code for a willingness to cut rates again, saying ''the risks are weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate economic weakness in the foreseeable future.'' Mark Vitner, an economist at Wachovia Securities, said Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, and his colleagues were trying to reassure both the stock market, which has rebounded smartly over the last two months on hopes that the economy will bounce back strongly next year, and the bond market, which has pushed long-term interest rates higher out of fear that a recovery will generate inflation. ''Not only does the Fed point out that inflation is heading lower, thereby reassuring bond investors,'' Mr. Vitner said, ''but they also hint that the economy is bottoming out, which should give stocks a boost.'' The Fed's statement reflected a debate among economists about how quickly the United States would pull out of the first recession in a decade. Citing upbeat signs like the strong stock market and relatively healthy consumer sales, some analysts are forecasting a quick rebound. Financial markets are already beginning to forecast interest rate increases by the Fed this spring, reflecting a belief that the combination of the rate cuts this year, plus action by Congress on a stimulus package, could send the economy into overdrive. Other analysts say the rebound could take longer and be more lethargic than expected. If this view is correct, interest rates would be likely to go lower, and stay low for longer, than investors expect. In any case, unemployment tends to keep rising even after the worst of a formal downturn is past, and sometimes even well into the recovery. Economists said the Fed tends to keep cutting rates for as long as unemployment keeps rising, suggesting that it could reduce rates once or twice more if this recession is of a typical length and depth. ''Over the past two decades,'' economists at UBS Warburg said in a report today, ''the Fed has not stopped easing until there's no further decline in the unemployment rate, which we expect to rise further from 5.7 percent in November to 6.2 percent'' by the end of March.""]","[""washington, dec. 11 -- with unemployment rising and the outlook for recovery muddled, the federal reserve continued its campaign of interest rate cuts today as president bush and the two parties in congress made progress in reviving negotiations on an economic stimulus package. the fed reduced its main lending rate by a quarter of a percentage point, to 1.75 percent, the 11th time this year it has cut borrowing costs. in announcing the move, the fed, the nation's central bank, noted signs that the downturn may be reaching a bottom, the first time the fed has done so since the terrorist attacks on sept. 11. but it added that the positive signs were tentative, and it left the door open to further rate cuts in the new year. as the fed was meeting, mr. bush instructed secretary of the treasury paul h. o'neill to go to capitol hill with a modified offer on the proposed economic recovery package. the president's press secretary, ari fleischer, said mr. bush was willing to move toward the democrats on several components of the package, including reducing rather than repealing the alternative minimum tax for corporations, limiting individual income tax reductions and increasing the amount of money the administration would be willing to devote to helping laid-off workers.

199,2009-03-18,"['Gold futures staged an about-face to move higher in thinly traded after-hours screen trading after a surprise statement from the Federal Open Market Committee that pressured the dollar and rekindled longer-term inflation concerns. Gold had settled lower in the open-outcry session, with nearby March gold futures down $27.70 to $888.70 an ounce on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange. The most-active April contract fell $27.70 to $889.10. The weakness was triggered by an abatement of recent flight-to-safety buying as financial stocks kept improving and by sell stops, preplaced orders triggered when certain chart points are hit. But in electronic trading two hours after gold\'s official close, the April contract had reversed and traded at $940.10, a rise of 5.7% from the session\'s close. The catalyst was steps announced by the Fed in its efforts to revive the economy, including plans to buy long-term Treasurys and more mortgage-backed securities. ""The dollar is getting whacked,"" said Frank Lesh, broker and futures analyst with FuturePath Trading. ""It\'s the fact they\'re going to buy Treasurys. That\'s a surprise to everybody."" Investors often buy gold as a hedge against dollar weakness. Investors also buy gold as an inflation hedge, and that also came into play, said Andrew Montano, director of precious metals at Scotia Mocatta. The market perceived the Fed announcement as a ""massive expansion"" of the Fed\'s balance sheet and a rise in the money supply, he said, adding, ""Inflation worries would be the primary issue."" This prompted heavy buying in gold, with buy stops triggered, he said. George Gero, vice president at RBC Capital Markets Global Futures, also cited short covering, in which traders buy to offset positions in which they previously went short, or sold, the metal. Gold\'s sharp turn around in after-hours trading could make it ripe for a pull back. ""You might need some consolidation,"" said Stephen Platt, analyst with Archer Financial Services. But gold support is coming on expectations of a weaker dollar as the Fed is ""trying to pump as much money into the system"" as it can, Mr. Platt said. ""You would think it would be inflationary."" The gold decline during the regular-hours session was the largest one-day dollar and percentage drop since Jan. 12, and the lowest settlement since Jan. 28. It put gold prices down 11.4% from the exchange-record close of $1,003.20 hit on March 18, 2008.

200,2009-03-18,"[""WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve sharply stepped up its efforts to bolster the economy on Wednesday, announcing that it would pump an extra $1 trillion into the financial system by purchasing Treasury bonds and mortgage securities. Having already reduced the key interest rate it controls nearly to zero, the central bank has increasingly turned to alternatives like buying securities as a way of getting more dollars into the economy, a tactic that amounts to creating vast new sums of money out of thin air. But the moves on Wednesday were its biggest yet, almost doubling all of the Fed's measures in the last year. The action makes the Fed a buyer of long-term government bonds rather than the short-term debt that it typically buys and sells to help control the money supply. The idea was to encourage more economic activity by lowering interest rates, including those on home loans, and to help the financial system as it struggles under the crushing weight of bad loans and poor investments. Investors responded with surprise and enthusiasm. The Dow Jones industrial average, which had been down about 50 points just before the announcement, jumped immediately and ended the day up almost 91 points at 7,486.58. Yields on long-term Treasury bonds dropped markedly, and analysts predicted that interest rates on fixed-rate mortgages would soon drop below 5 percent. But there were also clear indications that the Fed was taking risks that could dilute the value of the dollar and set the stage for future inflation. Gold prices rose $26.60 an ounce, hitting $942, a sign of declining confidence in the dollar. The dollar, which had been losing value in recent weeks to the euro and the yen, dropped sharply again on Wednesday. In its announcement, the central bank said that the United States remained in a severe recession and listed its continuing woes, from job losses and lost housing wealth to falling exports as a result of the worldwide economic slowdown. ''In these circumstances, the Federal Reserve will employ all available tools to promote economic recovery and to preserve price stability,'' the central bank said. As expected, policy makers decided to keep the Fed's benchmark interest rate on overnight loans in a range between zero and 0.25 percent. But to the surprise of investors and analysts, the committee said it had decided to purchase an additional $750 billion worth of government-guaranteed mortgage-backed securities on top of the $500 billion that the Fed is already in the process of buying. In addition, the Fed said it would buy up to $300 billion worth of longer-term Treasury securities over the next six months. That would tend to push down longer-term interest rates on all types of loans. All these measures would come in addition to what has already been an unprecedented expansion of lending by the Fed. The central bank also said it would probably expand the scope of a new program to finance consumer and business lending, which gets under way this week. In effect, the central bank has been lending money to a wider and wider array of borrowers, and it has financed that lending by using its authority to create new money at will. Since last September, the Fed's lending programs have roughly doubled the size of its balance sheet, to about $1.8 trillion, from $900 billion. The actions announced on Wednesday are likely to expand that to well over $3 trillion over the next year. Despite a trickle of encouraging data in the last few weeks, Fed officials were clearly still worried and in no mood to cut back on their emergency efforts. Fed policy makers sharply reduced their economic forecasts in January, predicting that the economy would continue to experience steep contractions for the first half of 2009, that unemployment could approach 9 percent by the end of the year and that there was at least a small risk of a drop in consumer prices like those that Japan experienced for nearly a decade. The Fed rarely buys long-term government bonds. The last occasion was nearly 50 years ago under different economic circumstances when it tried to reduce long-term interest rates while allowing short term rates to rise. Ben S. Bernanke, the Fed chairman, has been extremely cautious in recent weeks about predicting an end to the recession, saying that he hoped to see the start of a recovery later this year but warning that unemployment, a lagging indicator, would probably keep climbing until some time in 2010. In contrast to several recent Fed decisions, with the presidents of some regional Fed banks dissenting, the decision at Wednesday's meeting of the 10 members of the Federal Open Market Committee, the central bank's policy making group, was unanimous. Jan Hatzius, chief economist at Goldman Sachs, said the Fed had adopted a ''kitchen sink'' strategy of throwing everything it had to jolt the economy out of its downward spiral. But while Mr. Hatzius applauded the decision, he cautioned that the central bank could not solve the economy's problems by expanding cheap money. ''Even if the Fed could make interest rates negative, that wouldn't necessarily help,'' Mr. Hatzius said. ''We're in a deep recession mainly because the private sector, for a variety of reasons, has decided to save a lot more. You can have a zero interest rate, but if you just offer more money on top of the money that is already available, it doesn't do that much.'' Fed officials have been wrestling for months with the fact that lenders remain unwilling to lend and borrowers are unwilling or unable to borrow. Even though the Fed has been creating money at the fastest rate in its history, much of that money has remained dormant. The Fed's action is an expansion of its effort to bypass the private banking system and act as a lender in its own right. The Fed and the Treasury are starting a joint venture this week called the Consumer and Business Lending Initiative in their latest effort to thaw the still-frozen credit markets. The program will start out with $200 billion in financing for consumer loans, small-business loans and some corporate purposes. Fed officials have said they hope to expand the program next month, possibly to include the huge market for commercial mortgages, and both the Fed and Treasury hope the program will eventually provide up to $1 trillion in total financing.""]","[""washington -- the federal reserve sharply stepped up its efforts to bolster the economy on wednesday, announcing that it would pump an extra $1 trillion into the financial system by purchasing treasury bonds and mortgage securities. having already reduced the key interest rate it controls nearly to zero, the central bank has increasingly turned to alternatives like buying securities as a way of getting more dollars into the economy, a tactic that amounts to creating vast new sums of money out of thin air. but the moves on wednesday were its biggest yet, almost doubling all of the fed's measures in the last year. the action makes the fed a buyer of long-term government bonds rather than the short-term debt that it typically buys and sells to help control the money supply. the idea was to encourage more economic activity by lowering interest rates, including those on home loans, and to help the financial system as it struggles under the crushing weight of bad loans and poor investments. investors responded with surprise and enthusiasm. the dow jones industrial average, which had been down about 50 points just before the announcement, jumped immediately and ended the day up almost 91 points at 7,486.58. yields on long-term treasury bonds dropped markedly, and analysts predicted that interest rates on fixed-rate mortgages would soon drop below 5 percent. but there were also clear indications that the fed was taking risks that could dilute the value of the dollar and set the stage for future inflation. gold prices rose $26.60 an ounce, hitting $942, a sign of declining confidence in the dollar. the dollar, which had been losing value in recent weeks to the euro and the yen, dropped sharply again on wednesday. in its announcement, the central bank said that the united states remained in a severe recession and listed its continuing woes, from job losses and lost housing wealth to falling exports as a result of the worldwide economic slowdown.

201,1995-08-22,"['Prices of Treasury securities slipped yesterday, as the Federal Reserve left short-term interest rates unchanged at its monetary policy meeting and the Treasury sold two-year notes in a successful auction.   The 30-year bond slipped 8/32 of a percentage point, to a price of 99 28/32; its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, was 6.89 percent, compared with 6.87 percent on Monday.   The only data out, a weekly retail sales report by Johnson Redbook, showed a drop of 1.1 percent for sales so far this month, compared with the previous one-month period, little changed from last week\'s reading of a 1 percent decline. Analysts said this was consistent with recent reports of disappointing back-to-school retail activity, but since the market was already aware of the trend, the report had little market impact. What it did do was raise hopes for another easing by the Fed later this year.   Supply concerns also weighed on the market, particularly so soon after the quarterly refunding earlier this month. But after the recent flurry of dollar-buying interventions by central banks, market expectations were that there could be demand for Treasury securities to make use of the dollars purchased by the central banks. And traders thought that the two-year note would be a decent vehicle to be considered.   Yesterday\'s sale of $17.25 billion in two-year notes saw the high yield taken at 6.09 percent, lower than analysts\' expectations of a 6.10 percent yield, but higher than last month\'s yield of 5.955 percent. There was the customary drop in prices just ahead of the auction as some dealers sold off in hopes of lowering prices enough to make the two-year issue that much more attractive.   The Federal Open Market Committee began its meeting at 9 A.M.; at 2:14 P.M. the Fed announced that the meeting had ended at 12:25 P.M. without changing monetary policy.   Dealers waited for the meeting to end before setting up for today\'s five-year note auction. So when prices declined on the announcement it was apparent that the market was preparing for the $11.5 billion five-year note auction today rather than reacting to an unchanged policy. Traders said the five-year notes backed up a bit in when-issued trading, to 6.35 percent from 6.31 percent early in the day.   Theodore Ake, government trading manager at Kemper Securities in Chicago, described the two-year auction as successful, but suggested the price was a little rich. He said the auction drew support from the larger investors, basically a few big institutional investors that came in late.   Carroll J. Delaney, director of research at Stires, O\'Donnell & Company, said, ""The jury is still definitely out as to the extent of the economy\'s recovery, and it seems to us that lower interest rates would be at cross purposes with the obviously more important goal of keeping the dollar on an upward track.""   Eric Hamilton, a senior fixed-income analyst with Technical Data in Boston, said: ""The two-year auction found a decent welcoming committee, but there was no follow-through. Into Wednesday, it still appears necessary to build a little bit of a concession ahead of the when-issued five-year note."" He predicted that the welcome for the five-year note would not be so warm as for the two-year issue.   The municipal market was steady as investors focused on yesterday\'s $1.02 billion in new bonds, which included $227 million of Georgia general obligation bonds in a competitive sale that went to J. P. Morgan.   The securities were sought after because of their Aaa rating by Moody\'s Investors Service and AA+ by Standard & Poor\'s. They were priced to yield from 3.70 percent for a maturity date in 1996 to 5.33 percent for one in 2015.   The New York State Thruway Authority, in a negotiated sale, priced $234.4 million of revenue bonds through Paine Webber. Demand was good enough that underwriters were able to lower yields on a few issues by as much as 5 basis points. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.   The bonds were rated Baa-1 by Moody\'s and BBB by S.& P., and were priced to yield from 3.75 percent in 1996 to 6.20 percent in 2010, with term bonds due in 2014 priced to yield 6.436 percent and a bond due in 2015 priced to yield 6.45 percent.

202,1995-08-22,"['WASHINGTON, Aug. 22 -- With the economy apparently recovering from a stumble in the spring, the Federal Reserve\'s top policy committee chose today to leave short-term rates unchanged.   The decision to do nothing had been widely expected, given a recent string of strong economic indicators that suggested little need for the Fed to stimulate the economy right now. But the decision was nonetheless important as an indication that the central bank planned to move slowly on lowering rates even in the face of an equally striking set of indicators showing inflation was under control.   The Federal Reserve\'s decision had little effect on the stock and bond markets.   The group that met today, the Federal Open Market Committee, had voted on July 6 to cut interest rates for the first time since 1992. In the weeks before that meeting, the economy had seemed in worse shape, and the Fed\'s chairman, Alan Greenspan, had talked about the possibility of a recession.   Nevertheless, the panel chose to make the smallest possible reduction in short-term interest rates, and justified the move not in terms of the need for stimulus but on the grounds that ""inflationary pressures have receded enough.""   Given that the Federal Reserve had previously tended to change interest rates several times over the space of a year once it moved them at all, the July reduction in rates prompted considerable speculation about the pace of further rate cuts.   Today\'s decision to stand pat suggested that the tempo would be slow. The Open Market Committee is not scheduled to meet again until Sept. 26, although Wall Street economists said today the group might have voted to give extra discretion over the next five weeks to Mr. Greenspan to reduce rates further.   The Federal Reserve signaled it did not change interest rates today with a carefully phrased announcement that matched statements made previously when the committee had left rates untouched.   ""The Federal Open Market Committee meeting ended at 12:25 P.M.,"" Joseph R. Coyne, the central bank\'s chief spokesman, said at 2:14 P.M. ""There is no further announcement.""   This outcome means the target for the Federal funds rate, which banks charge each other for overnight loans but which the Fed strongly influences, is likely to stay at its current level of 5.75 percent. The Federal Reserve also left untouched the discount rate, which it charges banks for loans and which stands at 5.25 percent.   Clinton Administration officials had no comment on the Federal Reserve\'s decision today, in keeping with their policy of respecting the central bank\'s autonomy. But few officials seem to have strong views right now on interest rate policies in any case.   An interest rate cut now might raise economic growth slightly during next year\'s elections, which could help President Clinton\'s reelection campaign. But a rate reduction would also make it less attractive for foreigners to make short-term investments in the United States, and that would undermine Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin\'s effort to drive up the value of the dollar in international currency markets.   While Mr. Rubin has argued that a strong dollar is in the national interest because it protects the buying power of American consumers and preserves the dollar\'s dominant role in international trade, some Administration officials also contend that a strong dollar is in the Administration\'s political interest. When the dollar weakens, as it did last spring, it is widely viewed as a sign of national weakness that tends to hurt whatever President is in office, they argue.   Business groups like the National Association of Manufacturers and the United States Chamber of Commerce accused the Federal Reserve of excessive caution today.   ""We felt the Fed had room to cut,"" Martin A. Regalia, the chief economist at the Chamber of Commerce, said. ""There is virtually no inflation on the horizon, and the economy, while growing, is not growing anything like fast enough to trigger inflation.""   But with many signs the economy is growing at close to full capacity, long-term interest rates have risen over the last month as investors worried that a burst of economic growth might lead to shortages of some skilled workers and materials, feeding inflation. Investors tend to demand higher returns before lending money when they think that they might be repaid in dollars devalued by inflation.   ""There hasn\'t been any clamor in the financial markets for a rate cut, not like what it was in mid-June,"" said Kenneth P. Mayland, the chief financial economist and senior vice president at Keycorp, a Cleveland-based bank.   Mr. Greenspan testified before a Congressional subcommittee on July 19 that the worst risk of a recession had passed. Housing starts have risen while retail sales and industrial production have steadied after falling during the spring.   At the same time, consumer price inflation grew only two-tenths of a percent in July while there was no inflation in the prices that factories and other producers receive for their goods.   Steady growth and steady prices are exactly what Mr. Greenspan was pursuing when the Federal Reserve raised short-term interest rates seven times during a 12-month period that began on Feb. 4, 1994. The current outcome has pleased senior Fed officials.   ""We\'re in a situation where we\'re going to have exactly what the doctor ordered, which is slow, moderate growth,"" said Lawrence B. Lindsey, a governor of the Federal Reserve Board, in an interview at the beginning of last week.

203,1995-08-22,"['Wall Street endured a typically dull late-August session yesterday, showing little response to the Federal Reserve Board\'s decision not to act on interest rates.   Trading volume was sluggish and there were relatively small changes on the plus side in the major market averages.   After a follow-through of Monday\'s selling early in the day, the stock market leveled off until the last hour of trading. At that point, buyers entered the market and many stocks pulled out of minus territory.   ""The market spent a lot of time waiting for the Federal Open Market Committee meeting and then nothing happened,"" said Robert H. Stovall, president of Stovall/21st Advisers, referring to the meeting by the Federal Reserve\'s policy-making arm. ""Once the announcement came out, the uncertainty was removed and the market began to pay attention to earnings and dividends and momentum.""   Bond prices slumped, with the 30-year Treasury bond down 8/32 of a point and its yield, which moves in the opposite direction of its price, up to 6.89 percent from 6.87 percent on Monday.   Still, the Dow Jones industrial average snapped a five-day losing streak by rising 5.64 points to 4,620.42. The Standard & Poor\'s 500-stock index increased 1.41 points to 559.52 and the Nasdaq composite index gained 5.59 points to 1,025.29.   Despite the upturn in the averages, however, declining issues outpaced advancers, 1,157 to 1,028, on the New York Stock Exchange. Volume on the Big Board dropped again, to 290.9 million shares from 303.2 million shares Monday.   Returning to the fore yesterday were technology stocks, as traders determined that much recent concern over their earnings had been overblown. As a result, some companies in this group had substantial gains.   For example, with some analysts reaffirming the growth potential of the Intel Corporation, its shares rose 2, to 62 1/4. The Microsoft Corporation was another star, adding 4 13/16, to 99 5/16.

204,1995-08-22,"['WASHINGTON -- Federal Reserve officials left U.S. short-term interest rates unchanged, while separately an unexpected contraction in the German money supply increased speculation that the Bundesbank will cut rates soon. The decision by members of the Fed\'s Open Market Committee, who met yesterday to map out near-term policy, had been widely anticipated in financial markets and came six weeks after the Fed reversed course and pushed down rates by one-quarter percentage point in response to a weakening economy and abating inflationary pressures. The latest decision leaves the target for the important federal-funds  rate, at which banks lend to each other overnight, at 5.75%. Further reductions in interest rates later this year remain a strong possibility and could come as soon as the Fed\'s Sept. 26 meeting. Any move depends on incoming economic data about the pace of growth, the inflation outlook and congressional progress toward reducing the federal deficit. The economy\'s surprisingly swift rebound from its spring-time slump has relieved pressure on the Fed to cut rates to avoid recession and has led some Fed officials to conclude that they need to keep the central bank\'s foot on the brake. By holding short-term interest rates somewhere between 2.75 and 3 percentage points above the inflation rate, the Fed is restraining the economy, economists figure. ""Real [or inflation-adjusted] interest rates remain high at levels historically consistent with slow growth or recession,"" complains Lawrence Chimerine, economist at the Economic Strategy Institute in Washington, a liberal think tank that is calling for further rate cuts. ""They are restrictive, but they need to be,"" counters Michael Moran, economist at Daiwa Securities Inc. in New York. Inflation remains a threat, he says, unless the unemployment rate climbs slightly from current levels. ""If you consider only the economy, we shouldn\'t expect the Fed to ease again [this year]. There\'s one condition that could lead the Fed to ease again: If Congress puts together a credible deficit package and passes it."" But other economists say the receding inflation threat means inflation-adjusted interest rates are too high, and they specu late that the central bank will be looking for an opportunity to bring them down. ""There\'s no urgency here,"" says St. Louis forecaster Laurence Meyer. ""They might say we\'d like to move rates down a little bit."" The latest weekly survey of 16 Fed watchers by his firm, Laurence H. Meyer & Associates, found 10 who anticipate a further cut in interest rates at or before the Sept. 26 meeting of Fed policy makers. Although Mr. Meyer himself predicts a 1/4-percentage-point cut in rates in September, he isn\'t very confident of that. ""The good news is we don\'t have to worry about recession. The bad news is that we\'re coming back to trend [economic] growth, perhaps too quickly,"" and that may make the inflationary-wary Fed reluctant to lower interest rates. As is its current practice when it leaves rates alone, the Fed\'s spokesman said yesterday only that the meeting of its policy-making FOMC ended after 3 1/2 hours at 12:25 p.m. Details of the central bank\'s deliberations and the vote of the current members of the committee won\'t be released until late September. Financial markets didn\'t respond much to word that the Fed was leaving interest rates unchanged. The yield on 10-year Treasury notes was at 6.56% late yesterday, up from 6.52 the day before. But the dollar rallied earlier in the day on prospects for lower interest rates in Germany.   Late yesterday, the dollar was quoted at 1.4860 marks, up from 1.4765, and 96.85 yen, down from 96.90. In Germany, the Bundesbank\'s policy-setting Central Bank Council gathers tomorrow for its fort-nightly meeting. ""If all the information is going in the right direction, I am not excluding some room for maneuver in reducing interest rates in the next time,"" Bundesbank President Hans Tietmeyer said in an interview, which was conducted in English, with a Japanese news agency. A transcript of the interview was obtained by Dow Jones wire services, and the Bundesbank confirmed the accuracy of the remarks. A Bundesbank spokesman stressed that Mr. Tietmeyer\'s use of the phrase ""in the next time"" didn\'t indicate any specific date, implying rather ""in the time ahead."" A German move to lower interest rates would be welcome in the U.S. It probably would be matched by other European countries, spurring economic growth in Europe and with it demand for U.S. exports. Moreover, a German rate cut would make German securities less attractive to global investors, thereby depressing the German mark and lifting the dollar. Boosting the dollar is currently a shared objective of the U.S., German and Japanese governments. The Bundesbank said its broadly defined M3 money supply contracted at a 0.4% annual rate in the first seven months of the year, suggesting a diminishing inflation threat as the German economy slows down. Although the Fed largely disregards money-supply data in its deliberations, the Bundesbank tracks them closely. Many market analysts, and even some Bundesbank officials, had been expecting a mild acceleration in money-supply growth. Growth in M3 has fallen short of the Bundesbank\'s 1995 target of 4% to 6%. The report comes amid a series of gloomy economic indicators, including a 3.5% plunge in inflation-adjusted manufacturing orders in June. ""The M3 figures give the Bundesbank a perfect excuse to sink interest rates -- if that\'s what they want to do,"" said Joachim Fels, an economist at Goldman, Sachs & Co. in Frankfurt. ""If they want to lower rates, it would be to help the real economy. The chance of this happening is bigger now, but it\'s still not certain."" With bad news piling up, many market economists consider a reduction in official Bundesbank interest rates to be imminent. Juergen Pfister, a Commerzbank AG economist in Frankfurt, forecasts a reduction in Germany\'s discount rate to 3.5% from the current 4% by the end of September. ""The inflation outlook is opportune and the economy has been very disappointing,"" Mr. Pfister said. ""Despite some statistical uncertainty, it\'s clear that the economy in the first half was very weak, perhaps little better than stagnation."" In the interim, perhaps this week, the Bundesbank is expected to shave a bit off the interest rate it charges on its 14-day securities-repurchase agreements, a key financing instrument for German money markets, Mr. Pfister said.']","['washington -- federal reserve officials left u.s. short-term interest rates unchanged, while separately an unexpected contraction in the german money supply increased speculation that the bundesbank will cut rates soon. the decision by members of the fed's open market committee, who met yesterday to map out near-term policy, had been widely anticipated in financial markets and came six weeks after the fed reversed course and pushed down rates by one-quarter percentage point in response to a weakening economy and abating inflationary pressures. the latest decision leaves the target for the important federal-funds  rate, at which banks lend to each other overnight, at 5.75%. further reductions in interest rates later this year remain a strong possibility and could come as soon as the fed's sept. 26 meeting. any move depends on incoming economic data about the pace of growth, the inflation outlook and congressional progress toward reducing the federal deficit. the economy's surprisingly swift rebound from its spring-time slump has relieved pressure on the fed to cut rates to avoid recession and has led some fed officials to conclude that they need to keep the central bank's foot on the brake. by holding short-term interest rates somewhere between 2.75 and 3 percentage points above the inflation rate, the fed is restraining the economy, economists figure.

205,2009-06-24,"['A bout of selling hit Treasurys after Federal Reserve policy makers refrained from increasing the size of the Fed\'s asset-purchase programs. Treasury prices had rallied earlier in the session as some investors bet the Fed would boost the size of its $300 billion Treasury-purchase program or alter the mixture of asset buying in favor of Treasurys against mortgage-backed securities. A well-bid $37 billion, five-year-note auction earlier in the afternoon also lent support to government securities. A gauge of demand for the five-year notes from a broad range of investors, including foreign central banks, reached a historical high. ""There was some disappointment in terms of the Treasury-purchases program,"" said James Caron, head of U.S. interest-rate strategy at Morgan Stanley in New York. Bonds are likely to be pressured as investors brace for a $27 billion, seven-year-note auction Thursday, the final leg of this week\'s record $104 billion note supply from the Treasury. The Fed also is set to conduct a round of Treasury buying on Thursday, targeting maturities between 17 years and 30 years. Late Wednesday afternoon in New York, the 10-year note was down 12/32 point, at 95 12/32, to yield 3.687%, up from 3.640% late Tuesday, as bond yields move inversely to prices. The two-year Treasury fell 2/32 point, raising its yield to 1.204%. The yield curve, the spread between the two-year and 10-year notes, flattened to 2.49 percentage points from 2.53 points late Tuesday and 2.58 points Monday. The Federal Reserve made few major changes in its policy statement after officials concluded their latest meeting on Wednesday. Policy makers acknowledged signs of stability in the economy and suggested that price pressure remained contained near term. The Federal Open Market Committee voted, 10-0, to maintain the federal-funds target rate for interbank lending at a range between zero and 0.25%. Fed policy makers reiterated that they are likely to keep the fed-funds target rate at low levels for an extended period, a blow to some traders and investors who had bet on a more-hawkish statement. ""The Fed is reminding the hyperventilating bond market that it needs to relax; inflation will be low for some time because the economic weakness will be with us for a time,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd., based in New York. Mr. Rupkey said Fed policy makers aren\'t about to start thinking about an exit strategy, which would mean raising rates, because the economy won\'t be back to normal for quite some time. Gary Pollack, who helps oversee $12 billion as head of fixed-income trading in New York at Deutsche Bank AG\'s private wealth-management unit, said that he was neutral on the market at this point and expected the 10-year Treasury note\'s yield to trade within the 3.5% to 4% range over the next couple of months. Mr. Pollack said he would be a buyer if the 10-year note\'s yield rises to 4% and would sell if the yield falls back to 3.5%. The Treasury\'s newly auctioned five-year note came in at a yield of 2.7%, compared with the 2.719% just before the auction. The lower yield suggests strong demand, a contrast to market expectations given that the auction came shortly before the FOMC statement. The bid-to-cover ratio was 2.58, the biggest since October 2007, compared with 2.32 for the previous auction in May and the average of 2.16 from the past 10 auctions.

206,2009-06-24,"['Following is the text of the statement by the Federal Reserve on Wednesday announcing it was holding its base federal funds target rate at a record low between zero and 0.25 percent: Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in April suggests that the pace of economic contraction is slowing. Conditions in financial markets have generally improved in recent months. Household spending has shown further signs of stabilizing but remains constrained by ongoing job losses, lower housing wealth and tight credit. Businesses are cutting back on fixed investment and staffing but appear to be making progress in bringing inventory stocks into better alignment with sales. Although economic activity is likely to remain weak for a time, the committee continues to anticipate that policy actions to stabilize financial markets and institutions, fiscal and monetary stimulus, and market forces will contribute to a gradual resumption of sustainable economic growth in a context of price stability. The prices of energy and other commodities have risen of late. However, substantial resource slack is likely to dampen cost pressures and the committee expects that inflation will remain subdued for some time. In these circumstances, the Federal Reserve will employ all available tools to promote economic recovery and to preserve price stability. The committee will maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and continues to anticipate that economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period. As previously announced, to provide support to mortgage lending and housing markets and to improve overall conditions in private credit markets, the Federal Reserve will purchase a total of up to $1.25 trillion of agency mortgage-backed securities and up to $200 billion of agency debt by the end of the year. In addition, the Federal Reserve will buy up to $300 billion of Treasury securities by autumn.

207,1991-03-26,"['WASHINGTON, March 26 -- Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady said today that no taxpayer bailout of the nation\'s banks would be necessary if Congress approved the Administration\'s proposed banking legislation and if the economy avoided a complete collapse.   In an interview in his office, Mr. Brady gave an upbeat appraisal of economic prospects, but he suggested that the Federal Reserve could prolong the recession if it became ""preoccupied with inflation"" and kept interest rates too high.   Over the course of an hour, Mr. Brady addressed these other topics:   *The Resolution Trust Corporation, the agency overseeing the savings and loan bailout, will not be able to go out of business by the summer of 1992 as the law requires, and new legislation will be needed to allow the agency to continue to take over failed institutions after that.   *The United States should not help rebuild Iraq, as it did Germany and Japan after World War II, as long as Saddam Hussein is in power.   *The Secretary expects that a report from his staff within the next day or so will show that Mr. Hussein has assets hidden in the United States and other Western countries.   *The United States will not give new credits and other financial benefits to the Soviet Union in the immediate future because of the Soviet crackdown in the Baltic states.   *If Congress passes legislation to cut Social Security taxes, he will advise President Bush to veto it. Fears of a Bailout   Some officials say that so many banks will fail in the next year or two that the bank insurance fund will become insolvent. The Government would then have to step in and pay off the depositors, as it has done in the savings and loan industry at a cost of up to $500 billion.   Mr. Brady said he was ""very close to promising"" that a taxpayer bailout of the banks would not occur unless the economy performed much worse than expected and ""you have a pusillanimous reaction by Congress"" to the Administration\'s banking proposal.   The central parts of the proposed legislation would permit banks to open branches nationwide and allow mergers between commercial banks and other institutions like investment banks, brokerage houses and even industrial companies.   Interstate banking stands a good chance of being approved by Congress, but passage of the mergers proposal is much more in doubt.   Mr. Brady seemed of two minds about whether he should take an all-or-nothing approach toward the legislation or settle for the parts he can get from Congress quickly and abandon the rest.   At one point, he said he would not make the ""mistake"" of agreeing to tackle the elements of the measure piecemeal. But later in the interview, he said: ""I\'m not naive enough to think that when you put legislation in, there won\'t be changes in it. Of course, there will be.""   Agreeing with many economists, Mr. Brady said he expected the recession to end by midsummer, and he said he was spotting some encouraging signs. ""Oil prices are down; interest rates are down; consumer confidence has taken a bounce back; home sales were up,"" he said. ""So the leading indicators are leading.""   ""If the economy is managed properly,"" he said, ""we can have an upward-sloping economy, hopefully in the 2 to 3 percent range, over a long period of time.""   But Mr. Brady said the recession was brought on in part because the Federal Reserve kept interest rates too high in 1989 and the first half of 1990, and he worried aloud that the central bank might keep rates too high this spring and summer out of concern over inflation.   The Government reported last week that consumer prices rose by two-tenths of a percent in February and that when energy and food prices were excluded, they rose by seven-tenths of a percent. Many economists said they found the latter figure to be a troubling indication of incipient inflation, but Mr. Brady said he did not. He said the increase resulted primarily from one-time jumps in the cost of postage stamps and the excise tax on cigarettes.   Mr. Brady said that inflation was now primarily ""within the services area"" and that he had tried to convince Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, that higher interest rates would not bring down this kind of inflation.   The Federal Open Market Committee, the policy-making arm of the Federal Reserve, met today, but its decisions on what to do about interest rates might not be known for some time. The prevailing view on Wall Street is that the central bank will not make any moves for at least another couple of weeks while it tries to get a better reading of how the economy is performing.   ""We ought to be focusing on growth,"" Mr. Brady said, ""not inflation.""   Even if the recession lingered longer than he expected, the Secretary said, he did not foresee the Administration offering any measures like extended unemployment benefits in response. He said experience had shown that such steps would not become effective until the rebound was well under way. ""I don\'t think we ought to be pouring gasoline on an already-starting fire,"" he said.  ']","['washington, march 26 -- treasury secretary nicholas f. brady said today that no taxpayer bailout of the nation's banks would be necessary if congress approved the administration's proposed banking legislation and if the economy avoided a complete collapse.   in an interview in his office, mr. brady gave an upbeat appraisal of economic prospects, but he suggested that the federal reserve could prolong the recession if it became ""preoccupied with inflation"" and kept interest rates too high.   over the course of an hour, mr. brady addressed these other topics:   *the resolution trust corporation, the agency overseeing the savings and loan bailout, will not be able to go out of business by the summer of 1992 as the law requires, and new legislation will be needed to allow the agency to continue to take over failed institutions after that.   *the united states should not help rebuild iraq, as it did germany and japan after world war ii, as long as saddam hussein is in power.   *the secretary expects that a report from his staff within the next day or so will show that mr. hussein has assets hidden in the united states and other western countries.   *the united states will not give new credits and other financial benefits to the soviet union in the immediate future because of the soviet crackdown in the baltic states.   *if congress passes legislation to cut social security taxes, he will advise president bush to veto it. fears of a bailout   some officials say that so many banks will fail in the next year or two that the bank insurance fund will become insolvent. the government would then have to step in and pay off the depositors, as it has done in the savings and loan industry at a cost of up to $500 billion.   mr. brady said he was ""very close to promising"" that a taxpayer bailout of the banks would not occur unless the economy performed much worse than expected and ""you have a pusillanimous reaction by congress"" to the administration's banking proposal.   the central parts of the proposed legislation would permit banks to open branches nationwide and allow mergers between commercial banks and other institutions like investment banks, brokerage houses and even industrial companies.   interstate banking stands a good chance of being approved by congress, but passage of the mergers proposal is much more in doubt.   mr. brady seemed of two minds about whether he should take an all-or-nothing approach toward the legislation or settle for the parts he can get from congress quickly and abandon the rest.   at one point, he said he would not make the ""mistake"" of agreeing to tackle the elements of the measure piecemeal. but later in the interview, he said: ""i'm not naive enough to think that when you put legislation in, there won't be changes in it. of course, there will be.""   agreeing with many economists, mr. brady said he expected the recession to end by midsummer, and he said he was spotting some encouraging signs.

208,1996-08-20,"['The Federal Reserve decided not to raise interest rates yesterday. In reaching that conclusion, the Federal Open Market Committee had to debate an issue that has been dominating discussion at the Fed and the White House: How low can unemployment go without triggering an acceleration of inflation? The policy makers\' answer matters to business, investors and people looking for work. The lower the trigger rate, the longer the Fed can wait before pushing up interest rates in order to slow economic growth. The policy makers\' immediate problem is that the consensus on the trigger rate has broken down. In perhaps the last major statement of the old established view, the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City published a study in 1994 concluding that a jobless rate held below 6% would result in accelerating wage and price inflation. Few economists disagreed. The consensus rule worked well in the late 1980s. Unemployment fell below 6% in mid-1987, and labor costs began accelerating significantly in 1988. But the policy rule has failed recently. Joblessness has been well below 6% for nearly two years, yet labor costs have remained quiescent. In light of recent experience, nobody knows what the new trigger rate is. Around Washington, the most frequently heard guess is 5.5% -- simply because that is what unemployment has been hovering around since the end of 1994. But more substantial evidence is available. It can be found in the behavior of the Midwestern regional economy, as presented in the nearby chart. During the past two years, unemployment in the Midwest has averaged 4.5%. That is well below almost any expert guess at the trigger rate, yet growth in regional labor costs -- the lion\'s share of business costs, and so the biggest single warning sign of inflation -- has been contained. Interestingly, the table does provide some hint of cost acceleration so far this year. If so, it took a sustained period of 4.5% joblessness to trigger the acceleration. The regional evidence cannot be easily dismissed. The Midwest -- 12 states from North Dakota to Ohio, Wisconsin to Missouri -- is a huge, complex economy. Taken alone, it would be the fourth largest in the world. The 1990s have not seen substantial population inflows from other regions to relieve pressure from low unemployment. It is reasonable, therefore, to conclude that the Midwestern experience can help us understand how the U.S. economy has changed. The message from the Midwest is a substantial, not modest, shift in the unemployment-inflation relationship. Business leaders understand the magnitude of the continuing changes in the economy. For years they have argued to Washington policy makers that widespread cost rationalization (sometimes derided as ""downsizing"") and globalization have altered inflation dynamics, making the economy capable of faster growth and lower unemployment. However, many economists and policy makers are skeptical of business claims, reluctant to assign rationalization an important role in recent economic trends. Indeed, economists find it convenient to assume that the economy always operates close to its maximum efficiency, providing little room for sustained cost-cutting. In this debate, the economists are wrong; the business leaders are right. In ""The Price of Industrial Labor"" (D.C. Heath, 1985), I showed that labor cost inefficiencies accumulated in the 1970s and 1980s. Widespread rationalization today is working to reduce those inefficiencies, pushing costs closer to market realities in a variety of ways: tighter controls on perks (""nonwage benefits""), fewer lockstep salary increases within companies, outright elimination of higher-wage positions (frequently in middle management), a trend away from cost-of-living adjustments, and the replacement (at least in part) of annual wage increases with performance-based awards. The macroeconomic result of the concerted efforts to boost cost efficiency should not be surprising. A high trigger rate of unemployment results from widespread labor-market inefficiency. Europe today, with its chronic double-digit jobless rates, illustrates this point. The higher economic efficiency is, the lower unemployment can be without triggering wage and price inflation. Nor should it be surprising that the Midwest leads the nation in cost rationalization. The one-time Rust Belt, battered by low-cost imports and burdened by high joblessness, had to improve its economic efficiency sharply in order to survive. Once started, institutional shareholders have insisted that the revenue gains continue, making rationalization a continuing process. This process of cost rationalization has spread throughout the whole country, substantially altering the U.S. economy. It has reduced the trigger jobless rate, allowing the Midwest to sustain unemployment well below 5%. The consequences, however, do not stop with lower unemployment. Most notably, efforts to improve cost efficiency have helped push up corporate profits as a share of national income, reversing a two-decade decline. The effect has been dramatic. The four-year growth in inflation-adjusted earnings per share in the S&P 500 has reached a record high. That explains the robust stock market and suggests that equity prices will continue to rise as long as cost rationalization persists. If Washington doesn\'t mismanage the process -- by, for example, adopting any of the anti-downsizing nostrums being bruited around -- today\'s rationalization will provide the foundation for the best sustained performance of the U.S. economy since the 1960s. Like the `60s, this new golden age will be characterized by strong profits, low inflation, modest unemployment, rising financial-asset prices, rapid investment, robust productivity gains and a resumption in the growth of real wages and living standards. Books will be written, and read widely in Europe and Japan, on how to manage like the Americans. --- Mr. Annable is chief economist at First Chicago NBD Bank.']","['the federal reserve decided not to raise interest rates yesterday. in reaching that conclusion, the federal open market committee had to debate an issue that has been dominating discussion at the fed and the white house: how low can unemployment go without triggering an acceleration of inflation? the policy makers' answer matters to business, investors and people looking for work. the lower the trigger rate, the longer the fed can wait before pushing up interest rates in order to slow economic growth. the policy makers' immediate problem is that the consensus on the trigger rate has broken down. in perhaps the last major statement of the old established view, the federal reserve bank of kansas city published a study in 1994 concluding that a jobless rate held below 6% would result in accelerating wage and price inflation. few economists disagreed. the consensus rule worked well in the late 1980s. unemployment fell below 6% in mid-1987, and labor costs began accelerating significantly in 1988. but the policy rule has failed recently. joblessness has been well below 6% for nearly two years, yet labor costs have remained quiescent. in light of recent experience, nobody knows what the new trigger rate is. around washington, the most frequently heard guess is 5.5% -- simply because that is what unemployment has been hovering around since the end of 1994. but more substantial evidence is available. it can be found in the behavior of the midwestern regional economy, as presented in the nearby chart. during the past two years, unemployment in the midwest has averaged 4.5%. that is well below almost any expert guess at the trigger rate, yet growth in regional labor costs -- the lion's share of business costs, and so the biggest single warning sign of inflation -- has been contained. interestingly, the table does provide some hint of cost acceleration so far this year. if so, it took a sustained period of 4.5% joblessness to trigger the acceleration. the regional evidence cannot be easily dismissed. the midwest -- 12 states from north dakota to ohio, wisconsin to missouri -- is a huge, complex economy. taken alone, it would be the fourth largest in the world. the 1990s have not seen substantial population inflows from other regions to relieve pressure from low unemployment. it is reasonable, therefore, to conclude that the midwestern experience can help us understand how the u.s. economy has changed. the message from the midwest is a substantial, not modest, shift in the unemployment-inflation relationship. business leaders understand the magnitude of the continuing changes in the economy. for years they have argued to washington policy makers that widespread cost rationalization (sometimes derided as ""downsizing"") and globalization have altered inflation dynamics, making the economy capable of faster growth and lower unemployment. however, many economists and policy makers are skeptical of business claims, reluctant to assign rationalization an important role in recent economic trends. indeed, economists find it convenient to assume that the economy always operates close to its maximum efficiency, providing little room for sustained cost-cutting. in this debate, the economists are wrong;

209,1999-08-24,"[""WASHINGTON, Aug. 24 -- The Federal Reserve raised interest rates today by a quarter of a percentage point, the second increase in less than two months, saying the action should help avert inflation while allowing the nation's long economic expansion to continue. Brushing aside arguments from farmers, labor unions, manufacturers and some politicians that there was no inflation to fight, the central bank said it would increase the main rate it controls, the Federal funds target rate on overnight loans among banks, to 5.25 percent from 5 percent. It also said it would raise its more symbolic discount rate on loans to banks from the Federal Reserve system to 4.75 percent from 4.5 percent. The Fed said the risks of inflation should now be ''markedly'' diminished, a statement that investors and analysts read to suggest that further rate increases this year, while by no means out of the question, were less likely. Although relatively small, today's increases were intended to slow the economy by putting upward pressure on borrowing costs, or at least to help lock in a general rise over much of this year in the rates set by the financial markets. Mortgage rates, for example, have risen substantially this year, but their future course will depend largely on the bond markets' assessment of the risks of inflation and higher interest rates. Banks quickly raised their prime lending rates to 8.25 percent from 8 percent, a step that will result in higher rates on some consumer and small business loans. Stocks seesawed after the Fed's announcement and ended the day mixed. But analysts said the hint that further rate increases might not be necessary was good news for investors, who have bid stock prices up to record levels recently on the assumption that the central bank could control inflation without a protracted series of rate increases. Apparently driven by that reasoning, bond prices rose today, pushing long-term rates down slightly. [Page C1.] In a statement, the Fed portrayed its decision as another step in reversing the three quarter-point rate cuts it made last fall, when the global financial system was threatening to seize up and other countries were looking to the United States for help in keeping their economies afloat. The global crisis has largely passed, and in the meantime the American economy has continued to expand robustly, setting off some tentative warning signals about inflation but generating almost no actual inflation so far. Having now taken back two of last fall's three rate cuts, the Fed distinctly left open the possibility that it could raise rates a third time this year. Economists said the central bank could still increase rates another notch at its next meeting on Oct. 5 or the subsequent meeting on Nov. 16 if economic data showed inflationary pressure in the form of a sharp decline in unemployment, further big wage increases or a substantial rise in the Consumer Price Index. But its statement suggested that the Fed saw its work as more likely to be finished for the year, with any threat of inflation now contained. ''You'd have to view the odds of an Oct. 5 rate hike as considerably less than 50-50 at this point,'' said Bill Dudley, an economist at Goldman, Sachs in New York. ''Obviously it depends on the data, but most likely the Fed is done for the year.'' The Fed's statement said that with financial markets having recovered, economies worldwide bouncing back and strong growth in the United States creating an extremely tight labor market, ''the degree of monetary ease required to address the global financial market turmoil of last fall is no longer consistent with sustained, noninflationary economic expansion.'' In what analysts said was an important shift in tone by the central bank, the statement added that the combination of the two rate increases by the Fed plus a rise in recent months in the longer-term rates set by the markets ''should markedly diminish the risk of rising inflation going forward.'' The central bank said it had adopted a neutral outlook about the need for any changes to monetary policy over the short run, meaning that it did not see any clear evidence now that it would have to raise rates again. But it is unclear how much value that stance has in predicting the Fed's decision when it meets in October because it adopted a neutral position after raising rates a quarter-point on June 30 and went on to raise rates again today. The central bank's action drew criticism from a variety of interest groups and politicians who traditionally oppose higher rates. They said today that the increase was unjustified at a time when overall inflation was nearly dormant and the prices of farm products and some other commodities were falling or depressed. They said most companies had little ability to raise prices because of intense competition and had proved determined to absorb cost increases by increasing their efficiency. ''At a time when inflation is almost dormant and when foreign markets are only now beginning to emerge from recession, this decision is a disappointment,'' said Jerry Jasinowski, the president of the National Association of Manufacturers. Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts, said the rate increase would ''increase the likelihood that our national economic progress will continue to fail to benefit fully those at the lower end of the economic spectrum.'' Steve Forbes, the Republican Presidential candidate, said the Fed was turning a mighty economy into ''the economic equivalent of the Titanic.'' But economists on Wall Street said the Fed was doing the right thing to fight inflation before it took root because price stability has been the foundation on which the long expansion has been built. ''I'm right with the Fed on this issue,'' said Allen Sinai, an economist at Primark Decision Economics in New York, adding that the central bank had to act early because ''inflation is a glacial process, loaded with inertia.'' As it has for the last several years, the Fed's Federal Open Market Committee came into today's meeting facing a raft of somewhat contradictory economic data. Although it slowed in the second quarter and faces potential trouble from a rapidly expanding trade deficit and a weakening dollar, the economy appears to have regained momentum over the summer. Industrial output last month rose to its highest rate in more than a year. Housing starts remain strong and retail sales are robust. Demand for imports was strong, and rebounding economies in Asia and Europe mean better prospects for exporters. With growth strong, job creation has remained brisk, and wages rose last month at a pace that while gratifying to workers was seen by some economists as the first signs of a possible inflationary spiral. Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, has repeatedly focused in his public comments on the depletion of the labor pool and the possibility of an excessive surge in wages as the most immediate inflationary threat to the economy. Still, inflation by nearly all measures has remained controlled, if not dormant, leaving the Fed in the position of fighting what critics consider a phantom menace. The Fed has had to weigh several other tricky issues in setting policy. It would clearly prefer not to have to raise rates later this year at a time when the Year 2000 computer problem could be having real or psychological effects on the economy and the financial markets. Some analysts said the Fed might have decided to tighten policy today to reduce the need to do so late in the year. The central bank also continues to grapple with the relentless rise in stock prices, seeing both a threat to financial stability in the possibility of a market crash and a ''wealth effect'' that fuels consumption at a time when the Fed is trying to slow the economy. Rising interest rates generally dampen enthusiasm among investors, but Wall Street has so far been undaunted by the two rate increases, at least partly offsetting any slowdown the higher rates might bring.""]","[""washington, aug. 24 -- the federal reserve raised interest rates today by a quarter of a percentage point, the second increase in less than two months, saying the action should help avert inflation while allowing the nation's long economic expansion to continue. brushing aside arguments from farmers, labor unions, manufacturers and some politicians that there was no inflation to fight, the central bank said it would increase the main rate it controls, the federal funds target rate on overnight loans among banks, to 5.25 percent from 5 percent. it also said it would raise its more symbolic discount rate on loans to banks from the federal reserve system to 4.75 percent from 4.5 percent. the fed said the risks of inflation should now be ''markedly'' diminished, a statement that investors and analysts read to suggest that further rate increases this year, while by no means out of the question, were less likely. although relatively small, today's increases were intended to slow the economy by putting upward pressure on borrowing costs, or at least to help lock in a general rise over much of this year in the rates set by the financial markets. mortgage rates, for example, have risen substantially this year, but their future course will depend largely on the bond markets' assessment of the risks of inflation and higher interest rates. banks quickly raised their prime lending rates to 8.25 percent from 8 percent, a step that will result in higher rates on some consumer and small business loans. stocks seesawed after the fed's announcement and ended the day mixed. but analysts said the hint that further rate increases might not be necessary was good news for investors, who have bid stock prices up to record levels recently on the assumption that the central bank could control inflation without a protracted series of rate increases. apparently driven by that reasoning, bond prices rose today, pushing long-term rates down slightly.

But the reaction was subdued in the stock and bond markets because many had anticipated the Fed's announcement. ''The markets are seeing this as a 'we're done for now' kind of signal,'' said Richard Berner, chief United States economist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. He and other Fed watchers said, however, that they could not rule out a third rate increase by the Fed. The first in this series came on June 30. ''The economy remains very strong, and the balance of inflation risks continues to edge higher,'' Mr. Berner said. Douglas R. Cliggott, United States equity strategist at J. P. Morgan Securities, agreed. He said that stocks with high price-earnings ratios and those dependent on discretionary consumer spending, like autos and retailers, would be vulnerable if market sentiment swung back to the view that a third rate increase was in the offing. The Dow Jones industrial average, after jumping 199.15 points to a new high on Monday, dropped 16.46 yesterday, or two-tenths of one percent, to 11,283.30. The Dow was down 10 to 20 points before the Fed announced it was raising its interest rate target, the Federal funds rate, on overnight loans between banks, to 5.25 percent. Right after the news, the Dow fell just over 100 points before rebounding. The Wall Street saying that covers such selling on what would be considered good news is ''buy on the rumor and sell on the news''; that is, buy when you expect the news to be good so that you can take some profits when the news is good. The other major stock indexes finished higher, though they dipped temporarily after the announcement. The Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks closed up 3.28, or two-tenths of one percent, to 1,363.50; it was up about 3 before the announcement by the Fed at 2:15 P.M. The Nasdaq composite index ended at 32.80, up 1.2 percent, at 2,752.37; it was up about 25 before the announcement. In the bond market, the price of the 30-year bond rose 23/32, to 102 24/32, as the yield, which moves in the opposite direction, dropped to 5.93 percent, from 5.98 percent on Monday. The bond was up about 13/32 before the announcement. The price of the two-year note, which is more sensitive to Fed interest rate moves, rose 3/32, and the yield dropped to 5.58 percent, from 5.64 percent on Monday. The dollar was little changed on the news, falling against the Japanese yen and the euro. In emerging stock markets, the benchmark Mexican and Brazilian indexes fell after the announcement but were still up for the day. The signal from the Fed policy makers came in the statement released by the Federal Open Market Committee after yesterday's meeting. ''Today's increase in the Federal funds rate,'' the statement said, ''together with the policy action in June and the firming of conditions more generally in U.S. financial markets over recent months, should markedly diminish the risk of rising inflation going forward.'' This was a far more positive signal than the Fed gave when it made the June rate increase. The statement released then said the committee ''recognizes that in the current dynamic environment it must be especially alert to the emergence, or potential emergence, of inflationary forces that could undermine economic growth.'' Louis Crandall, the chief economist at R. H. Wrightson & Associates, warned against assuming that the Fed would not raise interest rates again before the year is over. He said one indication was that the Fed had also raised its discount rate, the rate charged on loans to member banks, a quarter of a percentage point, to 4.75 percent. He argued that this was an aggressive move, indicating that the Fed was worried about inflation, so another rate rise should not be ruled out. In past episodes of raising rates, Mr. Crandall said, the Fed had waited longer and until the spread between the discount rate and the target Federal funds rate was much wider before raising the discount rate. Mr. Crandall also pointed to a very small word change in yesterday's statement from the June statement. In both, the Fed referred to the three quarter-point rate cuts that were made last fall in an effort to calm the financial turmoil around the world after Russia defaulted on its debt and devalued its currency. In raising the Federal funds rate in June, the Fed said that much of the financial strain from the fall of 1998 had eased and, therefore, ''the full degree of adjustment is judged no longer necessary.'' In yesterday's statement, the Fed said, ''The degree of monetary ease required to address the global financial market turmoil of last fall is no longer consistent with sustained, noninflationary economic expansion.'' Mr. Crandall said that the change from ''full degree'' to just ''degree'' could be taken as a signal that the Fed would take back all those rate cuts, which means one more rate increase. When you just have the Fed's statement to go on, he said, ''that is the sort of fine distinction that you can't ignore.''""]","[""financial markets got what many investors interpreted as an all-clear signal from the federal reserve yesterday, as the central bank indicated that its latest quarter-point rate increase would be enough to slow economic growth and keep inflation in check. but the reaction was subdued in the stock and bond markets because many had anticipated the fed's announcement.

212,1995-05-23,"['Bonds rallied yesterday, sending interest rates to their lowest levels in nearly a week on speculation that the Fed would cut short-term interest rates soon.   The policy-making Federal Open Market Committee met without changing the Fed\'s monetary policy. After the meeting, the Fed\'s spokesman simply said, ""There is no further announcement.""   William Shea, senior vice president-head government trading at Nikko Securities Company International, said that Treasuries received a lift from a report in The Washington Post yesterday that suggested Fed officials would lower the overnight bank loan rates, better known as the Federal funds rate, sometime this year. The article said that the central bank could cut short-term rates as much as 1.50 percentage points this year, if growth slowed to a 2.5 percent pace.   Analysts said that since the economy was widely predicted to grow at less than that rate in the first quarter of this year, the newspaper article effectively presented a case for an easing of rates in the near term.   Other market watchers attributed some of the market\'s rise to a 1.1 percent drop in the Mitsubishi/ Werthein Schroder weekly sales report, saying that the bond market yesterday was driven by technicals.   Some analysts noted that dealers who tried to set shorts ahead of the auctions, could not because the market failed to give ground, forcing them instead to cover quickly. A short occurs when a market participant sells borrowed securities, hoping to buy them back later at lower prices, thereby pocketing the difference. However, if prices are rising instead of falling, shorts need to cover, that is buy back the securities in order to limit their losses.   According to some trading desks, the two-year note auction went well, with the average yield coming in at 6.15 percent, down sharply from the April auction when the yield was 6.52 percent, and the lowest since June 21, 1994, when the yield was 6.04 percent.   Today the Treasury will auction $11.5 billion in five-year notes, and in when-issued trading they were offered at a price to yield 6.37 percent.   Mr. Shea said he thought that the market was working on breaking out from a consolidation phase and resuming its upward path. In fact, he said, seasonally and technically he likes the market. ""This is one of the best times of the year to buy,"" he said, adding that the yield on the long bond might get to 6 3/8 to 6 5/8 percent in the near term before a substantial correction in the market.   In a technical analysis, Mr. Shea notes, bond price changes have developed a chart formation that is characteristic of fast market moves. This suggests that the market is in the late stages of a bull move, he said.   Eric Hamilton, senior fixed-income analyst with Technical Data in Boston, said, ""There are still concerns that investors are not fully prepared to take on any further supply, and the five-year and one-year auctions today and Thursday may have a harder time finding investor favor"" than did the two-year note.   In the Johnson Redbook weekly retail sales report released yesterday sales were up three-tenths of 1 percent for the first three weeks of May versus April. This was down slightly from the four-tenths of 1 percent gain reported last week and was slightly lower than some economists had expected.   Elsewhere, municipals rose in step with the rally in Government bonds, as investors concentrated on yesterday\'s $1 billion in new debt securities.   In the day\'s largest scheduled competitive sale, Connecticut sold $125 million in special tax obligation bonds in an offering awarded to Chemical Securities Inc.   The bonds were priced to yield from 4 percent for an issue due in 1996 to 5.75 percent in 2014 and 2015.

213,1995-05-23,"['WASHINGTON, May 23 -- Faced with slowing growth in the American economy and a strengthening dollar, the Federal Reserve left short-term interest rates unchanged at a meeting today.   The Fed\'s interest rate policy group, the Federal Open Market Committee, signaled its decision with a brief statement. ""The F.O.M.C. meeting ended at 12:15 P.M.; there is no further announcement,"" said Joseph R. Coyne, the Fed\'s chief spokesman.   The phrasing of the announcement matched almost exactly the wording of statements from previous meetings at which the Fed left interest rates unchanged.   Few economists were surprised by the Federal Reserve\'s announcement. The central bank doubled short-term interest rates in the 12 months that ended on Feb. 1 in response to a burst of economic growth that appeared likely to produce some increase in inflation.   A wide range of economic indicators since then has pointed to slower growth, while inflation has barely risen. Producer prices and consumer prices did creep up in April. But last year\'s sharp increases in prices for raw materials like wheat and for semiprocessed goods like steel have not yet produced the run-up in finished good prices that many Wall Street economists and some Fed officials feared last year.   In the bond market, longer-term interest rates have been sliding this spring as Treasury prices rallied in reaction to the dwindling inflationary pressures. Today, the yield on the Treasury\'s 30-year bond fell to 6.86 percent, from 6.91 percent.   The economy\'s slowing growth led some economists to speculate today that the Fed might ease monetary policy and push down interest rates later this year. ""There is a chance of easing in July and a bit greater chance in August, but I don\'t see any chance of tightening in 1995,"" said Lawrence Chimerine, an economist at the Economic Strategy Institute, a Washington research group.   Other experts say there is just as much chance of another interest rate increase this year as a rate cut, depending on whether the economy grows too fast or too slow. ""We\'re right on the razor\'s edge of that, and I think that\'s where the Fed is now,"" said Darwin L. Beck, an economist with the First Boston Corporation.   The Federal Open Market Committee is scheduled to meet next on July 5 and 6, and again on Aug. 22.   The Fed still faces risks that the economy will grow too fast or too slow, most likely as a result of fluctuations in consumer spending. The last two months have produced signs of weak consumer spending, notably a slowness in auto sales.   But some Fed officials also thought in June of last year that consumer spending was slowing and the economy with it, only to find that shoppers soon returned in force to stores. That experience may have left Fed officials cautious.   Falling interest rates in recent weeks have produced a surge in new mortgages and in mortgage refinancings, as consumers try to lock in lower rates. Many economists say lower rates will produce a recovery in home building and in sales of appliances like washers and dryers.   But many refinancings involve homeowners trading adjustable-rate mortgages for fixed-rate mortgages at about the same rates. Because these homeowners\' paymentsremain roughly the same each month, they may not have much added cash to spend on goods and services, said Sung W. Sohn, a senior vice president and chief economist at the Norwest Corporation, a bank holding company in Minneapolis.   The weakness of the dollar earlier this year had put some pressure on the Fed to push up interest rates to make American financial investments more attractive.

214,2002-11-06,"[""WASHINGTON, Nov. 6 -- The Federal Reserve cut its main interest rate today by half a percentage point, an aggressive move to ward off renewed economic weakness at a time when threats of terrorism and an impending confrontation with Iraq are weighing down business and consumer confidence. As the political parties in Washington digested the economic policy implications of Tuesday's Republican victory in the midterm election, the Fed put aside internal differences over the need for further rate cuts and voted unanimously for the half-point reduction. The step was intended to stimulate business investment and consumer spending by lowering borrowing costs. But the Fed also hinted that it does not plan to cut rates again when it next meets in five weeks, reflecting a view at the central bank that rates are now low enough and that it is in any case running out of room to reduce them much further. Economists said the United States would now have to rely increasingly on stimulative fiscal policy -- some combination of tax cuts and increased government spending -- to give the economy a boost if it does not bounce back soon. With Republicans now in control of the Senate as well as the House and the presidency, analysts said Congress is likely to take up a package of new tax cuts early next year. The Fed's action today generated a mixed response on Wall Street, where stock prices first rose right after the announcement, then fell sharply before gaining ground again as investors sought to sort out the economy's prospects and the altered political landscape. The Dow Jones industrial average closed at 8,771.01, up 92.74. The Nasdaq composite index rose 17.82, to close at 1,418.99. The central bank cut its federal funds target rate on overnight loans between banks to 1.25 percent, its lowest level since July 1961, from 1.75 percent, where it had been for 11 months. It also cut its discount rate on loans to banks from the Federal Reserve system by half a percentage point, to 0.75 percent from 1.25 percent. The reductions will put downward pressure on interest rates for some types of business and consumer loans, especially those tied to the prime lending rate, which fell at many banks today in lock step with the Fed's move. The effect is likely to be less pronounced on mortgage rates, which depend largely on movements in longer-term bond prices. It is not clear how much of a boost the economy will get from the rate cut. While lower interest rates have supported automobile sales and helped homeowners by encouraging waves of mortgage refinancing, they have had little effect on what is perhaps the biggest problem afflicting the economy: the reluctance of businesses to invest in new plants and equipment at a time when they are laden with overcapacity and face uncertain demand for their products. After having cut the federal funds rate by 5.25 percentage points in less than two years, the Fed also now faces the question of whether to conserve the limited monetary ammunition it has left as its main rate effectively approaches the zero point, a consideration that has troubled the Japanese for years. The Fed's decision came after several weeks in which economic indicators were weak or declining, leading some forecasters to predict that growth would slow to a crawl in the fourth quarter. But it also came after a weeks-long recovery in stock prices that seemed to reflect a judgment by investors that the worst for the economy might be past or soon would be. In the end, the Fed's decision seemed to be as much about addressing unsettled investor, consumer and business psychology as about reacting to hard numbers, reflecting the belief of Alan Greenspan, its chairman, that human nature is as often as not the main variable in times of economic stress. It amounted to a a sharp turnaround from the Fed's last meeting, in September, when it held rates steady despite calls from at least 2 of its 12 voting members for an immediate rate cut. ''This was a 'feel-good' policy action,'' said Kenneth T. Mayland of ClearView Economics, a consulting firm. He noted that sectors of the economy sensitive to interest rates, like housing and automobiles, are already vigorous and that the Fed's rate cuts ripple through the economy with long lags rather than providing a quick boost. Ian Shepherdson, chief United States economist for High Frequency Economics, a consulting firm, said the Fed's real intention was ''to calm the nerves of the market'' until the economic indicators begin to improve. In a statement explaining its action, the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee was careful to avoid suggesting that the economy had any deep-rooted problems that might lead it to stall again a year after emerging halfheartedly from the first recession in a decade. It emphasized that interest rates are already low enough to support an economic rebound, and that in the long run the economy is benefiting for an upturn in productivity, or business efficiency. Instead, the Fed characterized the economy as being held back by a lack of confidence, linked in part to the possibility of a war and further terrorist attacks. Suggesting that it will not rush into further rate cuts, the Fed shifted its outlook for coming months to neutral from its previous assessment that the economy was at risk of a slowdown. The statement said today's rate cut ''should prove helpful as the economy works its way through this current soft spot.'' In moving to a neutral outlook, the Fed said the risks to the economy were now balanced between a return of inflation and further economic weakness, a formulation that seemed to minimize any concern that the economy was on the brink of deflation, or a generalized decline in prices. Still, by cutting rates half a percentage point today, a bigger step than many analysts had expected, the Fed was following the playbook it has developed for dealing with a situation in which deflation is a risk and interest rates do not have much further to fall. In an internal staff paper written earlier this year, the Fed concluded, based on a study of Japan's failure to deal effectively with a similar situation, that central banks should cut rates early and aggressively when confronted with deflation, even if official short-term rates are already approaching zero. Acting aggressively now, however, gives the Fed that much less flexibility to cut rates next year, should the economy suffer a big shock like a spike in oil prices related to a war with Iraq.""]","[""washington, nov. 6 -- the federal reserve cut its main interest rate today by half a percentage point, an aggressive move to ward off renewed economic weakness at a time when threats of terrorism and an impending confrontation with iraq are weighing down business and consumer confidence. as the political parties in washington digested the economic policy implications of tuesday's republican victory in the midterm election, the fed put aside internal differences over the need for further rate cuts and voted unanimously for the half-point reduction. the step was intended to stimulate business investment and consumer spending by lowering borrowing costs. but the fed also hinted that it does not plan to cut rates again when it next meets in five weeks, reflecting a view at the central bank that rates are now low enough and that it is in any case running out of room to reduce them much further. economists said the united states would now have to rely increasingly on stimulative fiscal policy -- some combination of tax cuts and increased government spending -- to give the economy a boost if it does not bounce back soon. with republicans now in control of the senate as well as the house and the presidency, analysts said congress is likely to take up a package of new tax cuts early next year. the fed's action today generated a mixed response on wall street, where stock prices first rose right after the announcement, then fell sharply before gaining ground again as investors sought to sort out the economy's prospects and the altered political landscape. the dow jones industrial average closed at 8,771.01, up 92.74. the nasdaq composite index rose 17.82, to close at 1,418.99. the central bank cut its federal funds target rate on overnight loans between banks to 1.25 percent, its lowest level since july 1961, from 1.75 percent, where it had been for 11 months. it also cut its discount rate on loans to banks from the federal reserve system by half a percentage point, to 0.75 percent from 1.25 percent. the reductions will put downward pressure on interest rates for some types of business and consumer loans, especially those tied to the prime lending rate, which fell at many banks today in lock step with the fed's move. the effect is likely to be less pronounced on mortgage rates, which depend largely on movements in longer-term bond prices. it is not clear how much of a boost the economy will get from the rate cut. while lower interest rates have supported automobile sales and helped homeowners by encouraging waves of mortgage refinancing, they have had little effect on what is perhaps the biggest problem afflicting the economy: the reluctance of businesses to invest in new plants and equipment at a time when they are laden with overcapacity and face uncertain demand for their products. after having cut the federal funds rate by 5.25 percentage points in less than two years, the fed also now faces the question of whether to conserve the limited monetary ammunition it has left as its main rate effectively approaches the zero point, a consideration that has troubled the japanese for years. the fed's decision came after several weeks in which economic indicators were weak or declining, leading some forecasters to predict that growth would slow to a crawl in the fourth quarter. but it also came after a weeks-long recovery in stock prices that seemed to reflect a judgment by investors that the worst for the economy might be past or soon would be. in the end, the fed's decision seemed to be as much about addressing unsettled investor, consumer and business psychology as about reacting to hard numbers, reflecting the belief of alan greenspan, its chairman, that human nature is as often as not the main variable in times of economic stress. it amounted to a a sharp turnaround from the fed's last meeting, in september, when it held rates steady despite calls from at least 2 of its 12 voting members for an immediate rate cut. ''this was a 'feel-good' policy action,'' said kenneth t. mayland of clearview economics, a consulting firm. he noted that sectors of the economy sensitive to interest rates, like housing and automobiles, are already vigorous and that the fed's rate cuts ripple through the economy with long lags rather than providing a quick boost. ian shepherdson, chief united states economist for high frequency economics, a consulting firm, said the fed's real intention was ''to calm the nerves of the market'' until the economic indicators begin to improve. in a statement explaining its action, the policy-setting federal open market committee was careful to avoid suggesting that the economy had any deep-rooted problems that might lead it to stall again a year after emerging halfheartedly from the first recession in a decade. it emphasized that interest rates are already low enough to support an economic rebound, and that in the long run the economy is benefiting for an upturn in productivity, or business efficiency. instead, the fed characterized the economy as being held back by a lack of confidence, linked in part to the possibility of a war and further terrorist attacks. suggesting that it will not rush into further rate cuts, the fed shifted its outlook for coming months to neutral from its previous assessment that the economy was at risk of a slowdown. the statement said today's rate cut ''should prove helpful as the economy works its way through this current soft spot.'' in moving to a neutral outlook, the fed said the risks to the economy were now balanced between a return of inflation and further economic weakness, a formulation that seemed to minimize any concern that the economy was on the brink of deflation, or a generalized decline in prices. still, by cutting rates half a percentage point today, a bigger step than many analysts had expected, the fed was following the playbook it has developed for dealing with a situation in which deflation is a risk and interest rates do not have much further to fall. in an internal staff paper written earlier this year, the fed concluded, based on a study of japan's failure to deal effectively with a similar situation, that central banks should cut rates early and aggressively when confronted with deflation, even if official short-term rates are already approaching zero. acting aggressively now, however, gives the fed that much less flexibility to cut rates next year, should the economy suffer a big shock like a spike in oil prices related to a war with iraq.""]",33.0,1.0,"while lower interest rates have supported automobile sales and helped homeowners by encouraging waves of mortgage refinancing, they have had little effect on what is perhaps the biggest problem afflicting the economy: the reluctance of businesses to invest in new plants and equipment at a time when they are laden with overcapacity and face uncertain demand for their products",,,,,,,1

216,2002-11-06,"[""An article in Business Day on Thursday about the performance of the stock market on Wednesday misidentified the meeting postponed by the biotechnology company Amgen, whose stock fell 7.7 percent. It was the company's business review meeting for Wall Street; its annual meeting is still scheduled for May. CORRECTED BY THE NEW YORK TIMES SATURDAY NOVEMBER 09, 2002 Stocks bounced around but finally finished in the black yesterday after a bigger-than-expected rate cut by the Federal Reserve seemed to leave investors wondering about the outlook for the economy. The three main market gauges moved between small gains and small losses ahead of the 2:15 p.m. announcement from Fed policy makers. Immediately after the rate cut of half a percentage point, stocks rallied then fell, and then reversed course again and climbed higher, as positive interpretations of the Fed rate cut won out, for now. At the close, the Dow Jones industrial average was up 92.74 points, or 1.1 percent, to 8,771.01. After the Fed announcement, the Dow made a 209-point swing, down to 8,590.19 and up to 8,800. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index climbed 8.37 points, or 0.9 percent, to close at 923.76. The Nasdaq composite index rose 17.82 points, or 1.3 percent, to 1,418.99. Despite a four-week rally and the Fed rate cut, all three gauges are still below the peaks they reached during the summer rally, which ended in late August as the overall market plunged to a five-and-a-half-year low in the second week of October. Drug companies were among the stocks leading the market higher yesterday. Analysts said that with Republicans in control of Congress, price caps in a prescription drug bill were less likely. Merck rose $1.80, or 3.3 percent, to $56. Military contractors, who could benefit from a war in Iraq, also rose. Boeing was up $2.06, or 6.5 percent, to $33.58. Amgen, the biotechnology company, plunged $3.87, or 7.7 percent, to $46.21, after it postponed its annual meeting to Feb. 25 from Nov. 21, worrying investors about its outlook. ''It was a good day for the stock market,'' said Joseph Liro, an economist and market analyst at Stone & McCarthy Research Associates. He said that the combination of the Fed rate cut and the fiscal stimulus now possible from a Republican-controlled Congress ''put a charge into the market.'' The rally after the Fed rate cut, Mr. Liro said, surprised him because he had expected that ''investors would take profits after a good four weeks'' during which the Dow rose 20 percent and the Nasdaq climbed 27 percent. But he said he expected profit taking sometime in the next few days. Analysts said that the half-point rate cut, instead of the expected quarter-point reduction, showed that Fed policy makers wanted to be aggressive in their effort to rekindle the recovery, which many forecasters expect to slow to a 1 percent to 2 percent growth rate in the fourth quarter. ''There is no one left who doesn't know the economy is doing terribly,'' said Robert J. Barbera, the chief economist at ITG/Hoenig. In addition, the Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed panel that sets interest rates, made clear in its statement that it thought that the outlook for the economy was positive and that the current slowdown was just a ''soft spot.'' On the negative side, the bigger-than-expected rate cut may have made some investors ask why. One answer is that Fed policy makers think the economy is in more trouble than many investors think. Another reason for some investor dismay was that Fed policy makers said that the risks the economy now faces are balanced between slower growth and higher inflation. To some investors, this means that it is less likely there will be another rate cut in December, when Fed officials are next scheduled to met. In the bond market, prices rose while yields, which move in the opposite direction, fell as some investors seemed to think the Fed rate cut signaled that the economy might be softer longer than expected. The yield on the Treasury's 10-year note fell to 4.03 percent from 4.07 percent on Tuesday as the price rose 9/32 , to 102 24/32 . The yield on the 10-year note auctioned yesterday was 4.095 percent at auction and rose to 4.11 percent late in the day. In the currency market, the dollar fell as the euro rose to a value of $1.0029, up from 99.94 cents on Tuesday. Some analysts interpreted the fall in the dollar as another sign that investors are worried that the economy here will be weaker for longer than expected. The dollar has not been at so-called parity against the euro at the end of a trading day since July, and yesterday's move may mean there is more weakness ahead of the dollar.

218,2007-06-28,"['U.S. Treasury prices dropped as policy makers continued to stress inflation as their primary concern after leaving interest rates steady for the eighth straight meeting. Shorter-maturity issues were the hardest hit after the Federal Open Market Committee left rates at 5.25%, as expected, yet continued to stress worries over price pressures and pointed to an economy likely to continue to expand over the coming quarters. As a result, Treasury investors turned more downbeat on an ease in interest rates in the foreseeable future. The two-year note, the most sensitive to official interest-rate changes, was down 4/32 point to 99 28/32. Its yield rose to 4.950% from 4.879% Wednesday, as yields move inversely to prices. The benchmark 10-year note, the baseline for other types of debt, from fixed home loans to corporate bonds, fell 11/32 to 95 8/32 for a yield of 5.118%. ""The Fed looks hawkish,"" said John Canavan, market analyst at Stone &McCarthy, referring to policy makers\' view that the recent downtrend in price pressures has yet to be established in a convincing fashion. Mr. Canavan expects the two-year yield could head back up to 5% as investors take rate-cut bets off the table. That will flatten the yield curve -- the gap between short- and long-term yields, he added. Late in the session, short-term interest-rate futures contracts were showing 56% odds of a cut in interest rates to 5% by the first quarter of next year, compared with 80% odds before the Fed decision. The statement was ""more hawkish than I thought [it would be] -- it\'s out of left field,"" said Richard Gilhooly, interest-rate strategist at BNP Paribas in New York. ""It shows [the Fed is] running out of patience on inflation,"" he added. With policy makers so focused on inflation -- and barring a serious upset in the U.S. subprime markets -- Treasury yields look set to hover around or above the 5% mark as the summer continues. Drew Matus, economist at Lehman Brothers in New York, is among those who see an upside risk to Treasury yields from here. Mr. Matus said ""it doesn\'t make sense to me why"" the two-year yield ""is as low as it is"" at a time when the Fed looks as if it will stay on hold for a long while yet. And it isn\'t just the Fed stance that will pressure yields. Foreign central banks have recently seemed less eager to buy Treasurys -- another factor keeping yields on an upward path, particularly on the long end of the curve. The suspicion that market rates are unlikely to decline is also fueled by trends outside the U.S. Government-bond yields in Europe, the United Kingdom, Japan and elsewhere have recently hit multiyear highs lifted by stronger-than-expected growth and inflation pressures in many overseas economies as well. Indeed, several overseas central banks -- including those in the U.K. and Australia -- have had to resume increasing rates over the past 18 months, long after economists there thought the tightening cycle was over. Dollar General, CanWest Reconfigure Bond Deals Two high-yield bond deals stumbled, adding to a growing list of issues that have struggled to find buyers in the past week. Issuers accustomed to easily placing bonds and dictating pricing terms are suddenly encountering head winds from investors. Dollar General Corp. sold $1.9 billion of bonds. But it had to shuffle the deal to adjust to resistance to a $725 million tranche of PIK toggle notes -- which give issuers the option to make interest payments with more debt rather than cash. The underwriters handling the deal -- which included Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Citigroup Inc., Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. and Wachovia Corp. -- were forced to keep the PIK toggle notes themselves and plan to sell them to investors in a separate offering in the coming weeks. The other $1.175 billion of the deal had previously been split into $625 million in senior eight-year notes and $550 million in senior subordinated 10-year notes. It was combined into a single tranche of senior eight-year notes noncallable for four years and sold to yield 11%. The bonds, combined with a $2.43 billion loan, will fund the leveraged buyout of Dollar General by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &Co. Separately, CanWest MediaWorks LP sold its junk-bond offering -- which had been downsized earlier in the day from $650 million to $400 million -- to yield 9.25% via Citibank and Bank of Nova Scotia, or Scotiabank, according to a person familiar with the matter.

219,2007-06-28,"['WASHINGTON -- With the nation\'s underlying inflation falling, the Federal Reserve yesterday softened its hawkish inflation stance a bit while squelching any suggestion it might cut interest rates soon. The central bank, in the statement issued at the end of its two-day meeting, sidestepped the question of whether the current inflation rate is low enough. It emphasized that the outlook for inflation -- and not the latest inflation reading -- is now driving its interest-rate decisions. On that score, the Fed reiterated that its ""predominant policy concern remains the risk that inflation will fail to moderate as expected."" As widely expected, the Fed\'s policy-making Federal Open Market Committee left its short-term interest-rate target at 5.25%, where it has been for almost exactly a year.

Revisions to first-quarter data released yesterday suggest the decline was less pronounced. The May core inflation, to be reported today, may remain at 2% rather than the 1.9% widely expected before yesterday\'s revisions were reported. Even so, that would be at the bottom of the 2% to 2.25% year-end range the FOMC projected in February, meaning inflation is easing ahead of schedule. The Fed doesn\'t have an inflation target. Some Fed officials say their ""comfort zone"" for inflation is 1% to 2% and see a number much above 1.5% as too high.

Still, with the FOMC in the midst of a lengthy debate on how to better communicate, yesterday\'s statement was less a wink at an implicit target and more an attempt to sidestep the issue altogether. More importantly, the Fed emphasized that it isn\'t enough for inflation to be low now, it must also remain low for the next few years. On that score, it still sees risks it could move higher. With unemployment hovering near a six-year low of 4.5%, policy makers suspect the economy has little, if any, spare capacity, and firms and workers might have greater than usual ability to raise prices and wages. Yesterday the Labor Department reported that initial claims for unemployment insurance fell 13,000 last week to 313,000, reversing three straight increases, suggesting the job market remains healthy. The Commerce Department yesterday also revised up its estimate of first-quarter growth to 0.7% at an annual rate from 0.6%, primarily due to higher exports than previously estimated. Economists generally expect growth to rebound to above 3% in the quarter now ending. Still, the likelihood of a Fed rate increase also appears to be receding. The run-up in Treasury bond yields, from below 4.7% in May to about 5.1% now, appears driven in part by growing risk aversion by investors previously willing to accept the same return on long-term as short-term bonds.

221,2007-12-11,"['WASHINGTON -- With a deepening credit crunch threatening to drag the stalled U.S. economy into recession, the Federal Reserve cut interest rates for the third time since August, and left the door open to further cuts. But yesterday\'s moves, at the low end of Wall Street\'s hopes, disappointed investors, who had looked to the Fed to do more to thaw frozen credit markets. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell sharply, undoing about a third of the run-up in stocks triggered in late November when top Fed officials first publicly signaled that another rate cut was likely. The blue-chip average ended the day at 13432.77, down 294.26 points, or 2.1%. The Fed lowered its target for the federal-funds rate, charged on overnight loans between banks, by a quarter percentage point to 4.25%. It also cut the discount rate, at which it lends directly to banks, by the same amount, to 4.75%. Fed officials, however, continue to consider ways of using various tools -- including the discount rate -- to combat banks\' unwillingness to lend even to each other, which they view as a threat to economic growth. The central bank could take action within days. A variety of steps, widely discussed in the markets, are likely to be on the table, including another cut in the discount rate, longer-term loans to money-market dealers, easier collateral rules for loans from the Fed, and other steps last taken in 1999 to alleviate funding pressures ahead of the year 2000, when many feared a ""Y2K"" computer bug would disrupt markets and create economic havoc. Changes in the discount rate can be made by the Fed board in Washington without the approval of the entire 17-member policy-making Federal Open Market Committee, which sets the federal-funds rate target. Some on Wall Street yesterday criticized the Fed\'s actions so far as inadequate. ""From talking to clients and traders, there is in their view no question the Fed has fallen way behind the curve,"" said David Greenlaw, economist at Morgan Stanley. ""There\'s a growing sense the Fed doesn\'t get it."" Markets believe a weakening economy will force the Fed to cut rates even more than they expected before yesterday, Mr. Greenlaw said. Futures markets anticipate another cut in January and a federal-funds rate of 3.25% by next fall. In its statement yesterday, the Fed said that its quarter-point rate cut, which pushed the federal-funds rate a full percentage point below where it stood in early August, ""should help promote moderate growth over time."" In October, the central bank said the risks of weaker growth and of higher inflation were roughly balanced, signaling it didn\'t expect to cut rates again. Yesterday, the Fed declined to give an explicit indication of its next move. It said it will assess financial and other developments and ""act as needed."" The Fed\'s language left its options open for its next meeting in late January. The FOMC\'s 10 voting members approved the rate cut 9-1. Federal Reserve Bank of Boston President Eric Rosengren dissented in favor of a sharper, half-point cut. One FOMC member also dissented in October, but in favor of no rate cut. The shift in the dissents, from wanting less rate cutting to wanting more, shows the turn toward pessimism at the Fed. ""Economic growth is slowing, reflecting the intensification of the housing correction and some softening in business and consumer spending,"" the Fed said yesterday. ""Moreover, strains in financial markets have increased in recent weeks."" Unlike the previous two rate cuts, yesterday\'s wasn\'t portrayed as ""insurance"" against improbable but potentially damaging economic scenarios. That suggests Fed officials view the economy as weaker than they expected as recently as late October. Corporate executives are also signaling a more downbeat outlook. ""I\'m not going to put a happy face on this. Consumers are going to be a challenge in 2008,"" General Electric Co. Chief Executive Jeffrey Immelt told investors yesterday. But global growth is ""as strong as ever,"" he added. When Fed policy makers met in late October, financial markets were in better shape than they had been in August, and the economy had just posted a strong third-quarter performance. They chose to cut rates by a quarter point and concluded that would likely be enough. But in subsequent weeks, markets reversed course as big losses tied to soured mortgage-related investments cut into the capital of major banks and other financial institutions, limiting their ability to lend. Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke and Vice Chairman Donald Kohn signaled their increased concern in speeches in late November, foreshadowing yesterday\'s rate cut. Even so, investors, who have persistently had a gloomier outlook than the Fed, were disappointed the Fed didn\'t cut rates more or signal greater willingness to do so. ""Well, the boys blew it again. You wonder which economy they are looking at and what it is they are thinking about,"" said Alfred Kugel, Chicago-based chief investment strategist for investment-management firm Atlantic Trust of Atlanta. Bond prices shot up yesterday and yields, which move in the opposite direction, fell sharply. The 10-year Treasury note\'s yield dropped to 3.97% from 4.1% just before the announcement, while the two-year note\'s yield, which is especially sensitive to expectations of Fed action, fell to 2.92% from 3.13%. Yields on corporate bonds rose relative to Treasurys. Major banks, meanwhile, lowered their prime lending rates, the benchmark for many consumer and business loan rates, to 7.25% from 7.5%. The Fed has found it especially difficult to discern the economy\'s path and thus the right level for rates because the main threat facing the economy is the reluctance of banks and investors to lend to home buyers, businesses and consumers. That\'s harder to measure than the things that usually drive the business cycle -- such as profits, inventories, employment and the Fed\'s own interest-rate actions. Brian Sack, an economist at Macroeconomic Advisers LLC, said that in 2001 the major shock to the economy was the stock market. ""We have a better shot at trying to calibrate those wealth effects, whereas the credit turmoil has many dimensions to it. Frankly it\'s hard to assess how much economic restraint you get from those various dimensions."" In the past month, data on the so-called real economy have been soft but not dramatically so. Macroeconomic Advisers said yesterday it now expects the economy to shrink marginally during the current quarter, then grow at a 1.8% annual rate in the first quarter of 2008. On the other hand, credit markets have tightened sharply. Since Oct. 31, the yields on securities backed by auto loans have jumped to 6.3% from 5.4%, while yields on securities backed by home-equity loans have jumped to 7.7% from 6.6%, according to J.P. Morgan Chase &Co. Rates on ""jumbo"" mortgages -- those larger than $417,000 -- are around 6.9%, up from 6.6%. The London interbank offered rate, the rate banks charge each other for three-month loans in the offshore market -- is a full percentage point above the expected federal-funds rate; it is typically less than a tenth of a point higher. There isn\'t yet evidence these higher rates have significantly bit into consumer spending, outside of housing, and the rates could drop after year-end funding pressures ease. But investors generally don\'t expect that to happen. A survey by Macroeconomic Advisers of 55 clients, mostly hedge funds and other sophisticated investors, found most expect little retracement of the wide spreads between yields on risky debt and Treasury yields by next year, and most expect banks to curtail lending. ""The possibility of a widespread pullback in credit availability is a significant risk to the outlook,"" the firm said. --- E.S. Browning contributed to this article.

222,2007-12-11,"['NEW YORK -- The yen bested both the euro and dollar, as risk aversion swept through financial markets after the Federal Reserve announced a third-consecutive cut to interest rates to defend the U.S. economy. The yen surged on a sharp decline in U.S. stocks, with equity investors disappointed by the 25-basis point cut to the fed-funds rate, instead of a 50-basis-point reduction -- although few market watchers actually expected the latter. ""This is the bare minimum that was expected,"" said Marc Chandler, global head of foreign exchange at Brown Brothers Harriman in New York. Consequently, the euro dropped almost three yen from its intraday high and the dollar declined almost 1.5 yen from its intraday high after the announcement. The euro\'s significant fall, just one day after striking a one-month high of 164.58 yen, helped boost the dollar against the single currency. The dollar was also boosted against the euro, said Robert Sinche, head of global foreign exchange at Bank of America in New York, because it is more attractive than it would have been if there was a 50-basis point cut. A cut to the fed-funds rate of any size suggests downside risks for the U.S. currency because lower rates reduce investors\' returns on dollar-denominated assets. However, the dollar\'s reaction wasn\'t as large as seen in the past, perhaps because the Fed itself stressed the current uncertainty. ""For now, the foreign-exchange markets will be taking their cue from other markets, like the commodity and equity markets,"" Mr. Sinche added. The euro was at $1.4653 in New York, down from $1.4717 the previous day, while the dollar was at 110.64 yen, compared with 111.68 yen. The U.K. pound was at $2.0337, down from from $2.0474, while the dollar was quoted at 1.1315 Swiss francs, compared with 1.1278 Swiss francs late Monday. The Federal Open Market Committee voted 9-1 to reduce the federal-funds rate to 4.25% from 4.5%, its third reduction since September totaling 100 basis points. It also cut the discount rate it charges banks that borrow from the Fed by 25 basis points to 4.75%. The market anticipated a cut after statements from several officials early last month, most pointedly by Fed governor Randall Kroszner, who on Nov. 16 said ""the current stance of monetary policy should help the economy get through the rough patch during the next year."" The dollar had retreated from its lifetime lows against the euro following that speech on the positive momentum it created in U.S. equities. ""Incoming information suggests that economic growth is slowing,"" the FOMC said in its statement, reflecting the ""intensification"" of the housing slump and slower business and consumer spending. The statement signaled an about-face from the previous Fed meeting, when the board suggested further easing was off the table. The Fed also dropped its previous assertion that growth and inflation risks were roughly balanced, opting instead for an open-ended view, and pledged to ""act as needed"" to keep the economy growing and inflation in check. The dollar and euro\'s subsequent decline versus the yen followed a typical low-risk appetite trading pattern. The yen benefits during times of risk aversion because Japan\'s ultra-low interest rates make the yen a funding currency for riskier assets when the market has a more positive sentiment. When that perspective shifts, the funds shift back into the yen. A similar pattern often aids the dollar against the euro and currencies like the Brazilian real, as it did yesterday. However, currency analysts say that the Fed\'s downside view of the economy indicates that this is no dollar rebound. Before the FOMC announcement, there was no significant U.S. economic data to sway the market\'s focus from the meeting and the dollar was largely rangebound. Today, the U.S. October trade deficit will be released at 8:30 a.m. EST, at the same time as November import prices. November\'s federal budget will be released at 2 p.m. EST. Late in the evening, Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson will close the U.S.-China Strategic Economic Dialogue in Beijing, during which he had planned to press China to pick up the pace on adopting a more flexible currency policy. --- Dan Molinski in New York and Brian Blackstone and Henry J.

""for now, the foreign-exchange markets will be taking their cue from other markets, like the commodity and equity markets,"" mr. sinche added. the euro was at $1.4653 in new york, down from $1.4717 the previous day, while the dollar was at 110.64 yen, compared with 111.68 yen. the u.k. pound was at $2.0337, down from from $2.0474, while the dollar was quoted at 1.1315 swiss francs, compared with 1.1278 swiss francs late monday. the federal open market committee voted 9-1 to reduce the federal-funds rate to 4.25% from 4.5%, its third reduction since september totaling 100 basis points. it also cut the discount rate it charges banks that borrow from the fed by 25 basis points to 4.75%. the market anticipated a cut after statements from several officials early last month, most pointedly by fed governor randall kroszner, who on nov. 16 said ""the current stance of monetary policy should help the economy get through the rough patch during the next year."" the dollar had retreated from its lifetime lows against the euro following that speech on the positive momentum it created in u.s. equities. ""incoming information suggests that economic growth is slowing,"" the fomc said in its statement, reflecting the ""intensification"" of the housing slump and slower business and consumer spending. the statement signaled an about-face from the previous fed meeting, when the board suggested further easing was off the table. the fed also dropped its previous assertion that growth and inflation risks were roughly balanced, opting instead for an open-ended view, and pledged to ""act as needed"" to keep the economy growing and inflation in check. the dollar and euro's subsequent decline versus the yen followed a typical low-risk appetite trading pattern. the yen benefits during times of risk aversion because japan's ultra-low interest rates make the yen a funding currency for riskier assets when the market has a more positive sentiment. when that perspective shifts, the funds shift back into the yen. a similar pattern often aids the dollar against the euro and currencies like the brazilian real, as it did yesterday. however, currency analysts say that the fed's downside view of the economy indicates that this is no dollar rebound. before the fomc announcement, there was no significant u.s. economic data to sway the market's focus from the meeting and the dollar was largely rangebound. today, the u.s. october trade deficit will be released at 8:30 a.m. est, at the same time as november import prices. november's federal budget will be released at 2 p.m. est. late in the evening, treasury secretary henry paulson will close the u.s.-china strategic economic dialogue in beijing, during which he had planned to press china to pick up the pace on adopting a more flexible currency policy. --- dan molinski in new york and brian blackstone and henry j. pulizzi in washington contributed to this article.   license this article from dow jones reprint service']",40.0,1.0,"however, the dollar's reaction wasn't as large as seen in the past, perhaps because the fed itself stressed the current uncertainty",,,,,,,1

224,1989-10-03,"['The combined foreign-currency holdings of the Federal Reserve and Treasury totaled $34 billion at the end of July 1989, the latest reporting date. That figure had increased by $23.2 billion in the 13 months since June 1988, mainly by purchases of yen and marks. This activity\'s costs appear to outweigh by far the benefits. The legal basis for the Federal Reserve\'s intervention in foreign-exchange markets is questionable. The Federal Reserve Act provides no general and positive authorization to operate in foreign currencies. However, in early 1962, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC, comprising the Fed board and presidents of the Fed regional banks) approved such operations with the concurrence of top U.S. officials. Congress, in the Gold Reserve Act of 1934, gave the Treasury a limited authority for operations to stabilize the dollar\'s exchange value. In March 1961, with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York as its agent, the Treasury for the first time since the late 1930s entered into foreign-exchange transactions for monetary purposes. The Treasury and the Fed effectively have been coordinating these efforts ever since, except during the the first Reagan administration, when no intervention occurred. Only since the start of 1977, however, has the FOMC approved an overall open position in all foreign currencies. Why do the authorities engage in substantial foreign-currency purchases? Has doing so achieved its objective? What costs are imposed on the economy? The authorities buy foreign currencies when they want to prevent the dollar from appreciating, and sell them when they want to prevent the dollar from depreciating. Ten years ago, foreign-currency reserves were $3.8 billion. The current figure is almost tenfold as large, a far greater increase than in the total assets of the Federal Reserve System, which less than doubled ($160 billion in 1979; less than $300 billion at the end of June 1989). The foreign-currency purchasing binge over the past 13 months has not prevented a sizable appreciation of the dollar. One dollar bought 1.758 marks and 127.5 yen in June 1988, and 1.89 marks and 140.4 yen in July 1989. Intervention has been ineffective because the Fed sterilized the monetary effects of purchases and sales -- that is, it contracted or expanded the domestic money supply to counteract the effects at home of its moves in the foreign-exchange markets. A major source of fluctuations in exchange rates is the change in relative rates of money growth. Differences in money growth rates tend to produce differences in inflation rates. Differences in inflation rates in turn produce either exchange-rate depreciation or appreciation. Since early 1987, with the exception of the months just after the 1987 stock market crash, the Federal Reserve has been restricting monetary growth; Japan and West Germany on the whole have been expansionary. Monetary policy was expansionary in those countries in 1987 and 1988 because they engaged in exchange-rate intervention in the attempt to prevent dollar depreciation and did not fully sterilize their purchases of dollars. As a result, monetary growth has accelerated in Japan and West Germany. A delayed result of these differences in monetary growth rates is that inflation is now trending down in the U.S. and rising in the other countries, with the expected consequences for exchange rates. Central-bank intervention in exchange markets has been a pointless activity that has imposed costs on the countries engaging in such intervention. One cost is an increase in exchange-rate volatility produced by the erratic intervention. A second is that the taxpayer bears a double pecuniary loss. The first arises from the Fed\'s sterilization activity. It offsets open-market purchases of foreign currency with open-market sales of Treasury and federal agency obligations. Although the monetary base grew by $10 billion from June 1988 to May 1989, domestic interest-bearing securities held by the Fed over the period declined on net by $7 billion. Net income of the Federal Reserve Banks, which is normally rebated to the Treasury, has accordingly been reduced. That is one part of the loss sustained by taxpayers, offset to an extent that is not reported by the interest earned on foreign-exchange holdings. The second loss relates back to exchange-rate volatility and the risk to which the taxpayer is exposed as foreign-currency assets held by the Fed and the Treasury balloon. By acquiring $34 billion of foreign currency, the monetary authorities have taken a speculative position that yen, D-marks and other currencies will appreciate in relation to the dollar. The Fed and the administration assert that the elimination of inflation is a major goal of policy. Yet in their foreign-exchange operations, the U.S. authorities are gambling that their own anti-inflationary policies will fail. The Fed publishes a quarterly report on its foreign-exchange operations three months after their conclusion. The report details the dates of purchases and sales, but not the prices at which it executed the transactions. In 1988, the latest year for which information is available, the realized and unrealized loss on foreign-exchange-rate transactions by the Fed was $511 million. The Treasury\'s losses, approximately equal, are not reported. No benefits offset the losses. Sterilized intervention has only temporary effects on exchange rates. The public has a right to insist on a full accounting of the realized and unrealized losses on official intervention in foreign-exchange markets. Is any congressional committee paying attention to these losses? Is there any other mechanism in existence for making the Treasury and the Fed accountable for their speculation in foreign exchange? --- Ms. Schwartz, co-author with Milton Friedman of ""A Monetary History of the United States,"" is affiliated with the National Bureau of Economic Research.']","['the combined foreign-currency holdings of the federal reserve and treasury totaled $34 billion at the end of july 1989, the latest reporting date. that figure had increased by $23.2 billion in the 13 months since june 1988, mainly by purchases of yen and marks. this activity's costs appear to outweigh by far the benefits. the legal basis for the federal reserve's intervention in foreign-exchange markets is questionable. the federal reserve act provides no general and positive authorization to operate in foreign currencies. however, in early 1962, the federal open market committee (fomc, comprising the fed board and presidents of the fed regional banks) approved such operations with the concurrence of top u.s. officials. congress, in the gold reserve act of 1934, gave the treasury a limited authority for operations to stabilize the dollar's exchange value. in march 1961, with the federal reserve bank of new york as its agent, the treasury for the first time since the late 1930s entered into foreign-exchange transactions for monetary purposes. the treasury and the fed effectively have been coordinating these efforts ever since, except during the the first reagan administration, when no intervention occurred. only since the start of 1977, however, has the fomc approved an overall open position in all foreign currencies. why do the authorities engage in substantial foreign-currency purchases?

225,1995-03-28,"['WASHINGTON, March 28 -- The Federal Reserve\'s interest-rate-setting committee met here today without changing short-term rates, the latest sign the central bankers think that the United States economy is settling down to steady growth with low inflation.   The policy group, the Federal Open Market Committee, issued a characteristically brief statement at the end of the meeting, which was the first since the panel raised rates by half a percentage point on Feb. 1.   ""The F.O.M.C. meeting ended at 1:15 P.M.,"" said Joseph R. Coyne, the Fed\'s chief spokesman. ""There is no further announcement.""   Stock and bond markets were already down slightly before Mr. Coyne\'s statement shortly after 2 P.M., and edged down a little further. The stock markets later recovered and closed little changed over all. But 30-year bond prices fell and long-term interest rates, which move in the opposite direction, rose to 7.39 percent, from 7.31 percent on Monday. The dollar declined on currency markets.   Most markets declined this morning after the Conference Board, a New York business group, released a survey showing that consumer confidence was strong. Traders interpreted the survey\'s results as an indication that Americans might soon start spending more money again, bidding up prices for goods and services and possibly encouraging inflation.   Financial analysts were divided today over whether to declare the Federal Reserve done with raising interest rates, after seven increases in just under 14 months. Some analysts noted that strong growth in employment over the last several months had left hundreds of thousands of Americans with more money in their pockets.   Widespread spending could push up prices and nudge the Fed into again raising rates at the next committee meeting on May 23, they said.   ""I think the Fed is still on the hook for another round of tightening unless the consumer takes the Fed off the hook with very weak spending,"" said John Lipsky, an economist with Salomon Brothers.   Other analysts predicted that consumer spending would remain subdued because for the collapse last year of the boom in the refinancing of home mortgages at lower rates. The refinancing boom had allowed millions of Americans to reduce monthly payments, freeing income for other purposes.   Lawrence Chimerine, domestic-policy economist at the Economic Strategy Institute, a Washington research group, said: ""Fed tightening should be over. I think it is over, and I think there\'s a greater possibility four or five months from now that they\'ll be lowering rates,"" rather than raising them.   Analysts concerned about a possible surge in consumer spending have pointed to a rising savings rate, a sign that Americans are at least temporarily saving part of their extra money. They saved 5 percent of their incomes in January, up from a low of 3.8 percent in August.   But Lawrence B. Lindsey, a Federal Reserve Board governor who specializes in consumer behavior, said in an interview on March 10 that so many households had large debts that those consumers might be reluctant to spend more money if their paychecks increased and more family members found jobs. Sustaining consumer spending growth ""at the rates of last year, I think, is unlikely because of household balance sheets,"" he said.   Members of the Federal Open Market Committee have cited a wide range of statistics in the last month as indications that the economy may be slowing. These indicators include slowing car sales and production schedules, fewer permits and construction starts of new homes, and slowing orders for industrial goods.   ""There are just a lot of little things like that, that add up to a slowing down,"" said John P. LaWare, a Federal Reserve Board governor, in an interview on March 10.   On Monday, Mr. LaWare announced his resignation from the board, to take effect on April 30, and he did not take part in today\'s meeting. Analysts said they did not believe that his absence had any effect on the outcome.

226,2004-01-28,"['NEW YORK -- The Federal Reserve\'s surprise deletion of a key phrase from its official statement on monetary policy sent shock waves through the bond market, with Treasury prices falling sharply. While investors had expected the Fed\'s decision to keep short-term interest rates on hold at 1%, the absence of the ""considerable period"" phrasing, used since August 2003 to describe how long the bank would keep rates low, caught market participants off guard. Many believe the removal of the phrase and its replacement with somewhat vaguer language signals that an eventual increase in the federal-funds target rate will come sooner rather than later. Prices plummeted in the immediate aftermath of the Fed\'s decision and the yield on the 10-year note shot up to 4.26%, a level not seen since the soft December jobs report encouraged investors to buy government securities. ""This was clearly a wake-up call for the market,"" said Craig Coats, head of fixed income at Keefe, Bruyette &Woods in New York. ""The Fed is seeing improvement or they wouldn\'t have done this,"" he added. Prices recovered from their worst levels in late trading, however. At 4 p.m., the benchmark 10-year note was down 26/32 point, or $8.125 per $1,000 face value, at 100 18/32. Its yield rose to 4.177% from 4.078%% late Tuesday, as yields move inversely to prices. The 30-year bond\'s price fell 31/32 point at 105 14/32 to yield 5.006%, up from 4.943%. In its statement, the central bank\'s policy-making Federal Open Market Committee said ""it can be patient in removing its policy accommodation."" While the change to ""patient"" from ""considerable period"" may seem like a subtle one to those outside of the bond markets, traders believe the shift indicates that the Fed will raise rates sooner than had been expected. Federal-funds futures contracts now indicate a roughly 72% chance of a 0.25 percentage point rate increase in June, compared with previous expectations for an increase in late September. ""I think it\'s basically telling the market that they may raise rates before they actually see a confirmation of growth in terms adding jobs,"" said Jim Caron, bond market strategist at Merrill Lynch. Some of the losses were reversed as the knee-jerk selling moderated once investors realized that just because the ""considerable period"" phrase is gone, it doesn\'t mean the Fed will raise rates at its next meeting. ""The FOMC now has the flexibility to raise rates this year, but they still have to remove the hurdle of `patience\' before they do,"" said Dominic Konstam, head of interest-rate strategy at Credit Suisse First Boston in New York. Rather than the bond market wondering whether the FOMC will adopt a bias toward raising rates at its next meeting in March, traders will wonder whether it will drop the term ""patience,"" he added. The change in the statement also cast doubt on the safety of the so-called carry trades in which leveraged investors borrow at short-term rates and buy longer-dated securities. These trades have helped keep Treasury yields at their historic lows in recent months. Now that the timing of a Fed rate increase appears to be closer than many thought, investors who have favored these trades ""are going to think a little bit harder"" about staying in them, said J.P. Marra, head of U.S. government trading at Lehman Brothers in New York. The yield curve, which measures the difference between shorter-dated and longer-dated securities, flattened dramatically as the spread between the two-year and 10-year notes narrowed by 0.06 percentage point to 2.37 percentage points. Municipal Bonds Citing New York City\'s progress in reducing budget imbalances, Moody\'s Investors Service raised its outlook on the city\'s ratings to stable from negative. New York City\'s general-obligation bond rating is A2.

""the fomc now has the flexibility to raise rates this year, but they still have to remove the hurdle of `patience' before they do,"" said dominic konstam, head of interest-rate strategy at credit suisse first boston in new york. rather than the bond market wondering whether the fomc will adopt a bias toward raising rates at its next meeting in march, traders will wonder whether it will drop the term ""patience,"" he added. the change in the statement also cast doubt on the safety of the so-called carry trades in which leveraged investors borrow at short-term rates and buy longer-dated securities. these trades have helped keep treasury yields at their historic lows in recent months. now that the timing of a fed rate increase appears to be closer than many thought, investors who have favored these trades ""are going to think a little bit harder"" about staying in them, said j.p. marra, head of u.s. government trading at lehman brothers in new york. the yield curve, which measures the difference between shorter-dated and longer-dated securities, flattened dramatically as the spread between the two-year and 10-year notes narrowed by 0.06 percentage point to 2.37 percentage points. municipal bonds citing new york city's progress in reducing budget imbalances, moody's investors service raised its outlook on the city's ratings to stable from negative. new york city's general-obligation bond rating is a2. in changing the outlook, moody's noted that the city expects to balance its budget in fiscal 2004 and has proposed ""a reasonable and achievable fiscal plan for fiscal 2005,"" which begins april 1. --- tom sullivan contributed to this article.  license this article from dow jones reprint service']",27.0,,,1.0,"['new york -- the federal reserve's surprise deletion of a key phrase from its official statement on monetary policy sent shock waves through the bond market, with treasury prices falling sharply",,,,,1
227,2004-01-28,"['NEW YORK -- The dollar surged across the board after currency dealers read a more hawkish stance into Federal Reserve policy makers\' outlook for interest rates. While the Fed\'s Open Market Committee left its benchmark interest rate unchanged at a 45-year low of 1%, it surprised markets by dropping the closely watched phrase that monetary policy would remain accommodative for a ""considerable period"" of time, replacing it with a pledge to be ""patient"" before tightening. Even though most banks don\'t think the Fed will lift interest rates until later this year, or even 2005, the nuanced shift in language was taken as a signal that the central bank has gone one step further down that road and that was a clear boon for the dollar. Late yesterday, the euro was trading at $1.2488, around session lows and well below $1.2640 late Tuesday. It was also lower against the yen at 132.42 yen from 133.50 yen. Against the Swiss franc, the dollar rose to 1.2552 francs from 1.2404 francs, while sterling fell to $1.8220 from $1.8277. The dollar rose to 106.02 yen from 105.64 yen late Tuesday. That the dollar clawed back so much ground after the FOMC was all the more impressive given that it had been under pressure for much of the day.

Meanwhile, not to be outdone by the Fed, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand made a surprise rate increase, lifting its official cash rate 0.25 percentage point to 5.25%. The New Zealand dollar, which had traded higher ahead of the decision, was sold modestly afterward, trading at 67.72 U.S. cents yesterday afternoon in New York, little changed from 67.81 U.S. cents late Wednesday in Wellington. Elsewhere, Norges Bank, the Norwegian central bank, met market expectations and cut its key deposit rate by 0.25 percentage point to 2.0%, in effect today. In its statement, the bank said it took into account the fall in the kroner against the euro since December as well as a continued rise in equity prices at the end of 2003 and into 2004.

228,2004-01-28,"['WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve has freed its hands for a future increase in interest rates. The central bank left its short-term interest rate target at a 45-year low of 1%. But the bigger action was in its language, which it uses in addition to rate changes to guide the markets and economy. In an important tactical move, its policy panel dropped the commitment it first made five months ago to keep interest rates low for ""a considerable period."" Instead, the Federal Open Market Committee said after its first two-day meeting of this year that it can be ""patient"" in raising rates because inflation is low and the economy still hasn\'t fully recovered. Investors interpreted the omission of ""considerable period"" as a signal that the Fed is closer to raising interest rates than many thought. The 10-year Treasury bond yield leapt to 4.17% from 4.08% Tuesday. Futures trading on the Chicago Board of Trade suggests traders have moved up the month when they think the Fed will start raising rates to June from August. The prospect of higher interest rates damped the relative attraction of stocks, which compete with interest-bearing investments. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, up almost 50 points earlier in the day, plunged after the Fed\'s announcement, closing down 141.55 points at 10468.37. The dollar rallied against the euro, since higher rates would improve the return on dollar-denominated loans. The announcement doesn\'t seem to suggest an interest-rate increase is imminent. Rather, it appears the central bank wants the freedom to raise rates if the economy continues to improve, without worrying about violating a perceived commitment to keep them down. ""This is tactical,"" said Richard Berner, chief U.S. economist at Morgan Stanley. ""It serves as a reminder that monetary policy will not stay on hold forever."" The rest of the statement suggested the Fed\'s economic outlook hasn\'t changed significantly since it last met in early December. ""Output is expanding briskly,"" it said. While ""new hiring remains subdued, other indicators suggest an improvement in the labor market."" Meanwhile, excluding food and energy prices, inflation is ""muted and expected to remain low."" It said upside and downside risks to economic growth were ""roughly equal,"" while the risk of ""an unwelcome fall in inflation"" was ""almost equal"" to the risk of an increase. Economic reports yesterday suggested the expansion may have slowed in December though it doesn\'t appear to be in trouble. New-home sales fell 5.1% in December from November to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.06 million units, while new orders for durable goods -- those meant to last at least three years -- were unchanged in December from November. Fed officials feel underlying inflation, at about 1%, is already at the bottom of their preferred range, and with businesses operating with a lot of spare capacity and unemployment high, there is little prospect that inflation will rise from that level. Still, in recent months they have grown more confident that the economic expansion is unfolding as expected. Some officials think upward pressure on consumer prices and wages could develop before the end of 2005, and they would like to start raising rates ""well in advance of that point, rather than slamming on the brakes in the middle of 2005,"" said Michael Prell, an economic consultant in Arlington, Va. ""This gets the market into better alignment with their thinking."" The FOMC, made up of seven governors in Washington and 12 regional bank presidents, of whom five vote, agreed unanimously to leave the federal-funds rate at 1%. The rate, charged on overnight loans between banks, has stood there since last June after 13 successive cuts beginning in January 2001. With its shift in language, the Fed has exited from an unusual experiment with verbal monetary policy born of last year\'s brush with deflation, or generally falling prices. Last summer, markets assumed the Fed would quickly raise interest rates to snuff out inflationary pressure, as in prior recoveries. In fact, with inflation so low and deflation still a risk, the Fed was prepared to wait much longer. But as long as markets believed otherwise, long-term interest rates would be pushed up, undermining the recovery. To alter their expectations, the Fed began saying in August that rates could stay low for a ""considerable period,"" departing from its historic practice of letting the markets decide for themselves what it would do. The commitment was almost immediately controversial inside and outside the Fed. Some policy makers thought it dangerous to constrain their future actions, when inflation could surge unexpectedly. Some Wall Street analysts meanwhile thought the Fed had encouraged rampant speculation in the stock and bond markets with an open-ended promise of cheap financing. Still, the commitment worked: It has held down long-term interest rates, such as on mortgages, supporting home sales and other interest-sensitive purchases at a critical juncture for the economy. Some analysts saw little change with the alteration of the language. Daiwa Securities economist Michael Moran said, ""The phrases `considerable period\' and `patient\' should be viewed as near-perfect substitutes,"" noting that Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan has used the word ""patient"" before. But for the Fed, the difference is crucial. With the change, it is now freer to act solely on economic data, rather than on any perceived commitment to keep rates low. The change in language appears to be the only result so far of a lengthy internal review of communications policy. Prompted by a series of controversies last year, the Fed\'s Federal Open Market Committee in October formed a working group headed by Gov. Roger Ferguson to study how it speaks to the public. The entire FOMC spent most of Tuesday discussing the issue. A Fed spokeswoman said Mr. Ferguson\'s group has completed its work. She said that while FOMC members aren\'t announcing any specific changes, ""they decided to gradually adapt their statements as needed and in response to changing economic circumstances."" She added that no decision has been made about releasing meeting minutes earlier. Currently, there is a wait of about six weeks. Analysts had speculated the Fed might start releasing minutes before, rather than after, its next scheduled meeting. In yesterday\'s economic reports, the Commerce Department said new orders for durable goods such as cars and computers were flat in December, after falling 2.3% in November from October. Excluding defense and aircraft, capital goods orders -- a barometer of business spending -- slipped 0.4%. The data may be distorted by statistical difficulties related to communications-equipment orders. Other data show a manufacturing and technology rebound, and tech executives are relatively optimistic. In a separate report, the department said while new-home sales fell in December, sales during the previous two months were revised higher. Homebuilders had on average 4.3 months of supply of homes, up from a low of 3.5 months during August. Mortgage rates have declined in recent weeks, which could provide a new lift to sales in the new year. --- Jon E.

230,2004-01-28,"[""The Federal Reserve's announcement yesterday that it had withdrawn its promise to keep short-term interest rates low ''for a considerable period'' shocked both the stock and bond markets, with the three major stock indexes dropping more than 1.3 percent and the yield on the 10-year Treasury note shooting up sharply.    With its announcement, Fed policy makers took away what had been a security blanket for investors: a promise to keep the benchmark interest rate low as the economy picked up steam. That pledge was made in August, when members of the Federal Open Market Committee added these words to a statement after their meeting: ''The committee believes that policy accommodation can be maintained for a considerable period.''    That promise was repeated as the economy grew, and it helped to keep longer-term rates low. As recently as last week, the 10-year Treasury yield was below 4 percent, more than half a percentage point lower than it was in September.    After yesterday's bond sell-off, the yield was back up to 4.20 percent. This surge came even though the Fed left its benchmark rate, the federal funds rate, at 1 percent. But it is not yet clear to investors precisely what the policy makers now intend. While committee members abandoned the ''considerable period'' language, they replaced it with a promise to be ''patient'' with any move to raise its short-term interest rate benchmark.    In the confusion yesterday, the selling of stocks and bonds seemed to show that some investors thought an interest rate increase could come sooner than expected. Investors also appeared to think that an increase could come soon enough to rescue the sinking dollar, which rose more than 1 percent against the euro after the Fed's 2:15 p.m. announcement.    Still, many analysts argued yesterday that the change in Fed policy -- made in a statement concluding its two-day meeting on interest rates -- was much less significant than it first appeared and was not a sign that the Fed would be raising its benchmark interest rate anytime soon. Economists at several Wall Street firms said the announcement did not affect their forecasts for the timing of a Fed rate increase, which range from this spring to sometime in 2005.    David J. Greenlaw, chief United States fixed-income economist at Morgan Stanley, said the biggest news was the timing of the announcement, which came when Fed officials had to know it was not expected and could therefore spark a sell-off of bonds and stocks. The Fed usually orchestrates its policy moves carefully, with public hints ahead of time.    Mr. Greenlaw suggested that Fed officials might be getting worried about the extent of the rebound in the financial markets, with the Dow Jones industrial average up as much as 8 percent since Dec. 9, the date of the last meeting of policy makers, and interest rates lower.    ''There is more evidence of exuberance in the financial markets,'' Mr. Greenlaw said.    But until the intention of Fed policy makers is made clear, the stock and bond markets could become much more volatile as investors try to interpret the impact of new economic data.    For example, if an employment report due out next week shows strong job growth in January, it could spark a big sell-off in bonds, pushing yields higher, and may even worry stock investors. This is because without the Fed's security blanket, each bit of stronger data could be seen as another step toward a rate increase, which could slow or even stall the stock market rally.    A report on the growth of the economy in the fourth quarter, due out tomorrow, could also worry investors if it is very strong. The consensus forecast is for growth of as much as 5 percent at an annual rate.    The most significant immediate effect of this new signal from the Fed is that it will be much harder for Treasury, home mortgage and corporate interest rates to continue to drift lower.    The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to as low as 3.96 percent last week, from 4.38 percent on Jan. 2. The average national rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage fell to 5.64 percent on Jan. 22 from 6.02 percent on Dec. 5, according to Freddie Mac.    Robert J. Barbera, chief economist at ITG/Hoenig, said some strategists have predicted that longer-term interest rates could fall even further in the near term. But the Fed change, he said, ''makes that story much more difficult.''    Bill Dudley, chief United States economist at Goldman Sachs, played down the importance of today's shift.    ''It is not as big a change as people think. The data is really what drives the Fed,'' he said. ''I don't think the Fed's fundamental thinking has changed,'' and that means, he added, that with inflation low, rates can remain unchanged for some time.    Goldman is forecasting that the Fed will not raise interest rates until the middle of 2005, a forecast that remains unchanged, Mr. Dudley said.    Mr. Greenlaw of Morgan Stanley said he was not changing his prediction that a rate increase will come in August. But, he said, ''if I were predicting no rate hike in 2004, I would be nervous now.''

''there is more evidence of exuberance in the financial markets,'' mr. greenlaw said.    but until the intention of fed policy makers is made clear, the stock and bond markets could become much more volatile as investors try to interpret the impact of new economic data.    for example, if an employment report due out next week shows strong job growth in january, it could spark a big sell-off in bonds, pushing yields higher, and may even worry stock investors. this is because without the fed's security blanket, each bit of stronger data could be seen as another step toward a rate increase, which could slow or even stall the stock market rally.    a report on the growth of the economy in the fourth quarter, due out tomorrow, could also worry investors if it is very strong. the consensus forecast is for growth of as much as 5 percent at an annual rate.    the most significant immediate effect of this new signal from the fed is that it will be much harder for treasury, home mortgage and corporate interest rates to continue to drift lower.    the yield on the 10-year treasury note fell to as low as 3.96 percent last week, from 4.38 percent on jan. 2. the average national rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage fell to 5.64 percent on jan. 22 from 6.02 percent on dec. 5, according to freddie mac.    robert j. barbera, chief economist at itg/hoenig, said some strategists have predicted that longer-term interest rates could fall even further in the near term. but the fed change, he said, ''makes that story much more difficult.''    bill dudley, chief united states economist at goldman sachs, played down the importance of today's shift.    ''it is not as big a change as people think. the data is really what drives the fed,'' he said. ''i don't think the fed's fundamental thinking has changed,'' and that means, he added, that with inflation low, rates can remain unchanged for some time.    goldman is forecasting that the fed will not raise interest rates until the middle of 2005, a forecast that remains unchanged, mr. dudley said.    mr. greenlaw of morgan stanley said he was not changing his prediction that a rate increase will come in august. but, he said, ''if i were predicting no rate hike in 2004, i would be nervous now.''    photo: traders on the floor of the new york stock exchange watched news of the federal reserve's announcement, which shook financial markets.

231,2004-01-28,"[""WASHINGTON, Jan. 28 -- The Federal Reserve left short-term interest rates at just 1 percent on Wednesday, the lowest level since 1958, but it jolted markets by retreating from its open-ended pledge to keep rates low for ''a considerable period.''    Though subtle, the Fed's change in language after its two-day policy meeting surprised many economists because it suggested that the central bank might raise rates before the end of the year.    Prices on Treasury securities dropped, stocks declined and the dollar jumped in reaction to the news, though the markets recovered in part as analysts parsed the Fed's language in greater detail. The most significant near-term change from this new signal is that it will be much harder for home mortgage, corporate and Treasury interest rates to continue to edge lower. [Page C1.]    By shifting its language, the Fed gains a bit more latitude in the timing of any rate increase, in case it detects any signs that the economy is at risk of overheating.    A close reading of the statement by the Fed suggested that its chairman, Alan Greenspan, remains unlikely to push for higher interest rates for several more months. As it has before, the Federal Open Market Committee, which sets monetary policy, reiterated its view that inflation remains low and that the economy still has a considerable amount of ''slack'' in the form of relatively high unemployment and large amounts of unused factory capacity.    ''With inflation quite low and resource-use slack, the committee believes that it can be patient in removing its policy accommodation,'' the central bank said in its statement after the meeting.    The distinction between keeping rates low for a ''considerable period'' and being ''patient'' is in many ways a nuance, but investors have interpreted the Fed's statements for the last several months as a promise that it would not raise rates until further notice.    For many investors, the Fed's statement on Wednesday was tantamount to being served notice.    ''Chairman Greenspan does not make changes unless he thinks there is good reason to do so,'' said Michael Prell, a former chief of research at the Federal Reserve. ''Even though the difference between 'patient' and a 'considerable period' might sound like a superficial difference, they must have thought this would communicate news to the marketplace.''    The Fed statement is not necessarily bad news for President Bush, even though it increases the possibility of higher interest rates soon before elections in November. Economists remain split between those who expect Mr. Greenspan to start tightening policy this summer and those who expect him to wait until early next year. Any changes in interest rates take several months to have a tangible effect on business activity and employment.    Over the last few weeks, many longtime Fed watchers became convinced that the central bank would make no changes in its language. Last month, the Fed startled markets by declaring that the risks of ''an unwelcome fall in inflation'' had diminished significantly and were almost equal to the risk of a unwanted rise in prices.    But the Fed retained its promise to keep rates low for ''a considerable period,'' a move that led many analysts to conclude that the Fed could afford to adopt a wait-and-see stance.    Many economists were surprised and perplexed by the shift in language.    Robert V. DiClemente, a senior economist at Citigroup, said the Fed caught investors ''flat footed'' with its change in emphasis.    Ian C. Shepherdson, an economist at High Frequency Economics, said the Fed had ''blind-sided the markets'' but done so with so much ambiguity that its statement could be read in several different ways.    Lawrence H. Meyer, a former Fed governor, noted that the central bank shifted from past declarations about ''remaining accommodative'' to the more chilling formulation about ''removing accommodation.''    ''This is an important change in body language,'' Mr. Meyer said. ''The change in the language almost certainly carries a change in the message.''    The Fed's shift may have more to do with its struggle over communications than with an imminent change in monetary policy. After reducing the federal funds rate on overnight loans between banks to just 1 percent last summer, the Federal Reserve sought to reassure corporations and investors that it would keep rates low longer than it might have during past recoveries.    But many Fed officials have been uncomfortable with the promise to keep rates low for ''a considerable period,'' because the central bank has traditionally avoided making even implicit commitments about future policy.    Mr. Greenspan recently organized a special committee to re-examine how it communicates policy to the public, and Fed officials have tried to clarify their commitment by linking changes in policy to signs of accelerating inflation and a pickup in the job market.    William C. Dudley, chief United States economist at Goldman Sachs, said the Fed's statement on Wednesday was more about language than substance.    ''We were clearly surprised,'' Mr. Dudley acknowledged. But he said the Fed continued to emphasize the same concerns it has for the last several months -- inflation that is almost uncomfortably low and ''slack'' in the economy.    ''We think nothing fundamentally has changed,'' Mr. Dudley said. ''The Fed thinks inflation is too low and it wants inflation to go up.''    Mr. DiClemente of Citigroup agreed, though Citigroup recently moved up its own prediction of when the central bank would start to raise rates to late this summer from early next year.    ''People have been arguing that the Fed was behind the curve,'' Mr. DiClemente said. But he added, ''We still have some hurdles before there can be any tightening.''    Richard Yamarone, chief economist at Argus Research in New York City, said Mr. Greenspan and the other Fed governors might have wanted to modify their language before getting any closer to the presidential elections. The Fed typically tries to avoid policy changes soon before elections, for fear of being accused of interfering in the political process.    ''It would have been much more explosive if they had done this closer to the elections,'' Mr. Yamarone said.    The Fed's announcement came just two days before the government is scheduled to release its initial estimate of economic growth in the fourth quarter of 2003, and most economists are predicting that the economy grew at a strong annualized rate of 4.5 percent and possibly as high as 5 percent. Though slower than the torrid pace of the third quarter, that would still be much faster than many people had expected just a few months ago.    After its policy-setting meeting last month, the Open Market Committee created a buzz in financial markets by declaring that the chances of an ''unwelcome fall in inflation'' had diminished and were almost equal to the risks of a rise in prices.    Since then, economists have been startled by initial reports showing that job creation came to a halt in December and that ''core'' inflation -- excluding the volatile food and energy sectors -- climbed at an annual rate of barely 1 percent in December. And on Wednesday, new data showed that orders for durable goods last month were much lower than had been expected.    ''The rate of inflation is extremely low, arguably lower than they would like to see it,'' said Joshua Feinman, chief economist at Deutsche Asset Management in New York. ''Combined with the notion that the economy still has some degree of slack in the labor and capital markets, that makes them a little uncomfortable.''

234,2005-11-01,"['WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve raised short-term interest rates for a 12th consecutive time, and will probably have to keep raising them until the economy slows, to keep inflation from rising.

Its accompanying statement showed optimism on economic growth and concerns about inflation. ""Elevated energy prices and hurricane-related disruptions in economic activity have temporarily depressed output and employment,"" the Fed said yesterday in the statement accompanying its decision. In spite of the damage and disruptions caused by hurricanes Katrina and Rita, the U.S. economy grew at a 3.8% annual rate in the third quarter, its eighth consecutive quarter at about that pace. That\'s above what most economists consider the economy\'s potential growth rate -- that is, what it can produce with existing capital and labor. Moreover, the Fed appears to see that continuing, thanks to relatively low interest rates, robust productivity growth and ""planned rebuilding in the hurricane-affected areas."" At the same time, the Fed warned that, although oil and gasoline prices have fallen from their levels in the immediate aftermath of the storms, the ""cumulative rise in energy and other costs have the potential to add to inflation pressures."" So far, though, ""core"" inflation -- which excludes food and energy prices -- has ""been relatively low"" and ""longer-term inflation expectations remain contained."" The Fed suggested it will continue to raise rates, albeit at a ""measured"" pace, which has come to mean a quarter percentage point per meeting. All 10 voting members of the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee agreed on yesterday\'s increase, unlike Sept. 20 when Fed governor Mark Olson dissented, favoring no increase. (There are normally 12 voting members but two governors\' seats are vacant.) All 12 regional reserve banks agreed to the accompanying increase in the less-important discount rate, charged on short-term Fed loans to commercial banks, to 5% from 4.75%. Many commercial banks raised their prime rate, the benchmark for many business and consumer loans, to 7% from 6.75%. With the economy running out of spare capacity and showing no signs of slowing, Fed officials have concluded they need to boost rates further than they previously thought to keep higher energy prices from triggering a price-wage spiral. That will likely require the economy to slow down noticeably in the next year or two. That may happen on its own. There are scattered signs that the housing market is beginning to cool, and high oil prices have eroded consumer confidence. But without evidence of a slowdown, the Fed is likely to keep raising rates until it induces one. Last month, Fed governor Donald Kohn said that ""the economy would still seem poised to expand more quickly than the rate of growth of its sustainable potential unless monetary policy accommodation is removed further."" Markets expect the Fed to raise the funds rate to 4.25% on Dec. 13 and 4.5% on Jan. 31, Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan\'s last day before retirement. Ben Bernanke, chairman of President Bush\'s Council of Economic Advisers, has been nominated to succeed Mr. Greenspan. Markets see approximately 50% odds Mr. Bernanke will raise the rate at his first meeting, on March 28, to 4.75%. Since the Fed began raising the funds rate from a 46-year low of 1% in June last year, it has described rates as ""accommodative"" -- in other words, below some neutral level that neither stimulates nor restrains growth. Fed watchers had assumed that at some point the Fed would conclude the rate is at neutral and drop ""accommodative."" Some Fed officials have recently pressed to drop the description. But it now appears the Fed will keep calling the rate accommodative as long as it expects to raise it further, even if it has passed most estimates of neutral, into ""restrictive"" territory. Peter Hooper, chief U.S. economist at Deutsche Bank, thinks the Fed has to get the federal funds rate to 5% because the economy is running out of spare capacity, which heightens the risk that companies and workers will be able to boost prices and wages in response to the jump in energy costs. Inflation excluding food and energy prices -- the Fed\'s preferred price index -- was 2% in August and September, near the top of many officials\' ""comfort range."" Mr. Hooper expects inflation to go above that range, forcing the Fed to slow the economy down, to 3% or slower by 2007. In economic reports yesterday, the Institute for Supply Management said its monthly index was at 59.1% for October, down from September\'s 59.4% and contrary to expectations for a plunge. With the index continuing to exceed 50 -- seen as an indication that the sector is expanding -- and with new orders and employment continuing to show strength in the report, analysts are optimistic about the sector\'s future. The Commerce Department said total U.S. construction spending rose 0.5% in September for a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $1.12 trillion. --- Joi Preciphs contributed to this article.

235,2001-08-21,"['NEW YORK -- The dollar moved lower against the euro and yen despite brief gains after the Federal Reserve acted to boost the U.S. economy. The Federal Open Market Committee cut the federal-funds rate (which governs overnight loans between banks) to 3.5% from 3.75%, marking the seventh cut this year and bringing interest rates to their lowest level in seven years. Within one hour of the news, the dollar was at its intraday lows against its major counterparts. As active trading wound down in New York, the dollar continued to hover at or near intraday lows against the yen, euro, sterling and Swiss franc. The U.S. currency was poised for further losses as today\'s global session got under way in Asia. Currency trading hit a 10-minute lull immediately following the widely expected cut, as market watchers rushed to assess the Fed\'s accompanying statement, which noted a good a long-term economic outlook, but said ""the risks are weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate economic weakness in the foreseeable future."" While the initial interpretation was favorable for the dollar, the realization that the U.S. economy remains mired in the same uncertain scenario appeared to outweigh the brief optimism for the dollar. ""This was bang in line with expectations,"" said Tim Fox, currency strategist at Standard Chartered in New York. ""The statement didn\'t give any particular new insights,"" but just helped consolidate the trend that was under way immediately prior to the announcement, he said. Indeed, the euro shakeout to an intraday low of 90.81 U.S. cents during the dollar\'s short-lived rally ""pushed some stops on the downside"" and ""leads me to believe the risk is to the top side in an attack of 92"" cents, a strong resistance level, said Thom Worden, senior vice president of foreign exchange at HSBC New York. Market focus is now firmly on the Aug. 30 European Central Bank meeting. A rate cut from the ECB could restore market confidence in the euro zone and support the euro further, analysts said. Meanwhile, capital-flow data continue to present signs of wavering foreign support for the dollar. UBS Warburg weekly equity-flow analysis showed net inflows to both the U.S. and continental Europe last week, but the U.S. saw net outflows to Europe. The Asia-Pacific region saw its ninth straight week of net inflows. Late yesterday, the euro was at 91.70 cents, up from 91.30 cents earlier in London and from 91.42 cents late Monday in New York. The dollar was at 119.59 yen, down from 119.90 yen in London and from 120.70 yen late Monday in New York. The dollar was at 1.6558 Swiss francs, down from 1.6616 Swiss francs late Monday. Sterling was at $1.4523, up from $1.4449 Monday in New York. In European data, Italian cities\' consumer prices for August came in at a rise of 0.1% on the month, and Swedish June retail sales rose 0.4% compared with a 0.3% fall in May. Swedish July unemployment came in unchanged from 4.2% in June.

237,2001-08-21,"['NEW YORK -- Technology issues fell again and consumer names retreated as investors interpreted the Federal Reserve decision to cut interest rates again as a signal that economic trends remain weak. A host of telecommunications-gear makers fell during trading. Communications-chip maker Broadcom shed $4.73, or 13%, to $33.06 in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. Optical-equipment maker JDS Uniphase, which hit a 52-week low Monday, fell further, dropping 44 cents, or 5.9%, to 7.07. Cellphone-chip maker RF Micro Devices slid 2.02, or 7.9%, to 23.54. Storage-software developer Brocade Communications retreated 1.60, or 5.9%, to 25.47. All trade on Nasdaq. The weakness came after the Federal Reserve voted to lower interest rates to 3.5% from 3.75%, marking the central bank\'s seventh rate cut this year. Market averages, which had moved slightly higher, albeit in thin trading, ahead of the release of the Fed\'s decision, veered lower. The Nasdaq Composite Index finished down 50.05, or 2.7%, at 1831.30, the lowest the index has finished since April 9. Technical analyst Peter Green of Gerard Klauer Mattison speculated the Nasdaq composite could fall another 4% during the short term, given the recent technical patterns. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 145.93 points, a 1.4% drop, at 10174.14, its lowest finish since April 12. Though Wall Street accurately anticipated the result of the Federal Open Market Committee ruling, investors clearly saw the decision, as well as the accompanying commentary, as an indication that the economy hasn\'t responded to the Fed\'s attempts to stimulate growth. Abby Joseph Cohen, market strategist at Goldman Sachs, highlighted the state of corporate profits in a report released yesterday before the Fed\'s ruling. In the report, titled ""Closing the barn door on second-quarter earnings,"" Ms. Cohen reduced the firm\'s earnings estimates for the S&P 500, saying ""our original estimates for 2001 earnings were too high, given the weaker-than-expected economic environment and the aggressive charges taken by many companies."" Separately, Ms. Cohen said the deterioration of corporate profits had largely run its course, adding, ""This is a great time for investors with longer time horizons to rebuild portfolios,"" because valuations remain attractive, despite the weak earnings backdrop. Much of the selling pressure during the session was on stocks in technology, manufacturing and financial-services sectors, which have shown weakness in profit performance for the first two quarters. Dell Computer eased 71 cents, to 22.01 in Nasdaq trading, while Honeywell slid 85 cents, to 37.25, and Merrill Lynch declined 1.63, to 49.85, near the 52-week low of 49.66 set during the past week. The weakness in some tech stocks whose market performance has been the worst since the Fed started this cycle of rate reductions in January got even worse yesterday. Ciena, which set a 52-week low Monday, fell 1.04, or 5.7%, to 17.05; Tellabs hit a 52-week low, falling 26 cents to 13.61; and Nortel Networks dropped 38 cents, or 5.7%, to 6.23, another 52-week low. Disturbing signs in the actions of stocks exposed to consumer spending suggest investors are worried those consumers may not continue to hold fast in the face of economic fallout. Credit-card lender Capital One Financial eased 2.47, to 59.37. Americredit, a Fort Worth, Texas, financial-services company that specializes in servicing auto loans slid 7.40, or 14%, to 45.05; since reaching a 52-week high of 64.90 three weeks ago, the stock has declined 31%. Home-builder Centex fell 86 cents to 40.24. In a tough session for retailers, Home Depot fell 1.70 to 48.10, while Bed Bath & Beyond slipped 1.04 to 28.64. ""I think the market\'s performance has begun to tell you that consumer spending has become a definite worry,"" Bob Basel, a Salomon Smith Barney senior trader, said. Agilent Technologies fell to a 52-week low intraday but recovered by the close, gaining 36 cents, to 26.45. The Palo Alto, Calif., producer of semiconductor-making hardware posted a loss for its fiscal third quarter, and said it will cut 4,000 jobs. Macrovision gained 3.39, or 7.8%, to 46.60 on Nasdaq. Thomas Weisel Partners, in a research note, said the Sunnyvale, Calif., developer of copy-protection technology could benefit from indications that the price of digital-video-disk players, which use Macrovision technology, will decline further, spurring demand. Computer Associates fell 1.28 to 32.44, amid indications that a dissident-shareholder group, led by investor Sam Wyly, has gained momentum in its bid to unseat four directors from the Islandia, N.Y., software developer. Mr. Wyly\'s group won the backing of Institutional Shareholder Services, a shareholder-advisory service. Cypress Semiconductor eased 1.01 to 22.36. The San Jose, Calif., maker of integrated circuits, trading in a tough session for chip stocks, agreed to acquire In-System Design, a closely held semiconductor-design company, for $45 million. Medtronic rose 87 cents to 45.55. The Minneapolis medical-device maker reported fiscal first-quarter results late Monday that topped Wall Street\'s forecasts. Guidant added 3.40, or 11%, to 35. The Indianapolis medical-device maker reached an agreement with closely held Cook Inc. for exclusive world-wide marketing rights for Cook\'s drug-coated stent for coronary-artery disease. American Eagle Outfitters tumbled 9.06, or 28%, to 23.21. The Warrendale, Pa., apparel retailer reduced its fiscal third-quarter growth estimate because it is having trouble selling jeans. In a difficult session for retailers, Target declined 1.74 to 35.36, after the Minneapolis discount retailer said its fiscal third-quarter earnings will come in at the low end of Wall Street\'s forecasts.

238,2001-08-21,"['WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve, citing continued weakness in business investment and profits and slowing growth abroad, cut interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point to their lowest level since 1994. The cut, the Fed\'s seventh this year, lowered the federal-funds rate, charged on overnight loans between banks, to 3.5% from 3.75%. The Fed also cut its largely symbolic discount rate to 3% from 3.25%, prompting major commercial banks to follow suit by cutting their prime lending rates to 6.5% from 6.75%. The statement accompanying the Fed\'s action suggested that policy makers see the economy much as they have for the past few months: torn between weak business spending and foreign growth on the one hand and continued demand from consumers on the other. ""Household demand has been sustained, but business profits and capital spending continue to weaken and growth abroad is slowing, weighing on the U.S. economy,"" the Fed said. The Fed also indicated it was more likely to lower than raise rates in the future, saying risks were ""weighted mainly toward . . . economic weakness"" rather than inflation. However, with some signs of stability emerging and the full impact of interest-rate cuts and tax rebates yet to be felt, some economists saw hints that the Fed would pause now in its rate-cutting campaign. In its statement, the Fed alluded to monetary stimulus already in the pipeline, noting that yesterday\'s action ""brings the decline in the target federal-funds rate since the beginning of the year to 300 basis points,"" or three percentage points (though it said something similar in June). Its reference to ""sustained"" household spending was more positive than the ""weak expansion of consumption"" it talked about in June. ""They have acknowledged that there are some elements of firmness in the economy but that they may not be sufficient to restore the kind of growth that they feel is appropriate,"" said Michael Prell, an economic consultant in Arlington, Va., and former senior Fed staffer. The downbeat tone of the Fed\'s statement helped send the Dow Jones Industrial Average down 145.93 points, or 1.4%, to 10174.14, its lowest level since April. Futures markets put the odds of a quarter-point cut at the Fed\'s Oct. 2 meeting at 70%, up from 62% Monday. Whether that happens depends mostly on developments in the interim. Merrill Lynch chief economist Bruce Steinberg said, ""The Fed\'s view of the economy was not as dire as in July but still gave no sense that the Fed saw an imminent turnaround,"" suggesting that a cut is likely in October. Recent signs have been mixed. Most manufacturers\' orders still are falling, according to surveys, and profit projections remain in free-fall. Some areas of previous strength, like commercial construction and auto sales, are also weakening. Foreign economies are slipping. But new claims for unemployment insurance have stopped going up and aggregate manufacturing output held steady in July for the first time since last fall. Retail sales appear to be getting a lift from tax rebates. Furthermore, while the impact of the Fed\'s earlier easing had been diluted by the failure of longer-term rates or the dollar to fall, both have dropped recently. Bill Dudley, head of U.S. economic research at Goldman Sachs and one of Wall Street\'s gloomiest prognosticators, thinks the Fed will cut rates again this fall but not necessarily at its October meeting. He expects tax rebates to sharply boost August retail sales, but that will make it hard for the Fed to know what the underlying trend is. ""I can imagine a scenario where the Fed saw the recovery in retail spending and decided in October to wait for more evidence"" before cutting rates again, he says. In yesterday\'s statement, Fed officials said slackening in job and product markets ""is expected to keep inflation contained."" That\'s the same language they used in their June statement. Still, in recent months, some members of the Federal Open Market Committee, made up of Fed governors and regional-bank presidents, have raised concerns about cutting rates so much that inflation becomes a problem next year. For that reason, Mickey Levy, chief economist at Bank of America, said that unlike in previous economic cycles when the Fed cut rates until economic conditions improved, it may stop sooner this time. ""One reason they may want to be a little more cautious this time is that over the last year, as the economy has slumped, core inflation has drifted up a bit,"" he said. Though Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan has been consistently optimistic about the inflation outlook, Mr. Levy said ""there are different members who are probably keeping a closer eye on the inflation numbers, and that concern, I believe, will mount and spread once we\'re into the economic rebound."" Only seven of the Fed\'s 12 regional reserve banks had requested yesterday\'s quarter-point interest-rate cut, the same as in June. That suggests ""some possible dissension,"" said Peter Hooper, chief U.S. economist at Deutsche Bank, surmising that most if not all of the other five would have preferred no cut. However, the Richmond, Va., and Kansas City, Mo., Feds, two hawkish banks that didn\'t originally request the June quarter-point cut, did request yesterday\'s, suggesting some hawks have become either more worried about the economy or less worried about inflation during the past two months. --- Journal Link: Read the Fed\'s latest policy statement and see background information on interest rates, in the online Journal at WSJ.com/JournalLinks.']","['washington -- the federal reserve, citing continued weakness in business investment and profits and slowing growth abroad, cut interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point to their lowest level since 1994. the cut, the fed's seventh this year, lowered the federal-funds rate, charged on overnight loans between banks, to 3.5% from 3.75%. the fed also cut its largely symbolic discount rate to 3% from 3.25%, prompting major commercial banks to follow suit by cutting their prime lending rates to 6.5% from 6.75%. the statement accompanying the fed's action suggested that policy makers see the economy much as they have for the past few months: torn between weak business spending and foreign growth on the one hand and continued demand from consumers on the other.

239,2001-08-21,"['NEW YORK -- The dollar moved lower against the euro and yen despite brief gains after the Federal Reserve acted to boost the U.S. economy. The Federal Open Market Committee cut the federal-funds rate (which governs overnight loans between banks) to 3.5% from 3.75%, marking the seventh cut this year and bringing interest rates to their lowest level in seven years. Within one hour of the news, the dollar was at its intraday lows against its major counterparts. As active trading wound down in New York, the dollar continued to hover at or near intraday lows against the yen, euro, sterling and Swiss franc. The U.S. currency was poised for further losses as today\'s global session got under way in Asia. Currency trading hit a 10-minute lull immediately following the widely expected cut, as market watchers rushed to assess the Fed\'s accompanying statement, which noted a good a long-term economic outlook, but said ""the risks are weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate economic weakness in the foreseeable future."" While the initial interpretation was favorable for the dollar, the realization that the U.S. economy remains mired in the same uncertain scenario appeared to outweigh the brief optimism for the dollar. ""This was bang in line with expectations,"" said Tim Fox, currency strategist at Standard Chartered in New York. ""The statement didn\'t give any particular new insights,"" but just helped consolidate the trend that was under way immediately prior to the announcement, he said. Indeed, the euro shakeout to an intraday low of 90.81 U.S. cents during the dollar\'s short-lived rally ""pushed some stops on the downside"" and ""leads me to believe the risk is to the top side in an attack of 92"" cents, a strong resistance level, said Thom Worden, senior vice president of foreign exchange at HSBC New York. Market focus is now firmly on the Aug. 30 European Central Bank meeting. A rate cut from the ECB could restore market confidence in the euro zone and support the euro further, analysts said. Meanwhile, capital-flow data continue to present signs of wavering foreign support for the dollar. UBS Warburg weekly equity-flow analysis showed net inflows to both the U.S. and continental Europe last week, but the U.S. saw net outflows to Europe. The Asia-Pacific region saw its ninth straight week of net inflows. Late yesterday, the euro was at 91.70 cents, up from 91.30 cents earlier in London and from 91.42 cents late Monday in New York. The dollar was at 119.59 yen, down from 119.90 yen in London and from 120.70 yen late Monday in New York. The dollar was at 1.6558 Swiss francs, down from 1.6616 Swiss francs late Monday. Sterling was at $1.4523, up from $1.4449 Monday in New York. In European data, Italian cities\' consumer prices for August came in at a rise of 0.1% on the month, and Swedish June retail sales rose 0.4% compared with a 0.3% fall in May. Swedish July unemployment came in unchanged from 4.2% in June.

242,2000-08-22,"['WASHINGTON -- Acknowledging that recent economic data point to a cooling economy, the Federal Reserve held interest rates steady again, although policy makers said they remain concerned about inflation. The central bank\'s policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee left the target for the federal funds rate -- used by banks for overnight lending -- unchanged at 6.5%, a nine-year-high that it reached after a half-point increase in May. In a statement accompanying the decision, the Fed said growth is moderating toward a pace closer to the economy\'s ""potential,"" while continued gains in work-force efficiency are ""containing costs and holding down underlying price pressures."" The closely watched decision marks the second time in a row that central-bank officials have met and decided against boosting interest rates. Many analysts now think the Fed is likely to stay on the sidelines until at least mid-November. The Fed\'s next meeting is scheduled for Oct. 3, and policy makers are believed to be reluctant to take action so close to an election. The decision came as little surprise to many analysts and market-watchers, who had grown increasingly confident the Fed would decide to sit back and watch the effects of its six interest-rate increases since June 1999. In recent weeks, a range of data -- from moderating consumer demand numbers to a job market that shows early signs of softening -- painted a picture of an economy that continues to work toward a ""soft landing"" of slower growth and almost nonexistent inflation. Yesterday\'s statement was noticeably more optimistic than the one the Fed issued after deciding to keep rates steady in June. When explaining the June decision, the central bank cautioned that signs the economy was slowing to a sustainable pace were ""tentative and preliminary,"" a qualification the Fed elected not to repeat. This time, the statement also suggested many Fed officials are increasing their estimate of the economy\'s speed limit. It said that ""more rapid advances"" in productivity have been ""raising"" the economy\'s ""potential growth rate."" Still, yesterday\'s statement leaves little doubt officials from Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan on down remain wary about a pickup in inflation. It points out that imbalances remain between the levels of demand and supply in the economy amid one of the tightest job markets in decades. It also emphasizes that the Fed worries that the risks facing the economy continue ""to be weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate heightened inflationary pressures in the foreseeable future."" Despite widespread anticipation by markets of the announcement, the Fed\'s decision pushed the stock market higher as investors concluded that the central bank\'s rate-increase campaign would for all intents and purposes be put on hold until year end. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 59.34, or 0.54%, to 11139.15, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index was at 3958.21, up 5.06, or 0.13%. While Fed officials would be reluctant to acknowledge that they pay much attention to politics, the November elections make it less likely that the central bank will raise rates in October. The last time the Fed raised rates in the meeting close to a presidential election was in 1980, when the economy was in the throes of stagnant growth and rampant inflation. This year, analysts say they are hard-pressed to think of a scenario in which future data would be worrisome enough for the central bank to conclude that it couldn\'t wait until its Nov. 15 meeting to take action. ""The Fed would have to perceive that the cost of not going would be greater than the cost of going. It would have to be a situation where the Fed\'s concerns about its own credibility or the risk of inflation overrode its sensitivities to the political process,"" said Robert DiClemente, an economist with Salomon Smith Barney in New York. ""But it\'s difficult to imagine the kind of circumstances emerging that couldn\'t wait six weeks."" Mr. DiClemente speculated that the type of worst-case scenario that could persuade Fed decision-makers to move again in October would include further declines in the unemployment rate alongside a pickup in the pace of job creation and sharp increases in commodity prices, import prices or prices for goods still in the pipeline. ""So far,"" he added, ""there are no signs whatsoever that that\'s where things are heading.""

244,2000-08-22,"[""WASHINGTON, Aug. 22 -- Reassured by evidence that wage and price increases remain under control despite robust economic growth, the Federal Reserve voted today to leave interest rates unchanged but warned that it might raise them later in the year if inflation creeps up. The decision displayed the Fed's confidence that the economy is gradually moving onto a path of slightly more modest, though more sustainable growth, but suggested as well that the central bank is not yet sure that its campaign of rate increases is complete. The task of bleeding off any inflationary pressure without ruining a business expansion is a tricky one under any circumstances. It has become especially complicated in this cycle because, many think, some old rules have been rendered obsolete by the changes that technology and globalization have brought to the economy. Analysts and policy makers are increasingly certain that the economy is capable of a substantially faster pace of noninflationary growth than it was a few years ago, though there is considerable debate in and outside the Fed about where the new tipping point might be and how close the economy is to it. As it often has in recent years under its chairman, Alan Greenspan, the Fed chose today to be patient but at the same time to offer reassurances that it would move quickly at the first sign of a threat from inflation. ''Recent data have indicated that the expansion of aggregate demand is moderating toward a pace closer to the rate of growth of the economy's potential to produce,'' the Fed's policy-making arm, the Federal Open Market Committee, said in a statement. Nonetheless, the panel said, ''the risks continue to be weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate heightened inflation pressures in the foreseeable future.'' The decision means that the Fed is likely to remain on the sidelines for the duration of the presidential campaign. The central bank's policy makers are next to meet on Oct. 3. But the bank has, over the years, tried to avoid taking any action on interest rates in the weeks leading up to Election Day -- which falls this year on Nov. 7. The Fed's first meeting after the election is on Nov. 15. The outcome of today's meeting had been widely expected by analysts and investors, and there was muted reaction in the financial markets after the announcement at 2:15 p.m. Stocks finished slightly higher, with the Dow Jones industrial average closing at 11,139.15, up 59.34 points. Bonds were little changed. Today's decision left the Fed's benchmark federal funds target rate on overnight loans between banks at 6.5 percent, where it has been since May, when the central bank raised the rate by half a percentage point. The Fed held rates steady at its subsequent meeting in June. It also left unchanged, at 6 percent, its discount rate -- the interest rate charged on loans to banks from the Federal Reserve system. The central bank has pushed the federal funds rate up 1.75 percentage points in six steps since June 1999 in an effort to tamp down inflation pressure without snuffing out what earlier this year became the longest business expansion on record. Some analysts said it was now unlikely that the Fed would raise rates again this year. Others said inflation remained a threat and that it would be a mistake to count the Fed out. ''As intoxicating as a soft-landing scenario is,'' said Carl Tannenbaum, chief economist at LaSalle Bank in Chicago, ''we have to remain sober for at least another couple of quarters before we allow ourselves to imbibe of it.'' In the second quarter of the year, the economy grew at a 5.2 percent annual rate compared with a 4.8 percent annual rate in the first three months of the year. Those figures were well above what many economists think can be sustained over the long run without igniting a spiral in wages and prices. While it remains a moving target, the economy's noninflationary speed limit now seems to be around or just below 4 percent. Yet inflation has edged up only slightly from very low levels, in large part because the strong economic growth has been accompanied by a surge in business efficiency, or productivity, which improved at a 5.3 percent annual rate in the second quarter. Even as companies find themselves paying more to attract workers in a tight labor market, where unemployment is at 4 percent, and more for raw materials and equipment, they are cutting costs in other areas or improving efficiency by investing in new technology. Within the Fed, there is a long-running debate about whether productivity improvements can continue to outrun inflation pressure. In keeping rates unchanged today, the Fed seemed to be deferring the matter rather than trying to settle it. In its statement, the Federal Open Market Committee noted that economic indicators were showing ''that more rapid advances in productivity'' had forced economists to revise upward their estimates of how fast the economy could grow without igniting inflation. At the same time, the committee said, productivity improvements have been ''containing costs and holding down underlying price pressures.'' But the policy panel suggested that productivity improvements were not a panacea and that the combination of low unemployment and strong growth still had to be viewed as inflationary, especially to the degree that strong demand for goods and services outstripped the economy's ability to keep up. The committee, the statement said, ''remains concerned about the risk of a continuing gap between the growth of demand and potential supply at a time when the utilization of the pool of available workers remains at an unusually high level.'' To some degree, the inflation warning in the statement was intended to keep analysts and traders from concluding that the Fed was signaling an end to this series of rate increases. In interviews in recent months, several Fed officials said they hoped to keep Wall Street somewhat off balance to prevent another sharp run-up in stock prices. Within the Fed, the wealth generated in the stock market is regarded as a primary driver of consumer spending and overall demand, and another strong rebound on Wall Street, it is feared, could push demand up to a level that would inevitably fuel inflation. But Fed officials no doubt have other, more fundamental inflation worries on their minds. Oil prices remain quite high, and although their effect on overall consumer prices so far has been somewhat muted, high oil prices could still feed through the economy and accelerate inflation. There is also concern among some Fed officials that the combination of 4 percent annual growth and 4 percent unemployment will inevitably lead to wage increases that will outstrip productivity gains and put upward pressure on prices. Mr. Greenspan told Congress last month that he did not think the Federal Reserve would have to drive unemployment higher to prevent inflation. But some of his colleagues -- including Laurence H. Meyer, the Fed governor most closely identified with the school of economists who see a tight link between unemployment and inflation -- are not so sure.""]","[""washington, aug. 22 -- reassured by evidence that wage and price increases remain under control despite robust economic growth, the federal reserve voted today to leave interest rates unchanged but warned that it might raise them later in the year if inflation creeps up. the decision displayed the fed's confidence that the economy is gradually moving onto a path of slightly more modest, though more sustainable growth, but suggested as well that the central bank is not yet sure that its campaign of rate increases is complete. the task of bleeding off any inflationary pressure without ruining a business expansion is a tricky one under any circumstances. it has become especially complicated in this cycle because, many think, some old rules have been rendered obsolete by the changes that technology and globalization have brought to the economy. analysts and policy makers are increasingly certain that the economy is capable of a substantially faster pace of noninflationary growth than it was a few years ago, though there is considerable debate in and outside the fed about where the new tipping point might be and how close the economy is to it. as it often has in recent years under its chairman, alan greenspan, the fed chose today to be patient but at the same time to offer reassurances that it would move quickly at the first sign of a threat from inflation.

The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to keep its target for the federal funds rate at 5.25 percent.

247,2006-09-20,"['What started out as a pause in rate increases last month began to look more like a full halt yesterday. The Federal Reserve left its short-term interest rate target at 5.25% for a second consecutive meeting. It also warned that it remains concerned about inflation, and thus if it changes rates soon, it is more likely to raise them than lower them. The statement accompanying yesterday\'s decision suggested that, since pausing in its two-year string of rate increases last month, the Fed has become more confident that standing pat is justified. In explaining yesterday\'s decision, it cited the quickening decline in housing activity and easing inflation pressure from energy. Investors, however, increasingly expect the Fed not just to remain on hold, but to cut rates at least once by next June and again by December 2007. Ten-year Treasury bond yields have fallen, ending yesterday at 4.73%, down from 5.25% in late June. Those expectations may not match the Fed\'s, at least for now. Indeed, its statement did little to hint a rate cut would be on the table in the near term and financial markets pulled back slightly in their anticipation of one. Stocks, meanwhile, which have been rallying because of falling oil prices and on hopes the Fed is finished raising rates and the economy escapes recession, extended their winning streak. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 72.28 points yesterday to 11613.19, just 110 points short of its January 2000 record. In its statement, the Fed said growth is moderating, ""partly reflecting a cooling of the housing market."" By discarding last month\'s characterization of housing as ""gradually cooling,"" the Fed acknowledged the slide in home construction, sales and, in some regions, prices has picked up speed. It said that while the ""core"" measure of inflation, which excludes food and energy, remains ""elevated,"" it was likely to moderate in part because of ""reduced impetus from energy prices."" Oil and gasoline prices have fallen sharply in recent months. Oil futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange fell $1.20 yesterday, or nearly 2%, to settle at $60.46 a barrel -- their lowest level in six months and down 22% from the nominal high reached July 14. In theory, such a decline has mixed implications for the Fed. Lower energy prices reduce inflationary pressure, which would call for the Fed to lower rates. They also boost consumer purchasing power, which can improve growth prospects and would call for an increase in rates. The Fed statement suggests it considers the former effect as more important. While economists differed on what the Fed\'s next action is likely to be, they agreed that the small changes in its statement signaled greater comfort with leaving rates where they are, despite its stated bias toward raising rates. ""We see these wording changes (and absence of other potential changes) as a step in the direction of a neutral balance of risks,"" Peter Hooper, chief economist at Deutsche Bank Securities, wrote in a note to clients. He predicted the Fed would drop its bias to higher rates either at its next meeting, on Oct. 24-25, or in December, and would cut rates by March. The Fed\'s statement conveys ""more of a sense of comfort of being on hold,"" agreed Bruce Kasman, head of economic research at J.P. Morgan Chase. He noted that inflation remains the Fed\'s paramount concern. He also expects another rate increase by March. Ten of the 11 voting members of the Federal Open Market Committee agreed to yesterday\'s decision not the change the federal-funds rate, which is charged on overnight loans between banks. The Fed had increased that rate at 17 consecutive meetings before pausing last month. As in August, Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond President Jeffrey Lacker dissented, preferring a quarter-point increase. It was the first time in eight years an FOMC member dissented at two consecutive meetings in favor of higher rates, said David Resler of Nomura Securities. The last time, he said, the Fed\'s next move was to lower rates. The Fed remains focused on inflation risks in large part because core inflation is above the 1% to 2% ""comfort zone"" of many Fed officials, including Chairman Ben Bernanke. In the 12 months through August, core inflation was 2.8%, up from 2.7% in the 12 months through July. Using a lesser-known price index that the Fed prefers, core inflation was 2.4% in the 12 months through July. Fed officials expect core inflation to move back below 2% over the next two to three years as energy prices stop boosting the prices of other goods and services and the economy cools. If that forecast doesn\'t unfold, it could pose a threat to the Fed\'s credibility that would require higher interest rates. The Fed\'s continuing concern about inflation seems at odds with investor expectations of rate cuts. Thomas Joseph Marta, fixed income strategist at RBC Capital Markets, says that while the Fed and his own firm\'s economists are optimistic the housing slump won\'t significantly hurt the rest of the economy, market participants are far more pessimistic. ""I\'ve heard traders say, \'Look, the Fed\'s wrong,\'"" he said. ""Traders are reacting viscerally to housing. Housing is something you see when you\'re driving home from the train station; it\'s very obvious, very visible."" Mr. Marta added, ""In terms of inflation, I keep whispering in the traders\' ears, \'Look, core [prices], hourly wages, unit labor costs, they\'re all at dangerous levels.\' They don\'t care."" Still, some economists say the bond market will be proven right. Paul Ashworth, senior U.S. economist at Capital Economics of London, said if housing construction\'s share of economic output falls to the same level it hit in the early 1990s, after the last housing boom, ""you\'ll get a substantial drag on growth."" He expects growth to slow to 1.5% next year from a projected 3.3% this year, and the Fed cutting its rate target to 3.5% by mid-2008. Another reason for the disconnect could be anticipation of easier credit conditions globally. The U.S. bond market is increasingly linked to its foreign counterparts, and there have been signs of slowing growth in Germany, Japan and China in recent weeks. --- Online Today: Journal editors David Wessel and Dave Kansas analyze the Fed\'s decision, at WSJ.com/Video.

249,2009-04-29,"['The Federal Reserve signaled it has no intention of pulling back from its aggressive efforts to revive the financial system, even though it acknowledged that the intensity of the recession has eased in recent weeks. The Fed said in a statement after its regular policy meeting that it would push forward with plans to substantially increase its holdings of mortgage-backed securities and Treasury securities in the months ahead, and suggested it could increase those purchases if markets and the economy veer further off track. The policy-making Federal Open Market Committee reiterated that it will keep its target for its key short-term interest rate -- the federal-funds rate at which banks lend to each other overnight -- near zero for an extended period. ""Although the economic outlook has improved modestly since the March meeting, partly reflecting some easing of financial market conditions, economic activity is likely to remain weak for a time,"" the Fed said. It noted that household spending ""has shown signs of stabilizing"" while businesses have cut inventories, investment and staffing. Still, officials are in no hurry to pull their foot off the monetary accelerator. The latest data have reassured officials that the economy is performing as their forecast anticipated, namely modest recovery in the second half of the year, with unemployment continuing to rise for several months. Considering the amount of slack built up as unemployment has risen and factories have curtailed output, officials see inflation as a remote risk, giving them a cause to continue to support the economy with low interest rates and aggressive purchases of assets. By purchasing Treasury notes, mortgage-backed securities, and debt issued by mortgage-finance firms Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the Fed is trying to push down a broad array of long-term interest rates, particularly those that affect the housing market. As of Tuesday, the Fed had purchased $74 billion of Treasury securities, a quarter of the $300 billion it has said it expected to purchase by September. It had purchased or committed to purchase a net $381 billion of mortgage-backed securities, roughly a third of the $1.25 trillion in such purchases it plans. ""They\'re in the implementation stage,"" said Laurence Meyer, vice chairman of Macroeconomic Advisers LLC, a forecasting firm. Some economists, including Mr. Meyer, believe the Fed might eventually need to ramp up purchases of Treasury notes, in light of the enormous amount of slack still in the system and the risk that inflation could become too low.

251,2009-04-29,"[""Following is the text of the statement by the Federal Reserve on Wednesday announcing it was holding its base federal funds target rate at a record low between zero and 0.25 percent: Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in March indicates that the economy has continued to contract, though the pace of contraction appears to be somewhat slower. Household spending has shown signs of stabilizing but remains constrained by ongoing job losses, lower housing wealth and tight credit. Weak sales prospects and difficulties in obtaining credit have led businesses to cut back on inventories, fixed investment and staffing. Although the economic outlook has improved modestly since the March meeting, partly reflecting some easing of financial market conditions, economic activity is likely to remain weak for a time. Nonetheless, the committee continues to anticipate that policy actions to stabilize financial markets and institutions, fiscal and monetary stimulus, and market forces will contribute to a gradual resumption of sustainable economic growth in a context of price stability. In light of increasing economic slack here and abroad, the committee expects that inflation will remain subdued. Moreover, the committee sees some risk that inflation could persist for a time below rates that best foster economic growth and price stability in the longer term. In these circumstances, the Federal Reserve will employ all available tools to promote economic recovery and to preserve price stability.

253,2001-01-31,"['With yesterday\'s half-point interest rate cut, Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan is hoping to lift the nation\'s economic spirits before they pull the economy into recession. Together with another half-point cut earlier this year, the Fed\'s actions mark the central bank\'s most aggressive easing move since 1982. But there\'s a key difference between now and 19 years ago. Back then, the central bank was struggling to revive an economy that had fallen into deep recession, with unemployment rates near the double digits. This time around, Mr. Greenspan is administering medicine to a patient who\'s still showing remarkable health, including a jobless rate that, at 4%, is near a 30-year low. More than usual, the Fed chief appears to be engaged in a game of psychology, struggling less to revive a moribund economy than to restore a sense of confidence to the nation\'s consumers and businesses. He remains convinced that the New Economy is for real, and that it promises above-average economic growth in the years ahead. But recent surveys show that many consumers and businesses have lost that faith. New evidence of their gloom came on Tuesday, when the Conference Board reported that consumer confidence had slid to a four-year low, taking its biggest hit since the 1990-91 recession. The survey showed that consumers have yet to actually feel much pain. But they fear worse times ahead. The week before, the same New York-based research group reported that business confidence had hit its lowest point since 1980. ""Consumer and business confidence has eroded further, exacerbated by rising energy costs that continue to drain consumer-purchasing power and press on business profit margins,"" the Federal Open Market Committee said, in a statement that accompanied yesterday\'s cut to 5.5% from 6% in its target for the federal-funds rate. ""Partly as a consequence, retail sales and business spending on capital equipment have weakened appreciably. . . . Taken together, and with inflation contained, these circumstances have called for a rapid and forceful response of monetary policy."" The Fed\'s actions are aimed at Americans like Tim Bice, who owns his own small construction firm in Waseca, Minn. Mr. Bice has been contemplating starting a new business that doesn\'t experience the winter lulls that construction does. He\'s thinking about manufacturing homes indoors that can then be transported to a home site, in any season. He even located a place to start his business -- an empty radio factory. But in recent months, his enthusiasm for the project has waned. Business remains good, he says; if anything, he got to bid on building more new houses than was usual for January. But the outlook, he fears, is bleak. ""On the news every night, all these layoffs, people downsizing, everybody is talking recession, recession,"" he says. Fear of a recession can quickly bring on the real thing. ""Animal spirits,"" the British economist John Maynard Keynes once wrote, can hold the key to important economic variables, such as business investment. And new numbers out yesterday show that investment did drop in last year\'s fourth quarter. The government reported that the quarter\'s real, or inflation-adjusted, growth in gross domestic product slipped to an annual rate of 1.4%, its slowest pace since 1995. Household consumption, which makes up two-thirds of total economic spending, advanced at a respectable 2.9%. But business investment on equipment and software actually fell at a 5% rate -- a dramatic reversal from 21% growth in the first quarter of 2000. A big December drop reported last week in orders for capital goods, excluding aircraft and defense, suggests the capital retrenchment isn\'t over. That\'s being felt by companies like Cisco Systems Inc., the giant Internet-gear maker in San Jose, Calif. ""In November, when we first started to see a slowdown, we thought it would be a blip -- it looked like it wouldn\'t affect us,"" Cisco Chief Executive John Chambers said yesterday, according to Dow Jones Newswires. ""But then in early December it was obvious that things were slowing down with many of our customers much faster than people anticipated. I became concerned when the Fed didn\'t move, but now they\'re moving."" The slowdown in investment is troubling for three reasons, says Joshua Feinman, chief economist at Deutsche Asset Management in New York. First, it subtracts directly from total spending in the economy. Second, as companies cut back, suppliers of capital goods slash output and jobs, and their stock prices fall -- unsettling both employees and consumers. Third, and perhaps most important, if businesses slow their investment spending, that could undercut the rapid growth in productivity that has fueled hopes for above-average economic growth in the decade ahead. Many economists, including William Dudley, head of U.S. economic research at Goldman Sachs in New York, think Mr. Greenspan\'s rapid action now means a recession is less than a 50% probability. The Jan. 3 surprise cut -- which came between meetings of the FOMC, instead of at one of the committee\'s regularly scheduled gatherings -- helped stocks and corporate bonds turn in a healthy January performance. That makes it easier for companies to issue securities to fund new investment, and it makes holders of the securities feel wealthier and more inclined to spend. ""You don\'t want [confidence] to break,"" says Mr. Dudley. ""But the financial markets suggest we\'re not at that breaking point."" Mr. Dudley argues that maintaining confidence is the key to keeping a temporary slowdown from snowballing into a more serious recession. Since World War II, the unemployment rate has never gone up more than 0.33 percentage point during any period of economic growth, except during one strike-affected period, he notes. But in a recession, it has never gone up less than 1.9 percentage points. Once unemployment starts rising, it can be hard to stop. For all the talk of consumer confidence, business confidence may be just as critical at this juncture, and it is eroding even faster. When the key decision makers at the nation\'s largest corporations are feeling pessimistic, outlays by businesses for new equipment -- once a major driver of growth -- suffer. Last week, the Conference Board said that in the fourth quarter of 2000 CEO confidence plunged by its largest amount ever -- to levels not seen since 1980. CEOs\' expectations for conditions in their own industries six months from now fell to the lowest level since the survey began in 1976. Lynn Franco, who oversees the survey, says executives are quicker to shift their views on the economy than the average consumer. ""They generally tend to be a little more pessimistic,"" she says. ""The economy has decelerated so rapidly it has created enormous uncertainty in the minds of CEOs"" and chief financial officers, says Richard Berner, chief U.S. economist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. That\'s prompted belt-tightening at many companies. At discount brokerage firm Charles Schwab Corp., for instance, where sagging revenue has taken its toll, that means a cutback in all planned discretionary expenses. Among its cost-cutting measures, Schwab, which is based in San Francisco, already has announced a hiring freeze, and has told some employees to take several Fridays off as vacation days. ""We had to look at all nonessential projects and other areas within the company where we could either delay or put off costs,"" says spokesman Greg Gable. ""We\'re looking at the more mundane areas, too, like limiting travel wherever possible."" Similar cutbacks are happening in other industries. Jerry Jasinowski, president of the National Association of Manufacturers, says capital spending is one of the first lines of defense against falling profitability: ""Once businesses get in the mindset of cutting capital spending one quarter, they\'re not going to turn around on a dime the next quarter, particularly in view of the inventory overhang and high energy prices."" In recent weeks, the European Central Bank has constantly spoken of ""increasing uncertainty"" from the U.S. economic slowdown and its impact on the rest of the world. Its governing council gathers for a regular meeting today, though it hasn\'t indicated any plans to change rates. ""There are no signals yet that we should change our monetary policy,"" Ernst Welteke, an ECB council member, told reporters over the weekend, but an additional half-percentage-point Fed cut ""would certainly trigger a very diligent discussion and evaluation."" Yesterday, the Fed also cut the largely symbolic discount rate by half a point to 5%, for a total reduction of one percentage point since the start of the year. In its statement, the Fed said that ""the risks are weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate economic weakness in the foreseeable future,"" which means rates are more likely to fall soon than to rise. Some analysts think the next cut could happen before the FOMC meets again March 20. While there\'s been little hard data yet on how the economy performed in January, Mr. Greenspan may already have gotten a glimpse of a report coming out today from the National Association of Purchasing Management, which conducts a monthly survey of manufacturing activity. A former Fed insider says the central bank often gets an early look at that report. The Fed chief also may have gotten an early look at some of the data in the January employment report, due out tomorrow. The pace and magnitude of cuts show a shift in tactics by Mr. Greenspan, who has generally preferred to move in small, quarter-point steps in order to avoid startling the markets. The half-point Jan. 3 cut took markets by surprise, and even yesterday\'s cut, though less than the three-quarters point some had hoped for, was more than the consensus expectation just a few weeks ago. Former Fed Vice Chairman Alan Blinder says Mr. Greenspan is moving more aggressively because ""he sees a more pressing need than is normal. Second, the market has gotten better at thinking ahead to what the Fed is going to do. The result is that his previous worry -- that if you move too much at once you\'ll unsettle the markets -- isn\'t a worry any more."" Whether the Fed\'s action will be sufficient to revive the economy\'s sagging spirits remains to be seen. But some were optimistic yesterday. ""This half-point cut is exactly what was needed to brake our descent into a general downturn,"" says Mr. Jasinowski, the NAM president. ""The astute timing of the Fed\'s last two interest-rate moves . . . probably has prevented an economy-wide recession."" --- G.

255,2007-09-18,"[""WASHINGTON, Sept. 18 -- The Federal Reserve rolled out its most powerful interest rate weapon on Tuesday in a bid to stop the turmoil in housing and financial markets from bringing down the overall economy.    But even as stock markets soared in a thunderous rally, the Fed carefully stopped short of implying any commitment to reduce rates even more in the months ahead. Indeed, policy makers cautioned that they still have lingering worries about inflation -- a concern that would weigh against stimulating the economy further with cheaper money.    In reducing its benchmark interest rate by an unusually large one-half percentage point, to 4.75 percent from 5.25 percent, the central bank made it clear that policy makers viewed the turbulence and disruptions of the past couple of months as too dangerous to ignore.    The reaction in stock markets was ecstatic: the Dow Jones industrial average jumped 200 points almost instantly and ended the day up 335 points, or 2.51 percent, at 13,739.39.    The move was the Fed's first rate reduction of any kind in four years, the steepest in nearly five years and its most abrupt reversal of course since January 2001, when policy makers sharply cut rates at an unscheduled emergency meeting just before the last recession.    ''Shock therapy,'' summed up Ethan Harris, chief United States economist at  Lehman Brothers. For consumers, the Fed's move could mean lower borrowing costs for mortgages and automobile loans. But the impact may be muted, because investors remain deeply anxious about the credit quality of mortgages and other long-term loans. The main problem in the last month has not been high rates so much as the availability of capital to complete deals.    Analysts described the Fed's action as a bold attempt to restore confidence, with a quieter caveat that investors and consumers should not assume the certainty of more painkillers later this year.    ''The important policy debate now centers on the future interest rate path, but Fed officials left that more ambiguous,'' said Richard Berner, chief United States economist at  Morgan Stanley. Indeed, while many on Wall Street have been clamoring for an aggressive rate cut, some economists had warned against it, saying that it might send the wrong signal by bailing out those who contributed to the housing bubble and encourage future market excesses.    In both the bold stroke and the fine print, the Fed's move offered a revealing hint about Ben. S. Bernanke, the former professor from Princeton who took over as Fed chairman last year.    Mr. Bernanke, a champion of steady rules to guide monetary policy, has long been seen as more skeptical about reacting to financial turbulence than his predecessor, Alan Greenspan.    Mr. Bernanke, for example, made it clear that he did not want to rescue investors or real estate speculators who made bad decisions. But in shielding the economy from a downturn, the Fed will inevitably be helping some of the very people Mr. Bernanke did not want to help.    What seems to have driven Mr. Bernanke to act more boldly, analysts said, was the jolt from the Labor Department's unexpectedly poor employment report for August, which showed that the nation had lost jobs for the first time in four years.    Still, Mr. Bernanke's move was nothing if not a Greenspanian display of ''discretionary'' policy in response to trouble but before the signs of an economic downturn were unambiguous. And in doing so, he obtained unanimous agreement from other board members, even though some Fed officials have been dubious about the need for a rescue.    The Fed's course change has been under way since early August, when fears about huge losses on subprime mortgage loans and a continued downturn in housing caused a much broader panic in credit markets.    The resulting credit tightness has now affected all but the safest home mortgages and has also greatly reduced the ability of private equity funds and hedge funds to borrow money at low rates. Many banks, which had been planning to resell their loans into the giant market for tradable commercial debt securities, are now being forced to absorb loans that the securities markets will no longer take.    In the rate cut and an accompanying statement, the central bank acknowledged that the risks of a recession were too big to ignore.    ''The tightening of credit conditions has the potential to intensify the housing correction and restrain economic growth more generally,'' the Fed's policy-making committee said in its statement. ''Today's action is intended to forestall some of the adverse effects on the broader economy that might otherwise arise from the disruptions in financial markets.''    Leaving the door open for the possibility of additional rate cuts, the central bank said it would ''continue to assess'' the economic outlook and ''act as needed to foster price stability and sustainable economic growth.''    But while Fed policy makers abandoned previous statements that the risk of inflation was their ''predominant concern,'' they did not say that the risk of a downturn had replaced inflation as their main worry. Rather, they spoke of ''uncertainty'' and left it at that.    ''The Fed kept its cards much closer to its vest than anyone would have guessed,'' said David Rosenberg, chief North American economist for  Merrill Lynch. ''It's not at all clear they think they have more to do.''    Trading among investors indicated that Wall Street expects the central bank to keep cutting rates. Many analysts contend that it needs to cut twice as deeply as it has so far by early next year.    And in a sign that the politics of rate-cutting could become more bruising, at least one prominent Democrat quickly criticized the Fed's cautionary warning about inflation at a time of slowing growth. Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts and chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, said he was ''surprised'' by the Fed's statement.    ''I hope, in this instance, that markets and consumers will pay more attention to what the F.O.M.C. did than to what it said,'' Mr. Frank added, referring to the Federal Open Market Committee, which sets interest rates.    In a separate move to bolster the banking system, the Fed also said that it had cut its discount lending rate, which applies to short-term emergency loans to banks, by a half a percentage point, to 5.25 percent.    As in 2001, the Fed's move came after a panic in financial markets and the collapse of a speculative bubble. Today, the panic is in credit markets unnerved by dubious mortgages on inflated housing prices. Back then, it was the stock market that was in trouble, initially because the air went out of inflated dot-com stocks.    But the debate within the Fed was all about risk probabilities: what were the odds that the twin meltdowns in housing and mortgage markets would tip the overall economy into a recession?    If policy makers cut rates too cautiously, they risk a recession; if they cut them too much or too early, they risk stoking inflation.    Ever since the jobs data was released this month, it seemed clear that Fed policy makers were no longer debating whether to reduce rates but how much to lower them. A smaller rate reduction posed a risk of moving too slowly if the economy was indeed in danger of stalling. But a bigger rate reduction could have been taken as a sign of Fed panic, and it added to the risk of stoking inflationary pressures that the central bank had just begun to tamp down.    Just a few hours before the central bank announced its decision, new statistics indicated that the pace of home foreclosures was accelerating.    RealtyTrac of Irvine, Calif., reported that the number of foreclosure filings -- from default notices and auction sale notices to bank repossessions -- was 36 percent higher in August than in July and 115 percent higher than one year ago.    But except for the housing downturn, which Fed officials admit is much more severe than they had expected, the evidence of a recession in the real economy is indecisive. Global economic growth is much stronger than in 2001, and American exports have climbed about 14 percent over the last year.    Instead of the United States being the world's engine of growth, the global economy could now become the engine of American growth.    Many Wall Street economists place the odds of a recession at about one-in-three or somewhat higher. Mr. Greenspan puts the odds at somewhat more than the one-in-three that he estimated earlier this year.    On Aug. 17, the Federal Reserve moved to ease the liquidity crisis by encouraging banks to borrow money through its discount window, an outlet originally created as an emergency source of overnight funding for banks in a cash squeeze.    But by most accounts, the turmoil in the credit markets has abated very little. The market for subprime mortgages has all but disappeared and demand for all forms of asset-backed commercial paper -- which are securities backed by mortgages, credit card debt and company receivables -- remains very weak.

(Sources: Federal Reserve; Bureau of Labor Statistics)   ""]","[""washington, sept. 18 -- the federal reserve rolled out its most powerful interest rate weapon on tuesday in a bid to stop the turmoil in housing and financial markets from bringing down the overall economy.    but even as stock markets soared in a thunderous rally, the fed carefully stopped short of implying any commitment to reduce rates even more in the months ahead. indeed, policy makers cautioned that they still have lingering worries about inflation -- a concern that would weigh against stimulating the economy further with cheaper money.    in reducing its benchmark interest rate by an unusually large one-half percentage point, to 4.75 percent from 5.25 percent, the central bank made it clear that policy makers viewed the turbulence and disruptions of the past couple of months as too dangerous to ignore.    the reaction in stock markets was ecstatic: the dow jones industrial average jumped 200 points almost instantly and ended the day up 335 points, or 2.51 percent, at 13,739.39.    the move was the fed's first rate reduction of any kind in four years, the steepest in nearly five years and its most abrupt reversal of course since january 2001, when policy makers sharply cut rates at an unscheduled emergency meeting just before the last recession.    ''shock therapy,'' summed up ethan harris, chief united states economist at  lehman brothers. for consumers, the fed's move could mean lower borrowing costs for mortgages and automobile loans. but the impact may be muted, because investors remain deeply anxious about the credit quality of mortgages and other long-term loans. the main problem in the last month has not been high rates so much as the availability of capital to complete deals.    analysts described the fed's action as a bold attempt to restore confidence, with a quieter caveat that investors and consumers should not assume the certainty of more painkillers later this year.    ''the important policy debate now centers on the future interest rate path, but fed officials left that more ambiguous,'' said richard berner, chief united states economist at  morgan stanley. indeed, while many on wall street have been clamoring for an aggressive rate cut, some economists had warned against it, saying that it might send the wrong signal by bailing out those who contributed to the housing bubble and encourage future market excesses.    in both the bold stroke and the fine print, the fed's move offered a revealing hint about ben. s. bernanke, the former professor from princeton who took over as fed chairman last year.    mr. bernanke, a champion of steady rules to guide monetary policy, has long been seen as more skeptical about reacting to financial turbulence than his predecessor, alan greenspan.    mr. bernanke, for example, made it clear that he did not want to rescue investors or real estate speculators who made bad decisions. but in shielding the economy from a downturn, the fed will inevitably be helping some of the very people mr. bernanke did not want to help.    what seems to have driven mr. bernanke to act more boldly, analysts said, was the jolt from the labor department's unexpectedly poor employment report for august, which showed that the nation had lost jobs for the first time in four years.    still, mr. bernanke's move was nothing if not a greenspanian display of ''discretionary'' policy in response to trouble but before the signs of an economic downturn were unambiguous. and in doing so, he obtained unanimous agreement from other board members, even though some fed officials have been dubious about the need for a rescue.    the fed's course change has been under way since early august, when fears about huge losses on subprime mortgage loans and a continued downturn in housing caused a much broader panic in credit markets.    the resulting credit tightness has now affected all but the safest home mortgages and has also greatly reduced the ability of private equity funds and hedge funds to borrow money at low rates. many banks, which had been planning to resell their loans into the giant market for tradable commercial debt securities, are now being forced to absorb loans that the securities markets will no longer take.    in the rate cut and an accompanying statement, the central bank acknowledged that the risks of a recession were too big to ignore.    ''the tightening of credit conditions has the potential to intensify the housing correction and restrain economic growth more generally,'' the fed's policy-making committee said in its statement. ''today's action is intended to forestall some of the adverse effects on the broader economy that might otherwise arise from the disruptions in financial markets.''    leaving the door open for the possibility of additional rate cuts, the central bank said it would ''continue to assess'' the economic outlook and ''act as needed to foster price stability and sustainable economic growth.''    but while fed policy makers abandoned previous statements that the risk of inflation was their ''predominant concern,'' they did not say that the risk of a downturn had replaced inflation as their main worry. rather, they spoke of ''uncertainty'' and left it at that.    ''the fed kept its cards much closer to its vest than anyone would have guessed,'' said david rosenberg, chief north american economist for  merrill lynch. ''it's not at all clear they think they have more to do.''    trading among investors indicated that wall street expects the central bank to keep cutting rates. many analysts contend that it needs to cut twice as deeply as it has so far by early next year.    and in a sign that the politics of rate-cutting could become more bruising, at least one prominent democrat quickly criticized the fed's cautionary warning about inflation at a time of slowing growth. representative barney frank, democrat of massachusetts and chairman of the house financial services committee, said he was ''surprised'' by the fed's statement.

256,2007-09-18,"['NEW YORK -- The dollar hit a series of fresh record lows against the euro yesterday, after the Federal Reserve sliced a half a percentage point from its benchmark lending rates to counteract the effects of credit-market woes on the U.S. economy. A cut by the Federal Open Market Committee was widely expected, but a unanimously voted 50-basis-point reduction was at the high end of currency analysts\' expectations and caught some off guard. The result was a spike higher for the euro to an intraday top at $1.3983, the single currency\'s peak level since its introduction in January 1999. ""It\'s broadly negative for the dollar, because of the lower interest rates and the outlook for rate differentials,"" said Rebecca Patterson, global currency strategist at J.P. Morgan Chase &Co. The Fed explicitly said that the cut was required as a result of developments in the financial market, said Todd Elmer, currency strategist at Citigroup Inc. That ""degree of responsiveness"" took the market by surprise, he said. Now, higher-yielding currencies, like the euro, are going to show gains, because the Fed has, at least temporarily, ""alleviated some concern among investors that these trades are going to see further pressure,"" Mr. Elmer said. The upshot is a re-emergence of the carry trade, which involves investors borrowing currencies with low interest rates, such as the yen, to finance the purchase of currencies with higher returns. The dollar rose versus its Japanese counterpart after the FOMC announcement, exiting from active North American trading up more than a yen on the day. In late trading in New York, the euro was at $1.3970, up from $1.3867 late Monday, while the dollar was at 116.23 yen, up from 115.17 yen. Also, the euro was at 162.35 yen, up from 159.70 yen. The British pound was at $2.0120, up from $1.9956 late Monday. The dollar was quoted at 1.1827 Swiss francs, down from 1.1868 Swiss francs late Monday. The FOMC also lowered by 50 basis points to 5.25% the discount rate it charges banks that borrow directly from the Fed. Last month, officials cut the discount rate by 50 basis points in a rare inter-meeting move and modified rules to encourage use of that facility. ""Today\'s action is intended to help forestall some of the adverse effects on the broader economy that might otherwise arise from the disruptions in financial markets, and to promote moderate growth over time,"" the Fed said in the statement accompanying its decision. It also said that core inflation has improved ""modestly,"" but that some risks remain, and that it will monitor price developments ""carefully."" In a departure from previous statements, the Fed didn\'t cite high capacity utilization, a nod to tight labor markets, as an inflation risk. It didn\'t refer to a balance of risks between economic growth and inflation either. But the worry is clearly on the economy. ""Given that Fed rate moves only tend to really take effect six months to a year after the fact,"" noted Naomi Fink, currency analyst at BNP Paribas, its decision means ""this may not be the end of the financial-market moves that we\'ve seen. . . . It\'s only a matter of time before the euro clears $1.40."" The yen could lose ground to the euro and the dollar as investors adjust to lower U.S. interest rates. ""Real money investors are still in risk-averse mode, trying to digest the impact"" of the announcement, said Samarjit Shankar, director of global strategy at Bank of New York Mellon, immediately after the Fed release. When the dust settles, he said, expect fresh carry trades to come with a renewal of risk appetite, in light of a favorable reaction by the U.S. equities market, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average gaining 335.97 points by the end of trading yesterday. Elsewhere, Canada\'s dollar touched a fresh 30-year high again yesterday on the Fed\'s decision, with the greenback dropping to $1.0139 after the FOMC made its announcement. The Fed cut, said market strategist Stewart Hall of HSBC Securities Canada in Toronto, has worked to the Canadian dollar\'s advantage by underscoring the monetary-policy divergence between the U.S. and Canadian central banks. Canada\'s central bank has suggested that it is unlikely to adopt any rate-changing policies in the near term.

257,2007-09-18,"['Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke moved aggressively to stop the spreading credit crunch from sinking the nation\'s economy with a surprising half-percentage-point cut in interest rates, casting aside for now worries about appearing to bail out investors. The cut, which exceeded the quarter-point reduction most economists had expected, signals that Mr. Bernanke, fearing broad damage from the market turmoil that erupted a month ago, preferred to risk doing too much rather than too little. The move came amid a sizable drop in home sales, construction and prices that could send mortgage defaults higher and damp consumer spending. With yesterday\'s move, Mr. Bernanke may have shown himself closer in style and tactics to predecessor Alan Greenspan than some market watchers had suspected. That carries risks: Critics may start referring to the ""Bernanke put,"" as they once spoke of the ""Greenspan put"" under the former Fed chairman. (A put option protects its holder from a loss on an investment.) Yet Mr. Bernanke has shown that giving the impression he might be shielding investors matters less than keeping the economy out of recession. That\'s how Mr. Greenspan interpreted the Fed\'s action. ""The question they had to weigh was, \'Was punishing those [speculators] more important than doing something that they perceived to be in the greater good?\'"" he said in an interview yesterday with Fox News Channel\'s Neil Cavuto. The Fed cut its target for the federal-funds rate, charged on overnight loans between banks, to 4.75% from 5.25%. It also cut its discount rate, charged on direct loans to banks, by the same amount, to 5.25%. The cuts sparked a rally on Wall Street. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, up just 70 points before the decision was announced, soared 335.97 points, or 2.5%, to 13739.39, its biggest percentage gain since 2003. But in a sign some investors fear that the cut could also foster inflationary pressures, the dollar fell sharply, long-term Treasury-bond yields rose, and oil prices also jumped. Crude-oil futures surged 94 cents a barrel to $81.51, a second consecutive record on the New York Mercantile Exchange but still well short of the inflation-adjusted high of $101.57 hit in April 1980. In a break from the past, the Fed did not say whether higher inflation or weaker growth was its greatest worry or whether those worries were equal; it thus gave no hint about what its next move would be. ""Some inflation risks remain,"" it said. But ""developments in financial markets . . . have increased the uncertainty surrounding the economic outlook."" Markets put high odds on a quarter-point cut at the Fed\'s next meeting, on Oct. 30. The half-point cut put an exclamation point on a drama that began more than a month ago. At its last meeting, Aug. 7, the Fed left the federal-funds rate, its main target for short-term interest rates, at 5.25% and signaled continued worries about inflation. Days later, credit-market concerns erupted in Europe over losses in bank-linked hedge funds and off-balance-sheet investment vehicles that had purchased U.S. subprime mortgages. In the following weeks, investors and lenders became increasingly suspicious of each other and unwilling to lend, driving up interest rates for all sorts of borrowers. On Wall Street, cries soon rose for the Fed to cut rates immediately. Instead, the Fed on Aug. 17 cut its discount rate by half a percentage point and eased terms on direct loans from its discount window in hopes banks would use the Fed\'s cash to restore liquidity to credit markets. The aim, Fed officials said at the time, was to make a distinction between the Fed\'s role of keeping the financial system functioning normally, and its responsibility for economic stability. By contrast, Mr. Greenspan tended to treat financial stability and economic stability as inextricably linked, and saw a rate cut as the best way both to restore investor confidence and cushion the economy. His critics say those cuts over time emboldened investors to take on ever more debt and drive asset prices -- first stocks, then houses -- to ever-loftier levels, making the ultimate correction more painful. That criticism has intensified both with the turmoil in housing and the recent release of Mr. Greenspan\'s memoir. Mr. Bernanke heard that criticism, but ultimately has shown himself of much the same mind as Mr. Greenspan: the Fed can\'t take responsibility for asset prices, only for growth and inflation. ""Economic growth was moderate during the first half of the year, but the tightening of credit conditions has the potential to intensify the housing correction and to restrain economic growth more generally,"" the Fed said in a statement accompanying yesterday\'s decision. ""Today\'s action is intended to help forestall some of the adverse effects on the broader economy that might otherwise arise from the disruptions in financial markets."" Fed officials had been leaning toward a rate cut in recent weeks, but the case for the larger move may have been sealed by a report two weeks ago revealing that employment declined in August for the first time in four years. That showed the economy had slowed markedly even before the full force of the market turmoil had been felt. As recently as July Fed officials had expected the economy to grow around 2.5% this year. While the Fed has lowered that forecast, the size of its rate cut was motivated more by the wide range of possibilities around that new forecast, due to the still-unknown reaction of business and households to tighter credit markets. The larger-than-expected cut represents insurance against more catastrophic scenarios. The market turmoil is likely to hit housing first and hardest. Investors have grown wary of holding loans from all but the safest borrowers. That has led to a sharp jump in rates on ""jumbo"" mortgages -- those above $417,000 -- which can\'t be sold to federally chartered mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The ranks of home buyers have thinned, especially in high-priced markets, and borrowers with shaky credit have difficulty finding a mortgage at any rate. The lack of buyers will likely drag down sales, make it even harder for home builders to trim bloated inventories, and force them to drop prices further. John Makin, a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, said even with the rate cut, the economy will probably shrink in the fourth quarter of the year, though by less than if the Fed hadn\'t acted. ""If the economy continues to weaken, credit conditions will weaken again because [of] falling housing prices. You\'ve got to break that cycle, where you have bad credit, bad economy, bad credit, bad economy. They\'re taking a first step to break that cycle."" David Seiders, chief economist at the National Association of Home Builders, said even though Treasury-bond yields -- the main determinant of mortgage rates -- rose slightly yesterday, the rate cut might boost credit market confidence and lead to a narrowing in the spread between mortgage rates and Treasury yields, allowing mortgage rates to fall. Several banks announced they were cutting their prime rates, the benchmark for many consumer and commercial loans, to 7.75% from 8.25%. It was only a month ago the Fed declared it was still more worried about higher inflation than weaker growth. Those concerns haven\'t entirely ebbed: yesterday the Fed said that while underlying inflation had ""improved modestly this year . . . some inflation risks remain."" Allan Meltzer, a Fed historian at Carnegie Mellon University, said the cut was a mistake, reminiscent of the 1960s and 1970s, when the Fed put more emphasis on unemployment and less on inflation in its actions. That caused inflation to ratchet higher over the years until Fed Chairman Paul Volcker brought it down again. ""What\'s the market saying?"" Mr. Meltzer said. ""That this is an expansive move that will bail out the economy."" He added: ""I never believed in the \'Greenspan put.\' But the market believes it, and now it will certainly believe there will be a \'Bernanke put.\'"" Some Fed officials may have shared similar concerns either about inflation or about the risk of stoking further speculation. Only seven of the Fed\'s 12 reserve banks requested the half-point cut in the discount rate. Four of the five absent banks are headed by presidents who have raised such concerns. None of the four, however, have a vote on the Fed\'s policy-making Federal Open Market Committee this year, and that may be why the vote to cut the federal-funds rate was unanimous.

""some inflation risks remain,"" it said. but ""developments in financial markets . . . have increased the uncertainty surrounding the economic outlook."" markets put high odds on a quarter-point cut at the fed's next meeting, on oct. 30. the half-point cut put an exclamation point on a drama that began more than a month ago. at its last meeting, aug. 7, the fed left the federal-funds rate, its main target for short-term interest rates, at 5.25% and signaled continued worries about inflation. days later, credit-market concerns erupted in europe over losses in bank-linked hedge funds and off-balance-sheet investment vehicles that had purchased u.s. subprime mortgages. in the following weeks, investors and lenders became increasingly suspicious of each other and unwilling to lend, driving up interest rates for all sorts of borrowers. on wall street, cries soon rose for the fed to cut rates immediately. instead, the fed on aug. 17 cut its discount rate by half a percentage point and eased terms on direct loans from its discount window in hopes banks would use the fed's cash to restore liquidity to credit markets. the aim, fed officials said at the time, was to make a distinction between the fed's role of keeping the financial system functioning normally, and its responsibility for economic stability. by contrast, mr. greenspan tended to treat financial stability and economic stability as inextricably linked, and saw a rate cut as the best way both to restore investor confidence and cushion the economy. his critics say those cuts over time emboldened investors to take on ever more debt and drive asset prices -- first stocks, then houses -- to ever-loftier levels, making the ultimate correction more painful. that criticism has intensified both with the turmoil in housing and the recent release of mr. greenspan's memoir. mr. bernanke heard that criticism, but ultimately has shown himself of much the same mind as mr. greenspan: the fed can't take responsibility for asset prices, only for growth and inflation. ""economic growth was moderate during the first half of the year, but the tightening of credit conditions has the potential to intensify the housing correction and to restrain economic growth more generally,"" the fed said in a statement accompanying yesterday's decision. ""today's action is intended to help forestall some of the adverse effects on the broader economy that might otherwise arise from the disruptions in financial markets."" fed officials had been leaning toward a rate cut in recent weeks, but the case for the larger move may have been sealed by a report two weeks ago revealing that employment declined in august for the first time in four years. that showed the economy had slowed markedly even before the full force of the market turmoil had been felt. as recently as july fed officials had expected the economy to grow around 2.5% this year. while the fed has lowered that forecast, the size of its rate cut was motivated more by the wide range of possibilities around that new forecast, due to the still-unknown reaction of business and households to tighter credit markets. the larger-than-expected cut represents insurance against more catastrophic scenarios. the market turmoil is likely to hit housing first and hardest. investors have grown wary of holding loans from all but the safest borrowers. that has led to a sharp jump in rates on ""jumbo"" mortgages -- those above $417,000 -- which can't be sold to federally chartered mortgage giants fannie mae and freddie mac. the ranks of home buyers have thinned, especially in high-priced markets, and borrowers with shaky credit have difficulty finding a mortgage at any rate. the lack of buyers will likely drag down sales, make it even harder for home builders to trim bloated inventories, and force them to drop prices further. john makin, a scholar at the american enterprise institute, said even with the rate cut, the economy will probably shrink in the fourth quarter of the year, though by less than if the fed hadn't acted. ""if the economy continues to weaken, credit conditions will weaken again because [of] falling housing prices. you've got to break that cycle, where you have bad credit, bad economy, bad credit, bad economy. they're taking a first step to break that cycle."" david seiders, chief economist at the national association of home builders, said even though treasury-bond yields -- the main determinant of mortgage rates -- rose slightly yesterday, the rate cut might boost credit market confidence and lead to a narrowing in the spread between mortgage rates and treasury yields, allowing mortgage rates to fall. several banks announced they were cutting their prime rates, the benchmark for many consumer and commercial loans, to 7.75% from 8.25%. it was only a month ago the fed declared it was still more worried about higher inflation than weaker growth. those concerns haven't entirely ebbed: yesterday the fed said that while underlying inflation had ""improved modestly this year . . . some inflation risks remain."" allan meltzer, a fed historian at carnegie mellon university, said the cut was a mistake, reminiscent of the 1960s and 1970s, when the fed put more emphasis on unemployment and less on inflation in its actions. that caused inflation to ratchet higher over the years until fed chairman paul volcker brought it down again. ""what's the market saying?"" mr. meltzer said. ""that this is an expansive move that will bail out the economy."" he added: ""i never believed in the 'greenspan put.' but the market believes it, and now it will certainly believe there will be a 'bernanke put.'"" some fed officials may have shared similar concerns either about inflation or about the risk of stoking further speculation. only seven of the fed's 12 reserve banks requested the half-point cut in the discount rate. four of the five absent banks are headed by presidents who have raised such concerns. none of the four, however, have a vote on the fed's policy-making federal open market committee this year, and that may be why the vote to cut the federal-funds rate was unanimous.    license this article from dow jones reprint service']",72.0,1.0,"have increased the uncertainty surrounding the economic outlook."" markets put high odds on a quarter-point cut at the fed's next meeting, on oct",1.0,"['federal reserve chairman ben bernanke moved aggressively to stop the spreading credit crunch from sinking the nation's economy with a surprising half-percentage-point cut in interest rates, casting aside for now worries about appearing to bail out investors",,,,,1
258,2005-06-30,"[""WASHINGTON, June 30 -- The Federal Reserve raised short-term interest rates on Thursday, the ninth consecutive increase and almost certainly not the last.   As investors expected, the central bank raised the federal funds rate on overnight loans between banks a quarter-point, to 3.25 percent.   In a statement that accompanied the announcement, policy makers gave no hint of when they might slow or stop their march to higher rates.   They repeated previous declarations that monetary policy is ''accommodative,'' which means interest rates are still lower than officials want, and they again said rates could still rise at a ''measured'' pace.   The Fed has been using those words as a form of advance guidance that it will continue raising short-term rates a quarter-point at each policy meeting until it says something different.   That left investors locked in the same debate about whether the central bank would take a breather at some point in the fall.   ''They didn't answer any questions today,'' said Peter Kretzmer, senior economist at Bank of America. ''My feeling is that we will hear some things in July, but they certainly didn't want to indicate that now.''   Thursday was the one-year anniversary of the Fed's effort to reverse the easy-money policies it followed after 2001, when it was fighting an economic slowdown and a collapse of the stock market bubble.   Investors hoped that Fed officials would offer some hint that they were getting close to a ''neutral'' rate, one that would neither stimulate inflationary pressures nor put a brake on growth.   But policy makers made only minor changes to their description of the economy, and those served to reinforce the case for more rate increases.   ''Although energy prices have risen further, the expansion remains firm and labor market conditions continue to improve gradually,'' members of the Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed's policy-making body, said in their statement.   That was consistent with the views of Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, and it implied that the Fed did not have to fight off a possible slowdown.   The statement also mentioned continued concern about inflation. ''Pressures on inflation have stayed elevated, but longer-term expectations remain well contained,'' the central bank said.   Richard W. Fisher, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, set off tremors in financial markets in early June when he remarked that the Fed was in ''the ninth inning'' of its rate-raising campaign.   But Mr. Fisher's comments were at odds with those of most other officials, including Mr. Greenspan.   The Federal Reserve has steadily nudged up the overnight lending rate from a low of 1 percent in June 2004. It is now significantly higher than the European Central Bank's benchmark rate, which is 2 percent.   The most recent economic data suggest that economic growth remains strong and inflationary pressure remains low, despite surging oil prices and rising labor costs.   That has given the Federal Reserve considerable room for maneuvering -- and for disagreement. For policy makers who worry that the cost of borrowing is still too low, the apparent resilience of the economy makes it easier to argue for tightening policy.   Supporters of higher rates received fresh ammunition on Wednesday, when the government reported that the economy grew 3.8 percent in the first quarter of 2005, compared with its previous estimate of 3.5 percent.   But inflation has also been milder in recent months, despite the rise of oil prices to more than $60 a barrel early this week.   On Thursday morning, the Commerce Department reported that the Fed's favorite gauge of inflation edged up slightly in May but was still well within the central bank's unofficial comfort zone.   The Commerce Department reported that its price gauge for personal consumption expenditures, excluding energy and food, was up 1.6 percent in May over the year before. That was slightly higher than the year-over-year increase in April, but within the range of 1 percent to 2 percent that policy makers appear to favor.   But in recent public statements, top Fed officials have indicated increased worries about evidence of bubble-like prices in the housing market as well as the nation's rapidly rising foreign indebtedness.   Housing prices have soared over the last year, partly because long-term mortgage rates have declined even as the Fed has been raising short-term rates.

260,2005-06-30,"['The Federal Reserve raised interest rates for the ninth time in a year, signaling confidence in the economy and concern about inflation -- even as bond investors worry that a downturn is in the offing. The Fed, as widely expected, raised its target for the federal-funds rate, charged on overnight loans between banks, to 3.25% from 3%. Yesterday\'s increase came exactly one year after the Fed began to lift rates from an extraordinary low level. But in that time, long-term interest rates, which are determined by market forces and are the benchmark for mortgages and corporate loans, have actually declined. That decline has fueled a debate over whether the Fed is going too far or hasn\'t gone far enough. Some say the Fed should pause in its rate increases because the decline, together with a downdraft in stock and commodity prices, foreshadows slower economic growth. Others say short-term rates should keep rising because low long-term rates have given an extra boost to the economy -- in particular housing. For now, the Fed is in the latter camp. In the statement accompanying its decision, the Fed said, ""Although energy prices have risen further, the expansion remains firm."" That\'s a more upbeat assessment than the statement after its May 3 meeting, which observed that growth had ""slowed somewhat."" Yesterday\'s statement said ""pressures on inflation remain elevated,"" though it dropped its May 3 assessment that ""pricing power is more evident."" The Fed said interest rates are ""accommodative,"" i.e. low enough to stimulate economic activity, and will likely rise further at a ""measured"" pace. ""Measured"" has come to mean a quarter percentage point per meeting. The Fed funds rate has risen from 1% to 3.25% in the last year, but at the same time, the 30-year fixed rate mortgage has fallen to 5.6% from 6.3% while the one-year adjustable rate mortgage has edged up only to 4.2% from 4.1%. Low mortgage rates have lifted housing construction, sales and prices to levels many Fed officials worry are unsustainable. Housing was the subject of a special discussion at the Fed\'s two-day meeting this week, according to several private economists close to the Fed. As they did with stocks in the 1990s, Fed officials disavow any responsibility for reining in a potential real-estate bubble. But they do believe housing activity and prices are fueling economic growth, adding to inflation pressures, all of which are reasons to keep tightening. Fed officials have also warned the banks they regulate against lax mortgage lending. All 11 voting members of the 18-member policy-making Federal Open Market Committee agreed to yesterday\'s rate increase. (One voting seat is vacant.) The Fed also raised its lesser-used discount rate, charged on Fed advances to commercial banks, to 4.25% from 4%. Commercial banks raised their prime rate to 6.25% from 6%. Laurence Meyer, a former Fed governor and now an analyst at Macroeconomic Advisers LLC, a forecasting firm, predicted the Fed will raise the funds rate one or two more times, to 3.5% or 3.75%, then pause to ""take stock.""

The FOMC has raised rates for nine consecutive meetings and indicated that it will continue to do so. However, the Fed decision did little to affect either the dollar's modest decline versus the euro or the sharp rally versus the yen that had come earlier in the session. Some analysts suggested that the yen's losses represent a continuing pullback in expectations for a revaluation of the Chinese yuan. The yen's fortunes in recent months have ebbed and flowed along with speculation over China's currency policy, since many Asian currencies are expected to appreciate if China does allow the yuan to strengthen. U.S. pressure on China to revalue its currency eased somewhat, when Sen. Charles Schumer (D., N.Y.), and Sen. Lindsey Graham, (R., S.C.), said they had agreed to delay a vote on their proposed legislation to put a 27.5% tariff on Chinese imports to offset the impact on trade of China's currency peg. The news came following a closed-door meeting in Washington with Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan and U.S. Treasury Secretary John Snow.

262,2005-06-30,"['The high-stakes game of poker between the Federal Reserve and the Treasurys market continued, with bond investors still calling the central bank\'s bluff over the extent of future rate increases. The Fed yesterday raised its federal-funds target rate by another quarter percentage point to 3.25%, and gave no sign that a pause in tightening is imminent. In reaction, long-dated Treasurys rallied strongly. This test of wills is the basis of a bet that could make or break many fixed-income investors during the second half of the year. It revolves around whether the Fed will halt its monetary tightening when the federal-funds rate reaches the area around 3.5% or 3.75%, or keep adjusting the cost of overnight borrowing in measured steps toward or beyond the 4% threshold. For now, the Fed\'s policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee, in its role as the ultimate judge and jury of the bond market\'s various swings in sentiment, is keeping its options open. At the conclusion of its two-day policy meeting, the FOMC not only met the expectations of a rate hike, it also released a statement similar in substance to the one from its May meeting. ""Although energy prices have risen further, the [economic] expansion remains firm and labor-market conditions continue to improve gradually,"" the FOMC said. ""Pressures on inflation have stayed elevated, but longer-term inflation expectations remain well-contained."" Dominic Konstam, head of interest rate strategy at Credit Suisse First Boston in New York, said, ""The Fed is not giving any ground on the idea among many investors that a pause is around the corner. Even if they do decide to pause tightening policy in a couple of months, the Fed wants to maintain a restrictive face for the bond market."" The six-week hiatus before the next Fed meeting provides the market with some breathing room. But it\'s walking a very fine line. ""There is no longer much of a margin for error,"" said Stephen Stanley, chief economist at RBS Greenwich Capital in Greenwich, Conn. He noted that current market forecasts for the year-end federal-funds rate and Treasurys out to 10 years in maturity are all below 4%. Despite the current debate over the economy\'s growth prospects, some investors believe things are much better than low Treasury yields imply. Economic factors ""will ultimately prevail, and rates are likely to move meaningfully higher than they are today,"" said Colin Lundgren, head of institutional fixed-income at American Express Asset Management Group in Minneapolis. He expects rate hikes beyond the 3.75% expected by the market, subject to future economic data. Aside from data, the test of wills between the bond market and the FOMC may be resolved to some degree by Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan\'s semiannual address before Congress on July 20. ""Greenspan will be able to flesh out in great detail policy makers\' thinking on the outlook and the stance of policy,"" said RBS Greenwich\'s Stanley. This has the bond market prepared for another increase of a quarter percentage point, and some language that hints at a pause after one more increase to 3.75%. Should the Fed ultimately pause, one big change in Treasurys would be a widening in the difference between short- and long-term yields -- in market terms, a steepening yield curve -- as investors build an inflation premium into longer-dated Treasury yields. For now, flattening remains the driving trend. And in post-FOMC trading, the margin between two- and 10-year note yields continued to shrink, falling below 0.3 percentage point for the first time since the start of 2001. ""Most of the rally in bonds is explained by the compression of inflation,"" said Eric Hiller, head of derivatives interest rate strategy at Bank of America. ""The curve is certainly flatter, with some room to continue."" At 4 p.m., the benchmark 10-year note was up 17/32 point, or $5.31 per $1,000 face value, at 101 21/32. Its yield fell to 3.922% from 3.986% Wednesday, as yields move inversely to prices. The 30-year bond was up 1 7/32 points at 118 15/32 to yield 4.193%, down from 4.263% Wednesday.

265,2007-05-09,"['They wanted change and got it, but nowhere near enough. Despite a tweak in its language on growth, the Federal Open Market Committee\'s decision to reiterate that inflation risk remains its ""predominant"" concern leaves the Treasury market stranded where it has stood for weeks now -- range-bound and uncertain where to turn forsome clear direction. As expected, the FOMC kept rates on hold at 5.25% for the seventh meeting running, extending to 11 months the period in which the Fed hasn\'t adjusted rates. In its statement, the Fed budged not an inch on inflation, repeating that price pressures excluding energy and food remain ""somewhat elevated."" The market\'s reaction said it all. From little-changed before the meeting, Treasurys sold off across the curve. The two-year note, which was unchanged for a yield of 4.67% before the statement, fell 3/32 point, or $0.9375 per $1,000 face value, to 99 19/32. Its yield rose to 4.726% from 4.671% Tuesday, as yields move inversely to prices. The new benchmark 10-year note stood at 98 21/32 to yield 4.669% late in the afternoon.

""The vast majority of people were long in anticipation of the meeting"" -- betting on price gains -- and had to reverse their bets after the statement, he added. For T.J. Marta, rates strategist at RBC Capital Markets, the most significant aspect of the statement was ""the pulled punch"" on inflation, which leaves market bets on a third-quarter rate cut precariously balanced. ""The fact that they could have downgraded their inflation assessment but didn\'t"" was what pushed the market lower, he said. For Treasury traders, the May FOMC meeting now passes onto a lengthening list of missed opportunities for the market to break out the ranges it has been stuck in. The statement reiterated the Fed\'s view that the economy will likely ""continue to expand at a moderate pace,"" even as it acknowledged that recent growth has slowed. Despite the weak first-quarter growth data, the tame March inflation readings and last Friday\'s softer nonfarm-payrolls growth, the 10-year yield has been stuck in a 4.60%-4.70% range for three weeks. It has been in a 4.58%-4.78% range for the last 5 1/2 weeks and in a 4.44%-4.78% range for almost three months. While the market has put a slate of bond issuance behind it and Treasury debt paydowns will soon leave investors flush with cash, there is fresh inflation data in coming days that could renew the pressure on Treasury prices if they don\'t conform to March\'s weakness.

267,1994-07-06,"['WASHINGTON, July 6 -- The Federal Reserve ended a two-day strategy session on monetary policy today without announcing an increase in short-term interest rates or explaining its apparent inaction.   Analysts took this to mean that the central bank, which had raised rates four times since early February, was satisfied with early signs that the economy is slowing enough to minimize the risk of resurgent inflation.   It had been widely agreed that the Fed\'s assessment of the domestic economy would outweigh its interest in supporting the dollar in world currency markets, even though higher rates, by making the dollar more appealing, would tend to enhance foreign investment and minimize inflation from imports. Markets\' Response   The financial markets responded fairly positively, though with no great enthusiasm, to the apparent outcome of the Fed meeting. The dollar rebounded from its morning declines, blue-chip stocks rallied and bond prices showed relatively little change.   But while today\'s result came as no surprise, some analysts had speculated that the Fed might continue its practice since early February -- when it began its current series of rate increases -- of providing a brief rationale for its moves, or at least to make a clear declaration that it had decided to leave its stance unchanged.   Today\'s development did not absolutely mean that the Fed had decided to keep rates where they were. Until February, the committee\'s moves had to be deduced from watching the financial markets -- usually the day after it met -- since the committee did not announce its immediate intentions. Fed Statement   The Fed did, in fact, issue a statement today, but the statement said only: ""The meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee ended at 12:35 P.M. and there will be no further announcement."" The session, attended by 18 members and more than two dozen staff, ran for seven hours, starting Tuesday afternoon, and reconvening at 9 A.M. today.   Joseph R. Coyne, a spokesman, denied that any precedent had been set in announcing immediately the four earlier increases in the Federal funds rate. Nor would he comment on the possibility that the Fed today made a ""contingent"" decision to take action based on some future development.   ""We don\'t have any permanent policy yet"" with respect to the immediate announcement of deliberative results, Mr. Coyne said. ""This is still provisional.""   There was disappointment, however, at the House Banking Committee where Henry B. Gonzalez, the Texas Democrat who serves as chairman, has long pressed for greater and quicker disclosure of Fed actions. A committee aide said today, ""They\'re clearly going back to their old ways.""   Most analysts continued to regard further rate increases as likely, probably before Labor Day and possibly as soon as mid-July, after the Fed has digested labor market and retail sales figures for June. The job report is due Friday, the sales report next Thursday. Consumer Spending   A slackening in consumer spending, along with a less robust housing market, has been the chief evidence so far that the economy\'s growth has slowed from the torrid 7 percent growth rate of the final three months of 1993 followed by a 3.4 percent pace -- regarded by some as still unsustainable -- in the first quarter of 1994.   Lyle E. Gramley, a former Fed governor and research chief who is now with the Mortgage Bankers Association, said today that the Fed would be particularly interested in the upcoming sales report and predicted that the next move to raise rates would come at the Federal Open Market Committee\'s next meeting on Aug. 16.   He said the job figures could prompt a telephone conference of the committee but doubted this set of data would produce an increase by itself.   Robert V. DiClemente, a veteran Fed watcher at Salomon Brothers, also said more rate increases could be expected. He said it did not much matter whether a rise was deferred for days or even weeks, so long as the economic need for it was clearly established. On the other hand, Mr. DiClemente added, ""it could be critical if they make a misstep in acting too soon.""   He and other analysts also suggested it was wise for the Fed to avoid stating today it had taken no action since this could have emboldened speculators to attack the dollar with relatively impunity. Three Votes   Mr. Coyne said three votes were taken at today\'s meeting but he would not hint at the results. The committee members, 11 of them currently with votes, expressed themselves on monetary targets for the balance of 1994 and on preliminary monetary targets for 1995, in addition to policy over the next six weeks.   The voting committee is currently composed of six sitting governors of the Federal Reserve Board plus the presidents of 5 of the 12 regional Federal Reserve Banks, who vote on a rotating basis; the president of the New York Fed, who also serves as vice-chairman of the committee, is a permanent voting member. This was the first meeting for the newest governor, Alan Blinder, the first Clinton appointee to the Fed.   The Fed\'s targets will be publicly disclosed when Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, makes his statutory semiannual appearance before Congress later this month to discuss the economic outlook and the central bank\'s anticipated response.   A spokesman for the Senate Banking Committee said this afternoon that the date for this hearing had not yet been determined.

269,2007-10-31,"['NEW YORK -- The dollar dropped to its seventh straight record low against the euro yesterday, a response to the Federal Reserve\'s cut in U.S. interest rates. The dollar also lost heavily against its Canadian counterpart, touching its lowest level in modern times. The dollar maintained gains on the yen, after the Bank of Japan voted to keep interest rates on hold during Asian trading. The euro broke the $1.45 barrier to $1.4508 after the Federal Open Market Committee announced its interest-rates cuts. At 4 p.m., the euro was at $1.4486, up from $1.4436 late Monday, while the dollar was at 115.35 yen, up from 114.69. The euro was at 167.10 yen, up from 165.67 yen. The United Kingdom pound was at $2.0793, up from $2.0683. The dollar was quoted at 1.1581 Swiss francs, down from 1.1590. The Canadian dollar extended its gains to C$0.9422, its modern-day high against the U.S. dollar. At 4 p.m., the U.S. dollar was trading at C$0.9448, down from C$0.9529 Tuesday. The C$0.9422 level dates from Aug. 21, 1957. It represents the strongest level reached by the Canadian dollar since the Bank of Canada was established and charged with managing the currency in the 1930s. Earlier versions of the Canadian currency reached their strongest level versus the U.S. dollar in the early 1860s, when the U.S. was still embroiled in the Civil War and issues of legal tender in Canada were fixed to the gold standard. Yesterday\'s late gains for the Canadian dollar were an extension of the rally set off following the Fed\'s cuts in interest rates. The Fed\'s quarter-point trimming of its benchmark rate eliminated the long-standing U.S. rate premium and brought administered U.S. and Canadian rates into alignment at equivalent 4.50% settings. ""As long as the Fed is the only central bank in the G-10 cutting rates, the U.S. dollar is going to underperform,"" said Sophia Drossos, a currency strategist at Morgan Stanley in New York.

270,2007-10-31,"['The Federal Reserve cut interest rates by a quarter point, but with an eye on surging energy prices and other inflationary threats, it strongly discouraged expectations of further cuts. The decision, following a half-point cut six weeks ago, shows Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke is grappling with risks on two fronts: Plunging home construction and eroding real-estate values could hit the broader economy, while rising oil and commodity prices, combined with a falling dollar, could spoil the Fed\'s hopes to contain inflation. Developments yesterday underlined the tension. Though data showed the U.S. economy growing at a faster-than-expected 3.9% annual rate in the third quarter, a purchasing managers\' survey showed weak manufacturing in the Midwest in October, the latest in a series of such reports. At the same time, crude-oil futures prices jumped $4.15 to $94.53 a barrel, a nominal record, and gold futures settled at $792.00 an ounce, a 27-year high. For now, though, investors appear to believe neither of those scenarios will materialize. Stocks initially fell after the announcement dashed expectations of more rate cuts, but then recovered, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbing 137.54 points, or 1%, to 13930.01, less than 235 points from its record. The Fed cut its target for the federal-funds rate, charged on overnight loans between banks, to 4.5% from 4.75%, after cutting it half a point in September. The combined cuts were designed, it said in the accompanying statement, to ""help forestall some of the adverse effects on the broader economy"" from the summer credit crunch that drove up interest rates paid by many homeowners, corporations and banks. Growth was solid in the third quarter but likely to slow with the ""intensification of the housing correction,"" the Fed said in its statement. Core inflation, which excludes food and energy, has improved, it said, ""but recent increases in energy and commodity prices, among other factors, may put renewed upward pressure on inflation."" As a result, the Fed said, ""after this [rate cut], the upside risks to inflation roughly balance the downside risks to growth."" In the weeks leading up to the meeting, Fed officials saw their choice as no cut or a quarter-point ease. But their room to maneuver was limited by the fact that markets had become certain there would be a cut and, by last week, perhaps even a larger, half-point cut. Many on Wall Street justified their predictions on the grounds that Fed officials hadn\'t publicly countered them. Fed officials don\'t like to do something just because the markets expect it. But with futures markets assigning a 92% probability yesterday morning to a cut, a failure to deliver would have been the biggest surprise in the 14 years for which comparable data is available, according to Bianco Research LLC, a Chicago financial-research firm. Many predicted that would have led to a stock selloff and increased reluctance to lend. Alan Blinder, a former Fed vice chairman who teaches at Princeton University, said, ""The Fed did not make their views very clear to the markets for about a three-week period in October when they could have. As a result, they wound up being pushed by the market. The Fed has a communications problem when the market\'s thinking diverges from the Fed\'s and the Fed doesn\'t say anything to get back in line."" But Mr. Bernanke has been less inclined than his predecessor Alan Greenspan to try to steer market expectations. And in any case, officials also saw good economic reasons to ease borrowing conditions. Markets remain unsettled and the housing slump could yet spill over more broadly to consumer spending, already weighed down by high energy costs. By some estimates a 4.75% funds rate is high relative to inflation and growth, implying the Fed was likely to ease eventually. Doing so now rather than later bought insurance against worst-case scenarios. There were hints the decision was a close call. Federal Open Market Committee members voted 9 to 1 to cut, the first time this year a vote hasn\'t been unanimous. Thomas Hoenig, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, dissented, preferring no cut. Just six of the 12 reserve banks requested the parallel decrease in the discount rate, charged on direct Fed loans to banks, to 5% from 5.25%. That suggests presidents of some of the other banks also would have preferred to stand pat. Just five of the 12 bank presidents have a vote on the FOMC in any given year. Perhaps mirroring the differing views inside the Fed, outsiders criticized the decision from both sides. Some said the Fed is underestimating the risks posed by the housing bust and credit crunch and will have to ease monetary policy again before long. ""The bursting of the housing bubble and strains in parts of the credit markets are profoundly deflationary events, and the Fed\'s concerns seem out of place,"" Bank Credit Analyst, a financial research service, said. But others say the Fed, despite yesterday\'s promise to monitor inflation pressure, risks stoking it. ""The Fed has to walk the walk as well as talk the talk,"" said John Ryding, an economist at Bear Stearns. ""They have to, should the numbers demand it, be willing to reverse the rate cuts. With gold up sharply and the dollar down, the market is still questioning the Fed\'s commitment to do what it says."" The expected inflation rate as implied by trading in inflation-protected Treasury bonds also rose yesterday, though that may reflect short-term trading dynamics. Despite the rhetoric, the Fed\'s leadership probably isn\'t too worried about inflation. Officials believe the tendency of a lower dollar or higher energy prices to become embedded in underlying inflation has declined significantly in recent decades. Their principal source of inflation concern -- the low level of spare capacity in the economy -- has waned as the unemployment rate rises and the economy slows. Wage and benefit costs rose at a subdued rate in the third quarter, the Labor Department said yesterday. The economy is expected to slow sharply in the fourth quarter as high energy prices bite into consumer spending and housing construction tumbles further. On the other hand, the Fed doesn\'t see the self-reinforcing dynamics that lead to recession, such as in 2001, when it had to cut rates repeatedly. Rather, it sees the economy as sagging temporarily, as the pool of potential homeowners shrinks to match the tightened terms of credit and the inventory of unsold new homes is worked down, after which it expects growth will return to a normal rate.

271,1994-03-22,"['Interest rates plunged sharply yesterday, after the Federal Reserve broke precedent for the second time in two months and announced its intention to raise short-term interest rates.   In a short statement released in the afternoon, the Fed\'s chairman, Alan Greenspan, said the Federal Open Market Committee -- the central bank\'s policy-setting arm -- had ""decided to increase slightly the degree of pressure on reserve positions."" He added, ""This action is expected to be associated with a small increase in short-term interest rates.""   Within minutes of the statement, bond prices rose a half-point on the long end, with rates on shorter-maturity bills dropping sharply. The 30-year bond\'s yield -- which moves in the opposite direction of its price -- fell as low as 6.83 percent and by late in the day the price was up 110/32 , to 92 18/32 , for a yield of 6.84 percent. The drop of 11 basis points was the largest one-day yield decline in two and a half months. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. Rally in Short-Term Bills   Short-term bills also rallied strongly, with the rate on three- and six-month bills down 11 basis points as well, to 3.50 percent and 3.79 percent, respectively.   The closely followed 10-year note also rallied, dropping its yield to 6.42 percent, from 6.55 percent on Monday.   Traders and dealers said they preferred this type of announcement by the Fed to the central bank\'s previous policy of not saying anything. Donald Fine, the chief market analyst at Chase Securities, was delighted by the idea of the Fed announcing the slight tightening, and hoped the central bank would continue to use that approach. ""It removes all uncertainty about what its intentions are, leaving nothing for speculation,"" he said. ""And you can see by the market\'s reaction that it is showing its approval.""   Assuming that the move would push the Federal funds rate to 3.50 percent, Mr. Fine said: ""It will stay at 3.50 percent for a month or two, then you can expect it to hit 3.75 percent and the 4 percent. And we are going to 4 percent by July or August.   ""The main reason the Fed wants positive real short-term interest rates is to forestall any speculative inventory build up resulting from higher inflationary expectations."" In other words, the Fed is trying to prevent any near-term overheating of the economy because of increasing demand for goods and services to avoid future price increases.   As Fed governors convened yesterday for the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, most economists, 22 out of 30 polled by Reuters, were betting on a tightening of 25 basis points. But some said they would not rule out a 50-basis-point rise given the strength in short-term rates.   But unlike the Feb. 4 rise in short-term interest rates, when prices fell across the yield curve, yesterday\'s announcement of another credit tightening caused bond prices to rally higher instead.   Gerald A. Guild, senior manager of fixed income at Advest Inc., said the Feb. 4 decline in the bond market was the result of an overreaction by investors not satisfied by the rate rise. The market had expected something more aggressive from the Fed, he said, to show that it was serious about fighting inflation. The selloff has continued for the most part despite soft inflation news, causing many bond traders to suspect that the bond market has been oversold for some time now.   ""The market could hold today\'s gains if people come to conclude that inflation will remain under control,"" Mr. Guild said.   Analysts at MMS International said the short end of the market rallied strongly since the threat of a half-point rise in rates had already been priced in ahead of time.   Traders said there was some nervousness in the short end ahead of yesterday\'s $17 billion two-year-note auction. The announcement helped the auction, which produced a high yield of 5.15 percent. But by late in the day the yield on a two-year note in the when-issued market was down to 5 percent.   Today the Treasury will be selling $11 billion of five-year notes. In when-issued trading late yesterday, they were being offered at a price to yield 5.91 percent.   With the market poised for news coming out of the Fed meeting, morning data from the Commerce Department showing the United States merchandise trade gap had widened significantly in January to $9.85 billion had little impact on trading. Economists had forecast a $9 billion deficit in January.

""the market could hold today's gains if people come to conclude that inflation will remain under control,"" mr. guild said.   analysts at mms international said the short end of the market rallied strongly since the threat of a half-point rise in rates had already been priced in ahead of time.   traders said there was some nervousness in the short end ahead of yesterday's $17 billion two-year-note auction. the announcement helped the auction, which produced a high yield of 5.15 percent. but by late in the day the yield on a two-year note in the when-issued market was down to 5 percent.   today the treasury will be selling $11 billion of five-year notes. in when-issued trading late yesterday, they were being offered at a price to yield 5.91 percent.   with the market poised for news coming out of the fed meeting, morning data from the commerce department showing the united states merchandise trade gap had widened significantly in january to $9.85 billion had little impact on trading. economists had forecast a $9 billion deficit in january.   the following are the results of the treasury's two-year note auction: (000 omitted in dollar figures) high yield . . . 5.15% low yield . . . 5.09% median yield . . . 5.13% accepted at low price . . . 82% total applied for . . . $44,836 048 accepted . . . $17,014,488 noncompetitive . . . $1,170,000 interest set at . . . 5 1/8% the two-year notes mature on march 31, 1996.   graphs: ""treasury yield curve"" shows the yields of selected treasury securities, in percent.; ""2-year treasury notes"" shows the average discounted rate in percent from oct.

272,1994-03-22,"['WASHINGTON, March 22 -- Federal eserve officials voted today to nudge short-term interest rates higher for the second time in less than seven weeks.   The move set off a steep fall in long-term interest rates as the central bank appeared to succeed in convincing investors that it is committed to heading off inflation.   Officials of the Federal Reserve took the unusual step of announcing their decision immediately, as they did, for the first time ever, on Feb. 4. Until then, the Federal Reserve had let traders and investors guess its intentions from the direction of short-term interest rates, which the Federal Reserve influences by buying and selling government securities. A Federal Reserve spokesman said the new policy of making announcements would continue for the time being. Small Move Foreseen   The Federal Reserve, in its announcement at 2:20 P.M. today, did not say how much it intended to increase rates. But the interest rate for large overnight loans between banks rose a quarter of a percentage point this afternoon, to 3.5 percent, as traders anticipated that the Federal Reserve would intervene on Wednesday to insure that this was the new rate.   While it may seem odd for higher short-term rates to produce lower long-term rates, economic theory predicts exactly this result. Long-term rates, which the Federal Reserve does not control, are determined largely by investors\' expectations of inflation. If investors expect high inflation to erode the value of money that they lend for many years, they then demand higher long-term interest rates. Some Immediate Response   Higher short-term rates tend to brake economic growth, and indirectly slow inflation. As companies and individuals find it more expensive to borrow money, they cut spending, which means that they do not bid up the price of scarce labor and materials as quickly, holding down inflation.   How quickly today\'s move will affect the rates that consumers pay for mortgages and car loans will depend on how financial markets react in the coming days. The initial reaction brought the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond down to 6.84 percent, from 6.95 percent on Monday -- the biggest one-day drop in two and a half months. [ Page D14. ]   Economists said that if long-term rates stay down or fall farther, mortgage rates, which have risen sharply in recent weeks, might fall soon.   Clinton Administration officials expressed no objections to today\'s rate action. ""The Administration has a favorable and optimistic view on the economy right now and nothing that happens today altered that view,"" said Gene Sperling, a senior official of the National Economic Council.   The White House has shown little concern about increases in short-term rates by the Federal Reserve in part because of an acute awareness that such increases now might actually help the President\'s re-election prospects in 1996, Administration officials say privately.   By slowing the pace of the economic recovery and holding down long-term interest rates that influence the level of investment, increases in short-term rates may improve the odds that the economy will still be strong in 1996. Adheres to a Forecast   Laura D\'Andrea Tyson, the head of the President\'s Council of Economic Advisers, declined to discuss what the Federal Reserve move today might mean for the Administration politically. But she did say the action was consistent with her agency\'s forecast of steady annual economic growth of 2.6 or 2.7 percent through 1998.   ""Our goal is to stay with moderate growth and low inflation over the medium term,"" she said in an interview tonight.   President Clinton has said repeatedly in recent weeks that interest rates should not continue to rise, but has not specified whether his comments were about long or short rates.   The White House\'s reticence on monetary policy appeared to fade last week, when the President called Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, to a meeting that both sides described as routine. Administration officials said this week that interest rates were discussed briefly, but that the Administration did not try to tell Mr. Greenspan what to do.   Such reticence is less in evidence in the House of Representatives, where many members face tough re-election campaigns in November, a time when increases in short-term rates now may be affecting the economy. At a recent hearing, some members of the House Banking Committee complained to Mr. Greenspan about the rate increase on Feb. 4. A Politician\'s Protest   Representative Maurice D. Hinchey, a freshman Democrat from upstate New York, who faces a tough re-election race, expressed dismay tonight at the Federal Reserve action. ""This is going to hurt the economy; it\'s going to be bad for jobs; it\'s a bad idea,"" he said.   Rising interest rates, and the expectation of further rises, have been poison for stock markets around the world in recent weeks. Higher yields for notes and bonds make stocks a less appealing alternative investment.   The stock market was little changed today, with most broad measures of the market rising slightly while the Dow Jones industrial average slipped 2.30 points to close at 3,862.55. By contrast, the Dow plunged 96.24 points after the Feb. 4 move by the Federal Reserve, closing then at 3,871.42.   The Federal Reserve\'s moves today and last month were not so much a response to actual signs of inflation as they were attempts to convince the markets that the Fed would stifle any rise in prices that could accompany an economic recovery.   Neal Soss, an economist at the First Boston Corporation in New York, said that long-term interest rates fell today in part because investors were relieved to see an end to weeks of speculating about when the next rate increase would come. Investors were also happy that the Fed seemed to be setting a precedent for announcing such decisions, he said. ""That kind of certainty is very valuable to financial markets,"" he said.   Federal Reserve officials and economists had expected the Feb. 4 increase in short-term rates to hold down long-term rates. But mortgage and bond interest rates have climbed steadily in recent weeks.   Some economists link these increases to the Federal Reserve\'s last move, while others cite unrelated issues like the currency-trading losses of big international funds that also invest in bonds.   The Federal Reserve\'s announcement today repeated the language it used on Feb. 4: ""Chairman Alan Greenspan announced today that the Federal Open Market Committee decided to increase slightly the degree of pressure on reserve positions.""   The overnight bank lending rate had stood at 3 percent for 17 months before the move on Feb. 4.   Federal Reserve officials said then that the central bank was not trying to set a precedent by announcing its action, a point Mr. Greenspan repeated during recent Congressional testimony. But today\'s announcement did not include such a disclaimer. The Federal Reserve has been under pressure from Congressional Democrats to become more open.   Joseph Coyne, the Federal Reserve\'s spokesman, said the central bank had made a preliminary decision to disclose changes in overnight rates for the time being. A decision on whether to make that a permanent procedure will not be made until May at the earliest, he said.   Banks with excess deposits at the Federal Reserve trade them every day to banks that need extra money, charging them an overnight rate. The Federal Reserve controls this rate. It sells Government securities to banks when it wants to drain them of excess deposits and push short-term rates up, and buys securities when it wants to reduce short-term rates.   The Federal Reserve was clearly struggling this morning to hold down the overnight interest rate, Wall Street economists said. Early today that rate rose to 3.5 percent in anticipation of this afternoon\'s decision, but Federal Reserve officials then intervened, adding money to the banking system and driving the rate back down to nearly 3.25 percent.

273,2004-03-16,"[""WASHINGTON, March 16 -- The Federal Reserve left short-term interest rates unchanged at 1 percent on Tuesday, noting that ''hiring has lagged'' and suggesting that it had become more concerned about the weak job market.   The decision to leave interest rates unchanged had been widely expected by analysts and investors, and it reinforced expectations that the Fed would refrain from raising rates until much later this year or perhaps next year.   Treasury bonds rose in value and yields declined after the decision was announced. Stocks, which had traded higher before the announcement, initially gave up their gains before rebounding. [Page C9.]   Since the summer, the Federal Reserve has kept the federal funds rate, the rate on overnight loans between banks, at its lowest level in 46 years.   Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, has warned that interest rates are too low to be sustainable indefinitely. At its last meeting on Jan. 28, the Fed's policy committee retreated from an open-ended commitment to keep rates low for ''a considerable period.''   But Federal Reserve officials had also made clear that they were worried and puzzled about the stubbornly high level of unemployment, and their statement on Tuesday reflected disappointment over the surprisingly poor employment report for February issued by the Labor Department.   The economy has lost 2.2 million jobs in three years, and job growth has remained anemic despite rapid growth in the overall economy since the summer. In February, 21,000 jobs were added, compared with about 125,000 that economists say is necessary just to keep up with increases in population. The unemployment rate remained at 5.6 percent.   The Fed's statement on Tuesday hinted at slightly more pessimism than last month about the job market. Its rate-setting panel, the Federal Open Market Committee, said the economy continued to expand ''at a solid pace.'' But it added, ''Although job losses have slowed, new hiring has lagged.''   It reiterated that inflation was extremely low and that there was little pressure to tighten monetary policy through higher rates. And it repeated a view that the risks of inflation and deflation were ''almost equal,'' and noted that increases in consumer prices were ''muted and expected to remain low.''   ''With inflation quite low and resource use slack, the committee believes it can be patient in removing its policy accommodation,'' it said. In using the word ''slack,'' the Fed panel was alluding to the relatively high number of unemployed workers and the large amounts of spare factory capacity.   Chris Wolfe, an analyst at the J.P. Morgan Private Bank, said the Federal Reserve's statement offered little real news but reassured investors who were worried that rapid price increases in commodities -- including crude oil, steel scrap and rubber -- suggested steeper inflation in the near future.   ''This ought to quell the notion that massive inflation might be ahead,'' Mr. Wolfe said.   William C. Dudley, chief United States economist at Goldman, Sachs, said the Fed's decision on Tuesday confirmed what Mr. Greenspan and other top officials had been signaling for some time: that there is no need to raise interest rates any time soon.   ''The Fed is actually speaking very plainly, but people are so used to the Fed speaking very subtly that the markets aren't used to it,'' said Mr. Dudley, who has predicted that the Fed would not raise rates until some time in 2005.   The response in the credit market on Tuesday reflected a dissonance between the Fed and bond investors over the prospects for a bump up in inflation. Mr. Greenspan and other officials noted that consumer prices, excluding food and energy, were climbing barely 1 percent a year.   Outside the Fed, some economists have become worried about rising commodity prices, which have traditionally been a precursor to rising consumer prices. Oil, for instance, reached another recent high in New York trading Tuesday, with the April contract up 4 cents, to $37.48.   Unless the Federal Reserve raises rates by June, which most analysts consider extremely unlikely, it may be reluctant to change policy until well after the presidential elections in November. The Fed has usually tried to avoid taking any action that might be seen as favoring one side or another.   Sung Won Sohn, chief economist at Wells Fargo & Company in Minneapolis, commented: ''This is a presidential election year and the Federal Reserve does not want to become a political football. Most likely, there won't be any need to raise the interest rate this year.''

275,2004-03-16,"['NEW YORK -- The dollar hit a three-week low against the yen, but was little changed against the euro after Federal Reserve policy makers signaled no shift in the outlook for interest rates. The Federal Open Market Committee not only left its key interest rate at a 46-year low of 1%, as expected, but also reiterated its stance that inflationary pressures are low enough that it ""can be patient in removing its policy accommodation."" Fed officials also acknowledged the recent batch of disappointing employment reports, noting in their postmeeting statement that, ""Although job losses have slowed, new hiring has lagged."" The statement reaffirmed market expectations that the Fed would hold off from raising rates until at least late 2004, which may continue to weigh on the dollar. Low U.S. rates have been a major factor in the dollar\'s long-term downtrend because it makes it more difficult to attract enough foreign investment to fund the U.S. current-account deficit. However, the dollar was mostly directionless in choppy trading against most currencies after the Fed\'s decision. ""The dollar consequences will be marginal at best,"" said Jason Bonanca, director and currency strategist at Credit Suisse First Boston in New York. ""The Fed\'s still not talking about removing policy accommodation, [so] this is not dovish enough to reignite dollar bearishness."" Marc Chandler, chief currency strategist at HSBC Bank in New York, agreed that the statement included ""nothing really new substantially to elicit much of a response in the forex market."" Instead, the biggest moves in the dollar came against the yen amid continued speculation that the Bank of Japan would ease up on large-scale intervention. The dollar fell as far as 108.65 yen, a level not seen since late February. The dollar\'s slide against the yen started a chain reaction during the New York session, pushing European currencies down. That, in turn, helped the dollar recoup most of its overnight losses against the European currencies, which were due in large part to continued jitters about an increase in global terrorism. Late yesterday afternoon, the dollar was trading at 108.84 yen, down sharply from 110.31 yen late Monday in New York. The euro was at $1.2264, down slightly from $1.2271, and was lower against the yen at 133.40 yen from 135.40 yen. Against the Swiss franc, the dollar was at 1.2784 francs, up from 1.2752 francs, while sterling remained higher on the day at $1.8110 versus $1.8057 late Monday. In recent weeks, the Bank of Japan, which intervenes on behalf of the Ministry of Finance, had apparently switched tactics by buying dollars even when the U.S. currency was rallying.

276,2004-03-16,"['NEW YORK -- Indications that the Federal Reserve will remain very patient before raising interest rates triggered a strong afternoon rally in Treasurys. The Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed\'s rate-setting arm, kept official interest rates at a more-than-four-decade low of 1%. The FOMC said the odds of an ""unwelcome"" fall in inflation are ""almost equal"" to the risk of inflation. The Fed also noted that new hiring has ""lagged"" -- a less upbeat view on labor markets than it expressed in late January -- and that it can remain patient in removing its policy accommodation. The statement turned around the bond market, which had traded lower in price prior to the FOMC decision, and pushed yields down to near eight-month lows. Traders had worried that the Fed would adopt a neutral stance on inflation risks and perhaps pave the way for higher rates later this year. ""It\'s a major statement of where the Fed is leaning. . . . Rates are really on hold at least through the end of this year, if not well into the beginning of next year,"" said Mary Ann Hurley, vice president of fixed-income trading at D.A. Davidson in Seattle. Some traders said the outlook for U.S. rates to remain low likely will encourage continued ""carry trade"" activity -- a popular strategy that involves borrowing in low-yielding securities and investing in markets with higher yields. Craig Coats, head of fixed income at Keefe, Bruyette &Woods in New York expects the exuberance in Treasurys to be short-lived. ""I think we\'ve probably seen the bulk of the rally, and we\'ll be here for the next couple of weeks until we get the next payroll number,"" he said. The next Labor Department report on monthly nonfarm payrolls growth is slated for April 2. The Fed\'s patience on monetary policy comes despite continuing signs that the economy is growing in the 4%-to-4.5% range, which could eventually trigger price pressures, some investors believe. ""Longer term, we think that rates are fundamentally too low relative to the prospects for economic growth and the potential that we could see inflation pass through from higher commodity prices,"" said John Miller, portfolio manager at Nuveen Investments. Economic reports yesterday were mixed. The Commerce Department reported that housing starts fell by 4% to a seasonally adjusted 1.855 million annual rate in February, well below the 1% increase expected by economists. However, a retail-chain-store sales index from the International Council of Shopping Centers and UBS rose by 0.5% in the week ended March 13, compared with the week before, on a seasonally adjusted, same-store basis. At 4 p.m., the benchmark 10-year note was up 20/32 point, or $6.25 per $1,000 face value, at 102 18/32. Its yield fell to 3.689% from 3.762% Monday, as yields move inversely to prices. The 30-year bond\'s price was up 30/32 point at 111 2/32 to yield 4.650%, down from 4.706% Monday.   Corporate &Junk Bonds High-yield bonds fell around 1/2 point, and Tenet Healthcare Corp.\'s 7 3/8% bonds due 2013 fell one point to 86.5 bid after the company said it anticipates negative cash flow, renegotiations of credit facilities and a credit downgrade. Standard &Poor\'s and Moody\'s Investors Service recently cut Tenet\'s ratings. S&P rates its senior unsecured bonds single-B-minus, and Moody\'s rates them single-B3. Elsewhere, terms were revised for Nextel Communications Inc.\'s $500 million deal via Credit Suisse First Boston and J.P. Morgan. It initially had been priced at 97.243 with a 5.875% coupon to yield 6.25% -- terms that posed tax concerns, people familiar with the deal said.

277,1999-11-16,"[""WASHINGTON, Nov. 16 -- The Federal Reserve raised interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point today, saying that the combination of strong growth and low unemployment had left the economy vulnerable to an outbreak of inflation. It was the third time this year that the central bank had raised rates to check the economy's momentum, and the move clearly signaled that the Fed's growing faith in technology's ability to improve business efficiency and temper inflationary pressures has its limits. In explaining its action, the Fed emphasized a concern that Alan Greenspan, the central bank's chairman, has stressed repeatedly in recent months: that the nation is literally running out of workers and that, as it does so, wages and then prices will inevitably be pushed higher, endangering an economic expansion that is about to become the longest in the nation's history. The Fed said it was raising its federal funds target rate on overnight loans between banks to 5.5 percent from 5.25 percent; the move followed two other quarter-point increases this year, in June and August. Today's increase took back the last of three quarter-point reductions  made last year in response to the global financial crisis and returned the rate to its level 14 months ago. The central bank also removed its formal stance toward higher rates, moving to a neutral one that analysts said all but ruled out a rate increase at the next monetary policy meeting, which is scheduled for Dec. 21. The Dow Jones industrial average rose immediately after the Fed's announcement this afternoon, fell back, then surged again to finish at 10,932.33, up 171.58 points. [Page C1.] It was the highest level for the index in more than two months and suggested that investors see no more rate increases coming before the Fed's first meeting of 2000, a two-day session on Feb. 1 and 2. The central bank also said it would increase its largely symbolic discount rates on loans to financial institutions from the Federal Reserve system to 5 percent, from 4.75 percent. It was the second quarter-point increase in the rate this year after two quarter-point reductions last year. The increase in the Fed's official short-term rates quickly began to affect the rates paid by businesses and consumers. Banks started raising their prime lending rate by a quarter of a point, to 8.5 percent, a move that will lead to higher rates on credit card, automobile and other consumer loans. Rates set directly or indirectly in the bond market, like those for mortgage loans, also edged up. The Fed seemed to leave open the possibility that it could raise rates further next year if the economy keeps roaring along and unemployment keeps falling. But for investors, the good news was a hint from the Fed that it did not plan to raise rates again at least for the rest of this year. The central bank said the cumulative effect of its three rate increases this year ''should markedly diminish the risk of inflation going forward.'' The American economy has been growing steadily for more than eight and a half years, driving unemployment down to 4.1 percent last month -- the lowest level in nearly three decades -- while allowing workers to enjoy higher wage gains than they have in years. Yet there has been no solid evidence that inflation is building, casting doubt on traditional economic models that predict a trade-off between falling joblessness and rising wages and prices. Many economists have sought to explain the situation by asserting that huge investments by businesses in computers and other efficiency-enhancing technology are yielding substantial improvements in productivity, or hourly output by each worker. As productivity growth accelerates, it helps companies keep their costs under control even if wages rise, making it possible for them to maintain profit margins without increasing prices. Mr. Greenspan and other Fed officials have increasingly come to accept that recent gains in productivity are more than a temporary blip, and they have become optimistic in their public statements about the economy's resilience and long-term growth prospects. But in raising rates today -- at a time when the economy is already showing signs of slowing and price increases are well contained -- Mr. Greenspan showed that he was not ready to abandon the notion that low unemployment plus robust growth is a recipe for inflation. ''Although cost pressures appear generally contained, risks to sustainable growth persist,'' the Federal Open Market Committee said in a statement released soon after 2:15 p.m. ''Despite tentative evidence of slowing in certain interest-sensitive sectors of the economy and of accelerating productivity, the expansion of activity continues in excess of the economy's growth potential,'' the statement said. ''As a consequence, the pool of available workers willing to take jobs has been drawn down further in recent months, a trend that must eventually be contained if inflationary imbalances are to remain in check and economic expansion continue.'' Economists had been sharply divided before today's meeting about whether a rate increase would be justified, and the Fed's decision led some of them to assert that the central bank was failing to take account of the economy's improved capacity to grow without inflation. They said the Fed should have taken more time to let the previous two rate increases of this year slow the economy and ease pressure on labor markets. ''If this was a football game, I think I'd throw a yellow flag for piling on,'' said Martin Regalia, an economist at the United States Chamber of Commerce in Washington. Mr. Regalia said that while the Fed officials' ''rhetoric seems to have shifted to an acceptance of productivity gains, their actions are clearly more consistent with the traditional labor-market-tightness arguments.'' Other analysts said that the economy was continuing to grow faster than the 3 percent to 3.5 percent annual rate that is widely viewed as a ''speed limit'' beyond which inflation can start to take off. ''The Fed believes, as I do, that the economy's speed limit is higher than we thought it was a few years back, but that doesn't mean in any sense that the economy does not still have a speed limit,'' said Richard Berner, an economist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter in New York. With growth exceeding that limit and showing no clear signs of moderating, Mr. Berner said, ''the balance of inflation risks still lies to the side of higher rather than lower inflation.'' Even before today's statement suggesting that the Fed will be on hold for the rest of the year, analysts had expected the central bank to leave rates untouched for several months because of the uncertainty about how Year 2000 computer problems will affect the economy and the financial system. If nothing else, economists expect that it could be difficult for the Fed to draw conclusions about the economy's path during the next few months because statistics may be distorted by businesses' building extra inventory and consumers' holding more cash than they otherwise would. As a result, some analysts say the Fed may shy away from raising rates at its February meeting even if growth seems to remain strong. The question over the longer run is whether the economy will again defy predictions that it is about to slow, leading the Fed to consider further rate increases next year. The economy has been growing steadily since March 1991. In January, barring a collapse in the next six weeks, it will set a new milestone, breaking the record for the longest expansion in the nation's history, 8 years and 10 months, which was set during the 1960's. During the last several years growth has proved remarkably impervious both to shocks from the rest of the world and to higher interest rates at home, and seems to have drawn sustenance in particular from the boom in the stock market. Fed officials insist that they have not set out to push Wall Street lower, but they say they remain concerned that the market's buoyancy, even in the face of tighter monetary policy, is helping to keep consumer demand at a higher level than they are comfortable with.""]","[""washington, nov. 16 -- the federal reserve raised interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point today, saying that the combination of strong growth and low unemployment had left the economy vulnerable to an outbreak of inflation. it was the third time this year that the central bank had raised rates to check the economy's momentum, and the move clearly signaled that the fed's growing faith in technology's ability to improve business efficiency and temper inflationary pressures has its limits. in explaining its action, the fed emphasized a concern that alan greenspan, the central bank's chairman, has stressed repeatedly in recent months: that the nation is literally running out of workers and that, as it does so, wages and then prices will inevitably be pushed higher, endangering an economic expansion that is about to become the longest in the nation's history. the fed said it was raising its federal funds target rate on overnight loans between banks to 5.5 percent from 5.25 percent; the move followed two other quarter-point increases this year, in june and august. today's increase took back the last of three quarter-point reductions  made last year in response to the global financial crisis and returned the rate to its level 14 months ago. the central bank also removed its formal stance toward higher rates, moving to a neutral one that analysts said all but ruled out a rate increase at the next monetary policy meeting, which is scheduled for dec. 21. the dow jones industrial average rose immediately after the fed's announcement this afternoon, fell back, then surged again to finish at 10,932.33, up 171.58 points.

The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index continued to climb, soaring 73.51 points, or 2.3 percent, to 3,293.05, setting its 11th closing high in 13 trading sessions. The Nasdaq market shut down for about 20 minutes, because of system problems, crippling trading before the close. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index also set a closing high, its first in four months. It rose 25.64 points, or 1.8 percent, to 1,420.03, surpassing the high of 1,418.78 set July 16. The Fed raised two short-term interest rates to ensure that inflation remained dormant; the central bank also signaled that the increase might be the last for a while. The federal funds rate on overnight loans between banks was raised to 5.50 percent, from 5.25 percent, which returned it to the level it was before the Fed started a series of three rate cuts last year. The Fed also increased the discount rate on direct loans to banks to 5 percent, from 4.75 percent. Analysts had been almost evenly divided on whether the Federal Open Market Committee, the central bank's policy arm, would -- or should -- raise rates for the third time this year to calm inflationary pressures. ''Now we have symmetry: We had three tightenings; we had three easings,'' said Arthur Hogan, chief market analyst for Jefferies & Company. ''It's behind us, we can move on and start to focus on earnings-growth potential and I think that's a positive for the marketplace.'' The committee's next meeting is set for Dec. 21.

280,1997-02-05,"[""WASHINGTON, Feb. 5 -- The Federal Reserve voted today to leave interest rates unchanged, betting that a recent surge in economic growth will moderate and leave wage and price inflation under control. The decision continues a yearlong pattern in which the Fed has kept monetary policy on hold as the economy has accelerated, slowed and then accelerated again. The Fed's last move was on Jan. 31, 1996, when it reduced its Federal funds target rate, its overnight loan rate for banks, to 5.25 percent from 5.5 percent, and its discount rate for loans to financial institutions to 5 percent from 5.25 percent. Because the Fed's decision today not to raise rates had been widely anticipated for weeks in the financial markets, it was not a powerful enough dose of good news to stop a technology-led swoon in stock prices. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 86.58 points, to 6,746.90. Since last summer the Fed's official policy has been a ''bias'' toward  tightening, a way of signaling that it will raise rates at the first compelling evidence that inflation might be taking root. Economists said they expected that the Fed kept the policy in place today, although it would not disclose its decision until after the next meeting of its policy-making body on March 25. By keeping rates unchanged, the Fed is once again waiting for further evidence of whether growth will slow sufficiently to keep wages from spiking up and setting off an upward spiral in inflation. Despite the economy's torrid 4.7 percent growth rate in the fourth quarter, wage increases have remained muted and there is almost no sign of rising inflation. ''The inflation picture still looks pretty good to them,'' said Richard D. Rippe, the chief economist at Prudential Securities. ''At the same time they are concerned that if the economy stays strong we could move from a position where we're running near capacity to where we're hitting capacity or exceeding it and therefore getting more inflationary pressures down the road. So they need to see signs that growth is moderating.'' There are tentative signs that the economy was cooling off even before the end of last year. The Commerce Department reported today that the value of new orders to factories fell 1.3 percent in December, the second consecutive decline. The department said shipments of finished goods and inventories of completed products also declined. But economists and financial markets are now looking ahead to the next major economic indicator, the release on Friday of January figures on job growth and the unemployment rate. Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, said in recent Congressional testimony that he was watching closely to see whether an unusual period in which workers appeared to be trading job security for restrained wage increases was coming to an end. Economists remain divided over whether the Fed will have to raise rates at its next meeting in March, or at the following one in May, or perhaps not at all. ''The pressures are going to continue to build,'' said William Dudley, an economist with Goldman, Sachs & Company. ''The economy is going to continue to grow above trend. By March a tightening is more of an even proposition, and by May it's maybe likely.'' Economists at Merrill Lynch, however, said in a report today that they did not expect a rate increase anytime soon. They said they believed the economy created about 190,000 new jobs in January, a relatively strong performance, but that the underlying trend in coming months will be around 150,000 to 175,000 a month, a rate that it said would not threaten to reignite inflation. ''Given our growth, inflation and employment outlooks, we believe that the Fed will be able to remain on hold for longer than most probably believe,'' the report said. ''Nevertheless we expect the next Fed move, whenever it occurs, to be a tightening.'' The Fed also said today that it was changing the timing of its release of minutes from meetings of its policy- making Federal Open Market Committee. The Fed has been releasing the minutes of each meeting on the Friday after the subsequent meeting. It will now release the minutes on the Thursday after the subsequent meeting, and will move the release time up to 2 P.M. from 4:30 P.M.

281,2005-09-20,"[""WASHINGTON, Sept. 20 -- Saying that Hurricane Katrina was unlikely to pose a ''persistent threat'' to the economy, the Federal Reserve raised interest rates on Tuesday for the 11th time in a row and signaled that more increases were on the way.   In an unusually long statement, the central bank acknowledged that the hurricane's devastation was likely to cause higher energy prices, higher joblessness and greater uncertainty in the months ahead.   But it said the hurricane had not shaken its confidence about longer-term growth, and it left little doubt that its top priority was still to head off inflationary pressures.   The decision lifted the federal funds rate on overnight loans between banks by a quarter-point, to 3.75 percent, the 11th rate increase since the central bank began raising rates in June 2004.   ''The widespread devastation in the gulf region, the associated dislocation of economic activity and the boost to energy prices imply that spending, production and employment will be set back in the near term,'' the central bank's Federal Open Market Committee said in a statement.   But it continued: ''While these unfortunate developments have increased uncertainty about the near-term economic performance, it is the committee's view that they do not pose a more persistent threat.''   In an important hint about its desire to keep raising rates for a while longer, the central bank repeated its long-held expectation that ''policy accommodation'' -- meaning low interest rates -- could be reversed at a ''measured'' pace.   In response, the stock market fell yesterday. The Dow Jones industrial average went down 76.11 points, to 10,481.52; the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 0.8 percent.   In a rare departure from the Fed's normal unity, one member of the policy committee, Mark W. Olson, voted against the rate increase.   It was the first dissent since June 2003, and a sign that Tuesday's decision was unusually difficult.   But it did not necessarily portend a serious rift within the Fed. Mr. Olson, a commercial banker by profession, has focused primarily on bank regulation and has rarely taken strong stands on macroeconomic policy.   Edward McKelvey, a senior economist at Goldman Sachs, said policy makers were taking a much harder line about inflation than investors had been assuming.   ''In our view, the financial markets are much too complacent about what a decision to keep tightening means at this juncture,'' Mr. McKelvey wrote before the Fed decision came out. ''If under these circumstances the F.O.M.C. is prepared to keep going, then this means that the committee is more worried about the longer-term risk of higher inflation than the shorter-term risk of a collapse in growth.''   In the first two weeks after Hurricane Katrina, many Wall Street analysts speculated that the Fed would either pause in raising rates or signal that the process would end fairly soon.   Historically, the central bank has taken a dim view of changing policy in response to a natural disaster, even a big one. Fed officials, and many economists, contend that the economic impact of such calamities is usually local and usually temporary.   The normal pattern is for the economy to slow and for unemployment to rise in the immediate aftermath. But any slowdown is usually followed by an even bigger jump in economic activity as rebuilding begins.   The big uncertainty this month is whether Hurricane Katrina, which disabled major oil refineries and offshore drilling platforms, will cause a more enduring downturn.   But the Fed, which has been raising the cost of borrowing since June 2004, showed little appetite for a ''wait and see'' approach.   It noted that the economy had been expanding ''at a good pace'' before the hurricane. It also noted that ''higher energy prices and other costs have the potential to add to inflation pressures.''   Most important, it repeated phrases suggesting that money remains too cheap for comfort. It said the prospects for inflation and growth are ''roughly equal.'' It implied that monetary policy is still ''accommodative,'' meaning that interest rates are not yet back to a ''neutral'' level that allows growth without inflation. And it repeated its expectation about raising rates at a ''pace that is likely to be measured.''   Ethan Harris, chief United States economist at Lehman Brothers, said that neither the hurricane nor the surge in oil prices constituted a good reason to relax monetary policy.   Both the hurricane damage and higher energy prices amount to a ''supply shock'' that leads to higher costs. By keeping interest rates low, the Fed would be stoking consumer demand and possibly driving prices up even higher.   ''There's not really anything you can do about a supply shock, other than repair the damage,'' Mr. Harris said. ''As a policy maker you have to be very careful about putting a lot of stimulus into the economy at a time when capacity has been impaired.''   Analysts continue to debate among themselves about how much more the Fed will raise rates. Most now predict that it will raise them a quarter-point at each of its two remaining meetings this year, in October and December, which would take the federal funds rate to 4.25 percent.   In its statement, the Fed conceded that inflation remains mild and that higher energy prices have yet to drive other prices higher.   But Fed officials are increasingly concerned that low interest rates have fueled too much speculation in housing and too much complacency among investors toward risk.

282,2005-09-20,"[""Following is the text of a statement released by the Federal Reserve yesterday after the Fed's monetary policy panel, the Federal Open Market Committee, decided to raise its benchmark interest rates a quarter-point:   The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to raise its target for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 3 3/4 percent.   Output appeared poised to continue growing at a good pace before the tragic toll of Hurricane Katrina. The widespread devastation in the gulf region, the associated dislocation of economic activity and the boost to energy prices imply that spending, production and employment will be set back in the near term. In addition to elevating premiums for some energy products, the disruption to the production and refining infrastructure may add to energy price volatility.   While these unfortunate developments have increased uncertainty about near-term economic performance, it is the committee's view that they do not pose a more persistent threat. Rather, monetary policy accommodation, coupled with robust underlying growth in productivity, is providing ongoing support to economic activity. Higher energy and other costs have the potential to add to inflation pressures. However, core inflation has been relatively low in recent months and longer-term inflation expectations remain contained.   The committee perceives that, with appropriate monetary policy action, the upside and downside risks to the attainment of both sustainable growth and price stability should be kept roughly equal. With underlying inflation expected to be contained, the committee believes that policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that is likely to be measured.

""they're buying into the fed statement, which is that inflation is well contained,"" said steve rodosky, a treasury portfolio manager at pacific investment management co., or pimco. responding to the rate increase, most major banks yesterday raised their prime rate one-quarter point, to 6.75%. the standard &poor's 500-stock index fell 0.79%, or 9.68 points, to 1221.34, still up 0.8% this year. the nasdaq composite index fell 0.65%, or 13.93 points, to 2131.33, down 2% on the year. outside the u.s., stocks rose in dollar terms, including a surge in japanese stocks to their highest close since june 2001. the dow jones world stock index, excluding u.s. stocks, advanced 0.62%, or 1.16 points, to 187.25. including u.s. stocks, the index fell slightly, down 0.06%, or 0.14 point, to 225.01. in major u.s. market action: stocks retreated. on the new york stock exchange, where 1.72 billion shares traded, 1,031 stocks rose and 2,259 fell. bond prices were mixed. the 10-year treasury note fell 2/32, or 62.50 cents for each $1,000 invested, pushing the yield up to 4.255%. the 30-year bond was up 11/32 to yield 4.529%. the dollar strengthened. late in new york, the currency traded at 111.91 yen, up from 111.48 yen, while the euro fell against the dollar to $1.2127 from $1.2151.   license this article from dow jones reprint service']",28.0,,,,,,,,,1

285,2005-09-20,"['The Federal Reserve\'s decision to stay on a steady course of interest-rate increases answered a key question for the bond market: Hurricane Katrina will not derail this tightening cycle. The Fed\'s 11th consecutive quarter-point interest-rate increase put the monetary-policy-sensitive two-year Treasury note under mild pressure and supported government bonds with longer maturity dates, which are most vulnerable to inflation. By extension, the Fed\'s statement that it may continue to raise interest rates at a ""measured"" pace gave renewed appeal to a flatter yield curve, whereby yields on shorter-dated maturities rise faster than those on long-dated peers. Noting elevated energy prices, the Federal Open Market Committee voted 9 to 1 to lift its target on the key federal-funds rate a quarter percentage point to 3.75% in a widely anticipated move that put the rate at its highest level in more than four years. Fed Governor Mark Olson dissented, advocating no change in the federal-funds target at this meeting. ""The Fed is giving no indication they are close to finishing their rate-hike cycle,"" said Dominic Konstam, head of interest-rate strategy at Credit Suisse First Boston in New York. ""They clearly want to get ahead of inflation risks and it makes 4.25% a likely year-end level for the [federal] funds rate."" Interest-rate-futures contracts forecast a 4% federal-funds rate for the end of the year. Meanwhile, a Dow Jones Newswires/CNBC survey of primary dealers -- banks that deal directly with the Fed -- found a strong majority looking for the nudge to 4% at the FOMC\'s next meeting Nov. 1, with the short-term rate expected to reach 4.25% in December. Mr. Konstam said the selling pressure in Treasurys, led by the two-year note, was an understandable reaction. ""The yield curve is flattening and that should continue as the Fed keeps raising rates."" After Hurricane Katrina sparked widespread damage across three states, some market participants expected the Fed might hold rates steady, or at least indicate it was prepared to do so. The Fed acknowledged the risks from the hurricane, but in a key statement, it suggested the unfortunate developments and disruption in energy markets ""do not pose a more persistent threat,"" to growth. Indeed, the jump in energy prices because of Katrina was the focus of the FOMC\'s concerns. Although policy makers said ""core inflation has been relatively low in recent months and longer-term inflation expectations remain contained,"" they cautioned ""higher energy and other costs have the potential to add to inflation pressures."" With those words, the Fed helped breathe life into the flattening of the yield curve, which had succumbed in Katrina\'s wake to a steepening trend. In late trade, the spread between the yields of two- and 10-year notes had narrowed to 0.26 from 0.32 percentage points before the Fed decision. Further flattening of the curve is expected to be propelled by a rising two-year yield and a steady 10-year yield. ""As long as the Fed is viewed as being more concerned with inflation than with growth, the 10-year should remain in a 4% to 4.38% range,"" said Andy Brenner, head of institutional fixed income at Investec in New York. ""This will force in more buying over the rest of the month"" for the 10-year, he added. Treasury Bonds At 4 p.m., the benchmark 10-year note was down 2/32 point, or $0.625 per $1,000 face value, at 99 31/32. Its yield rose to 4.255% from 4.25% Monday.

Many economists are predicting a Federal Reserve rate increase in 2010, and the central bank is considering how to take cash out of circulation. In addition, government support programs for the funds and the assets that they buy, put in place after the Reserve Primary Fund dipped below its $1 net asset value and sparked panic in the industry, are starting to unwind. That combination may bring slightly higher yields, which would be a welcome break for fund companies that have been waiving fees on their funds to maintain investors. ""These rays of hope may just be enough to give you courage,"" said Peter Crane, president of Crane Data LLC, of struggling money-market fund providers. ""It could make you walk a couple more miles in the desert, but you need that Fed-hike oasis to really survive."" Fed watchers had waited Wednesday for a change, even a subtle one, in the central bank\'s commitment to keep borrowing costs at record lows for ""an extended period."" Even though the Fed didn\'t remove the word ""extended"" from its new statement, Mr. Crane saw signs of hope in the Fed\'s expanded discussion of the economy. He noted, too, that the Fed said economic conditions are likely to warrant ""exceptionally low levels"" of the federal-funds rate for an extended period. ""They didn\'t say an \'exceptionally low level,\'"" which could possibly indicate room for some change, he said. Mr. Crane believes one of the most important moves the Fed could make to affect rates is to engage in reverse repurchase agreements to drain liquidity from the financial system. The Fed last month said it was testing the use of these ""reverse repos,"" in which it sells securities to market participants with a commitment to buy them back at a higher price. In a statement Tuesday, Debbie Cunningham, chief investment officer for taxable money markets at Federated Investors, said some Federal Open Market Committee members seem to be hedging on their pledge to keep benchmark rates exceptionally low for an extended period. Ms. Cunningham said she expects the Fed ""in the near future"" to begin conducting reverse repos with nontraditional market participants, possibly including money-market funds. She wasn\'t available for comment after the Fed\'s statement Wednesday. Barry Benjamin, U.S. leader of PricewaterhouseCoopers\'s Investment Management and Real Estate Industry Group, said it is important to determine whether money-market funds will be able to continue with stable $1 net asset values. To sustain that, some system of support is needed to handle any possible run on money-market funds, he said. Discussions about an industry-sponsored liquidity bank are still under way. ""As the government programs are wound down, what\'s going to replace them?"" Mr. Benjamin asked.

289,2009-11-04,"[""The Dow Jones industrial average erased almost all of a 156-point rally after the House of Representatives passed a bill to curb rate increases on credit cards, touching off concern about bank earnings. The news outweighed investor optimism after the Federal Reserve said it planned to keep interest rates at a record low. ''Businesses are still cutting back on fixed investment and staffing, though at a slower pace,'' the Federal Open Market Committee said in a statement on Wednesday after meeting in Washington. ''Activity in the housing sector has increased over recent months.'' Gold surged, settling at $1,092.20 an ounce, after the Fed announcement. The dollar, meanwhile, slipped as much as 1 percent against a basket of six currencies. This year, gold has soared 24 percent, heading for a ninth annual gain, as the dollar fell 6.8 percent. Gold has climbed on speculation that central banks and investors will buy more metal to hedge against a falling dollar. India's central bank said this week that it bought 200 metric tons of gold from the International Monetary Fund last month. ''With interest rates so low, money is seeking markets that have an upside,'' said Leonard Kaplan, the president of Prospector Asset Management in Evanston, Ill. ''Momentum is crucial, and gold has a lot of momentum.'' The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index wiped out most of a 1.5 percent rally that began after the Fed said it would leave interest rates at ''exceptionally low'' levels for an extended period. ''If you're going to limit how much banks could charge in their credit cards, that's going to limit profits,'' said Art Hogan, the chief market analyst at Jefferies & Company. ''So it's certainly another source of pressure.'' At the end of the day, the S.& P. 500 added 0.1 percent, or 1.09 points, to 1,046.5. The Dow increased 30.23 points, or 0.3 percent, to 9,802.14. About five stocks fell for every four that rose on the New York Stock Exchange. Wells Fargo, JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup led financial shares to the steepest loss among 10 industries. The House legislation would move up the start date of many rule changes that will make it more difficult for banks to increase rates on credit cards. The S.& P. 500 rallied in morning trading after the Institute for Supply Management's report on nonmanufacturing businesses showed 1.4 percent growth in new orders and a 2 percent increase in the backlog of orders. The main index in the report fell to 50.6, below analysts' estimates but still signaling growth. Some traders may have sold shares in anticipation of the Friday report on the job market in the United States.

290,2002-08-13,"[""NEW YORK -- Taking its cue from retreating stocks, the dollar slipped against its major rivals in the wake of a widely watched Federal Reserve policy meeting that left interest rates unchanged but paved the way for easing monetary policy again. Late yesterday in New York, the dollar was trading around its session lows, at 118.88 yen, off its high of 119.25 yen just after the FOMC statement was released and down from 119.08 yen late Monday in New York. The euro was trading at 98.17 cents, again up from around 97.90 cents just after the FOMC meeting, and well up from 97.86 cents late Monday.

Moody's Investors Service cut Brazil's country ceiling for foreign-currency bonds and notes to single-B-2 from single-B-1, and the country ceiling for foreign-currency bank deposits to single-B-3 from single-B-2.

291,2002-08-13,"['Markets had to absorb a welter of news yesterday. President Bush held his Waco gabfest, with Treasury Secretary Paul O\'Neill remarking afterward about the participants\' ""passion."" The Federal Open Market Committee refrained from cutting its target interest rates, but changed what Fed-watchers call its ""bias,"" hinting that it may cut rates further in the future. Last and probably least, companies are stirring themselves to vouch for their earnings to meet today\'s deadline established by the SEC. The net verdict was, down 206 points on the Dow Industrials.

President Bush came out for restraint on government spending, saying he would not release $5.1 billion in counter-terrorism funds because Congress lumped in unrelated pork. Maybe he can even manage to veto something or other. Which brings us to the certification circus. Embattled SEC Chairman Harvey Pitt decided that because some CEOs did wrong, all must be patted down and made to take an oath that they are not currently committing fraud. August 14 is the day when CEOs at the biggest 947 companies are supposed to ""certify"" that their financial results are correct or to explain why they can\'t. Most executives already had assumed they were vouching for something when their companies issued their quarterly reports and seem appropriately mystified by the demand for an additional ""certification."" Sun\'s Scott McNealy briefly threatened to call the agency\'s bluff until his PR handlers calmed him down. In the past week the trickle of certifications has become a flood, as executives from J.P. Morgan Chase, Foot Locker, Kellogg and others have filed. In each case, CEOs swallowed hard and submitted to the SEC\'s self-administered lie detector test. This was supposed to ""reassure"" the markets, which yawned, or yesterday, swooned. Throughout it all, indeed, you have to give credit to the stock market, which unlike Mr. Pitt or the media, has behaved as if distinctions are worth making. Enron\'s stock price dropped precipitously for months before the press began asking intelligent questions about Enron\'s accounting. WorldCom had fallen from $65 to less than $1 before accounting fraud was even whispered. The certifications will no doubt provide ammunition for class-action lawyers, who are in the habit of suing companies whose share prices fall regardless of whether any management misbehavior was involved. But, then, creating new opportunities to sue has been the practical thrust of all the ""reforms"" that have made it out of a Senate controlled by Tom Daschle Democrats. In the meantime, we suspect that the market has already gotten over any systemic ""crisis of confidence"" in accounting and returned to worries about whether the folks in Washington know how to keep our nascent recovery going. In this respect, we\'d like to offer one post-Waco suggestion. To wit, that President Bush convene a more workable forum and think seriously about economic policy. We\'d suggest he lock himself in a room with Larry Lindsey from the White House, Glenn Hubbard from the Council of Economic Advisers and John Taylor from the Treasury. Then he could reach out to Stanford University to add Michael Boskin, John Cogan and Martin Anderson. In case you\'re wondering, this is not our list. It was the economic brain trust announced back during the last presidential campaign by candidate George W. Bush.

292,2002-08-13,"['NEW YORK -- Prices of U.S. Treasury securities rallied, pushing yields toward historical lows, after Federal Reserve policy makers left rates unchanged but acknowledged  the downside risks to the economy are outweighing its potential upside. The rally pushed the yield on the benchmark 10-year note to its lowest level in 39 years. Treasury securities had been mostly higher before the decision, with long-dated securities outpacing shorter-dated issues. That trend quickly reversed after the Fed\'s decision, as short-dated Treasurys benefited most from the Fed\'s acknowledgment it might need to cut interest rates if economic weakness persists. At 4 p.m., the benchmark 10-year note was up 1 2/32 point, or $10.63 per $1,000 face value, at 102 13/32. Its yield fell to 4.083% from 4.207% late Monday, as yields move inversely to prices. The 30-year bond\'s price was up 1 18/32 point at 106 5/32 to yield 4.973%, down from 5.070% on Monday. Late in the session, a large drop in major stock indexes helped bolster the rally in Treasurys. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended down 206.50 points at 8482.39, while the Nasdaq Composite Index was down 37.56 at 1269.28. The policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee voted to leave the key federal-funds rate unchanged at 1.75%, a 41-year low. But the panel altered its assessment of the economic outlook, saying risks to the economy no longer are ""balanced."" The risk of too-slow economic growth is again greater than the risk of higher inflation, the committee said. The language implied the Fed is prepared to cut interest rates, possibly as early as Sept. 24. ""The softening in the growth of aggregate demand that emerged this spring has been prolonged in large measure by weakness in financial markets and heightened uncertainty related to problems in corporate reporting and governance,"" the FOMC said, after a unanimous vote. That prospect ""makes it very difficult for anyone to be underweight Treasurys at this point,"" said Sadakichi Robbins, head of global fixed-income trading at Bank Julius Baer in New York. Still, that doesn\'t mean that investors will remain nervous about owning Treasurys near historically low yields. ""People look at absolute yield levels and say that it\'s scary, but we are in an atypical situation here, with renewed economic risks, global event risk, mortgage prepayments, and a poor functioning of the corporate bond market,"" Mr. Robbins said. Following the Fed\'s announcement, Treasurys quickly reversed much of the curve-flattening trend -- in which investors had been favoring long-dated securities -- that has marked the past several sessions. Instead, investors piled into short-dated Treasurys since they stand to benefit most if economic conditions warrant another rate cut. Besides the economy, market-watchers will also look for how the corporate-bond market fares. In recent weeks, the corporate-bond market has become increasingly illiquid as many investors avoided all but the safest credits. If the Fed\'s implied willingness to act on further problems in the bond market does indeed calm some nerves, it might help to mitigate the so-called credit squeeze that has been going on. In the short term, however, some said the change in the Fed\'s bias toward lower growth might alarm markets, since it suggests the Fed\'s economic outlook has worsened since Chairman Alan Greenspan offered a cautiously upbeat assessment of the economy in congressional testimony in mid-July and other central bank officials echoed that sentiment. Prices of long-dated Treasurys had been higher early in yesterday\'s session, when a particularly weak economic report in Germany sent U.S. and European investors flocking toward the safety of U.S. government securities.  Corporate Bonds The Fed\'s action had little effect on the corporate-bond market since it was widely expected, market participants said. Instead, the market was more affected by movements in equities and concerns about particular sectors, he said. One of those sectors was telecommunications where SBC Communications had its Aa3 senior unsecured long-term credit rating placed on review for possible downgrade yesterday by Moody\'s Investors Service. The announcement wasn\'t unexpected after Moody\'s last week said it was re-examining the Regional Bell Operating Companies, or RBOCs, on a number of industrywide pressures. Concerns include growth of wireless communications, unfavorable regulatory pricing policies and cable providers\' broadband success. --- Christine Richard contributed to this article.']","['new york -- prices of u.s. treasury securities rallied, pushing yields toward historical lows, after federal reserve policy makers left rates unchanged but acknowledged  the downside risks to the economy are outweighing its potential upside. the rally pushed the yield on the benchmark 10-year note to its lowest level in 39 years. treasury securities had been mostly higher before the decision, with long-dated securities outpacing shorter-dated issues. that trend quickly reversed after the fed's decision, as short-dated treasurys benefited most from the fed's acknowledgment it might need to cut interest rates if economic weakness persists. at 4 p.m., the benchmark 10-year note was up 1 2/32 point, or $10.63 per $1,000 face value, at 102 13/32. its yield fell to 4.083% from 4.207% late monday, as yields move inversely to prices. the 30-year bond's price was up 1 18/32 point at 106 5/32 to yield 4.973%, down from 5.070% on monday. late in the session, a large drop in major stock indexes helped bolster the rally in treasurys. the dow jones industrial average ended down 206.50 points at 8482.39, while the nasdaq composite index was down 37.56 at 1269.28. the policy-setting federal open market committee voted to leave the key federal-funds rate unchanged at 1.75%, a 41-year low. but the panel altered its assessment of the economic outlook, saying risks to the economy no longer are ""balanced."" the risk of too-slow economic growth is again greater than the risk of higher inflation, the committee said. the language implied the fed is prepared to cut interest rates, possibly as early as sept. 24.

294,1996-12-17,"[""WASHINGTON, Dec. 17 -- The Federal Reserve voted today to leave interest rates unchanged, concluding that inflation remained dormant despite sporadic surges in economic activity. The Fed's decision had been widely anticipated among economists and in the financial markets. The Fed has not raised or lowered rates since January, and analysts said monetary policy was likely to remain unchanged well into 1997 because the economy had shown few signs of deviating from its course of moderate growth with low inflation, even though unemployment is low and other economic indicators occasionally send warning signals. Indeed, just before the central bank's Federal Open Market Committee began meeting to consider interest rate policy today, the Commerce Department reported that construction of housing jumped sharply higher last month, suggesting that the economic growth could be picking up again in the fourth quarter after cooling down substantially over the summer. Driven in part by a decline in mortgage rates, housing starts rose 9.2 percent in November, the biggest monthly jump since July 1995, the department said. The increase, which put housing starts at an annual rate of 1.514 million units, wiped out nearly all of a decline in new housing activity recorded in September and October. Starts were 20.8 percent higher in the Midwest and 12 percent higher in the South, but flat in the West and down 2.2 percent in the Northeast. The housing report unsettled the bond market, which saw the pickup in construction as possibly presaging inflation. With bond prices falling, the yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond rose to 6.65 percent from 6.62 percent in late trading. Despite the weakness in the bond market, stocks had a more positive day. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 39.98 points, to 6,308.33. While economists had discerned nothing in the economic fundamentals to justify a rate increase by the Fed, investors had been keeping a close watch on today's policy meeting anyway because of comments about stock prices made earlier this month by Alan Greenspan, the central bank's chairman. Mr. Greenspan had questioned whether the steep rise in the stock market was a result of ''irrational exuberance.'' Some analysts had seen the comments by Mr. Greenspan as a warning that he might raise rates, if not immediately then in the long run, to deflate stock prices. The Fed, as usual, gave no explanation of its decision today. A synopsis of its deliberations will be released after its next monetary policy meeting, which will be held Feb. 4 and 5. The Fed's last move was to cut rates by a quarter of a percentage point in January, leaving the Federal funds target rate for overnight bank lending at 5.25 percent and the discount rate for short-term Fed loans to banks at 5 percent. Since then the economy has alternately slowed and accelerated, albeit within a relatively narrow range, leaving both Fed officials and the markets off balance and making the search for clues to incipient inflation that much more difficult. Although some economists believe the economy will slow enough next year that the Fed will feel compelled to reduce rates again to stimulate more growth, the predominant opinion among Fed watchers is that the next move in interest rates, whenever it comes, will be up. ''While we expect inflation to remain low, the risk of rising inflation far outweighs the risk of deflation,''  Bruce Steinberg, an economist with Merrill Lynch & Company, said. The statistics on housing starts were the latest to indicate that the economy was again picking up momentum. On Monday, the Fed said that industrial output in November increased nine-tenths of 1 percent, its sharpest rise in nine months, and that the capacity utilization rate edged up four-tenths of 1 percent, to 83.3 percent. Economists consider an 85 percent capacity utilization rate the point at which factories have trouble keeping up with orders, causing bottlenecks that can set off an upward inflationary spiral. But analysts said the housing numbers were so strong that they probably represented a brief rebound in construction from a temporary downturn in the previous two months. Another indicator of housing construction, the number of building permits issued, rose a more moderate 3.9 percent in November. ''We don't expect a rise in starts activity at that level again next month,'' said Paul Taylor, an economist at America's Community Bankers, the trade group for savings and loan institutions. 04:40 EST December 18, 1996""]","[""washington, dec. 17 -- the federal reserve voted today to leave interest rates unchanged, concluding that inflation remained dormant despite sporadic surges in economic activity. the fed's decision had been widely anticipated among economists and in the financial markets. the fed has not raised or lowered rates since january, and analysts said monetary policy was likely to remain unchanged well into 1997 because the economy had shown few signs of deviating from its course of moderate growth with low inflation, even though unemployment is low and other economic indicators occasionally send warning signals. indeed, just before the central bank's federal open market committee began meeting to consider interest rate policy today, the commerce department reported that construction of housing jumped sharply higher last month, suggesting that the economic growth could be picking up again in the fourth quarter after cooling down substantially over the summer. driven in part by a decline in mortgage rates, housing starts rose 9.2 percent in november, the biggest monthly jump since july 1995, the department said. the increase, which put housing starts at an annual rate of 1.514 million units, wiped out nearly all of a decline in new housing activity recorded in september and october. starts were 20.8 percent higher in the midwest and 12 percent higher in the south, but flat in the west and down 2.2 percent in the northeast. the housing report unsettled the bond market, which saw the pickup in construction as possibly presaging inflation. with bond prices falling, the yield on the benchmark 30-year treasury bond rose to 6.65 percent from 6.62 percent in late trading. despite the weakness in the bond market, stocks had a more positive day. the dow jones industrial average rose 39.98 points, to 6,308.33. while economists had discerned nothing in the economic fundamentals to justify a rate increase by the fed, investors had been keeping a close watch on today's policy meeting anyway because of comments about stock prices made earlier this month by alan greenspan, the central bank's chairman. mr. greenspan had questioned whether the steep rise in the stock market was a result of ''irrational exuberance.'' some analysts had seen the comments by mr. greenspan as a warning that he might raise rates, if not immediately then in the long run, to deflate stock prices. the fed, as usual, gave no explanation of its decision today. a synopsis of its deliberations will be released after its next monetary policy meeting, which will be held feb. 4 and 5. the fed's last move was to cut rates by a quarter of a percentage point in january, leaving the federal funds target rate for overnight bank lending at 5.25 percent and the discount rate for short-term fed loans to banks at 5 percent. since then the economy has alternately slowed and accelerated, albeit within a relatively narrow range, leaving both fed officials and the markets off balance and making the search for clues to incipient inflation that much more difficult. although some economists believe the economy will slow enough next year that the fed will feel compelled to reduce rates again to stimulate more growth, the predominant opinion among fed watchers is that the next move in interest rates, whenever it comes, will be up. ''while we expect inflation to remain low, the risk of rising inflation far outweighs the risk of deflation,''  bruce steinberg, an economist with merrill lynch & company, said. the statistics on housing starts were the latest to indicate that the economy was again picking up momentum. on monday, the fed said that industrial output in november increased nine-tenths of 1 percent, its sharpest rise in nine months, and that the capacity utilization rate edged up four-tenths of 1 percent, to 83.3 percent. economists consider an 85 percent capacity utilization rate the point at which factories have trouble keeping up with orders, causing bottlenecks that can set off an upward inflationary spiral. but analysts said the housing numbers were so strong that they probably represented a brief rebound in construction from a temporary downturn in the previous two months. another indicator of housing construction, the number of building permits issued, rose a more moderate 3.9 percent in november. ''we don't expect a rise in starts activity at that level again next month,'' said paul taylor, an economist at america's community bankers, the trade group for savings and loan institutions. 04:40 est december 18, 1996""]",30.0,,,,,,,,,1
295,2006-12-12,"['WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve signaled that while the economy looks a bit weaker than a month ago, its forecast and concerns about inflation are unchanged, and thus interest rates are still more likely to rise than fall. The Fed yesterday left its short-term interest rate at 5.25%, where it has stood since late June. In the statement accompanying its decisions, the Fed downgraded its assessment of the housing market and acknowledged ""mixed"" signals on growth. But its forecast of moderate growth is unchanged. Inflation remains its principal focus, and it still says its choice is whether to raise rates -- not to lower them. Bond yields declined and stocks retraced most of their early losses as investors interpreted the statement as a concession by the Fed to markets\' gloomier forecast of growth and more sanguine outlook on inflation. That, however, might turn out to be an overreaction. Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke has emphasized that rate actions depend on where the Fed thinks the economy and inflation will be in the future, not where they are today. And that hasn\'t changed. The Fed said that ""growth has slowed . . . partly reflecting a substantial cooling of the housing market."" Its last statement, in October, didn\'t include the word ""substantial."" ""Although recent indicators have been mixed, the economy seems likely to expand at a moderate pace on balance over coming quarters,"" it said. Inflation remains ""elevated,"" and though expected to moderate, ""inflation risks remain."" Whether rates rise again will depend on new data, it said, in words identical to those used in October. ""The very fact that not even a comma was altered in the discussion of inflation and the outlook for policy should be taken as a strong sign that the Fed does not see \'recent indicators\' as altering their fundamental outlook for the economy,"" said Michael Feroli, economist at J.P. Morgan Chase &Co., in a note to clients. The Fed and the markets have starkly different views of the path of interest rates, with the former maintaining a bias to raise them and the latter anticipating cuts of half to three-quarters of a percentage point in the coming year. Yesterday\'s statement did little to close the divide. Indeed, investors raised the probability of rate cuts a bit. David Greenlaw, an economist at Morgan Stanley, said markets were reacting to ""the insertion of the word \'substantial\' to describe the cooling in the housing market,"" but he argued this was off the mark, as it was a backward-looking description. Indeed, the Fed for some months has expected housing to be a sizable drag on the economy. Its statement first acknowledged a ""gradual cooling"" in August, and since then, reported housing starts have fallen 19%. In early October, Mr. Bernanke said housing was undergoing a ""substantial correction."" The insertion of ""substantial"" in yesterday\'s statement was mostly an acknowledgment that the housing correction has advanced. Fed officials consider the decline in construction necessary to clear inventories of unsold homes. That said, they acknowledge housing remains a risk factor: Sales of homes are still falling, albeit more slowly, and eroding house prices could yet damp consumer spending more broadly. Ten of the 11 voting members of the Federal Open Market Committee voted to keep the target for the federal-funds rate, charged on overnight loans between banks. For the fourth-consecutive meeting, Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond President Jeffrey Lacker dissented, favoring a quarter-percentage-point increase. Mr. Lacker won\'t be a voting FOMC member next year. One seat on the committee is vacant. Laurence Meyer, vice chairman of Macroeconomic Advisers, says the divide between the markets and the Fed is likely to be resolved one month at a time. If the data continue to support the Fed\'s stance, the Fed\'s language will remain the same, and markets will adjust their expectations as each Fed meeting approaches. Richard DeKaser, chief economist at National City Corp. in Cleveland, predicted the Fed would stay on hold through all of next year. He attributed recent weakness in manufacturing to firms reacting to a buildup of inventories. Businesses are ""not hunkering down and playing defense,"" he said, adding that his bank continues to see healthy loan demand from businesses.

298,1999-05-18,"['WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve decided to leave benchmark interest rates unchanged, but said it is so ""concerned about the potential for a buildup of inflationary imbalances"" that it is leaning toward raising rates in the coming months for the first time in nearly a year. Although inflation remains ""generally . . . quite subdued,"" the Fed said in a 134-word statement, ""domestic financial markets have recovered and foreign economic prospects have improved"" since it slashed rates by three-quarters of a percentage point last fall. It also suggested that demand in the U.S. economy is growing faster than the economy\'s ability to supply goods and services, despite gains in productivity. The Fed\'s decision to adopt an end-ofmeeting statement, or directive, that says a rate increase is more likely than a rate cut doesn\'t mean that higher rates are a certainty. Rather, it is a clear statement that Fed officials at this moment see a much greater risk of accelerating inflation than of a worrisome slowdown in the economy. In March 1998, for instance, the Fed adopted a directive that said it was leaning toward higher rates. But after Russia\'s default and devaluation shook global financial markets in August of that year, the Fed actually ended up cutting rates. According to a tally by economists at Goldman, Sachs & Co., the Fed under Chairman Alan Greenspan has ended 29 of its policy meetings with a bias toward higher rates. In half the cases, rates were lifted within six months, and in the other half rates weren\'t. Financial markets reacted negatively to the news. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which had been up nearly 70 points before the 2:15 p.m. Eastern time announcement, quickly reversed course and ended the day down 16.52 points at 10836.95. Treasury bonds, which also had been higher during the day, fell after the announcement and ended the day little changed. The yield on 30-year Treasury bonds was 5.88%. The reaction might have been sharper if not for a May 6 speech by Mr. Greenspan and last Friday\'s unanticipated uptick in consumer prices, both of which led many Fed watchers to predict yesterday\'s outcome. The decision leaves the Fed\'s target for the federal funds interest rate at 4.75%, the level at which it has been since November. The Fed manipulates the fed-funds rate, at which banks lend to each other overnight, by buying and selling government securities. The Fed yesterday left unchanged the discount rate, at which it lends directly to banks. The Fed\'s policy-making Federal Open Market Committee traditionally ends each session with a statement on where it believes rates are headed in the weeks ahead. In the past, the statement was supposed to be kept confidential for six weeks, although the press sometimes reported it earlier and Fed officials sometimes gave away the secret in speeches. But the Fed has moved slowly toward more openness. In 1994, it began announcing changes in its target for the fed-funds rate, but it offered explanations only when changing the target. Then in February, it said it would reveal the directive and explain its thinking ""when it wanted to communicate to the public a major shift in its views about the balance of risks or the likely direction of policy."" Yesterday\'s statement was the first use of that new tool. When they met in early February, according to a summary of the meeting released subsequently, some Fed officials were already prepared to undo some of the rate cuts implemented last fall amid turmoil in the global economy and financial markets. Since then, the economy has proved much stronger than expected, the stock market has continued to climb and foreign economies have improved. Except for one month of bad consumer-price numbers, tangible signs of inflation have yet to emerge. Yet the much-forecast slowing of U.S. economic growth has yet to arrive, causing concern at the Fed that the inflationary good luck may be running out. The Fed statement is a sign that, with the jobless rate already at a 29-year low, FOMC members won\'t wait forever for the slowdown to materialize. The decision to hold rates steady for now, and the statement\'s reference to the possible need for action in the ""coming months,"" suggests the Fed is willing to wait a little while longer, though. ""Against the background of alreadytight domestic labor markets and ongoing strength in demand in excess of productivity gains,"" the Fed statement said, ""the Committee recognizes the need to be alert to developments over coming months that might indicate that financial conditions may no longer be consistent with containing inflation."" Richard Berner, chief U.S. economist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Co., said the statement is the first step toward tighter monetary policy. ""The basic point is that the inflation risks, while relatively small, are rising. Last fall\'s easing was put in place as we witnessed a drying up of liquidity in domestic financial markets and prospects for the global economy were deteriorating."" With both those concerns abating, ""it\'s appropriate for the Fed to take back some of the easing that they put in place last fall."" Economists at the Paris-based Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development urged the Fed to ""respond cautiously to developments until they can be interpreted with greater confidence."" The OECD foresees growth of 3.5% in the U.S. this year and 2% growth next year. With inflation low, the Fed can wait for the economy to slow on its own, the OECD\'s top economist, Ignazio Visco, said yesterday. After cutting rates in November, the Fed adopted a directive saying that higher or lower rates were equally likely in the ensuing weeks. It maintained that stance in meeting in December, February and March. The last time the Fed ended a meeting with a directive tilted toward higher rates was in early July 1998.

299,1999-05-18,"[""WASHINGTON, May 18 -- The Federal Reserve put investors and consumers on notice today that it might raise interest rates in coming months if it continued to see signs that inflation was brewing. Although it voted to hold rates steady for now, the central bank's policy-making Federal Open Market Committee dropped its neutral stance on monetary policy, under which it considered the possibility of rate cuts or rate increases to be equal. Instead, it said it was now leaning toward imposing higher rates. The shift was subtle, but it signaled a clear change in the Federal Reserve's outlook from last fall, when it made three reductions in interest rates in response to the global financial crisis. In a statement, the Fed said it was ''concerned about the potential for a buildup of inflationary imbalances that could undermine the favorable performance of the economy.'' Investors and economists, who considered the odds of such a shift to be roughly 50-50, were well prepared for the announcement, which came just after 2:15 P.M. It rattled Wall Street, but only briefly. Stocks, which had been up modestly, turned down  before recovering most of their losses. Bond prices fell, and the dollar dipped slightly. [Page C1.] ''The Fed took a step without tightening policy and signaled to investors in an orderly fashion where they think the risks lie,'' said Joel Prakken, an economist at Macroeconomic Advisors, a consulting firm. ''They're saying the economy is going too fast, given how low the unemployment rate is.'' Analysts said the move was also intended to show that the Federal Reserve was no longer so worried about a global downturn or a credit squeeze in the financial markets. Rather, the central bank is increasingly concerned that strong domestic growth at a time of low unemployment could set off a worrisome increase in prices and wages. ''The odds are high, although far from 100 percent, that an upward move in interest rates is coming,'' said Allen Sinai, chief global economist at Primark Decision Economics, a consulting firm in Boston and New York. ''Quite properly and early, the central bank has shifted focus to a potential inflationary buildup in the U.S.'' The move came on the heels of Friday's report that the Consumer Price Index had risen seven-tenths of 1 percent in April, the biggest monthly jump since 1990. And it came just two weeks after Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, warned in a speech that inflation remained a threat despite the tremendous economic gains stimulated by huge investments in new technology that have occurred during the course of a business expansion that is now in its ninth year. In announcing and explaining the move after its meeting today, the Fed was employing for the first time a policy of immediately disclosing shifts in its intentions. Before the policy was adopted last fall, the Federal Reserve, except when actually raising or lowering interest rates, had kept changes in its policy stance secret until after the subsequent meeting of the committee. The new disclosure policy was adopted partly in response to longstanding calls from Congress and investors for the Fed to be more open. But it also gives the Fed more flexibility in preparing Wall Street and the public for rate changes, perhaps avoiding sharp, destabilizing swings in stock prices. Economists said that the Fed could raise rates as soon as its next policy meeting at the end of June, especially if there were further signs of inflation or a further drop in unemployment from its current rate of 4.3 percent. But they said that if the economy began to cool on its own, the Fed might well hold off. The main short-term rate controlled by the Federal Reserve, the Federal funds target rate on overnight loans between banks, stands at 4.75 percent, where it has been since Nov. 17. The discount rate on loans made to banks from the Federal Reserve system is 4.5 percent. The American economy has been defying predictions of a slowdown for several years; it grew at a robust 4.5 percent pace in the first quarter. Until now, however, the economy has generated almost no concrete signs of incipient inflation despite a longstanding low unemployment rate. In many ways, the spike in consumer prices last month was an anomaly, because prices at the producer level, wage increases and indicators of potential bottlenecks in production have shown few or no worrisome signs. The situation has set off a debate about whether the economy can now grow for sustained periods at higher rates without generating the rise in inflation that traditional models would suggest. Mr. Greenspan has been among those who have made the case that technology-driven increases in productivity -- the output generated per worker -- have improved the economy's ability to grow without serious inflation and have allowed the Fed to avoid rate increases, with one exception, for more than four years. But Mr. Greenspan has made clear that his faith in productivity improvements does have its limits, and he is apparently reaching them now. Mr. Greenspan and his colleagues on the policy committee -- some of whom have been far less sanguine about inflation -- also confront a reviving world economy, and a domestic stock market that has left people from all walks of life feeling affluent and willing to spend. As a result, consumer demand is likely to remain strong or intensify while pressure for higher wages could grow. The Fed is also facing a rebound in oil prices, which had been falling or depressed for several years, helping to contain inflation. In its statement today, the Fed acknowledged that ''increases in costs and core prices have generally remained quite subdued,'' even considering last month's jump in consumer prices. ''But domestic financial markets have recovered and foreign economic prospects have improved since the easing of monetary policy last fall,'' the statement said. There are clearly dangers for the Fed in raising rates, especially if the increase is seen as precipitate. Without any clear evidence of inflation, a rate increase could fuel political criticism of the Fed and bring protests from parts of the economy, like heavy manufacturing and agriculture, that lately have been missing out on the general prosperity. A rate increase could also drive the value of the dollar higher against other currencies, making imports more attractive in price and making it harder for American exporters to compete abroad. That could make the trade deficit, which has been expanding rapidly, even deeper. The Fed also has to be careful not to unsettle the stock market too much. Although Mr. Greenspan has been clear for several years now that he thinks stock prices may be too high, Fed officials are well aware that if higher rates puncture the market in a way that leads to a steep drop, it could pinch off consumer spending and risk putting the economy into a stall. Still, the committee's statement  seemed clearly intended to dispel the notion that has become popular among some economists in the last few months that Mr. Greenspan and his colleagues are less inclined to strike at inflation before it takes root and more likely to wait until they have concrete evidence of its return before raising rates.""]","[""washington, may 18 -- the federal reserve put investors and consumers on notice today that it might raise interest rates in coming months if it continued to see signs that inflation was brewing. although it voted to hold rates steady for now, the central bank's policy-making federal open market committee dropped its neutral stance on monetary policy, under which it considered the possibility of rate cuts or rate increases to be equal. instead, it said it was now leaning toward imposing higher rates. the shift was subtle, but it signaled a clear change in the federal reserve's outlook from last fall, when it made three reductions in interest rates in response to the global financial crisis. in a statement, the fed said it was ''concerned about the potential for a buildup of inflationary imbalances that could undermine the favorable performance of the economy.'' investors and economists, who considered the odds of such a shift to be roughly 50-50, were well prepared for the announcement, which came just after 2:15 p.m. it rattled wall street, but only briefly. stocks, which had been up modestly, turned down  before recovering most of their losses. bond prices fell, and the dollar dipped slightly. [page c1.] ''the fed took a step without tightening policy and signaled to investors in an orderly fashion where they think the risks lie,'' said joel prakken, an economist at macroeconomic advisors, a consulting firm. ''they're saying the economy is going too fast, given how low the unemployment rate is.'' analysts said the move was also intended to show that the federal reserve was no longer so worried about a global downturn or a credit squeeze in the financial markets. rather, the central bank is increasingly concerned that strong domestic growth at a time of low unemployment could set off a worrisome increase in prices and wages. ''the odds are high, although far from 100 percent, that an upward move in interest rates is coming,'' said allen sinai, chief global economist at primark decision economics, a consulting firm in boston and new york. ''quite properly and early, the central bank has shifted focus to a potential inflationary buildup in the u.s.'' the move came on the heels of friday's report that the consumer price index had risen seven-tenths of 1 percent in april, the biggest monthly jump since 1990. and it came just two weeks after alan greenspan, the federal reserve chairman, warned in a speech that inflation remained a threat despite the tremendous economic gains stimulated by huge investments in new technology that have occurred during the course of a business expansion that is now in its ninth year. in announcing and explaining the move after its meeting today, the fed was employing for the first time a policy of immediately disclosing shifts in its intentions. before the policy was adopted last fall, the federal reserve, except when actually raising or lowering interest rates, had kept changes in its policy stance secret until after the subsequent meeting of the committee. the new disclosure policy was adopted partly in response to longstanding calls from congress and investors for the fed to be more open. but it also gives the fed more flexibility in preparing wall street and the public for rate changes, perhaps avoiding sharp, destabilizing swings in stock prices. economists said that the fed could raise rates as soon as its next policy meeting at the end of june, especially if there were further signs of inflation or a further drop in unemployment from its current rate of 4.3 percent. but they said that if the economy began to cool on its own, the fed might well hold off. the main short-term rate controlled by the federal reserve, the federal funds target rate on overnight loans between banks, stands at 4.75 percent, where it has been since nov. 17. the discount rate on loans made to banks from the federal reserve system is 4.5 percent. the american economy has been defying predictions of a slowdown for several years; it grew at a robust 4.5 percent pace in the first quarter. until now, however, the economy has generated almost no concrete signs of incipient inflation despite a longstanding low unemployment rate. in many ways, the spike in consumer prices last month was an anomaly, because prices at the producer level, wage increases and indicators of potential bottlenecks in production have shown few or no worrisome signs. the situation has set off a debate about whether the economy can now grow for sustained periods at higher rates without generating the rise in inflation that traditional models would suggest. mr. greenspan has been among those who have made the case that technology-driven increases in productivity -- the output generated per worker -- have improved the economy's ability to grow without serious inflation and have allowed the fed to avoid rate increases, with one exception, for more than four years. but mr. greenspan has made clear that his faith in productivity improvements does have its limits, and he is apparently reaching them now. mr. greenspan and his colleagues on the policy committee -- some of whom have been far less sanguine about inflation -- also confront a reviving world economy, and a domestic stock market that has left people from all walks of life feeling affluent and willing to spend. as a result, consumer demand is likely to remain strong or intensify while pressure for higher wages could grow. the fed is also facing a rebound in oil prices, which had been falling or depressed for several years, helping to contain inflation. in its statement today, the fed acknowledged that ''increases in costs and core prices have generally remained quite subdued,'' even considering last month's jump in consumer prices.

300,1999-05-18,"[""Stock prices closed slightly lower yesterday but well above their lows of the session, as traders and investors reacted with relative equanimity to the decision by the Federal Reserve Board to adopt a more hawkish stance on interest rates. Given the continued strength in the domestic economy and signs that inflation may be on the rise, the announcement that the Federal Open Market Committee had adopted a tightening bias toward monetary policy did not shock financial markets. Still, the Dow Jones industrial average, which had been up as much as 77 points during the morning, sharply reversed course after the Fed's announcement, tumbling almost 150 points. But the blue-chip average subsequently regained much of that loss and closed at 10,836.95, a drop of 16.52 points. Elsewhere in the stock market, declines in oil stocks and regional telephone companies helped push the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index down 6.17 points, or half a percent, to 1,333.32. The Nasdaq composite index fell 3.48 points, to 2,558.36. But the Russell 2000 index of small-company stocks rose 1.10, or 0.25 percent, to 442.45. ''The market got something that was not exactly a surprise, but not friendly either, and it has taken the news and brushed it aside,'' said Jonathan Olesky, head of block trading at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. ''Over the past couple of weeks the market has had a lot of bricks and rocks thrown at it, and it has been remarkably resilient.'' Indeed, much of the weakness in stock prices yesterday was among cyclical stocks, which over the last six weeks have posted very strong gains. The Morgan Stanley cyclical stock index, which hit a record 619.09 May 10, fell 6.05 yesterday, to 589.79, its sixth straight decline. Oil stocks like Chevron, Exxon and Royal Dutch Petroleum moved lower. So too did heavy-equipment manufacturers like Caterpillar, and big chemical companies like Dow Chemical. ''Stocks like Dow have had a career move in a month or so,'' said Bob Bissell, president and chief investment officer of Wells Capital Management. ''You have to expect them to correct some.'' Of the Dow stocks, Chevron was the biggest decliner, falling 3 1/4, to 129 5/8. Exxon lost 1 1/4, to 77 3/4. And Royal Dutch declined 1 1/4, to 55 3/16. Caterpillar, another Dow component, fell 2 3/16, to 58 3/4. And Dow Chemical slumped 2 9/16, to 129 5/8. Although the Fed chose not to raise interest rates yesterday, concern that it might soon do just that could keep a lid on stock prices. Such a development would probably sit well with the Fed, according to some analysts. ''I don't think the Fed in any way, shape or form is trying to knock down stock prices,'' said Donald J. Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Asset Management. ''But I am sure they would like to see stocks plateau. Over the last year or so the wealth effect from a rising stock market has contributed to a sharp increase in consumer spending. If the stock market plateaus for a while, that should slow consumer spending down.'' Mr. Fine said that despite the spike in consumer prices during April, the threat of a sustained rise in the rate of inflation -- a major concern for the Fed -- seemed low. ''Inflation is not nearly the threat the Consumer Price Index suggested,'' he said. ''Inflation will be noticeably higher this year than it was in 1998, at around 2 percent to 2.25 percent. But there is no real reason to expect a sustained pickup.'' Nevertheless, in the bond market, which abhors inflation, Treasury securities erased earlier gains and fell after the Fed announced it was adopting a tightening bias. But an afternoon round of buying pared the losses. The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond actually gained 2/32 from late Monday, to 91 5/32. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, fell to 5.88 percent, from 5.89 percent Monday. Prices of short and intermediate Treasury securities were generally lower. Hewlett-Packard, which reported strong earnings after the market closed on Monday, was the biggest gainer among Dow stocks, rising 9 3/16 yesterday, to 96. Dell Computer, which rose 13/16, to 44 1/16 in yesterday's trading, is likely to come under selling pressure in today's session, because after the market closed Dell, the leading direct seller of personal computers, posted first-quarter results that just met Wall Street's forecasts, but, nevertheless, disappointed some investors. Elsewhere, J. C. Penney, the nation's second-largest department store company, rose 4 7/8, to 50 1/8 after it announced it would offer 20 percent of its Eckerd drugstores to the public and sell its credit card portfolio. And Kmart, another big retailer, rose 13/16 to 17 3/16 after announcing it would buy back as much as $1 billion of its outstanding common stock.""]","[""stock prices closed slightly lower yesterday but well above their lows of the session, as traders and investors reacted with relative equanimity to the decision by the federal reserve board to adopt a more hawkish stance on interest rates. given the continued strength in the domestic economy and signs that inflation may be on the rise, the announcement that the federal open market committee had adopted a tightening bias toward monetary policy did not shock financial markets. still, the dow jones industrial average, which had been up as much as 77 points during the morning, sharply reversed course after the fed's announcement, tumbling almost 150 points. but the blue-chip average subsequently regained much of that loss and closed at 10,836.95, a drop of 16.52 points. elsewhere in the stock market, declines in oil stocks and regional telephone companies helped push the standard & poor's 500-stock index down 6.17 points, or half a percent, to 1,333.32. the nasdaq composite index fell 3.48 points, to 2,558.36. but the russell 2000 index of small-company stocks rose 1.10, or 0.25 percent, to 442.45.

302,2002-01-30,"['NEW YORK -- The bond market moved lower, pushed down by the combination of stronger equity markets, improved economic data, and Federal Reserve policy makers\' decision to leave interest rates unchanged. Treasury securities had been lower for most of the session, spurred mostly by the release of positive U.S. fourth-quarter gross domestic product data and the Treasury\'s quarterly refunding announcement. Then a late-day rally in stocks, which followed the Fed\'s interest-rate decision, pushed the debt market down further. At 4 p.m. EST, the benchmark 10-year Treasury note was down 8/32 point, or $2.50 per $1,000 face value, at 100. Its yield rose to 5.000% from 4.966% late Tuesday, as yields move inversely to prices. Meanwhile, the 30-year Treasury bond\'s price was down 12/32 at 99 8/32 to yield 5.426%, up from Tuesday\'s 5.401%. The central bank\'s Federal Open Market Committee voted to hold its main federal-funds rate at a 40-year low of 1.75%, pausing to see whether the economy will strengthen as businesses start rebuilding inventories they depleted last year. The Fed\'s message was ""almost perfectly in line with what the market expected,"" said David Ging, government bond strategist at Credit Suisse First Boston in New York. That means the bond market will need to take a wait-and-see stance in coming weeks, as participants focus keenly on the performance of the U.S. economy, corporations and stock markets. Earlier in yesterday\'s session, government debt fell when the market got a dose of improved economic data. Prices slipped further when the Treasury Department announced a $29 billion refunding package, consisting of $16 billion in reopened November five-year notes to be auctioned Tuesday and $13 billion in 10-year notes to be sold Wednesday. The Treasury Department also revealed it is considering ending its current pattern of alternating new issues and reopenings, and that it would conduct $3 billion to $5 billion in buybacks in three operations after the April tax deadline. In general, the Treasury Department\'s news contained no surprises for a market warily awaiting details of the February refunding. ""The Treasury signaled this, and the Treasury is definitely trying to get more predictable. And what I like about this refunding is that they are telling the market what they are thinking,"" said Gerald Lucas, senior government-bond strategist at Merrill Lynch in New York. Still, the announcement helped to lay to rest recent speculation that the Treasury Department would move to a monthly five-year note auction schedule. Speaking to reporters, Treasury Assistant Secretary for Financial Markets Brian Roseboro said the government isn\'t ""actively considering"" such a move. Many market participants have been clamoring for the Treasury Department to move to monthly five-year note auctions due to recent imbalances in the government repurchase agreement market, where dealers go to borrow securities. For nearly eight weeks, the November five-year note has been extremely scarce in the government repurchase agreement market, allowing lenders of the note to command zero-rate financing from those who need to borrow it. In many cases, the note has been so elusive that borrowers haven\'t been able to return it to the lender, a situation known as a fail. Corporate Bonds The corporate bond sector was quieter compared with Tuesday, with little reaction seen to the Fed\'s announcement. ""If anything, not cutting sends the message that the Fed sees the economy bottoming or improving and that their job is pretty much done,"" said Steve Nelson, portfolio manager at Advantus Capital Management.

306,2006-05-10,"['As it raised interest rates by a quarter-point for the 16th consecutive time, the Federal Reserve, in its accompanying statement, struck a careful balance between concern about inflation and a willingness to consider pausing in its two-year rate-raising campaign. The Fed, as expected, boosted short-term rates to 5% from 4.75%. In its statement, it laid out a rationale for a pause in the series of rate increases that began in mid-2004, while signaling such a break need not be a halt. In recent weeks, Fed officials, led by Chairman Ben Bernanke, have tried to signal that they are less certain of where rates are going and that while they may pause soon, they could raise rates again later. But those signals have come while recent data have shown that the economy remains strong and inflationary pressure is growing. Markets have questioned the wisdom of the Fed\'s game plan by showing greater concern about inflation. Yesterday\'s statement was less explicit than Mr. Bernanke\'s Congressional testimony two weeks ago on the prospects of a pause. It restated the Fed\'s bias to raise interest rates further because of the risk of higher inflation. But it also laid out a forecast of slowing growth that would allow it to pause on rate increases. Growth has been ""quite strong,"" the Fed said, but will ""likely . . . moderate to a more sustainable pace, partly reflecting a gradual cooling of the housing market and the lagged effects of increases in interest rates and energy prices."" Inflation expectations are ""contained,"" but tightening capacity usage and high commodity prices could add ""potential"" inflation pressure. Further rate increases ""may yet be needed to address inflation risks,"" the Fed said, slightly tweaking the guidance it gave on interest rates after its previous two meetings. But it added that it ""emphasizes that the extent and timing of any such firming will depend importantly on the evolution of the economic outlook as implied by incoming information."" That wording suggests that the Fed still sees a reasonable chance of having to raise rates again this year, but without the predictability of the past 23 months. Stock and bond markets weakened following the Fed\'s statement, and finished mixed on the day, while futures markets raised to 40% from 38% the odds of a quarter-point increase in rates at the Fed\'s next meeting on June 28-29. The dollar recouped some of its losses against the euro, but remained lower on a day when the highlight was a Treasury report that criticized China for holding down the value of its currency but stopped short of calling it a currency manipulator. All 11 voting members of the 18 member Federal Open Market Committee voted to raise the target for the federal-funds rate, charged on overnight loans among banks. (One FOMC seat is vacant.) The Fed also raised the less-important discount rate, charged on central-bank loans to commercial banks, to 6% from 5.75%. Eleven of the Fed\'s 12 regional banks requested the increase; the board of the Kansas City Fed did not, just as in March. In response, U.S. commercial banks raised their prime rate, a benchmark for many business and consumer loans, to 8% from 7.75%. The Fed and its new chairman are at a delicate juncture. At 5%, short-term rates are now about neutral -- neither so low that they stimulate spending, nor so high that they restrain it. And there are signs that, after two years, the Fed is having an impact: Long-term rates have started to rise, and home sales and price appreciation have slowed. But the overall economy grew at a robust 4.8% annual rate in the first quarter, and though it\'s expected to slow to between 3% and 3.5% in the second quarter, the latest data have been strong. Moreover, underlying inflation recently ticked up to the top of the Fed\'s comfort zone of 1% to 2%. Thus, Mr. Bernanke is caught between the risk of appearing soft on inflation and the risk of raising interest rates too much and triggering a serious slowdown. They are ""concerned with the lagged impact of earlier tightening on economic activity -- it\'s the reason the [notion of a pause] has been introduced,"" said Al Broaddus, former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond. ""But . . . they mustn\'t give anyone the idea their ultimate focus on inflation has diminished. It\'s very tough to walk this fine line."" Robert Parry, former president of the San Francisco Fed, thinks the Fed will likely have to raise rates further this year, in part because it usually has to raise them above neutral to get the economy to slow to a desirable rate and keep inflation in its preferred zone. Even so, he said the Fed would be justified in pausing at its next meeting because after several years in which the direction of rates was straightforward, ""it\'s much more complex, and one has to be careful and also circumspect."" Mr. Bernanke seems more willing than his predecessor Alan Greenspan to lay out his forecast for the economy to justify the Fed\'s rate actions. Edward Gramlich, a former Fed governor who is now interim provost at the University of Michigan, said ""it\'s inevitable"" that the Fed must now rely on forecasts. The only reason it can consider a pause, he said, is that it believes rates at current levels ""have already dampened spending enough to bring [inflation] under control."" However, that forecast may not yet ring true with people in the markets who still see a strong economy, buoyant financial markets and inflation signals, such as gold prices hitting a 25-year high.

307,2006-05-10,"['The Treasury bond market still believes a pause is coming in the Federal Reserve\'s tightening campaign, even as the central bank kept its options open. Along with a quarter-percentage-point increase in the federal-funds rate to 5%, the Federal Open Market Committee kept the idea of another rate increase in June alive, saying ""some further policy firming may yet be needed to address inflation risks."" It also emphasized that any further rate increases will depend ""importantly"" on the incoming data. The market sold off in an initial response to the statement, and yields -- which move inversely to prices -- rose, as bond investors had pegged the odds of a pause in June around 65% before the FOMC statement was released. But prices exited from active trade little changed, and the two-year note\'s yield failed to move beyond the 5% mark. At 4 p.m., the two-year note was down 1/32, or 31.3 cents per $1,000 face value, at 99 25/32 to yield 4.992%, compared with 4.975% Tuesday. The 10-year note rose 2/32 to 95 7/32 to yield 5.128%. The odds of a rate increase in June are ""now close to fifty-fifty,"" said Jim Caron, fixed-income strategist at Merrill Lynch &Co. in New York. That is also reflected in short-term interest-rate futures, which show the odds of a June increase at 44%, compared with 50% odds just after the FOMC statement was published. Scott Gewirtz, head of Treasury trading at Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. in New York, said the statement itself was neutral and that explained the modest nature of the selloff. ""I think they avoided overtly signaling a pause but they left themselves a huge amount of flexibility,"" Mr. Gewirtz said. Policy makers also highlighted inflation risks in their statement -- and that was the trigger for the market\'s biggest move in the wake of the statement\'s publication -- a flatter yield curve, said Richard Gilhooly, senior interest-rate strategist at BNP Paribas. Longer-term yields are sensitive to inflation expectations, while short-term yields react most to official interest-rate changes. In recent trade, the yield curve as measured by the difference between two-year and 10-year yields had flattened to 0.13 percentage point, its lowest level since April 26, the day before Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke made his comments about a possible pause in rate increases to Congress. How far the flattening goes will now be determined by the reception given to today\'s auction of $13 billion in new 10-year notes. ""A good auction will help rally the back end,"" Mr. Gilhooly said. In the wake of the Fed\'s rate move, commercial banks are raising their prime rate to 8% from 7.75%. Many consumer-lending rates, such as interest on credit cards and home-equity loans, are tied to the prime rate. Municipal Bond The Government Development Bank for Puerto Rico has delayed today\'s planned sale of $800 million bonds, a GDB spokeswoman said. The sale, which would have been the largest this week in the tax-exempt bond market, has been put off at least temporarily because of a downgrade Monday by a major ratings firm of $25 billion of the commonwealth\'s debt, said spokeswoman Maria Rosario. The island territory has been in the grips of a fiscal crisis that has partially closed its government, as well as eroded its shaky credit rating and that of the GDB, which has made extensive loans to the government. Impatient about a budget impasse that has kept the Puerto Rican government in a partial shutdown since May 1, Moody\'s Investors Service Monday took its rating on the commonwealth\'s general obligation bonds down one peg to Baa3, the firm\'s lowest investment-grade rating and just one step above junk-bond status. It also cut its ratings on Puerto Rico\'s appropriations debt to Ba1, its highest junk-bond rating. The company said it was keeping Puerto Rico on a watch list for possible further downgrades. Corporate Bond Embarq Corp. is shopping a $4.485 billion three-part debt offering this week and investors are already lining up for the deal. A person familiar with the offering said roughly $17 billion in orders have poured in for the offering, which is expected to price this week. This deal comes after $4 billion in new debt from Abbott Laboratories in the investment-grade market on Tuesday. Embarq is Sprint Nextel Corp.\'s local land-line phone business that is being spun off to Sprint shareholders May 17. It has garnered the lowest possible investment-grade ratings of triple-B-minus from Standard &Poor\'s, Fitch Ratings and Moody\'s Investors Service. S&P has a negative outlook on the company, while Fitch and Moody\'s are stable. The business has ""lots of cash"" that is expected to be used to pare down debt, said Eric Geil, credit analyst at S&P. But ""beyond the next couple of years, we\'re really unsure where the business may go,"" he said. That is because the land-line sector of the telecommunications market is shrinking, while the wireless and cable sectors are expanding. Yield-starved investors, however, are willing to overlook the gloomy outlook. GM Bonds Shift Out of Reverse General Motors Corp.\'s bond ratings are on review for yet another downgrade by both Moody\'s Investors Service and Standard and Poor\'s, but that hasn\'t stopped investors from snapping up the debt securities lately. The company\'s 8.375% bonds due in 2033 have risen over the past few trading sessions and yesterday hit 76.5 cents on the dollar, representing a yield of about 11%. That is much improved from a low of about 66 cents on the dollar at the end of December 2005, according to data from MarketAxess.

""i think they avoided overtly signaling a pause but they left themselves a huge amount of flexibility,"" mr. gewirtz said. policy makers also highlighted inflation risks in their statement -- and that was the trigger for the market's biggest move in the wake of the statement's publication -- a flatter yield curve, said richard gilhooly, senior interest-rate strategist at bnp paribas. longer-term yields are sensitive to inflation expectations, while short-term yields react most to official interest-rate changes. in recent trade, the yield curve as measured by the difference between two-year and 10-year yields had flattened to 0.13 percentage point, its lowest level since april 26, the day before fed chairman ben bernanke made his comments about a possible pause in rate increases to congress. how far the flattening goes will now be determined by the reception given to today's auction of $13 billion in new 10-year notes. ""a good auction will help rally the back end,"" mr. gilhooly said. in the wake of the fed's rate move, commercial banks are raising their prime rate to 8% from 7.75%. many consumer-lending rates, such as interest on credit cards and home-equity loans, are tied to the prime rate. municipal bond the government development bank for puerto rico has delayed today's planned sale of $800 million bonds, a gdb spokeswoman said. the sale, which would have been the largest this week in the tax-exempt bond market, has been put off at least temporarily because of a downgrade monday by a major ratings firm of $25 billion of the commonwealth's debt, said spokeswoman maria rosario. the island territory has been in the grips of a fiscal crisis that has partially closed its government, as well as eroded its shaky credit rating and that of the gdb, which has made extensive loans to the government. impatient about a budget impasse that has kept the puerto rican government in a partial shutdown since may 1, moody's investors service monday took its rating on the commonwealth's general obligation bonds down one peg to baa3, the firm's lowest investment-grade rating and just one step above junk-bond status. it also cut its ratings on puerto rico's appropriations debt to ba1, its highest junk-bond rating. the company said it was keeping puerto rico on a watch list for possible further downgrades. corporate bond embarq corp. is shopping a $4.485 billion three-part debt offering this week and investors are already lining up for the deal. a person familiar with the offering said roughly $17 billion in orders have poured in for the offering, which is expected to price this week. this deal comes after $4 billion in new debt from abbott laboratories in the investment-grade market on tuesday. embarq is sprint nextel corp.'s local land-line phone business that is being spun off to sprint shareholders may 17. it has garnered the lowest possible investment-grade ratings of triple-b-minus from standard &poor's, fitch ratings and moody's investors service. s&p has a negative outlook on the company, while fitch and moody's are stable. the business has ""lots of cash"" that is expected to be used to pare down debt, said eric geil, credit analyst at s&p. but ""beyond the next couple of years, we're really unsure where the business may go,"" he said. that is because the land-line sector of the telecommunications market is shrinking, while the wireless and cable sectors are expanding. yield-starved investors, however, are willing to overlook the gloomy outlook. gm bonds shift out of reverse general motors corp.'s bond ratings are on review for yet another downgrade by both moody's investors service and standard and poor's, but that hasn't stopped investors from snapping up the debt securities lately. the company's 8.375% bonds due in 2033 have risen over the past few trading sessions and yesterday hit 76.5 cents on the dollar, representing a yield of about 11%. that is much improved from a low of about 66 cents on the dollar at the end of december 2005, according to data from marketaxess. earlier this week, gm revised its first-quarter results to a profit from a loss effectively ending a five-quarter streak of reported losses.

308,2006-05-10,"[""WASHINGTON, May 10 -- The Federal Reserve raised short-term interest rates again on Wednesday, its 16th increase in two years, and gave itself room to raise them again in June.   As expected, the central bank nudged up the federal funds rate on overnight loans between banks another quarter-point, to 5 percent.   But the Fed also damped hopes of some investors that it might stop or at least pause before raising rates again. In its statement, the Fed asserted that ''some further policy firming may yet be needed,'' a signal that policy makers are leaning toward at least one more increase. But it also took care to keep its options open.   While investors expected the rate increase, the Fed statement seemed to worry them. The Dow Jones industrial average had moved higher in afternoon trading but fell after the announcement and ended about where it began. [Page C11.]   Wednesday's statement illustrated the uncertainty that confronts the Fed and its chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, as policy makers prepare to shift gears to a more neutral stance after two years of raising rates.   In many ways, the statement did little to clarify the muddy picture that policy makers have conveyed in the last month.   The central bank's priority on Wednesday seemed to be to make sure that it did not limit its options. It asserted that future decisions would be shaped more than ever by economic data rather than by a preordained strategy.   ''The extent and timing of any such firming will depend importantly on the evolution of the economic outlook as implied by incoming information,'' the central bank said.   Two weeks ago, Mr. Bernanke told House lawmakers that the Fed might take a pause while it took time to assess the economy's direction. But on Wednesday, the Fed made no reference to pauses and gave a clear reference to the likelihood of another rate increase.   At the same time, the central bank suggested that it was not overly alarmed about the prospects of higher inflation and that it still expected the economy to cool to a ''more sustainable pace'' from the torrid growth rates of earlier this year.   Some analysts said Mr. Bernanke was sending a tougher message about the need to head off potential inflation. The Fed's statement, which is supposed to convey the views of the entire Federal Open Market Committee, did not repeat Mr. Bernanke's suggestion last month to lawmakers that the Fed might pause in its rate increases.   ''They're effectively saying that their bias is to raise rates at the next meeting,'' said Anton Pil, head of fixed income investments at J. P. Morgan Asset and Wealth Management.   Other analysts noted that policy makers expressed little concern about recent data that signaled higher inflation. Consumer prices increased 3.4 percent in the 12 months ended in March. The Fed's preferred measure of ''core'' inflation, which excludes the volatile prices of food and energy, has risen 2 percent in the last year -- at the top of Mr. Bernanke's comfort zone for price increases.   Ian Shepherdson, an economist at High Frequency Economics, a research firm, said the Fed might still refrain from raising rates at its next meeting, set for June 28 and 29, because it would probably have more data by then that show a sharp slowing in the economy.   ''I am very sure that the incoming data, particularly consumer confidence numbers, are going to tank,'' Mr. Shepherdson said.   In their statement on Wednesday, Fed policy makers noted that economic growth has been very strong so far this year. But they repeated their view that growth, which rose to an annual rate of 4.8 percent in the first three months of this year, would moderate as a result of a cooler housing market and the lagging effects of higher interest rates and energy prices.   ''As yet, the run-up in the prices of energy and other commodities appears to have had only a modest effect on core inflation,'' the Federal Reserve said. Continued growth in productivity has helped restrain costs, it continued. Inflation expectations ''remain contained.''   Mr. Bernanke helped set off a sell-off in the bond markets last month after his remarks to lawmakers about a pause.   But last week, a financial reporter for CNBC, Maria Bartiromo, said Mr. Bernanke had told her at a banquet in Washington that the markets had misunderstood his intentions. Fed officials never confirmed Mr. Bernanke's comments, but many analysts concluded that he wanted to reassert his toughness against inflation.   Bond investors showed greater anxiety about inflation after Mr. Bernanke suggested a pause. Prices of inflation-protected Treasury bonds jumped, often an indicator of increased worry about inflation.   Andrew Tilton, an economist at Goldman Sachs, wrote Wednesday in a research note that the Fed was still likely to take a breather at its next meeting but wanted to convey its vigilance.   ''This was a relatively subtle way of reminding the markets that the Fed is on the case,'' Mr. Tilton wrote, ''without unduly alarmist language about the inflation outlook.''

The dollar fell to a 12-session low against the euro, which rose as high as $1.5687.

The euro zone\'s higher interest rates help make assets denominated in the euro more attractive to investors. With the ECB widely expected to raise rates at its meeting next week, currency analysts said the dollar will stay under pressure from the euro\'s advances. Wednesday afternoon in New York, the euro was at $1.5676 from $1.5572 late Tuesday, according to EBS. The dollar was at 107.77 yen from 107.79 yen, while the euro was at 168.95 yen from 167.80 yen. The U.K. pound was at $1.9758 from $1.9697, and the dollar was at 1.0351 Swiss francs from 1.0412 francs Tuesday. The FOMC voted 9-1 to keep its benchmark lending rate at 2%. It also took no action on the discount rate charged for Fed loans to banks and brokers, which stands at 2.25%. In the policy statement, officials signaled that while the economy still faces headwinds, the chances of a severe slowdown or recession have receded. They also said, ""Upside risks to inflation and inflation expectations have increased."" ""People in the currency market may have been looking for a more hawkish stance from the FOMC,"" said Adam Boyton, currency strategist at Deutche Bank AG in New York.

313,2001-05-15,"[""WASHINGTON, May 15 -- The Federal Reserve continued its campaign to reinvigorate the weakened economy today, cutting its benchmark interest rate half a percentage point for the fifth time this year. Suggesting that the worst of the slowdown may still not be past, the Fed said its decision was primarily driven by the deteriorating outlook for businesses, which have been cutting investments in new plants and equipment in the face of declining profits. Today's action reduced the federal funds rate on overnight loans among banks to 4 percent, from 4.5 percent. The decision brought the total reduction since the Fed began cutting rates in January to 2.5 percentage points, making this one of the most concentrated efforts it has ever undertaken to reignite economic growth. And the central bank, dismissing any concern that inflation might become a threat, hinted that it was likely to ease monetary policy further at its next scheduled meeting in late June. After fretting for several days that the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, and his colleagues might limit their rate cut to a quarter percentage point, Wall Street bid up stock prices after the announcement at 2:15 p.m. But prices then fell back and finished flat. The Dow Jones industrial average slipped 4.36 points, to 10,872.97; the Nasdaq composite index rose 3.66 points, to 2,085.58. [Page C1.] The Fed's action was intended to put downward pressure on borrowing costs throughout the economy, making it more affordable for consumers to buy a car or a new refrigerator as well as providing them with some assurance that their own financial situation would not worsen. That process was under way within minutes, when banks began lowering their prime lending rates to 7 percent from 7.5 percent, a step that most directly affects small-business borrowers but also helps consumers who have certain types of credit cards, auto loans and adjustable mortgages. Ultimately, the cumulative reductions in the short-term rates controlled by the Fed should have some impact on a variety of loans. But they will have only an indirect effect on the biggest borrowing expense for most people -- mortgages. Mortgage rates are determined primarily by the bond market's assessment of the long-term economic outlook. And despite the cuts in short-term rates engineered by the Fed this year, mortgage rates have been more or less steady since January, reflecting a calculation by bond traders that any improvement in economic growth prospects could be offset by the risk of inflation. Today's move came against the backdrop of an economy that appeared to have dipped into a zone of tepid growth just short of recession. Retail sales rose in April, and consumer confidence stabilized, suggesting that consumer spending, the chief bulwark of the economy, was weathering the slowdown. Companies made progress in bringing their backlogs of unsold goods and supplies into line with reduced demand. The stock market stabilized. But the economy lost 223,000 jobs in April, the biggest downturn in more than a decade, and the unemployment rate rose to 4.5 percent from 4.3 percent. Industrial production fell again last month. And most worrying to many analysts, businesses continued to reduce investment spending plans. In doing so, they dragged down a segment of the economy that had been a leading engine of growth and raised questions about whether gains in productivity, the most fundamental measure of the economy's long-term potential, could be sustained. ''The erosion in current and prospective profitability, in combination with considerable uncertainty about the business outlook, seems likely to hold down capital spending going forward,'' the Fed's policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee said in a statement. ''This potential restraint, together with the possible effects of earlier reductions in equity wealth on consumption and the risk of slower growth abroad, continues to weigh on the economy.'' The federal funds rate -- the Fed's principal short-term rate -- has not been as low as 4 percent in almost seven years, when the central bank finished its campaign to turn around the economy after the recession of 1990-91. The Fed also cut its discount rate on loans to banks from the Federal Reserve by half a point, to 3.5 percent from 4 percent. The Fed gave no signal that it saw a need to cut rates again before its next scheduled meeting on June 26-27 but left little doubt that a reduction of at least another quarter-point would be on the agenda. The Fed emphasized that ''inflation is expected to remain contained,'' an indication that it felt it still had plenty of leeway to cut rates. And it held to its policy bias toward further rate reductions, concluding that ''the risks are weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate economic weakness in the foreseeable future.'' Some economists said the Fed had reached a point where it needed to let its interest rate medicine do its work before administering another dose. Not only does it take at least six months or so for a reduction in short-term rates to ripple through the financial system and into the economy, but Congress and the Bush administration are also working on a tax-cutting plan that would provide some additional stimulus later this year and into next year. Some economists said they were surprised that the Fed was not more concerned about inflation, given that by most measures price increases accelerated this year. They also suggested that further cuts in interest rates might not have the desired effect on capital spending. While lower interest rates clearly provide a boost to consumers and to interest-sensitive sectors of the economy like housing, they are believed to have only a limited impact on decisions by a business about whether to modernize a factory or upgrade a computer system. Those decisions tend to be driven more by calculations of potential profit and how much capacity is needed to meet expected demand than by the cost of borrowing money. ''The Fed did note that consumption is healthy, that housing is healthy and that inventory adjustment is rapid,'' said Mickey D. Levy, chief economist at Bank of America. ''Obviously they are concerned about capital spending, which is a legitimate concern. But they can't do anything about it. And what really jumps out is that the Fed says inflation is contained, and it's not.'' The Fed also sounded another optimistic note that was questioned by some analysts. Reflecting the view of Mr. Greenspan that huge investments in technology were making the economy fundamentally more efficient, the statement asserted that the underlying trend of improvement in productivity growth ''appears to be largely intact, supporting longer-term prospects.'' Improvements in productivity, or output per hour, mean that companies can pay higher wages or absorb cost increases without passing them along to their customers. But productivity growth stalled in the first quarter. Economists said that if capital spending remained weak, productivity growth would remain muted. David Orr, chief economist at First Union, said Mr. Greenspan seemed to have weighed the risk of fueling inflation and allowing productivity growth to ebb and favored promoting productivity growth by jump-starting the stalled expansion. Mr. Greenspan ''believes the path to containing inflation is through productivity,'' Mr Orr said, ''and in order to assure its continued progress, growth and profits are the key.''""]","[""washington, may 15 -- the federal reserve continued its campaign to reinvigorate the weakened economy today, cutting its benchmark interest rate half a percentage point for the fifth time this year. suggesting that the worst of the slowdown may still not be past, the fed said its decision was primarily driven by the deteriorating outlook for businesses, which have been cutting investments in new plants and equipment in the face of declining profits. today's action reduced the federal funds rate on overnight loans among banks to 4 percent, from 4.5 percent. the decision brought the total reduction since the fed began cutting rates in january to 2.5 percentage points, making this one of the most concentrated efforts it has ever undertaken to reignite economic growth. and the central bank, dismissing any concern that inflation might become a threat, hinted that it was likely to ease monetary policy further at its next scheduled meeting in late june. after fretting for several days that the federal reserve chairman, alan greenspan, and his colleagues might limit their rate cut to a quarter percentage point, wall street bid up stock prices after the announcement at 2:15 p.m. but prices then fell back and finished flat. the dow jones industrial average slipped 4.36 points, to 10,872.97; the nasdaq composite index rose 3.66 points, to 2,085.58.

314,1994-05-17,"['WASHINGTON, May 17 -- The Federal Reserve raised two short-term interest rates by half a percentage point today, the sharpest increase in more than five years, but signaled that further increases were unlikely to follow soon.   Abandoning the gradual pace of three previous increases this year, the nation\'s central bank sought today to brake the nation\'s economic expansion before it feeds inflation, and to protect the value of the dollar in international markets.   In a lengthy statement, the Federal Reserve said that today\'s actions -- raising two rates that affect what banks charge for short-term loans -- ""substantially remove"" the stimulus to the economy that low interest rates provided last year, and that top central bankers contend is no longer needed.   Today\'s decision delighted Wall Street, where investors sent stock and bond prices sharply upward on the assumption that short-term interest rates would stay steady into early summer. The Dow Jones industrial average shot up 49.11 points, to 3,720.61, while the yield on long-term Treasury bonds fell to 7.26 percent, down from 7.44 percent on Monday. [ Page D1. ]   But the Federal Reserve move dismayed Congressional Democrats and some business groups, who warned that the move could stall the economy and increase unemployment.   President Clinton said this morning, before the Fed acted, that economic growth would continue despite higher interest rates. And Administration officials refused to criticize the Federal Reserve decision afterward.   ""There is clearly some room for short-term interest rates over the rate of inflation that won\'t slow down our economic growth,"" the President told reporters.   Laura D\'Andrea Tyson, the chairwoman of the Council of Economic Advisers, reinforced that view after the Federal Reserve acted. ""The Administration believes that the economy is on a path of sustained growth, strong employment creation and low inflation,"" she said. ""Today\'s actions by the Federal Reserve do not alter our basic forecast for the economy.""   Big commercial banks moved quickly today to translate the Federal Reserve\'s action into higher borrowing rates for consumers. The banks, led by Citibank, matched today\'s increases by pushing up their prime rates by half a percentage point, to 7.25 percent. Banks used to charge the prime rate to their best corporate customers, but now use it as a benchmark for setting the interest rates on credit card balances and other loans.   For the first time this year, the nation\'s central bank increased two important interest rates. It pushed up its target for the interest rate that banks charge each other for overnight loans, known as the Federal funds rate, to 4.25 percent from 3.75 percent. And it raised the key discount rate, which the central bank charges when it makes overnight loans to banks, to 3.5 percent from 3 percent.   The Federal Reserve had already increased the Federal funds rate three times this year, on Feb. 4, March 22 and April 18, by a quarter percentage point each time. The discount rate had remained unchanged at 3 percent for nearly two years until today. Decision Termed Unwarranted   Critics of the Federal Reserve said that today\'s decision was unwarranted. Martin Regalia, the chief economist at the United States Chamber of Commerce, said: ""With virtually all current indexes showing little or no inflation, and with many indicators showing that economic growth was already slowing from its rapid pace at the end of last year, we are becoming increasingly concerned that Federal Reserve policy may be moving too fast and too far. We are concerned that monetary policy not choke off an economy that only recently has begun to generate income and job growth.""   Senator Jim Sasser, Democrat of Tennessee, said, ""The Federal Reserve is once again putting the brakes on the nation\'s economic recovery and in doing so, hurting hard-working Americans.""   But consumers could benefit from today\'s decision through cheaper rates on loans like fixed-rate mortgages, if the Federal Reserve succeeds in its ultimate goal of reducing long-term interest rates.   The Fed paradoxically pursues this end by raising shorter-term rates, hoping that this will cool the economy a notch, and thereby also cool investor expectations about inflation. If investors think that inflation will not be a problem because the economy is growing more slowly, they will be more willing to lend their money long term at lower interest rates.   High rates for short-term loans by banks hold down inflation by discouraging companies and individuals from borrowing money. Without this borrowing, fewer factories operate at full capacity and so do not encounter bottlenecks in labor and materials that force them to bid up prices. Treasury Yields Tumble   The yield on 30-year Treasury bonds did tumble today as investors apparently concluded that the Federal Reserve\'s moves would restrain inflation and prevent it from eroding the returns from long-term investments.   Recent Government figures on the economy have provided little if any evidence that inflation has already become a problem. Consumer prices rose only one-tenth of a percent in April, while producer prices fell a tenth of a percent, the Labor Department announced late last week.   But several different concerns have prompted the nation\'s central bank to push up interest rates steadily this spring despite the lack of evidence of current inflation, top Federal Reserve officials have said in interviews over the last month. The biggest concern has been to prevent the economy from overheating in the coming months, which could feed inflation next year.   The weakness of the dollar in recent weeks has heightened the concern of central bankers. When long-term interest rates rise as they have this spring and the dollar nonetheless weakens, then international investors are in effect signaling that inflation so worries them that they are unwilling to buy American bonds even when these bonds pay unusually high rates. Shift by Administration   The President\'s comments this morning were the latest sign that the Administration has shifted away from the aggressive pro-growth stance that it advocated a year ago. President Clinton and Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen have tempered and even reversed their former oratory that favored a lower dollar and low interest rates.   The Administration is now as concerned about excessive growth and higher inflation as it is about inadequate growth and higher unemployment, several top Administration officials said in interviews over the last two weeks. They are acutely aware that rising inflation forced the Fed to raise interest rates very sharply a year before the 1980 Presidential elections, a move often cited as having cost Jimmy Carter his Presidency.   Dee Dee Myers, the White House press secretary, gave a guarded reaction when asked this afternoon whether the Federal Reserve\'s action would slow the economy. ""We\'ll have to see,"" she said. ""I think that we\'ll watch signs in the economy and try to maintain sustained growth -- so far all indications are that the predictions for growth are good.""   The White House had strongly signaled the Federal Reserve in the last two weeks that it wanted the central bank to do two things regardless of how much the central bank chose to raise interest rates today. Administration officials urged Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, to announce that no further increases would be made in interest rates for a while, and to explain his actions clearly, so as to reassure financial markets and prevent long-term interest rates from climbing higher.   Today\'s statement by the Federal Reserve appeared to address those concerns. The statement said that the higher short-term interest rates were ""designed to maintain favorable trends in inflation"" -- language that skirted the zero-inflation goal of the central bank\'s hard-liners. The statement also indicated that the central bank\'s policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee had reached its goal of a so-called neutral policy in which it supplies only enough money to the financial system to allow the economy to grow at a noninflationary rate.   ""These actions, combined with the three adjustments initiated earlier this year by the F.O.M.C., substantially remove the degree of monetary accommodation which prevailed throughout 1993,"" the statement said.

315,2006-03-28,"[""WASHINGTON, March 28 -- At Ben S. Bernanke's first meeting as head of the Federal Reserve's policy-making committee, the watchword was no surprises.   As expected, the Federal Open Market Committee raised the benchmark federal funds rate on Tuesday by a quarter of a percentage point, to 4.75 percent, and suggested that at least one more increase was in the cards. It was the 15th such increase in consecutive meetings of the committee.   In its statement describing the decision, the central bank veered little from the Fed's prior assessments of the economy and the expected path of monetary policy, underscoring Mr. Bernanke's stated intention to maintain the course set by his predecessor as Fed chairman, Alan Greenspan.   Despite its predictability, the Fed's statement still modestly unsettled financial markets, bolstering the dollar in foreign exchange markets and sending the prices of stocks and government bonds lower. The broad Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 0.64 percent, to 1,293.23. [Page C9.]   Though virtually all investors expected the rate increase, a substantial minority of operators on Wall Street had held hopes that the Fed would indicate that it would be the last one in the cycle that began in June 2004, when the benchmark rate stood at 1 percent. They were disappointed by the clear suggestion that the Fed still saw the need for further tightening.   ''He was paving the way for another rate hike,'' said Mickey D. Levy, chief economist at Bank of America. ''He knew full well that with this type of language the market would price in a hike to a 5 percent funds rate.''   The Fed's statement relied on words nearly identical to those used after the committee's previous meeting in January, Mr. Greenspan's last after 18 years as head of the central bank. It said that ''some further policy firming may be needed'' to keep inflation under wraps.   It pointed out that the economy was growing robustly after a slowdown in the fourth quarter of last year. It noted that core inflation, beyond food and energy, had ticked up only modestly, but it warned that the rising prices of energy and other commodities could add to inflation pressures in the future.   Though the committee's statement was pored over by financial analysts for any hint of the new chairman's intentions, the market tremors appeared to have little to do with the new management at the Fed.   Mr. Bernanke is expected to put his own stamp on the central bank eventually. He has long said that he supports more transparency, letting the markets know more clearly how the Fed reaches its decisions and what is the expected path of policy. He has argued in favor of setting a specific inflation target -- within a range -- to make explicit the Fed's goals.   He apparently judged Tuesday not to be the day for bold moves, however. Untested as Fed chairman, Mr. Bernanke had a clear interest in projecting continuity with the Greenspan Fed.   At most, the new statement provided a mere hint of Mr. Bernanke's desired transparency. ''It was the same policy message but with a little innovation in communication,'' said Laurence H. Meyer, a former Fed governor who is now an economic forecaster at Macroeconomic Advisers in Washington.   The whiff of change came in the second paragraph of the Fed's five-paragraph statement, the passage often referred to as the ''snapshot paragraph,'' in which the committee assesses current economic conditions. It offered a somewhat more detailed analysis of current conditions than the one issued in January.   Significantly, it calmed fears that wage increases might spur inflation by pointing out that productivity gains were holding down the growth in labor costs.   At the same time, the Fed went beyond the expected description of the economy's current status to elucidate what it saw as its likely future path. ''Economic growth has rebounded strongly in the current quarter,'' it said, adding that growth appeared ''likely to moderate to a more sustainable pace.''   Mr. Bernanke comes to the helm of the nation's central bank at a delicate moment for monetary policy. Since the Fed started increasing interest rates, financial markets have come to expect a quarter-point rise in interest rates at pretty much every committee meeting.   But after 15 consecutive rate increases, the cycle of monetary tightening is reaching its peak as interest rates approach what is seen as a ''neutral'' rate that is not so high that it slows economic growth but not so low that it allows inflationary fears to come back to life.   With underlying inflation at 1.8 percent, excluding food and energy, the Fed's preferred measure is still within the range of 1 percent to 2 percent considered comfortable by most officials. That leaves the Fed debating how far to raise rates merely to counter the risk of higher inflation as opposed to the reality of prices rising too fast.   In a note to investors, a Goldman Sachs economist, Andrew Tilton, said that ''the potential for disagreement on policy decisions increases now that the Fed is roughly at 'neutral' and the data become more important.''   With the economy growing at a healthy clip but facing the potential headwind of a weakening housing market, the decision on when to end the cycle of rising interest rates will not be trivial.   The outlook for inflation is slightly worse than in January, with increases in producer prices and consumer price inflation. Payrolls have expanded by some 200,000 a month and retail sales have grown sharply.   Fed economists have argued that a slowing housing market is likely to dampen overall economic growth. Housing, however, is not sinking yet. Sales of existing homes rose in February, housing starts remain strong and by some measures home prices are still rising.   In testimony to Congress last month, Mr. Bernanke argued that in coming quarters the Fed's policy-setting committee ''will have to make ongoing, provisional judgments about the risks to both inflation and growth, and monetary policy action will be increasingly dependent on incoming data.''   Given such uncertainties, mused Ethan S. Harris, chief economist of Lehman Brothers, ''Bernanke moved into the job right at the time it got interesting.''

''he was paving the way for another rate hike,'' said mickey d. levy, chief economist at bank of america. ''he knew full well that with this type of language the market would price in a hike to a 5 percent funds rate.''   the fed's statement relied on words nearly identical to those used after the committee's previous meeting in january, mr. greenspan's last after 18 years as head of the central bank. it said that ''some further policy firming may be needed'' to keep inflation under wraps.   it pointed out that the economy was growing robustly after a slowdown in the fourth quarter of last year. it noted that core inflation, beyond food and energy, had ticked up only modestly, but it warned that the rising prices of energy and other commodities could add to inflation pressures in the future.   though the committee's statement was pored over by financial analysts for any hint of the new chairman's intentions, the market tremors appeared to have little to do with the new management at the fed.   mr. bernanke is expected to put his own stamp on the central bank eventually. he has long said that he supports more transparency, letting the markets know more clearly how the fed reaches its decisions and what is the expected path of policy. he has argued in favor of setting a specific inflation target -- within a range -- to make explicit the fed's goals.   he apparently judged tuesday not to be the day for bold moves, however. untested as fed chairman, mr. bernanke had a clear interest in projecting continuity with the greenspan fed.   at most, the new statement provided a mere hint of mr. bernanke's desired transparency. ''it was the same policy message but with a little innovation in communication,'' said laurence h. meyer, a former fed governor who is now an economic forecaster at macroeconomic advisers in washington.   the whiff of change came in the second paragraph of the fed's five-paragraph statement, the passage often referred to as the ''snapshot paragraph,'' in which the committee assesses current economic conditions. it offered a somewhat more detailed analysis of current conditions than the one issued in january.   significantly, it calmed fears that wage increases might spur inflation by pointing out that productivity gains were holding down the growth in labor costs.   at the same time, the fed went beyond the expected description of the economy's current status to elucidate what it saw as its likely future path. ''economic growth has rebounded strongly in the current quarter,'' it said, adding that growth appeared ''likely to moderate to a more sustainable pace.''   mr. bernanke comes to the helm of the nation's central bank at a delicate moment for monetary policy. since the fed started increasing interest rates, financial markets have come to expect a quarter-point rise in interest rates at pretty much every committee meeting.   but after 15 consecutive rate increases, the cycle of monetary tightening is reaching its peak as interest rates approach what is seen as a ''neutral'' rate that is not so high that it slows economic growth but not so low that it allows inflationary fears to come back to life.   with underlying inflation at 1.8 percent, excluding food and energy, the fed's preferred measure is still within the range of 1 percent to 2 percent considered comfortable by most officials. that leaves the fed debating how far to raise rates merely to counter the risk of higher inflation as opposed to the reality of prices rising too fast.   in a note to investors, a goldman sachs economist, andrew tilton, said that ''the potential for disagreement on policy decisions increases now that the fed is roughly at 'neutral' and the data become more important.''   with the economy growing at a healthy clip but facing the potential headwind of a weakening housing market, the decision on when to end the cycle of rising interest rates will not be trivial.   the outlook for inflation is slightly worse than in january, with increases in producer prices and consumer price inflation. payrolls have expanded by some 200,000 a month and retail sales have grown sharply.   fed economists have argued that a slowing housing market is likely to dampen overall economic growth. housing, however, is not sinking yet. sales of existing homes rose in february, housing starts remain strong and by some measures home prices are still rising.   in testimony to congress last month, mr. bernanke argued that in coming quarters the fed's policy-setting committee ''will have to make ongoing, provisional judgments about the risks to both inflation and growth, and monetary policy action will be increasingly dependent on incoming data.''   given such uncertainties, mused ethan s. harris, chief economist of lehman brothers, ''bernanke moved into the job right at the time it got interesting.''   photo: traders at the new york stock exchange, moments after the fed announced a rise in the federal funds rate. stock prices fell yesterday.

317,2006-03-28,"['At his first policy meeting as Federal Reserve chairman, Ben Bernanke picked up where predecessor Alan Greenspan left off: with another quarter-point boost in interest rates, and a hint of more to come. But Mr. Bernanke put a modest stamp of his own on the Fed\'s closely watched postmeeting statement, by including a more explicit view of where the nation\'s economy is headed. The statement\'s forecast that economic growth appears likely ""to moderate to a more sustainable pace"" may be an early, though small, sign of his efforts to make the central bank\'s thinking more transparent. The Fed raised its target for the federal-funds rate, charged on overnight loans between banks, to 4.75% from 4.5%. In its statement released after the two-day meeting, the Fed said ""some further policy firming may be needed to keep"" the risks to growth and of inflation ""roughly in balance."" The language was identical to that used in the statement released after Mr. Greenspan\'s last meeting, on Jan. 31. Fed officials have indicated that saying policy firming ""may be needed"" simply keeps their options open on whether to raise rates again, and implies no commitment to do so. Nonetheless, financial markets, which had already thought it highly likely that the Fed would raise rates to 5% at its May 10 meeting, became even more convinced it would do so after reading the statement. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which had been up about 19 points before the Fed\'s afternoon announcement, finished the day down 95.57, or 0.9%, at 11154.54. The yield on the 10-year Treasury bond rose to 4.78% from 4.71% Monday. Yesterday\'s move was the Fed\'s 15th consecutive quarter-point rate increase since June 2004, when it began to raise rates from a 46-year low. The increase reflects a continuing view at the Fed that robust growth abroad and an economy near full capacity at home create a risk that inflation, though tame, could rise. The Fed said that while energy prices could boost underlying inflation, so far they have not, in part because of brisk productivity growth. ""Still, possible increases in resource utilization, in combination with the elevated prices of energy and other commodities, have the potential to add to inflation pressures,"" it said, in words similar to its Jan. 31 statement. The similarity of the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee\'s words and actions to those of Mr. Greenspan\'s on Jan. 31 may have reflected Mr. Bernanke\'s stated desire to maintain ""continuity."" But in one respect, the statement did break some new ground. It said the slowing growth of the nation\'s gross domestic product in the fourth quarter was due to ""temporary or special factors. Economic growth has rebounded strongly in the current quarter but appears likely to moderate to a more sustainable pace."" The inclusion of an explicit forecast differed from previous statements, which generally stuck to a snapshot of current economic conditions. Its reference to ""real GDP growth in the fourth quarter"" was also far more specific than previous statements, which seldom specified what data they were referring to. Mr. Bernanke has suggested that more discussion of the forecast would help markets more accurately predict the central bank\'s actions. ""What does it mean when the Fed is data-dependent?"" Mr. Bernanke said after a speech in New York last week. It means, he said, that with each new economic report, the Fed reconsiders ""where the economy is going to be a year down the road. The key statistic is the forecast."" Changes in the forecast, he said, drive rate decisions. In his earlier career as an academic, Mr. Bernanke worked extensively on economic modeling, which is used to make forecasts. And as a Fed governor from 2002 to 2005, he often met with Fed staff to discuss their forecast, dubbed the ""green book."" While Mr. Greenspan also considered forecasts important, he generally was reluctant to issue one, and often disagreed with the green book. Mr. Bernanke has argued for more transparency at the Fed and suggested the FOMC should release forecasts more often than twice a year, the current practice. The modest change in yesterday\'s statement suggests Mr. Bernanke may pursue his transparency initiatives in small, incremental steps. Other changes in the FOMC\'s communications and deliberations processes may have been considered at the meeting. Minutes of the discussion will be released April 18. Laurence Meyer, a former Fed governor who now analyzes the Fed for Macroeconomic Advisers, a St. Louis forecasting firm, said the statement reflected ""continuity in policy and innovation in communication."" While the forecast of moderating growth wasn\'t news, its inclusion in the statement served to temper potential market overreaction to the Fed\'s upbeat assessment of current conditions, he said. Fed officials have said their actions increasingly are driven by new economic data, which means they probably will soon stop giving hints about their next action on interest rates. David Greenlaw, an economist at Morgan Stanley, said more information on the Fed\'s forecast could help make up for such a loss of guidance on interest rates as markets try to figure out what the Fed will do next. The decision by the FOMC\'s 11 voting members was unanimous. Departing Federal Reserve Board Vice Chairman Roger Ferguson didn\'t attend. It is customary for departing FOMC members to skip their last meeting. Eleven of the Fed\'s 12 regional reserve banks asked for the accompanying increase in the little-used discount rate, charged on short-term Fed loans to commercial banks, to 5.75% from 5.5%. The exception was the Kansas City Fed. Many commercial banks yesterday raised their prime rate -- a benchmark for many consumer and business loans -- to 7.75% from 7.5%. Economists generally said that how much higher rates go depends mostly on whether the risk of inflation becomes reality. Ethan Harris, chief U.S. economist at Lehman Brothers, said, ""I think you\'re going to see both . . . tightening capacity and some kind of pickup in inflation."" He predicted the Fed will eventually lift its key rate to 5.5%. Larry Kantor, co-head of research at Barclays Capital, said, ""The financial environment is still stimulative: high stock prices, relatively low bond yields."" He predicted that even if the Fed paused soon it would have to resume raising rates shortly afterward. But Maury Harris, chief U.S. economist at UBS, said the Fed should stop raising rates now, arguing that the economy is already slowing. He noted that new-home sales and capital-goods orders, excluding aircraft and defense, dropped in February. Mr. Harris predicted growth will slow to an annual rate of 2.5% by the second half of the year from the current rate of about 4%. If the Fed raises rates further, it risks overshooting and making the slowdown worse, he said. However, he added that inflation is low enough that it is unlikely any such overshooting would trigger a recession. --- Online Today: WSJ.com subscribers can see how the Federal Reserve\'s statement compares with the previous one and read the full text of the Fed\'s statement.

At late afternoon in New York, the euro was at $1.2009 from $1.2069 prior to the Fed announcement and from $1.2011 late Monday. The dollar was at 117.98 yen from 117.26 yen pre-FOMC and from 116.70 yen late Monday, up more than a yen on the day. The dollar was changing hands at 1.3096 Swiss francs from 1.3094 francs late Monday, and the pound fetched $1.7435 from $1.7474. Although the rate increase had been universally anticipated, investors were relieved that the statement implied additional rate increases may be needed. ""It\'s not a particularly hawkish statement, but some people were expecting something overly dovish, and when that didn\'t happen the market responded"" by buying dollars, said Jens Nordvig, global markets economist at Goldman Sachs in New York. Expectations of higher U.S. interest rates have been supportive of the dollar in recent months because dollar-denominated assets thereby become more attractive to investors. The statements that accompany FOMC decisions have come under close scrutiny for clues as to a possible end to the tightening cycle. During the market lull that customarily precedes FOMC rate decisions, several U.S. senators made announcements regarding U.S. efforts to encourage China to adopt a more flexible currency regime. Two longtime critics of China\'s yuan policy, Sens. Charles Schumer (D., N.Y.) and Lindsey Graham (R., S.C.), said they would delay a vote on a bill they sponsor that could impose punitive tariffs of 27.5% on imports of Chinese goods if China fails to allow its currency to appreciate significantly. Also, Senate Finance Committee leaders said they would introduce a bill directing the Treasury Department to take a tougher line in dealing with currency manipulation by trading partners. --- Azam Ahmed in New York, Elizabeth Price in Washington and Alastair Stewart in Sao Paulo contributed to this article.

321,1998-05-19,"['WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve again decided to hold short-term interest rates steady, even though an amazingly strong U.S. economy has pushed the unemployment rate well below the level some inflation-fearing Fed officials consider wise. The decision to keep the key federal-funds rate at 5.5% was widely expected on Wall Street both because new turmoil in Asian financial markets make them particularly vulnerable to a surprise Fed move and because Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan had said nothing in public to prepare the markets for a rate increase. Some Fed watchers expect the Fed to raise shortterm rates later this year, unless the depressing effect of Asia\'s financial crisis or something else slows the economy from its robust pace. Seven of the 18 economists surveyed weekly by Macroeconomic Advisers, a St. Louis forecasting company, expect a 1/4 percentage point rate boost before Labor Day. Indeed, going into yesterday\'s meeting, some Fed officials were ready to raise rates as insurance against an acceleration of inflation from the current historical low level. But Mr. Greenspan apparently was not. The Fed won\'t disclose until early July whether any members of its policy-making Federal Open Market Committee formally dissented from yesterday\'s decision. However, economic forecasters suggest that economic growth may slow significantly in coming months from the better-than-3% pace of the past six quarters without a Fed rate boost. ""For the Fed to remain on hold, significant moderation of economic activity . . . needs to be seen . . . certainly by the Aug. 18 meeting,"" Merrill Lynch & Co. economist Bruce Steinberg said. ""We expect such moderation."" Even with last month\'s uptick in consumer prices, the government\'s consumer price index has risen just 1.4% during the past 12 months, equal to the lowest reading since December 1988 when falling oil prices damped inflation -- and close to the Fed\'s long-stated goal of ""price stability."" With inflation so low, some Fed officials have argued, the Fed can afford to take a wait-and-see stance. Business and labor groups that have been urging Mr. Greenspan to keep his hands off the interest-rate trigger greeted the Fed decision warmly. ""The wisest course is inaction,"" the National Association of Manufacturers said. ""The risk of doing it [raising rates], given Asia and the stock market, exceeded the risk of not doing it,"" said the National Federation of Independent Business. The stock market declined after the widely expected decision. A survey of 35 Wall Street economists by Dow Jones Newswires and CNBC found 33 of them predicted no change in rates. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which had been up more than 50 points just before the Fed announcement, gave back nearly all the day\'s gains to finish up 3.74 to 9054.65. The bond market had little reaction. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year bond was down 6/32, or $1.875 for a bond with a $1,000 face value, at 102 17/32. The bond\'s yield rose to 5.933%. The Fed doesn\'t give any explanation when the committee maintains its current target for the federal-funds rate, at which banks lend money to one another overnight. Yesterday was no exception. The Fed simply said at about 2:15 p.m. EDT that its committee meeting had ended at 1:35 p.m. The committee next meets in a two-day session on June 30 and July 1. The Fed\'s summary of its March 31 meeting will be released tomorrow and closely scrutinized for clues to the Fed\'s thinking. The Fed changed its stance in March and concluded that rates were more likely to rise than fall in the near future. The summary will explain the reasons for that shift.

323,1990-10-02,"[""WASHINGTON, Oct. 2 -- Faced with a revolt in his party's Congressional ranks and wariness around the country, President Bush appealed on television tonight for public support of the budget compromise he and Congressional leaders struck last weekend. He predicted ''economic chaos if we fail to reduce the deficit.''   Faced with a revolt in his party's Congressional ranks and wariness around the country, President Bush appealed on television tonight for public support of the budget compromise he and Congressional leaders struck last weekend. He predicted ''economic chaos if we fail to reduce the deficit.''   In a show of bipartisanship that verged on coalition Government, the President was followed with a broadcast by Senator George J. Mitchell of Maine, the Democratic leader. He urged support for the President ''because the nation is more important than partisan differences.'' [Transcripts of the Bush and Mitchell speeches appear on page D28.] Mr. Mitchell was preaching to the converted for the most part. Despite considerable opposition among liberals, a majority of Congressional Democrats appear to support the agreement.   Tough Task for Bush   But Mr. Bush has the more difficult task of swaying enough dissident Republicans to win enactment of the plan.   The President said that neither he nor anyone else was completely satisfied with the compromise, but he said it was ''the best agreement that can be legislated now.''   In the strongest statement he has made about economic perils that might lie ahead, Mr. Bush emphasized: ''If we fail to enact this agreement, our economy will falter, markets may tumble and recession will follow.''   He called on the public to ''tell your Congressmen and Senators you support this deficit-reduction agreement.''   A Bipartisan Appeal   The President continued: ''If they are Republicans, urge them to stand with the President. If they are Democrats, urge them to stand with their Congressional leaders.''   ''Those who dislike one part or another may pick our agreement apart,'' Mr. Bush said, ''but if they do, believe me, the political reality is no one can put a better one back together again.''   Senator Mitchell made almost identical points. He would have preferred ''a budget that asks more from the wealthy and less from the elderly,'' he said. But as for the compromise, he concluded, ''For America's economic future, we have to pass it.''   Personal Appeals   The President spent most of the day making personal appeals to Republican lawmakers, who are the crucial to passage. He invited about three dozen of them to the White House in three groups and telephoned several others.   Early indications were that the arm-twisting, based on personal and party loyalty, was paying dividends.   ''I think the President can win,'' said Representative Vin Weber of Minnesota, a leader of the right flank of the party in the House that is opposing the budget plan.   ''The President has already made it a test of party loyalty,'' Mr. Weber added.   Opposition From Republicans   A preliminary count showed 60 or 70 of the 176 House Republicans firmly against the plan, a handful committed to it unequivocally and the rest undecided, at least officially.   Representative Jerry Lewis of California, the third-ranking member of the Republican leadership and a supporter of the President, observed that the vocal opposition was largely coming from the most conservative Republicans and the most liberal Democrats.   ''There ought to be a lot of room in the middle for a majority of our party to support it,'' Mr. Lewis said.   In the maneuvering today, John H. Sununu, Mr. Bush's chief of staff, Richard G. Darman, the budget director, and other top policy makers were arguing that it was essential to support the President and enforce party discipline, according to Administration officials and lawmakers who talked to the President.   Many other Administration officials have dropped almost everything to concentrate on winning approval of the budget plan.   Vice President Dan Quayle made dozens of calls to lawmakers and was interviewed by the television networks and local stations. Mr. Quayle and Michael J. Boskin, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, canceled campaign trips for Republicans challenging Congressional Democrats so they could stay Washington for the hard sell.   Federal Reserve's View   Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, had nothing to do with devising the budget plan, but he may be a crucial player in selling it. In their lobbying, Administration officials are citing Mr. Greenspan's view that interest rates will come down if the politicians enact a credible longterm plan to lower the deficit.   Lower rates would encourage companies and individuals to borrow and spend and thus stimulate the economy. Moreover, they would mean the Government would have to pay less on the money it borrows.   The Federal Open Market Committee, the policy-making arm of the Federal Reserve, met here today, but as usual its decisions were not announced.   Mr. Bush, meanwhile, was describing the deal as good for America and the best he could get from a Congress controlled by Democrats.   First Test Is Thursday   Republican opponents of the plan are maintaining that the higher taxes it calls for and the lack of a lower tax rate on capital gains would drain an already flagging economy and increase the likelihood of a recession.   The first test votes in both chambers are scheduled for Thursday on the overall budget resolution, which is a broad framework for spending and taxes but not the specific policies. If the measure clears this hurdle, the crucial votes will come week after next on the particular elements of the agreement.   Some lawmakers are predicting that the House might reject the resolution Thursday in a sort of protest vote and then pass the measure the next day.   The White House and Congressional leaders are confident that the plan will pass the Senate with the support of a majority of senators from both parties. The party leaders in the Senate, Mr. Mitchell, and Bob Dole, Republican of Kansas, worked on a strategy today to have the Senate vote first to increase the pressure on the House. But Mr. Mitchell said this afternoon that the parliamentary rules might make that impossible.   The plan also faces serious opposition among liberal Democrats in the House and around the country. But if a majority of House Republicans backs the measure, a majority of House Democrats will almost certainly go along, some out of loyalty to their leaders, others because they realize that it is the best plan they can get and that reducing the deficit is of primary importance.   The liberals argue that higher taxes on gasoline and other products would place too much of the burden of deficit reduction on poor and middle-income Americans and that deep cuts in Medicare would make the plan even more unfair.   Opposition From Governors   From Albany, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo expressed the liberal opposition. ''I believe this deal would be surrender to the failed policies of the last 10 years and should be rejected,'' the Democrat wrote in a letter to the New York Congressional delegation.   ''It makes things worse for the middle class, the elderly, the states and local governments,'' he continued.   Gov. L. Douglas Wilder of Virginia made similar points in a letter he sent to Ronald H. Brown, chairman of the Democratic National Committee who is a supporter of the plan. ''Our two-party system,'' Governor Wilder wrote, ''is becoming a competition between the party inside Washington and that new party, the vast majority of Americans who live outside.''   Earlier today at the White House, Mr. Bush gave his pitch to a group of business leaders. ''This budget agreement is our last best chance to get the Federal budget deficit under control,'' he said. ''To all the people that disagree and the people on the sidelines that are rushing out and having their press conferences and the critics, let me say this: 'You can pick the package apart, but you cannot realistically put a better package together.' ''   He apologized to the business group for abandoning his drive for a lower capital gains tax. ''The philosophy I was elected on runs out of gas in terms of votes in the United States Congress,'' he declared.   Marlin Fitzwater, the White House press secretary, said Mr. Bush would continue to press for the budget compromise in speeches around the country, beginning with New England stops on Thursday and Friday.   ''A lot of people who disagree with this,'' Mr. Fitzwater said. ''A lot of people have trouble with it. And they need to be convinced. And we'll do our best.''

324,2002-06-26,"['NEW YORK -- Whacked by the disclosure of a major accounting fraud at WorldCom Inc., the dollar tumbled against its key counterparts, at one point coming within striking distance of parity with the euro and prompting talk of a major meltdown in the U.S. currency. The dollar did regain some lost ground later in the session in line with gains in U.S. stocks, but the currency still ended New York trading around nine-month lows against the yen, a 28-month trough against the euro and at its weakest mark against the Swiss franc in close to three years. At one point, the euro traded as high as 99.45 cents, stoking talk that the common currency could reach the elusive bar of parity with the dollar as early as this week. Meanwhile, the dollar shrugged off a low-key monetary-policy statement from the Federal Open Market Committee, after the U.S. central bank left its key interest rates unchanged for the fourth time this year. The Fed said the economic outlook remains foggy, with risks ""balanced"" between inflation and too-slow economic growth. The message implied the Fed isn\'t preparing to raise or lower interest rates. As well as being sold off heavily on the Worldcom scandal, market participants also took comments from President Bush as an effective green light to sell the currency. Signaling that the U.S. won\'t likely step into the foreign-exchange market and try to prop up the flagging dollar, Mr. Bush said late Tuesday that market forces and economic fundamentals will determine the dollar\'s exchange rate, in the process casting doubt about the very existence of a so-called strong-dollar policy. Treasury officials scrambled to mop up any confusion sparked by Mr. Bush\'s rare foray into foreign-exchange policy, insisting that there was no change to the Bush administration\'s commitment to a strong currency. ""Nothing new. No change in dollar policy,"" a Treasury spokesman said. But currency-market participants viewed Mr. Bush\'s statement as a sign that the government won\'t stand in the way of a falling dollar, certainly as long as the decline in the currency doesn\'t transform into a straight-line plunge. ""The price of explicitly abandoning [the policy] is very high,"" said Jason Bonanca, vice president and foreign-exchange analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston in New York. He said Mr. Bush\'s remarks were ""one of many pieces of commentary that suggest that there is significant dilution of exactly what it means.""

While the selloff in the dollar might have been overdone -- on an intraday basis, the euro jumped as much as 1. 5%, sterling by 1. 4% and the yen by 2% -- the WorldCom fraud nonetheless focused attention on the deep doubts hanging over what had been a covenant of faith between U.S. corporations and shareholders. It also raised the question of how many other U.S. companies might have engaged in similar practices. ""This brings attention to speculative excesses that bloated values in the telecommunications sector,"" said John Lonski, chief economist at Moody\'s Investors Service. As a result of WorldCom, ""investors will be increasingly wary of building up further positions within U.S. equities,"" which in turn is expected to ""speed up the pace of dollar\'s decline,"" said Michael Woolfolk, currency strategist with the Bank of New York. There were already key signs that the retreat from U.S. assets -- in particular equities - was gaining pace, which has already been weighing on the dollar. But the prospect of a rapid withdrawal from U.S. asset markets raises an additional raft of fears for the currency, which has effectively metamorphosed into a barometer of global risk.

The dollar failed even to get lasting respite from several rounds of intervention by the Bank of Japan, which is keen to stop a strong yen from derailing Japan\'s frail economic recovery. There were some silver linings for the dollar, however. The dollar gained against many of the key peripheral currencies -- including the so-called commodity bloc of the Australian, New Zealand and Canadian dollars as well as most Latin American currencies. At one point the Mexican peso, which tends to trade in tandem with the dollar, saw its rate against the dollar drop as far as 10.0725 pesos, a two-year low and well down from late Tuesday\'s 9.9010 pesos. But the peso also recovered some ground as the dollar clawed back, ending the day at 9.9575 pesos to the dollar. --- John Parry and Kristyne Demske contributed to this article.']","['new york -- whacked by the disclosure of a major accounting fraud at worldcom inc., the dollar tumbled against its key counterparts, at one point coming within striking distance of parity with the euro and prompting talk of a major meltdown in the u.s. currency. the dollar did regain some lost ground later in the session in line with gains in u.s. stocks, but the currency still ended new york trading around nine-month lows against the yen, a 28-month trough against the euro and at its weakest mark against the swiss franc in close to three years. at one point, the euro traded as high as 99.45 cents, stoking talk that the common currency could reach the elusive bar of parity with the dollar as early as this week. meanwhile, the dollar shrugged off a low-key monetary-policy statement from the federal open market committee, after the u.s. central bank left its key interest rates unchanged for the fourth time this year. the fed said the economic outlook remains foggy, with risks ""balanced"" between inflation and too-slow economic growth. the message implied the fed isn't preparing to raise or lower interest rates. as well as being sold off heavily on the worldcom scandal, market participants also took comments from president bush as an effective green light to sell the currency. signaling that the u.s. won't likely step into the foreign-exchange market and try to prop up the flagging dollar, mr. bush said late tuesday that market forces and economic fundamentals will determine the dollar's exchange rate, in the process casting doubt about the very existence of a so-called strong-dollar policy. treasury officials scrambled to mop up any confusion sparked by mr. bush's rare foray into foreign-exchange policy, insisting that there was no change to the bush administration's commitment to a strong currency.

325,2002-06-26,"[""WASHINGTON, June 26 -- Faced with corporate scandals, skittish financial markets and an economic recovery that has little traction so far, the Federal Reserve voted today to hold interest rates steady, saying it was not yet clear how soon the outlook would improve. As it has all year, the Fed said it expected the economy to pick up, and it hinted again that it planned to raise rates eventually. But it acknowledged that the rebound appears to have lost some momentum, perhaps only temporarily. And it concluded that the risks remained evenly balanced for now between an economic rebound and a slowdown that could lead to another recession or a broad-based decline in prices. In its statement, the Fed did not mention the stock market's dive, the dollar's weakness or the corporate malfeasance that has undermined confidence among investors in the United States and around the world. But analysts said those factors weighed on the policy-making Federal Open Market Committee as it decided for the fourth consecutive time to leave official interest rates at their lowest levels in 40 years. In a unanimous decision to hold rates unchanged, the Fed left its main tool for influencing the economy, the federal funds target rate on overnight loans among banks, at 1.75 percent, where it has been since December. The Fed lowered rates 11 times last year, by a total of 4.75 percentage points, as the economy slid into recession and then suffered from the disruptions caused by the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11. Economists, after assuming early this year that the Fed would be raising rates by summer, said they did not now expect any increases before the fall, and maybe not until next year. In setting policy, the Fed committee confronted unusually strong cross-currents in the economy. There was fresh evidence today of an improving outlook, in the form of a record increase in new-home sales last month and a solid pickup in orders for durable goods. Many analysts are forecasting improving corporate earnings this year. Inflation is dormant. And overall economic growth, while markedly lower in the current quarter than the 5.6 percent annual pace in the first quarter, remains reasonably healthy. But there is a long list of potential pitfalls remaining. Unemployment may not yet have reached its peak. The economy, after benefiting early this year from businesses' restocking their inventories, has yet to register any substantial rebound in capital spending by companies. The huge and expanding trade and current-account deficits are weighing heavily on the dollar, raising the risk of a destabilizing decline in the currency's value. Tension in the Middle East and concern about further terrorist attacks continue to cast a shadow over the economy. And a parade of revelations of corporate fraud could drive stock prices even lower, further undermining investor confidence. ''Inflation has been beaten into at least temporary submission, the economic recovery looks a little fragile, and stocks are plummeting,'' said Bill Cheney, chief economist at John Hancock Financial Services in Boston. ''It's not the easiest moment to figure out what to do, but on balance the Fed can afford to wait and see what happens.'' The weakness in the financial markets has even set off speculation that the Fed could cut interest rates again this year, although analysts said a rate reduction remained a long shot unless stocks plunged further or the economy suffered some other kind of damaging shock. The Fed began its two-day meeting on Tuesday afternoon, just before WorldCom, the nation's second-largest long-distance carrier, disclosed that it had overstated its cash flow by more than $3.8 billion over the last five quarters. The disclosure made WorldCom the latest in a string of prominent companies to restate its earnings, a trend that has undermined faith in corporate financial information and, more broadly, called into question the kind of aggressive capitalism that distinguished the American economy in the 1990's. ''It certainly feels like death by a thousand cuts,'' said Ian Morris, chief United States economist at HSBC in New York. In a report today, Mr. Morris said he now expected the Fed to leave rates unchanged for the rest of the year ''due to equities and a growing list of corporate and geopolitical risks.'' With questions increasing about how much of the economy's apparent potential is real and how much was a result of misguided financial engineering, the Fed today re-emphasized its belief in a ''robust underlying growth in productivity.'' Productivity, or output per hour, is the crucial gauge of business's ability to produce more for less and is the most basic measure of an economy's capacity to grow without generating inflation. After languishing for two decades, the growth rate of productivity began picking up in the mid-1990's, and to the surprise of many economists held up well last year during the recession, even accelerating at times. The Fed otherwise struck a measured, and in some ways ambivalent, tone in its assessment of the economy, and offered only the vaguest of timetables for improvement. ''The information that has become available since the last meeting of the committee confirms that economic activity is continuing to increase,'' it said. ''However, both the upward impetus from the swing in inventory investment and the growth in final demand appear to have moderated,'' the statement continued, alluding to the short-  and long-term measures of economic activity the Fed has been tracking most closely in assessing the outlook. ''The committee expects the rate of increase in final demand to pick up over coming quarters, supported in part by robust underlying growth in productivity, but the degree of the strengthening remains uncertain.''""]","[""washington, june 26 -- faced with corporate scandals, skittish financial markets and an economic recovery that has little traction so far, the federal reserve voted today to hold interest rates steady, saying it was not yet clear how soon the outlook would improve. as it has all year, the fed said it expected the economy to pick up, and it hinted again that it planned to raise rates eventually. but it acknowledged that the rebound appears to have lost some momentum, perhaps only temporarily. and it concluded that the risks remained evenly balanced for now between an economic rebound and a slowdown that could lead to another recession or a broad-based decline in prices. in its statement, the fed did not mention the stock market's dive, the dollar's weakness or the corporate malfeasance that has undermined confidence among investors in the united states and around the world. but analysts said those factors weighed on the policy-making federal open market committee as it decided for the fourth consecutive time to leave official interest rates at their lowest levels in 40 years. in a unanimous decision to hold rates unchanged, the fed left its main tool for influencing the economy, the federal funds target rate on overnight loans among banks, at 1.75 percent, where it has been since december. the fed lowered rates 11 times last year, by a total of 4.75 percentage points, as the economy slid into recession and then suffered from the disruptions caused by the terrorist attacks on sept. 11. economists, after assuming early this year that the fed would be raising rates by summer, said they did not now expect any increases before the fall, and maybe not until next year. in setting policy, the fed committee confronted unusually strong cross-currents in the economy. there was fresh evidence today of an improving outlook, in the form of a record increase in new-home sales last month and a solid pickup in orders for durable goods. many analysts are forecasting improving corporate earnings this year. inflation is dormant. and overall economic growth, while markedly lower in the current quarter than the 5.6 percent annual pace in the first quarter, remains reasonably healthy. but there is a long list of potential pitfalls remaining. unemployment may not yet have reached its peak. the economy, after benefiting early this year from businesses' restocking their inventories, has yet to register any substantial rebound in capital spending by companies. the huge and expanding trade and current-account deficits are weighing heavily on the dollar, raising the risk of a destabilizing decline in the currency's value. tension in the middle east and concern about further terrorist attacks continue to cast a shadow over the economy. and a parade of revelations of corporate fraud could drive stock prices even lower, further undermining investor confidence.

327,2009-01-28,"['The Federal Reserve inched toward a new program to purchase long-term U.S. Treasury securities, possibly the next step in the central bank\'s battle against a recession that it said has only deepened in recent weeks. ""Industrial production, housing starts and employment have continued to decline steeply, as consumers and businesses have cut back spending,"" Fed officials said Wednesday in a policy statement following a two-day meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, which sets the central bank\'s direction. ""Furthermore, global demand appears to be slowing significantly."" The Fed has already pulled its main lever for managing the economy as far as it can. Its benchmark short-term interest rate -- the federal-funds rate -- hovers near zero, and policy makers reiterated the rate would remain low ""for some time."" With the funds rate about as low as it can go, officials are focused on developing new lending and asset-purchase programs to bring down an array of other interest rates and boost the economy. On the list of next steps could be an effort to buy long-term government debt, which could in effect lower rates on mortgages and other debt. But the Fed is taking a slow path toward embracing the idea, something that has unsettled some investors. Disappointed that the central bank didn\'t take a more decisive step toward buying government bonds, investors sold Treasury bonds Wednesday. An effort to buy long-term government bonds could help the economy broadly because many kinds of debt -- from mortgages to corporate bonds -- are benchmarked to Treasury yields. Fed purchases could raise Treasury prices, which would reduce their yields and thus yields on other kinds of debt. Still, it would be a controversial move at a time when government budget deficits are soaring. Some might see it as an inflationary move to finance deficits by printing money. With economic slack building so abruptly around the world, Fed officials don\'t see inflation as a worry now. In their statement, they pointed to a different worry: that inflation would fall below their comfort levels, believed to be roughly between 1% and 2%. An abrupt fall in inflation raises the inflation-adjusted cost of borrowing, which could be a new hindrance to growth and recovery. Two other programs geared toward the credit market are still in the process of being ramped up. Officials have high hopes they will more directly ease strains afflicting consumers and businesses. In one, the Fed is buying $600 billion of securities issued or guaranteed by government-linked mortgage-finance companies like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. In the other, which won\'t be operational until February, it will provide up to $200 billion of financing to investors buying securities tied to consumer debt like car loans or credit cards. ""There are lots of channels through which the Fed is working hard and using its balance sheet to ease financial conditions,"" said Richard Berner, chief U.S. economist with Morgan Stanley. ""Buying Treasurys is only one of those."" Operationally, buying Treasurys would be easy for the Fed after a year of complicated efforts to revive markets. It has clear legal authority to buy government debt and the markets desk of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York has a long history of trading bonds with securities dealers. The approach is favored by some members of the Fed\'s policy-making arm, the Federal Open Market Committee. Dissenting from the Fed\'s latest policy statement Wednesday, Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, said purchasing Treasury bonds was preferable to the Fed\'s many other new lending programs. Moreover, Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke has highlighted the possibility of Treasury purchases twice in speeches since December. In its statement Wednesday, the central bank said it ""is prepared"" to take such a step, stronger language than it has used before. But the Fed said it depended on ""evolving circumstances,"" and whether such a move would translate into help for private-sector debt markets. It offered no plan for moving forward on such purchases. The market sold off sharply on the hesitant approach. The 10 and 30-year Treasury bonds fell on the day by 1 9/32 points and 4 11/32 points, respectively. Treasury yields are still very low. The yield on a 10-year note hit 2.66% Wednesday. Still, they have pushed higher in recent weeks, from just above 2% in December. Uncertainty about the Fed is one factor pushing yields up recently. A range of other factors are at play, from the mountain of supply hitting the market as deficits rise, to concerns that foreign buyers may back away as the global economy contracts. Many estimates put the Treasury\'s borrowings this year at $1.5 trillion to $2 trillion. In recent years, $300 billion was considered a large amount. Peter Hooper, chief economist for Deutsche Bank, said the Fed hasn\'t felt much pressure to begin the program because Treasury yields have been so low. But ""if Treasury yields rise appreciably,"" he said, then the program ""becomes a more important part of the picture."" The economic backdrop is souring fast.

328,2009-01-28,"[""For one day, at least, battered bank stocks actually helped the markets. Reports that the government was considering a deal to set up a ''bad bank'' to absorb toxic assets ignited a broad rally on Wednesday, with financial companies leading the way. It was Wall Street's third consecutive day of gains, which reached across all sectors. The Obama administration did not announce formal plans to absorb billions of dollars in toxic assets still lingering on the balance sheets of banks. But the Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, has confirmed that officials were considering such a system, to be run by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. ''Investors are concluding that if the F.D.I.C. is going to run the bad bank and take on all the bad assets of the commercial banking system, then they will suddenly be transformed overnight into good banks,'' said Ed Yardeni, president of Yardeni Research, who added, ''which is a bit of a stretch.'' Stocks rose to their highest point in two weeks, injecting a note of cheer into markets that have been stricken by new fears about the scope of the economic downturn. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 200.72 points, or 2.46 percent, to 8,375.45, while the broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index jumped 28.38 points, or 3.36 percent, to 874.09. The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index increased 53.44 points, or 3.55 percent, to 1,558.34. Once again, investors watched developments in Washington as the House prepared to vote on an $825 billion stimulus plan that contains a combination of tax cuts and new spending. And a statement released by the Federal Open Market Committee indicated that interest rates would stay near zero in the face of the persistent recession. The Fed indicated it was growing more concerned about deflation and the health of the economy and said it was willing to expand programs to buy mortgage-backed securities, which are aimed at unfreezing the credit markets. ''The Federal Reserve will employ all available tools to promote the resumption of sustainable economic growth and to preserve price stability,'' the committee said in a statement. Wells Fargo posted a fourth-quarter loss of $2.55 billion, its profit hurt by mortgage assets that it assumed after it took over Wachovia. But the results were better than some analysts had expected, sending the stock up $5, or 30.88 percent, to $21.19. Financial companies including Citigroup, Bank of America, Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase rose by double digits. Citigroup gained 66 cents, or 18.59 percent, to $4.21. Bank of America jumped 89 cents, or 13.69 percent, to $7.39. Morgan Stanley rose $3.48, or 17.83 percent, to $23. JPMorgan jumped $2.60, or 10.38 percent, to $27.66. Shares of banks and brokerage firms were pummeled in 2008 as the credit crisis unfolded and troubles in mortgage-backed assets came to light.

329,2009-01-28,"[""WASHINGTON -- As lawmakers pressed the Obama administration for details of how it would assist financial firms that have been rapidly deteriorating, Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner said Wednesday the administration is working on a comprehensive plan to ''repair the financial system.'' Mr. Geithner declined to provide any specific details or to address rising calls for the creation of a government institution to buy or guarantee the declining assets at several of the nation's largest banks. He discouraged speculation that the plan would include the nationalization of some banks. ''We have a financial system that is run by private shareholders, managed by private institutions, and we'd like to do our best to preserve that system,'' he said. But bank stocks surged on hopes the government was moving toward creating a ''bad bank'' to purge toxic assets from balance sheets that are rapidly deteriorating as the economy worsens. On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve cautioned that the economy was still spiraling downward on many fronts. According to several Wall Street officials, senior administration members spent the weekend and the last few days reaching out to top bankers for their views on how a bad bank should be structured. Lawrence H. Summers, head of the White House's National Economic Council; Sheila C. Bair, the Federal Insurance Deposit Corporation chairwoman; and Mr. Geithner have been involved in the talks, the Wall Street officials said. Federal policy makers are discussing how to use the second $350 billion portion of bailout funds. About $50 billion to $100 billion is expected to be allocated to stave off home foreclosures. That would leave up to $250 billion available for the banks, with the bulk going to buying troubled assets. On Wednesday, the head of the Congressional Budget Office told lawmakers that weakening banks would probably need hundreds of billions in additional funds beyond the Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP. But administration officials believe that trillions of dollars more may be needed to buy the majority of bad assets from banks. ''The size of the problem is so large that no one knows if you just wiped out all the assets, how much it would cost,'' said Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York and vice chairman of the Joint Economic Committee. He added that a number of officials estimate it may take up to $3 trillion to $4 trillion to buy the bad assets. Federal officials are trying to find a delicate balance between stabilizing banks and keeping the nation's finances steady. Mr. Summers privately expressed concern last week that spending too much to buy bad assets could cripple the dollar, according to a person who spoke with him. Administration officials are also worried that lawmakers might reject the high price tag. At the same time, spending too little may not provide enough to plug the deepening hole. ''None of the solutions are very easy,'' Mr. Schumer said. ''All of these proposals sound very appealing until you start to examine them in detail. And then you find that all of them have problems. The good bank-bad bank idea -- the problem, first and foremost, is how do you value the assets? No one knows how to do that.'' Lawmakers have complained that the $350 billion already spent under TARP has failed to prevent institutions from continuing to decline. On Wednesday, several senior members of Congress, including Christopher J. Dodd, chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, and Barney Frank, chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, urged the administration to detail swiftly how it will run the assets program. Administration officials have been moving with some caution. They say that they hope to avoid the spectacle of the last administration, which lurched from policy to policy, and in the process lost some credibility in Congress. Senior officials including Ben S. Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, and Ms. Bair have recommended that the new administration consider a so-called aggregator bank that would relieve banks of their worst assets. Such a move, they contend, would restore investor confidence in the banks and encourage investors to provide them with fresh capital. One version of the plan being floated by bankers would have the F.D.I.C. take the lead in running the ''bad bank'' and buying the toxic assets for a combination of cash and notes backed by the bad bank. In return, the government would demand some sort of equity stake. The banks would still be responsible for collecting payments on the loans that they sold, according to bankers briefed on the situation. Other issues still need to be resolved, including how the government would determine what to pay for the toxic assets, which assets would qualify, and what conditions might be attached. Also under discussion was whether to require banks that dump their assets into the fund to separately raise private capital. That could put pressure on weaker banks. Government officials are considering other ideas for stabilizing the financial system. Those include expanding the types of government guarantees given to Citigroup and Bank of America to cover more assets at more financial companies. Another idea is to pour even more federal money into the banks, possibly in return for common stock. In a sense the debate over creation of an aggregator bank or nationalization is really a discussion over how much to expand policies begun during the Bush administration, officials said on Wednesday. The government in effect has already nationalized several large institutions, including the American International Group, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, when it seized control. And it has taken the same steps as creating a bad bank when it took $29 billion in assets held by Bear Stearns and guaranteed more than $300 billion in declining assets at Citigroup. Officials said the debate within the administration was over how much and under what terms to extend those programs to other institutions. Compounding the complexity is the fact that the administration is simultaneously asking for a stimulus package of more than $800 billion. Moreover, as the excesses of Wall Street -- from expensive corporate jets at Citigroup to huge bonuses and extravagant renovations at Merrill Lynch -- ring through Capitol Hill, the idea of a large bailout that does not penalize shareholders and senior executives becomes a tough sell. The concept of a bad bank has gained momentum in the financial industry as the economy deteriorates, slashing the value of risky assets on banks' books and increasing the need for banks to hold capital against those losses. Shares in Citigroup and Bank of America, which both recently received a second taxpayer lifeline, surged 19 percent and 14 percent respectively as the stock market rose on optimism that the administration would relieve banks of money-losing assets. The Fed said Wednesday the economy remained gloomy, and vowed to use ''all available tools to promote the resumption of sustainable economic growth and to preserve price stability.'' Its Federal Open Market Committee voted to keep the federal funds target rate at zero to 0.25 percent. Analysts estimated that the economy contracted by more than 5 percent in the fourth quarter, one of the sharpest quarterly drops in decades. Employers eliminated two million jobs from September through December. In the past, the Fed has tried to steer the overall economy almost entirely through the federal funds rate, the rate that banks charge each other to lend overnight reserves. But because banks remained reluctant to lend, even after the Fed lowered the overnight rate time after time, the central bank began creating new programs last fall in which it stepped in as a lender itself. To push down interest rates on mortgages, the Fed began a program this month to buy $500 billion in mortgage-backed securities issued by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the federal agencies. Buying large volumes of a security pushes up its price in the market, which leads to lower yields or interest rates. Thus far, the Fed has bought about $53 billion of the securities. But rates for the kind of traditional mortgages that Fannie and Freddie guarantee dropped sharply and stayed low as soon as the Fed announced plans for the program in late November. The committee also served notice that it might purchase longer-term Treasury bonds, a move that would drive down long-term interest rates of all types. In the next several weeks, the Fed expects to start a $200 billion program to finance securities backed by consumer loans, including car loans and credit card debt. This month, the Fed started a program to buy $500 billion in mortgage-backed securities. Wednesday's policy vote was not unanimous. Jeffrey M.

330,2009-01-28,"[""Following is the full text of the statement by the Federal Reserve on Wednesday announcing it was holding its base federal funds target rate at a record low between zero and 0.25 percent: The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to keep its target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent. The committee continues to anticipate that economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for some time. Information received since the committee met in December suggests that the economy has weakened further. Industrial production, housing starts and employment have continued to decline steeply, as consumers and businesses have cut back spending. Furthermore, global demand appears to be slowing significantly. Conditions in some financial markets have improved, in part reflecting government efforts to provide liquidity and strengthen financial institutions; nevertheless, credit conditions for households and firms remain extremely tight. The committee anticipates that a gradual recovery in economic activity will begin later this year, but the downside risks to that outlook are significant. In light of the declines in the prices of energy and other commodities in recent months and the prospects for considerable economic slack, the committee expects that inflation pressures will remain subdued in coming quarters. Moreover, the committee sees some risk that inflation could persist for a time below rates that best foster economic growth and price stability in the longer term. The Federal Reserve will employ all available tools to promote the resumption of sustainable economic growth and to preserve price stability. The focus of the committee's policy is to support the functioning of financial markets and stimulate the economy through open market operations and other measures that are likely to keep the size of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet at a high level. The Federal Reserve continues to purchase large quantities of agency debt and mortgage-backed securities to provide support to the mortgage and housing markets, and it stands ready to expand the quantity of such purchases and the duration of the purchase program as conditions warrant.

''we have a financial system that is run by private shareholders, managed by private institutions, and we'd like to do our best to preserve that system,'' he said. but bank stocks surged on hopes the government was moving toward creating a ''bad bank'' to purge toxic assets from balance sheets that are rapidly deteriorating as the economy worsens. on wednesday, the federal reserve cautioned that the economy was still spiraling downward on many fronts. according to several wall street officials, senior administration members spent the weekend and the last few days reaching out to top bankers for their views on how a bad bank should be structured. lawrence h. summers, head of the white house's national economic council; sheila c. bair, the federal insurance deposit corporation chairwoman; and mr. geithner have been involved in the talks, the wall street officials said. federal policy makers are discussing how to use the second $350 billion portion of bailout funds. about $50 billion to $100 billion is expected to be allocated to stave off home foreclosures. that would leave up to $250 billion available for the banks, with the bulk going to buying troubled assets. on wednesday, the head of the congressional budget office told lawmakers that weakening banks would probably need hundreds of billions in additional funds beyond the troubled asset relief program, or tarp. but administration officials believe that trillions of dollars more may be needed to buy the majority of bad assets from banks. ''the size of the problem is so large that no one knows if you just wiped out all the assets, how much it would cost,'' said senator charles e. schumer, democrat of new york and vice chairman of the joint economic committee. he added that a number of officials estimate it may take up to $3 trillion to $4 trillion to buy the bad assets. federal officials are trying to find a delicate balance between stabilizing banks and keeping the nation's finances steady. mr. summers privately expressed concern last week that spending too much to buy bad assets could cripple the dollar, according to a person who spoke with him. administration officials are also worried that lawmakers might reject the high price tag. at the same time, spending too little may not provide enough to plug the deepening hole. ''none of the solutions are very easy,'' mr. schumer said. ''all of these proposals sound very appealing until you start to examine them in detail. and then you find that all of them have problems. the good bank-bad bank idea -- the problem, first and foremost, is how do you value the assets? no one knows how to do that.'' lawmakers have complained that the $350 billion already spent under tarp has failed to prevent institutions from continuing to decline. on wednesday, several senior members of congress, including christopher j. dodd, chairman of the senate banking committee, and barney frank, chairman of the house financial services committee, urged the administration to detail swiftly how it will run the assets program. administration officials have been moving with some caution. they say that they hope to avoid the spectacle of the last administration, which lurched from policy to policy, and in the process lost some credibility in congress. senior officials including ben s. bernanke, the chairman of the federal reserve, and ms. bair have recommended that the new administration consider a so-called aggregator bank that would relieve banks of their worst assets. such a move, they contend, would restore investor confidence in the banks and encourage investors to provide them with fresh capital. one version of the plan being floated by bankers would have the f.d.i.c. take the lead in running the ''bad bank'' and buying the toxic assets for a combination of cash and notes backed by the bad bank. in return, the government would demand some sort of equity stake. the banks would still be responsible for collecting payments on the loans that they sold, according to bankers briefed on the situation. other issues still need to be resolved, including how the government would determine what to pay for the toxic assets, which assets would qualify, and what conditions might be attached. also under discussion was whether to require banks that dump their assets into the fund to separately raise private capital. that could put pressure on weaker banks. government officials are considering other ideas for stabilizing the financial system. those include expanding the types of government guarantees given to citigroup and bank of america to cover more assets at more financial companies. another idea is to pour even more federal money into the banks, possibly in return for common stock. in a sense the debate over creation of an aggregator bank or nationalization is really a discussion over how much to expand policies begun during the bush administration, officials said on wednesday. the government in effect has already nationalized several large institutions, including the american international group, fannie mae and freddie mac, when it seized control. and it has taken the same steps as creating a bad bank when it took $29 billion in assets held by bear stearns and guaranteed more than $300 billion in declining assets at citigroup. officials said the debate within the administration was over how much and under what terms to extend those programs to other institutions. compounding the complexity is the fact that the administration is simultaneously asking for a stimulus package of more than $800 billion. moreover, as the excesses of wall street -- from expensive corporate jets at citigroup to huge bonuses and extravagant renovations at merrill lynch -- ring through capitol hill, the idea of a large bailout that does not penalize shareholders and senior executives becomes a tough sell. the concept of a bad bank has gained momentum in the financial industry as the economy deteriorates, slashing the value of risky assets on banks' books and increasing the need for banks to hold capital against those losses. shares in citigroup and bank of america, which both recently received a second taxpayer lifeline, surged 19 percent and 14 percent respectively as the stock market rose on optimism that the administration would relieve banks of money-losing assets. the fed said wednesday the economy remained gloomy, and vowed to use ''all available tools to promote the resumption of sustainable economic growth and to preserve price stability.'' its federal open market committee voted to keep the federal funds target rate at zero to 0.25 percent. analysts estimated that the economy contracted by more than 5 percent in the fourth quarter, one of the sharpest quarterly drops in decades. employers eliminated two million jobs from september through december. in the past, the fed has tried to steer the overall economy almost entirely through the federal funds rate, the rate that banks charge each other to lend overnight reserves. but because banks remained reluctant to lend, even after the fed lowered the overnight rate time after time, the central bank began creating new programs last fall in which it stepped in as a lender itself. to push down interest rates on mortgages, the fed began a program this month to buy $500 billion in mortgage-backed securities issued by fannie mae, freddie mac and the federal agencies. buying large volumes of a security pushes up its price in the market, which leads to lower yields or interest rates. thus far, the fed has bought about $53 billion of the securities. but rates for the kind of traditional mortgages that fannie and freddie guarantee dropped sharply and stayed low as soon as the fed announced plans for the program in late november. the committee also served notice that it might purchase longer-term treasury bonds, a move that would drive down long-term interest rates of all types. in the next several weeks, the fed expects to start a $200 billion program to finance securities backed by consumer loans, including car loans and credit card debt. this month, the fed started a program to buy $500 billion in mortgage-backed securities. wednesday's policy vote was not unanimous. jeffrey m. lacker, president of the federal reserve bank of richmond, in virginia, voted against the decision. help for credit unions the united states agreed to inject $1 billion of new capital and provide backing for corporate credit unions facing mounting losses on their investments in mortgages, a federal agency said. the agency, the national credit union administration, said on wednesday it would guarantee uninsured lender assets through next month and set up a voluntary program through 2010. the u.s. central corporate federal credit union will get a $1 billion federal injection that will raise the public's confidence in credit unions, the lender said. photo: secretary timothy f.

334,2000-10-03,"['WASHINGTON -- The economy will continue to glide toward a soft landing with slower growth in the months to come, new economic data show. The Conference Board\'s Index of Leading Economic Indicators, designed to predict economic conditions in the next six months, fell 0.1% in August, after dropping 0.2% in July. The index has been flat or declining for all of 2000 except for a 0.1% increase in March. The data suggest the economy is likely to continue slowing into the early part of 2001 before stabilizing. The economy expanded at a surprising 5.3% annual rate in the second quarter, but many analysts expect the pace of gross-domestic-product growth to drop to between 3% and 3.5% for the rest of 2000, and remain at about that level for much of 2001. ""The days of 5% GDP growth are behind us,"" said Ken Goldstein, an economist at the Conference Board, a New York-based market-research firm. The report was good news for the Federal Reserve, which has raised interest rates six times since June 1999 to cool the economy and stave off inflation. Yesterday, the Federal Open Market Committee held rates steady. For much of the year, the housing sector offered some of the clearest evidence of a cooling economy, as rising interest rates, which make housing more expensive, hampered sales. But the sector has begun to show some signs of a resurgence. The Commerce Department reported that new-home sales fell 3% in August to a seasonally adjusted rate of 893,000 units a year, but that came after a huge 11.8% rise in July. All told, new-home sales remained 2.3% lower than the torrid pace a year earlier. Meantime, existing-home sales surged 9.3% in August, while overall construction spending grew 1.4%. All three measures have largely reversed their earlier declines. One reason: lower mortgage rates. The interest rate for a 30-year mortgage was 7.88% last week, a notch higher than the 7.63% level of June 1999, but well off the recent high of 8.64% in May, according to Freddie Mac, the mortgage purchaser. In the Conference Board report, six of the leading index\'s 10 components -- including manufacturing hours and consumer expectations -- declined. A sustained decrease signals weaker economic conditions, though Mr. Goldstein predicted the slowdown wouldn\'t be severe.

335,2000-10-03,"[""The global stocks table in the World Business section on Oct. 4 misstated the closing number for the Johannesburg Top 25 industrial index and its performance this year to date. It closed on Oct. 3, at 9,307.86, not 9,173.43. Through Oct. 3, the index was up 2.32 percent in South African rand (not 0.85 percent), and down 12.81 percent in dollars (not 14 percent). CORRECTED BY THE NEW YORK TIMES SATURDAY OCTOBER 21, 2000 WASHINGTON, Oct. 4 -- Reassured by signs that economic growth is moderating to a sustainable pace, the Federal Reserve voted today to hold interest rates steady, but warned that low unemployment and high oil prices could still lead to a jump in inflation. In its last meeting before Election Day, the Fed said it would hold its benchmark federal funds rate on overnight loans among banks at 6.5 percent, where it has been since May. It was the third consecutive meeting at which the Fed kept monetary policy on hold, after raising rates by 1.75 percentage points in six steps starting in June of last year. In announcing its decision, the central bank's Federal Open Market Committee suggested that the economy's capacity for noninflationary growth had increased in recent years and that the expansion had slowed to near that range. But its statement was laden with caveats, and gave no indication that the Fed had begun thinking about cutting rates, as some investors had been hoping it would. Faced with the likelihood that rates would remain steady at best in coming months and might even rise, investors sent stock prices down after the Fed's announcement. The Dow Jones industrial average, which had been up more than 100 points before the release of the Fed statement around 2:15, lost most of its gains and closed at 10,719.74, up 19.61 points for the day. The Nasdaq composite index fell 113.07 points, to 3,455.83. Prices of long-term government bonds fell. Most indicators in the last few months have suggested that the business expansion, now in its 10th year, is slowing somewhat from its torrid pace late last year and earlier this year. The Commerce Department reported today that sales of new single-family homes declined by 3 percent in August and the Conference Board said its index of leading indicators declined 0.1 percent in August after falling 0.2 percent in July. At the same time, inflation by most measures has remained subdued. And although the issue is still subject to considerable debate among economists, Fed officials have become increasingly convinced that the technology-driven upturn in the growth rate of productivity -- the most important measure of efficiency and a critical indicator of long-term economic potential -- is likely to continue for some time. As productivity improves, businesses can pay workers more and maintain their profits without raising prices. Still, with unemployment at 4.1 percent, Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, has remained concerned that employers might soon have to begin bidding up wages to find the workers they need, potentially pushing prices up. And though the surge in oil prices this year has not filtered through the entire economy, it is pushing up some broad measures of inflation and increasing the risk that workers, business executives and investors will begin assuming that higher inflation is inevitable. In its statement, the Fed noted that recent economic reports indicate ''that the expansion of aggregate demand has moderated to a pace closer to the enhanced rate of growth of the economy's potential to produce.'' Gains in productivity ''also continue to help contain costs and hold down underlying price pressures,'' the statement said. On the other hand, the statement said, ''utilization of the pool of available workers remains at an unusually high level,'' and higher oil prices pose ''a risk of raising inflation expectations.'' Using its boilerplate language to signal that it remains more likely to raise rates in the future than to cut them, the Fed said that ''the risks continue to be weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate heightened inflation pressures in the future.'' Economists said the Fed was now likely to remain on hold for months or possibly through next year, since the economy seems to have achieved or to be close to the proverbial soft landing -- a slowdown sufficient to squelch inflation pressures without endangering the expansion. After growing 8.3 percent in last year's fourth quarter, 4.8 percent in the first quarter and 5.6 percent in the second quarter, the economy is projected by many analysts to have expanded at about 3.5 percent in the third quarter. Fed officials think the economy's long-term noninflationary growth rate is around 4 percent. Fed policy next year is likely to hinge on whether growth stays below that level or accelerates above it again. ''I'm almost willing to say we've landed, but that's not the end of the story, it's the beginning,'' said Robert V. DiClemente, an economist at Salomon Smith Barney. ''You either refuel or you get hit with something else.'' There are several signs that the economy could take off again. Consumer spending has shown considerable resilience, even though the stock market has run out of steam this year, and mortgage rates have fallen substantially in recent months, suggesting that housing could continue to support strong growth rates. Energy prices are another wild card, one that the Fed made clear it remains concerned about. But Stephen D. Slifer, chief United States economist at Lehman Brothers, said energy accounted for 7 percent of economic output now, down from 14 percent in 1980, so the economy was far less vulnerable to an oil price shock than it used to be. Mr. Slifer said President Clinton's willingness to tap the nation's Strategic Petroleum Reserve should also limit the chances of any big spike in oil prices, which in any case have been coming down somewhat from their recent peak a few weeks ago.""]","[""the global stocks table in the world business section on oct. 4 misstated the closing number for the johannesburg top 25 industrial index and

sales of new single-family homes declined by 3 percent in august and the conference board said its index of leading indicators declined 0.1 percent in august after falling 0.2 percent in july. at the same time, inflation by most measures has remained subdued. and although the issue is still subject to considerable debate among economists, fed officials have become increasingly convinced that the technology-driven upturn in the growth rate of productivity -- the most important measure of efficiency and a critical indicator of long-term economic potential -- is likely to continue for some time. as productivity improves, businesses can pay workers more and maintain their profits without raising prices. still, with unemployment at 4.1 percent, alan greenspan, the fed chairman, has remained concerned that employers might soon have to begin bidding up wages to find the workers they need, potentially pushing prices up. and though the surge in oil prices this year has not filtered through the entire economy, it is pushing up some broad measures of inflation and increasing the risk that workers, business executives and investors will begin assuming that higher inflation is inevitable. in its statement, the fed noted that recent economic reports indicate ''that the expansion of aggregate demand has moderated to a pace closer to the enhanced rate of growth of the economy's potential to produce.'' gains in productivity ''also continue to help contain costs and hold down underlying price pressures,'' the statement said. on the other hand, the statement said, ''utilization of the pool of available workers remains at an unusually high level,'' and higher oil prices pose ''a risk of raising inflation expectations.'' using its boilerplate language to signal that it remains more likely to raise rates in the future than to cut them, the fed said that ''the risks continue to be weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate heightened inflation pressures in the future.'' economists said the fed was now likely to remain on hold for months or possibly through next year, since the economy seems to have achieved or to be close to the proverbial soft landing -- a slowdown sufficient to squelch inflation pressures without endangering the expansion. after growing 8.3 percent in last year's fourth quarter, 4.8 percent in the first quarter and 5.6 percent in the second quarter, the economy is projected by many analysts to have expanded at about 3.5 percent in the third quarter. fed officials think the economy's long-term noninflationary growth rate is around 4 percent. fed policy next year is likely to hinge on whether growth stays below that level or accelerates above it again. ''i'm almost willing to say we've landed, but that's not the end of the story, it's the beginning,'' said robert v. diclemente, an economist at salomon smith barney. ''you either refuel or you get hit with something else.'' there are several signs that the economy could take off again. consumer spending has shown considerable resilience, even though the stock market has run out of steam this year, and mortgage rates have fallen substantially in recent months, suggesting that housing could continue to support strong growth rates. energy prices are another wild card, one that the fed made clear it remains concerned about. but stephen d. slifer, chief united states economist at lehman brothers, said energy accounted for 7 percent of economic output now, down from 14 percent in 1980, so the economy was far less vulnerable to an oil price shock than it used to be. mr. slifer said president clinton's willingness to tap the nation's strategic petroleum reserve should also limit the chances of any big spike in oil prices, which in any case have been coming down somewhat from their recent peak a few weeks ago.""]",37.0,,,,,,,,,1
336,2000-10-03,"['NEW YORK -- Big technology stocks suffered as worry spread that the profit problems of technology companies had spread to the market leaders.    Shares of Oracle fell $9.25, or more than 11%, to 69.50 on the Nasdaq Stock Market, after an analyst at Merrill Lynch shared cautious comments with the firm\'s sales staff following a meeting Oracle officials held with analysts. Oracle shares had been edging lower throughout the session, then fell sharply in the final hour of trading.    At the same time, shares of International Business Machines dropped in the final hour, as fears that the company would issue an earnings warning spread throughout Wall Street. The stock finished down 7.25 at 110.56.    Investors initially had pushed some stocks up, allowing market averages to post modest gains. Even an earnings warning from copier maker Xerox was considered a company-specific, rather than sectorwide, problem. Xerox shares fell 3.94 to 11.38, a 52-week low. However, the optimism withered in the face of speculation about further earnings warnings.    The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended the session at 10719.74, up 19.61, or 0.18%. IBM\'s decline shaved 42.19 points off the average.    The Nasdaq Composite Index fell to 3455.83, down 113.07, or 3.2%.    ""There is so much negative sentiment out there in the market,"" Adam Weisman, a trader at Wit SoundView, said. ""The last thing people want to hear is bad news about leadership names.""    Several stocks whose high valuations had remained intact coming into this week despite selling elsewhere came under pressure. I2 Technologies dropped 17.88 to 152, while Ciena sank 11.25 to 110.13. Ariba fell 14.58 to 112.48, and PMC-Sierra slid 13.50 to 199.25, all on Nasdaq. Commerce One, hurt by pessimistic comments from an analyst at Jefferies, which lowered its rating on the stock, declined 13.69, or nearly 19%, to 58.88.    The sell-off came in another session of vigorous trading. Nasdaq trading totaled 1.90 billion shares, up from the 1.72 billion that changed hands Monday, while action on the New York Stock Exchange amounted to 1.09 billion, up from 1.02 billion Monday.    The technology sell-off came at the same time the Federal Reserve released a statement saying it left interest rates unchanged at its Federal Open Market Committee meeting. But that outcome had been widely expected.    Shares of several blue-chip names thrived during the session. Minnesota Mining & Manufacturing gained 2.31 to 94, Alcoa added 2.44 to 26.94 and International Paper rose 1.63 to 29.63. Those names, though, had been coming off relatively low bases. Both Alcoa and International Paper reached 52-week lows last week, suggesting some bargain-hunting was at work.    Meanwhile, money-management firm Neuberger Berman rose 3.63, or 5.6%, to 68.38 on speculation the firm would be taken over by a large financial conglomerate. Jeffrey Lane, president and chief executive of Neuberger, said he ""won\'t comment on rumors."" Analysts say banks, insurers and brokerage firms have been eyeing asset-management businesses with particularly wealthy clients such as those of Neuberger, New York. The stock rose 3.25 Monday.    Investors, hesitant to own technology shares, gravitated to other sectors. Media stocks found a following. Shares of Cox Communications added 2.38 to 41.94, while Time Warner rose 1.15 to 81.01. Cablevision Systems added 1.44 to 70.44, and Adelphia Communications rose 1.13 to 28.81.    Shares of home builders also gained ground, with several names reaching 52-week highs. Economic data released during the session showed that new-home sales slid in August following a sharp gain in July, but nevertheless reflected healthy demand for housing. Shares of Lennar gained 1.06 to 31.25, reaching a 52-week high. Pulte, helped by comments from Goldman Sachs, which started coverage of the stock yesterday, gained 56 cents to 33.56. Centex moved up 1.38 to 34.38. Goodyear Tire & Rubber fell 1 to 17.29, near its 52-week low. Lehman Brothers lowered its earnings forecast for the Akron, Ohio, tire maker, and said it expected the company to reduce its dividend.    Raytheon\'s class B shares moved up 1.75 to 29. Striking workers at the Lexington, Mass., defense contractor voted to accept a four-year agreement Monday, ending a monthlong strike against the company.    Electronics For Imaging fell 4.19 to 20.50, a 52-week low, on Nasdaq, caught in Xerox\'s profit warnings. Analysts said that about one-third of sales at the Foster City, Calif., maker of printer components are made to Xerox. Morgan Stanley Dean Witter cut its rating on the stock yesterday.    Covad Communications fell 2.09 to 9.91 on Nasdaq, pulling back even though the Santa Clara, Calif., provider of Internet access services said it expected to meet its third-quarter earnings targets.    Equifax rose 3.25 to 29.94, reaching a 52-week high in intraday trading. Bear Stearns raised its rating on the Atlanta provider of information services about consumer credit, following the company\'s announcement Monday that it wants to separate into two businesses, spinning off its payment-services division to shareholders.    Intersil gained 25 cents to 41.81 on Nasdaq. Lehman Brothers issued an upbeat research note on the Palm Bay, Fla., semiconductor maker, saying the stock is undervalued, and that it expected strong third-quarter numbers from the company.    Mentor Graphics fell 2.19 to 20.44 on Nasdaq. Credit Suisse First Boston issued a research note in which it recommended that investors take some profits in the stock, adding that it wasn\'t enthusiastic about the company\'s fundamentals.

337,2004-12-14,"[""Following is the text of a statement released by the Federal Reserve yesterday after the Fed's monetary policy panel, the Federal Open Market Committee, decided to raise its benchmark interest rates a quarter point:   The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to raise its target for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points, to 2.25 percent.   The committee believes that, even after this action, the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative and, coupled with robust underlying growth in productivity, is providing ongoing support to economic activity. Output appears to be growing at a moderate pace despite the earlier rise in energy prices, and labor market conditions continue to improve gradually. Inflation and longer-term inflation expectations remain well contained.   The committee perceives the upside and downside risks to the attainment of both sustainable growth and price stability for the next few quarters to be roughly equal. With underlying inflation expected to be relatively low, the committee believes that policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that is likely to be measured. Nonetheless, the committee will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to fulfill its obligation to maintain price stability.   Voting for the F.O.M.C. monetary policy action were: Alan Greenspan, chairman; Timothy F. Geithner, vice chairman; Ben S. Bernanke; Susan S. Bies; Roger W. Ferguson Jr.; Edward M. Gramlich; Thomas M.

338,2004-12-14,"['The Federal Reserve raised its key interest-rate target for the fifth time this year, giving no signal it would either speed up or slow down the pace of rate changes next year. As widely expected, the Fed raised its target for the federal-funds rate to 2.25% from 2%. It was the fifth consecutive policy meeting at which the central bank raised the target a quarter of a percentage point. In language almost identical to what it said after its November meeting, the Fed said the economy is growing at a ""moderate pace"" despite high energy prices, the job market continues ""to improve gradually,"" and both inflation and longer-term inflation expectations remain ""well contained."" The Fed also reaffirmed its intention to raise rates at a ""measured"" pace, interpreted as no more than a quarter point per meeting. Investors trading futures contracts based on movements in the fed-funds rate currently put a near 100% probability that the Fed will raise the rate to 2.5% at its meeting Feb. 1-2, but are split on the likelihood the Fed will repeat that step at the March 22 meeting. Economists said the 19-member Federal Open Market Committee shed no new light on its inclinations. ""The outlook is now data-dependent,"" said Lou Crandall, chief economist at Wrightson Associates, a money-market research firm in New York. ""The world could change over the next few weeks and they\'re not prejudging it."" There was one slight hint of less inclination to pause in its rate increases. All 12 of the Fed\'s regional banks had submitted requests to raise the discount rate, up from 10 in November. That little-used levy on central-bank advances to commercial banks moves in lockstep with the more important fed-funds rate, charged on overnight loans between banks. Several commercial banks raised their prime rate, a benchmark for many business and consumer loans, to 5.25% from 5%. The Fed said, as it has since March, that there are ""roughly equal"" risks of the economy growing faster or slower than its ideal rate, and of inflation going too high or too low. Markets, relieved that the Fed gave no sign of greater concern on inflation, pushed down long-term interest rates. Stocks rose. Laurence Meyer, a former Fed governor and a Fed analyst at St. Louis forecasting firm Macroeconomic Advisers LLC, said the Fed is torn between data that show the economy to be strong and expectations that a widening trade deficit, high energy prices and less fuel from tax cuts will weigh on growth in the coming year. He predicted the Fed, after raising interest rates in February, would slow the pace of increases thereafter, so that the funds rate reaches about 3.5% by year end. Separately, the FOMC said it would begin releasing minutes to its deliberations three weeks after a policy meeting, instead of the Thursday after the subsequent meeting five to seven weeks later. It is the latest move by the Fed to become more transparent. The earlier release should give the public a better understanding of what drove a particular decision, and more appreciation of any divergence of views within the Fed. Under the old schedule, issues raised in the minutes often had been superseded by intervening developments by the time the public read them. ""In the current environment, where the Fed is being so predictable and there are so few surprises, it won\'t add or subtract that much,"" said Ken Kuttner, an economist at Oberlin College who worked on communications issues while a staff economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. ""But when the turning point in interest rates comes, having the minutes available [sooner] will make some difference."" The FOMC had been considering earlier release for at least a year, but officials first had to reassure themselves it wouldn\'t distract from the Fed\'s postmeeting statement. Another concern was whether the central-bank staff could prepare the minutes, which are based on a full meeting transcript, and circulate them for approval in time. The Fed\'s first rate increases were driven primarily by the need to lift the rate from extraordinary lows appropriate only when the economy faced the risk of deflation. With yesterday\'s increase, the rate is firmly above the underlying inflation rate -- 1.5%, according to the Fed\'s preferred measure -- and the Fed is keying its moves more to the ebb and flow of data on growth and inflation. While all 12 voting FOMC members were unanimous in yesterday\'s action, there is growing divergence on the outlook for growth and inflation. Some officials are becoming more wary on the outlook for inflation. Productivity growth -- which enables firms to become ever more efficient -- has slowed, and firms are trying harder to raise prices in response to higher material costs and the lower dollar. In a survey of 185 chief financial officers released yesterday, 56% said their companies have felt rising producer prices and of those, 77% plan to pass along between half and all of that increased cost to consumers. The survey was conducted by Financial Executives International, a trade association, and Baruch College in New York. But other Fed officials think inflation will remain tightly under wraps. They note with factories operating below normal capacity and unemployment still relatively high, businesses will remain hard-pressed to raise prices and workers will struggle to win pay increases.

339,2004-12-14,"['STOCK MARKETS, unfazed by rising interest rates, trade deficits and oil prices, marched to their own tune -- a holiday jingle. Traders held their powder before the Federal Reserve\'s Open Market Committee announced it would raise its target short-term interest rate to 2.25%. But after the statement, which included reassurances that the central bankers would maintain a ""measured"" pace of monetary tightening, investors got busy. Stocks pushed higher despite a 2% gain in oil, a record trade gap and somewhat subtle indications from the Fed that the soft labor market just isn\'t firming up. Could the fabled ""Santa Claus"" rally finally be under way? Blue chips have advanced four out of the past five sessions and are up 2% for the month, with only seven more trading days before the Christmas holiday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished up 38.13 points, or 0.4%, at 10676.45 -- the average is now just 60 points off the 2004 high. Alcoa weighed on the industrials, slumping 1.7% after J.P. Morgan downgraded the aluminum company on concerns of higher costs and declining demand, among other reasons. But Intel, another Dow component, gained 2.7% on a broad rally in the technology sector. That helped carry the Nasdaq Composite Index up 0.5%, or 11.34 points, to 2159.84. Reports of merger talks between security-software makers Symantec and Veritas Software helped prop up the tech sector. The broad Standard &Poor\'s 500-stock index added 4.7 points, or 0.4%, to 1203.38, padding its three-year high. While investors held their collective breath until the Fed announcement, the rate increase wasn\'t a surprise. The economy ""appears to be growing at a moderate pace, despite the earlier increase in energy prices, and labor-market conditions continue to improve gradually,"" the policy makers said. The ""gradually"" caveat -- a concession to a soft job market -- was the only alteration from the FOMC\'s last statement, in November. ""There had been some talk about more recognition of inflation risk, given [Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan\'s] observations in Frankfurt a few weeks back,"" said Peter Hooper, chief U.S. economist at Deutsche Bank, referring to concerns Mr. Greenspan expressed about trade and current-account deficits. But there was no such recognition, and stocks celebrated.

A report of a surprisingly sharp jump in the U.S. trade deficit showed that it swelled 8.9% to $55.46 billion in October -- the widest gap since June, when it hit $55.34 billion.

The trade deficit with China ballooned 8% to $16.8 billion for the month, a record high. It\'s a record that comes amid a tacit U.S. policy to drive down the dollar to help offset the nation\'s trade and budget deficits. Treasury Secretary John Snow has left it for the market to sort out the greenback\'s value. Mr. Greenspan\'s comments to foreign bankers in Frankfurt last month about the threat of the twin deficits were interpreted by many as an endorsement of a weak-dollar policy.

340,2004-12-14,"['KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- A U.S. Commerce Department move to reduce countervailing and antidumping duties on imports of Canadian softwood lumber surprised futures traders, who had expected deeper cuts, and led to minimal gains in lumber futures. The Chicago Mercantile Exchange\'s January lumber contract rose 90 cents a thousand board feet to $331.40, and the March position rose $1.40 to $345.50. The Commerce Department announced shortly after noon CST that it was lowering the countervailing duty to 17.18% from 18.79% and the antidumping duty to 4.03% from 8.4%. Before the announcement, traders said they were expecting a combined reduction of about 9% rather than the 6% that was announced. ""The news was a little less bearish than anticipated,"" said Sandi Castillo of Rosenthal Collins Group LLC. Prices settled higher, but since the duty reductions were less than expected, the reaction was minimal and disappointing, traders said. Lumber prices opened narrowly mixed but declined quickly on follow-through selling from Monday\'s inability to hold a rally attempt and on anticipation of a reduction in the Canadian lumber duties, said Bob Book, senior lumber analyst at TJ&R Trading Corp., Chicago. The sharp pullback from Monday\'s high made traders nervous about betting prices would rise, especially since there were no early reports of cash markets making any kind of a rally attempt. As prices were falling, however, word filtered into the pit that one large British Columbia spruce-pine-fir lumber producer found a price at which lumber would move in quantity, Mr. Book said. This price was well below other mills\' quotes, and though the other producers weren\'t selling much, the fact that one was having a good day persuaded traders that maybe the market was finding some firm footing. In addition, at the lows, the January contract fell below even that major producer\'s low prices, and commercial traders stepped in to cover their needs, Mr. Book said. Another broker said rumors began seeping into the pit that the duty announcement would be less of a cut than expected. That prompted local and outside investors to cover earlier bets that prices would fall, and the market began to rise to the day\'s highs, where the buying interest ran out, Ms. Castillo said. HEATING OIL: Futures prices on the New York Mercantile Exchange rose as the first wave of cold weather spread across the U.S. midsection and the Atlantic Coast region. Some weather forecasters are also calling for colder temperatures to persist for a couple of weeks. Heating oil for January delivery rose 4.75 cents a gallon to $1.3045. GOLD: Futures prices on the Comex division of the Nymex fell amid a stronger U.S. dollar versus other major currencies, and as players were content to sit tight during the U.S. Federal Reserve\'s Federal Open Market Committee meeting, held yesterday. Fed policy makers raised interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point, as expected. Gold for December delivery fell $3 an ounce to $435.90.

Currency traders noted that while the dollar staged healthy rallies against the mark and yen, the U.S. currency isn\'t likely to continue strengthening against the mark. They said underlying demand for the German currency will halt its slide.
