0.25 PAR 7 at its march meeting , the fomc indicated that the balance of risks was weighted toward higher inflation .
0.25 PAR 7 during the intermeeting period , inflation pressures have intensified , judging by the strength in incoming data on output , employment , and prices .
0.25 PAR 7 accordingly , the issue addressed in this bluebook is not whether to tighten the stance of monetary policy but by how much .
0.25 PAR 7 two basic alternatives are presented for consideration by the committee : alternative c , under which the target federal funds rate would be raised 25 basis points , and alternative d , under which it would be increased 50 basis points .
0.25 PAR 8 even if the committee 's assessment of the outlook is such that a substantial firming of policy ultimately will be necessary to prevent underlying inflation from rising , it still may favor a continued gradual approach , as under alternative c . signs of an actual acceleration in prices are quite recent , and the committee may require further evidence that inflation is on the upswing before firming policy more aggressively .
0.25 PAR 8 while some measures of labor compensation gains recently have shown signs of strengthening , this development may be largely a lagged response to previous increases in productivity growth rather than a signal of heightened inflation pressures .
0.25 PAR 8 moreover , the elevated uncertainty about the economy 's sustainable level of resource utilization and rate of output growth -- which contributes to the sense that forecasts of inflation are less reliable -- might justify continuing the incremental approach to policy firming .
0.25 PAR 8 continued gradualism would afford the federal reserve more time to assess the responsiveness of the economy and inflation to the cumulative change in the stance of monetary policy , thereby limiting the risk of possible over - tightening .
0.25 PAR 8 and , to the extent that market participants extrapolate the gradual approach to policy tightening into the future , expectations of further policy restraint will remain embedded in the structure of market interest rates , still bringing forward in time the effects on spending of future policy firming .
0.25 PAR 9 the 25 basis point move of alternative c would be somewhat smaller than is incorporated in financial market prices .
0.25 PAR 9 even if the committee also announces that the balance of risks remains skewed toward higher inflation , short rates still would decline , as market participants marked down their expected near - term path for the funds rate target .
0.25 PAR 9 longer - term yields also might edge down if market participants concluded that the federal reserve would be pursuing a more gradual approach than they had anticipated , and this strategy was not viewed as enhancing inflation risks .
0.25 PAR 9 on the latter score , market participants might infer from the small size of the policy move that inflationary pressures are a little less intense than they had thought ; such a response would , of course , be more plausible if the cpi data to be released the morning of the meeting turn out to be benign .
0.25 PAR 9 equity prices could rally , while the value of the dollar on foreign exchange markets might change little .
0.25 PAR 9 but it can not be ruled out that financial market participants would adopt a more skeptical interpretation of limited federal reserve action .
0.25 PAR 9 if a sense that the committee had fallen behind the curve of requisite policy firming became prevalent , which would be made more likely by a disquieting cpi release , longer - term rates could back up , equity prices weaken , and the dollar come under downward pressure .
