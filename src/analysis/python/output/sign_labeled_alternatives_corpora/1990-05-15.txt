- PAR 11 the easing of reserve conditions under alternative a would tend to strengthen money growth over may and june to something more in line with rates incorporated in the committee 's expectations at the last meeting .
- PAR 11 opportunity costs would narrow even more , boosting m2 growth to nearly a 6 percent rate over may and june , leaving this aggregate notice- ably above the midpoint of its annual range .
- PAR 11 m3 growth would firm to a 4 percent annual rate , keeping this aggregate a little above the lower bound of its range .
- PAR 11 the easing of policy under alternative a would come as something of a surprise to most market participants , and money market rates would decline by the full 50 basis point drop in the federal funds rate .
- PAR 11 the dollar would come under downward pressure , and , absent incoming information pointing to a weaker economy or a distinct improvement in underlying cost or price trends , the decline in bond rates would be limited , resulting in a steeper yield curve .
- PAR 11 if , however , evidence sug- gested a softening in economic activity , perhaps reflecting more powerful credit restraint than now seems apparent , the drop in short - term rates would feed through to bond yields .
- PAR 11 the decline in market rates would tend to buoy borrowing and spending by those with market access , helping to offset the effects of tighter credit availability on spenders dependent on depository intermediaries .
0 SENT -- under alternative b , federal funds would be expected to continue to trade around 8 - 1/4 percent , with an initial level of adjust- ment plus seasonal borrowing of $ 350 million .
0 PAR 7 interest rates generally would be expected to show little net change under alternative b . market expectations now embody federal funds continuing to trade around 8 - 1/4 percent , as under this alternative .
0 PAR 7 similarly , incoming information on the economy consistent with the green- book forecast would be roughly in line with the continued economic growth and moderation in measured inflation -- though with little improvement in longer - term price trends -- that market participants now seem to be antici- pating .
0 PAR 7 rates on treasury bills and notes , however , could be subject to transitory supply pressures if rtc activity accelerates appreciably and with it treasury financing needs .
0 PAR 7 a breakthrough in negotiations on the budget between the administration and the congress in coming weeks would be likely to spark a rally in capital markets , which after a time might induce a downward adjustment in the foreign exchange value of the dollar .
0 PAR 7 absent such a breakthrough , the dollar likely would remain around recent levels on foreign exchange markets ; with the dollar stable and german reunification impending , a tightening of monetary policy in germany and japan before the next fomc meeting appears unlikely .
0 PAR 8 projected growth rates for the monetary aggregates from march to june are given in the table below for all three alternatives .
0 PAR 8 ( the table and charts on the following pages show more detailed data . )
0 PAR 8 under alternative b , growth in both m2 and m3 would pick up over may and june from the sluggish pace of april .
0 PAR 8 this pickup results in part from a cessation of the runoff of demand deposits and rps .
0 PAR 8 in addition , the response of depositors to previous increases in opportunity costs would begin to wane .
0 PAR 8 moreover , opportunity costs have already narrowed from april and , with market interest rates stable , this narrowing could con- tinue , buoying retail deposit inflows , as banks raise small time deposit rates , albeit slowly , in adjustment to increases in market rates on bal- ance this year .
0 PAR 8 to an extent , the strengthening of m2 and m3 under this alternative rests on a rebound in bank credit growth and associated fund-
0 PAR 8 ing needs in may and june -- given the evidence that reductions in willing- ness to lend are limited .
0 PAR 8 again , the behavior of the rtc constitutes a major uncertainty in the outlook for money growth .
0 PAR 8 to date in the second quarter , rtc spending still has been fairly modest .
0 PAR 8 we have assumed pro- gressively more resolution activity over may and june , but well below rtc 's announced goal of 141 resolutions involving $ 50 billion of assets for this quarter .
0 PAR 8 a surge in rtc activity could damp m3 growth as thrift assets end up on the government 's balance sheet .
0 PAR 8 and it could affect m2 as well , if large volumes of retail deposits are transferred to commercial banks without accompanying loans and investments , reducing bank needs to raise deposit offering rates .
0 PAR 8 on balance , m2 growth is projected to strengthen to a 5 percent pace on average in may and june , in line with average growth over the first four months of the year .
0 PAR 8 m3 growth would remain quite sluggish as thrifts continued to shrink -- through rtc resolu- tions and through action to meet capital requirements -- but would pick up a little to about a 3 - 1/2 percent pace from growth of around 1 percent in march and april .

+ PAR 12 the tighter reserve conditions under alternative c would be expected to keep money growth damped .
