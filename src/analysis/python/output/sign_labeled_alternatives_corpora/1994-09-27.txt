0 PAR 8 inaction might be deemed particularly appropriate if the committee believed that strains on capacity could be less pressing than in the staff forecast , either because potential output might be greater than assumed by the staff or because more restraint on spending could be in the pipeline in view of the substantial increases in interest rates over the past year .
0 PAR 8 more- over , slow growth of a broad array of monetary and credit aggregates might be seen as suggesting that financial conditions are not con- ducive to a pickup in underlying inflation .
0 PAR 8 a pause would allow the committee to accumulate more evidence on these questions . such a wait - and - see posture would accord with the tone of the press statement announcing the policy action taken at the august meeting .
0 PAR 9 market opinions on what the committee might do at this meeting are split .
0 PAR 9 some analysts have interpreted the recent economic news as implying sufficiently greater inflation potential to overcome any presumption of a policy pause ; they expect a firming action , per- haps of 50 basis points .
0 PAR 9 others still anticipate a hiatus in the process of policy tightening ; however , even many of those in the latter camp seem to expect some action no later than the november meeting .
0 PAR 9 while few actually foresee a 25 basis point increase , the composite effect of these different views has produced a federal funds futures rate for october that is 25 basis points above the current funds rate .
0 PAR 9 nonetheless , maintenance of existing reserve conditions under alternative b might elicit little reaction in rates beyond the very shortest maturities because market participants would assume that tightening had simply been postponed .
0 PAR 9 in these circumstances , longer- term instruments might trade in their current ranges at least for a time , although security prices probably will remain quite sensitive to news bearing on inflation pressures as market participants attempt to gauge the extent of future policy restraint .
0 PAR 9 in that regard , under the staff forecast , economic releases over the next few months would suggest that inflation is on a slightly higher track and that final demand remains fairly vigorous .
0 PAR 9 absent unanticipated changes in policy abroad , the foreign exchange value of the dollar most likely would remain around its current level , though it could come under some downward pressure if inflation expectations began to deteriorate further .
0 SENT -- for illustrative purposes , the path under alternative b was derived assuming that the funds rate would hold at its current level for the remainder of the year .
0 PAR 14 over the september - to - december period , m2 would expand at a 1 - 1/2 percent rate under alternative b .

0 PAR 14 these factors will place a particular drag on liquid accounts , and m1 will expand at only a 2 - 1/2 percent rate over the period.6 while the growth of small time deposits should remain robust , not all the funds lost from liquid deposits will remain in m2 .
0 PAR 14 direct purchases of securities , including noncompetitive tenders at treasury auctions , are anticipated to continue at a healthy clip .
0 PAR 14 as a result , m2 velocity is expected to continue increasing rapidly in the fourth quarter -- at a rate near 5 percent .
0 PAR 14 m3 growth should pick up a bit over the remainder of 1994 , reflecting somewhat reduced reliance of banks on nondeposit sources of funding .
0 PAR 15 under alternative d , m2 would grow at a 1/2 percent rate over the september - to - december period .
0 PAR 15 the sluggish adjustment of deposit rates to the rise in market rates would further widen opportunity costs , depressing m1 and savings deposits even more .
0 PAR 15 however , should policy firming be accompanied by some price declines in capital markets , outflows from bond mutual funds could intensify , some of the outflows might find their way into deposits and money market mutual funds , partly offsetting the effects on m2 of the higher cost of holding deposits .
0 PAR 15 m3 would grow at a 3/4 percent rate over the remaining months of the year , pulled down by a runoff of institu- tion - only money funds as their yields lag behind the increase in money market rates that would be in train under alternative d. 6 .
0 PAR 15 rapid currency growth should continue to bolster m1 over the balance of the year .
0 PAR 15 as a result , under alternative b , the monetary base should expand at about a 8 - 1/4 percent rate , while total reserves should grow at a 1 - 3/4 percent rate over the september - to - december period .

+ PAR 11 the 25 basis point tightening of alternative c is con- sistent with the current structure of market rates , and this policy action might well trigger only muted interest rate reactions .
+ PAR 11 how- ever ,
+ PAR 11 since most market participants expect either no action or a 50 basis point tightening , alternative c could raise questions about system intentions , potentially unsettling markets .
+ PAR 11 a considerable portion of the 50 basis point increase in the federal funds rate under alternative d would pass through to other short - term rates .
+ PAR 11 in light of recent experience and the split in market expectations , it 's dif- ficult to say what immediate impact this alternative would have on interest rates in capital markets .
+ PAR 11 eventually , assuming economic and price data consistent with the staff forecast , intermediate - term yields could tend to work their way a bit higher , as market partici- pants raised their expected path for federal reserve tightening in this phase of the business cycle .
+ PAR 11 but the system 's evident willing- ness to deal with inflation pressures through a 50 basis point move should alleviate longer - run concerns in this regard , limiting any increases in bond yields .
+ PAR 11 with the rise in real interest rates , the dollar would likely appreciate somewhat on exchange markets .
+ SENT -- ( the response of the aggregates under alternative c would lie midway between the two alternatives . ) alt .
