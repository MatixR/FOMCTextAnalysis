- PAR 10 the extent of the easing of reserve market conditions under alternative a would catch market participants unawares , and the 1/2 point drop in the federal funds rate would induce a nearly compar- able decline in other money market interest rates .
- PAR 10 commercial banks are likely to pass through the funds - rate reduction fully to the prime rate , while retaining a relatively wide spread over costs of funds .
- PAR 10 recent declines in long - term rates , occurring as markets were beginning to build in a possible easing , suggest that a decrease in bond yields might accompany such an action .
- PAR 10 however , following an easing move , especially of the dimensions of alternative a , investors would become more assured of sustained economic expansion , but also less confident of any longer - term decrease in inflation , which together would limit any reductions in long - term rates .
- PAR 10 with interest rates on dollar - denomi- nated securities becoming less attractive relative to returns abroad , the exchange value of the dollar would adjust downward .
- SENT -- if the lower funds rate of alternative a is maintained through year - end , growth of m2 for the year could be expected to come in around 4 percent .
0 SENT -- the same federal funds rate could be achieved by cutting the discount rate 1/2 percentage point to 3 percent and specifying borrowing at the alternative b level of $ 100 million .
0 PAR 9 although market participants apparently view the prospects for the next policy action as more heavily favoring an easing than a tightening , no immediate policy change seems to remain the predominant view .
0 PAR 9 consequently , prices in domestic credit and foreign exchange markets probably would not show much reaction should the committee main- tain current reserve market conditions by choosing alternative b at this meeting .
0 PAR 9 economic expansion along the lines projected in the greenbook and money growth remaining near the lower end of the committee 's range ( discussed below ) are likely to continue to foster some downward bias in 4 . upward technical adjustments to the borrowing assumption may be required to allow for some continued uptrend in seasonal borrowing during the spring ; the extent of such adjustments will be limited by the new market - based rate on such credit .
0 PAR 9 market expectations for reserve market pressures for a time .
0 PAR 9 maintain- ing unchanged conditions over the entire intermeeting period eventually could cause some short - term rates to edge higher and dollar exchange rates to strengthen a little as markets reassessed the federal reserve 's intentions .
0 PAR 9 however , long - term yields are likely to remain fairly steady or possibly even edge down as expectations for growth and infla- tion are trimmed back ; the passage of an effective balanced budget amendment would add to downward pressures on long - term rates .
0 PAR 13 growth of m2 is projected to average 2 - 1/2 percent at an annual rate over may and june with the essentially stable money market interest rates of alternative b . most of the pickup should stem from the liquid components , as outflows to cover tax payments prove to be smaller than implicitly anticipated by seasonal factors .
0 PAR 13 in particular , ml is likely to return to a double - digit pace over may and june , led by a sharp reacceleration of demand and other checkable deposits .
0 PAR 13 even so , m2 growth from march to june would be only 1 percent , as would its growth on a quarterly - average basis , far below the staff 's projected pace of 5 percent for nominal gdp .
0 PAR 13 the staff believes that m2 velocity will continue to increase in coming quarters but at a much slower rate as the unusual factors inducing the current quarter 's increase in m2 velocity wane .
0 PAR 13 for the year as a whole , v2 is projected to be up about 2 percent in association with annual m2 growth of 3 - 1/2 percent .
0 PAR 13 5 . adjusted for the change in reserve requirements , total reserves and the monetary base would grow by 10 - 1/4 and 7 - 3/4 percent , respec- tively , over may and june .

0 PAR 14 under alternative b , the projected turnaround in m2 over may and june should show through to m3 , which is expected to register an annual growth rate of 1 - 3/4 percent ; from march to june , m3 would be about unchanged .
0 PAR 14 the slower expansion of m3 than of m2 would reflect continued runoffs of large time deposits , as net credit extension at depositories lags behind inflows to retail deposits .
0 PAR 14 the decline of business loans at banks might moderate as inventory liquidation slows and banks become more willing to lend , especially to smaller businesses .
0 PAR 14 however , business credit demands are expected to be restrained overall , as projected cash flow about matches capital spending , and to remain focused on longer - term markets .
0 PAR 14 the modest projected rise in spending for new homes and durable goods , together with continuing cautious attitudes toward debt , should limit household borrowing as well .
0 PAR 14 conse- quently
0 PAR 14 , growth of the debt of nonfederal sectors is projected to con- tinue at only a 2 - 3/4 percent annual rate from march to june .
0 PAR 14 federal debt , by contrast , is expected to post a more rapid 13 percent rate of growth over these three months .
0 PAR 14 total domestic nonfinancial debt is anticipated to expand at a little above a 5 percent rate over the second quarter , lifting it in june to just above the lower bound of its 4 - 1/2 to 8 - 1/2 percent monitoring range .
0 SENT -- while growth of m3 for the year of 2 percent is expected under the constant funds rate of alternative b , this projec- tion would have to be shaded up or down by perhaps 1/4 point if alterna-
0 PAR 16 draft language for the operational paragraph is present- ed below .
0 PAR 16 an alternative for the last sentence is shown in brackets .
0 PAR 16 this alternative would stress the committee 's expectation of a resump- tion of growth in broad money over may and june , in contrast to the traditional three - month specification , which would show little if any monetary growth ( for example , 1 percent for m2 and zero for m3 under alternative b ) .
0 PAR 16 operational paragraph in the implementation of policy for the immediate future , the committee seeks to decrease somewhat / maintain/ increase somewhat the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions .
0 PAR 16 in the context of the committee 's long - run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth , and giving careful consideration to economic , financial , and monetary developments , slightly ( somewhat ) greater reserve restraint might ( would ) or slightly ( somewhat )
0 PAR 16 lesser reserve restraint ( might ) would be acceptable in the intermeeting period .
0 PAR 16 the contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be consistent with growth of m2 and m3 over the period from march through june at annual rates of about and [ del : 3 - 1/2 and 1 - 1/2 ] percent , respectively .
0 PAR 16 [ the contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be consistent with a resumption of growth in m2 and m3 over the period from april to june to annual rates of about and percent , respectively . ]

+ PAR 11 the more restrictive policy of alternative c would come as a considerable surprise to market participants .
+ PAR 11 short - term interest rates would rise at least commensurately with the federal funds rate .
+ PAR 11 long - term rates might increase relatively little , as investors shifted their concerns toward the potential for renewed economic weakness for a time rather than inflationary pressures , in light of the signal of federal reserve resolve to achieve disinflation gains .
+ PAR 11 stock prices probably would slide as dividend streams expected by investors are reduced and discounted at somewhat higher rates .
