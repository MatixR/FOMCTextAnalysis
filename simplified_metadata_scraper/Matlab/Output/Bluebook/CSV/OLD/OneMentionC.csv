1970-01-15,"(17) Policy alternative C."
1972-04-18,"The pattern of specifications
for this alternative could be the same as that for alternative A, but the phrase
""taking account of capital market developments"" could be construed as in-
structing the Manager to be more liberal in providing reserves and more
cautious in allowing the Federal funds rate to move upward if significant
increases in long-term interest rates appear to be in process..
(16) Alternative C."
1977-12-19,"In private short-term markets, banks are
likely to issue a sizable amount of new large, negotiable CD's in
coming weeks, though the amount issued will probably drop below
the exceptional volume of the fourth quarter, as other deposit
inflows pick-up somewhat and loan demands moderate..
(16) Alternative C contemplates an increase in the Federal
funds rate to the mid-point of a 6¾-7¼ per cent range between now
and mid-January."
1979-05-22,"In the mortgage market,
however, yields can be expected to continue rising as available supplies
of credit are constrained by the reduced deposit flows to thrift institutions..
(16) Alternative C contemplates a rise in the Federal funds
rate to the midpoint of a 10 to 11 per cent range."
1979-08-14,"(15) Alternative C calls for an increase in the Federal funds
rate to the midpoint of a 10-3/4 to 11-1/2 percent range."
1982-11-16,"The further decline in U.S. interest
rates would tend at least to blunt the strength of the dollar on foreign
exchange markets, and may well bring some depreciation..
(16) Alternative C involves M2 growth over the fourth quarter at
a 9 percent annual rate and constraint on reserve provision that would
probably lead to a federal funds rate of 10 percent or somewhat higher."
1982-12-20,"(17) Alternative C involves slower growth in the monetary
aggregates than alternatives A or B, with M2 growth specified at 10 percent
over the first quarter."
1983-02-08,"The
dollar likely would resume its decline on foreign exchange markets..
(24) Alternative C, which appears most consistent with the
tightest of the longer-run alternatives presented, involves a rise in the
federal funds rate to the 9 percent area."
1983-05-24,"Since
the contemplated interest rate declines are small,a substantial impact on
spending would seem to be contingent on whether the easing engendered a
significant improvement in business and consumer confidence..
(21) Alternative C, which contemplates an increase in the federal
funds rate to the 9 to 9½ percent area, would imply a level of adjustment
borrowing between $500 and $700 million at the current discount rate."
1983-07-12,"While thrift deposit flows might be
about the same as under alternative A, higher deposit costs would once
again begin to eliminate the earnings of a large number of S&Ls and MSBs,
exerting upward pressure on mortgage rates..
(26) Alternative C involves an approach that would exert
relatively strong restraint on the aggregates and credit markets over the
near-term."
1983-11-14,"The reaction of bond yields may be more muted, espe-
cially if incoming data indicated not only continued strength in economic
activity but also a very substantial pickup in money stock growth..
(19) Somewhat tighter reserve conditions are contemplated under
alternative C, with discount window borrowing in the neighborhood of $800
to $900 million and the federal funds rate rising to around 10 percent."
1983-12-19,"Total and nonborrowed
reserves would grow at 4-1/2 and 8-1/2 percent annual rates, respectively,
through March..
(25) Under alternative C, growth in M2 would be constrained to
the lower half of its longer-run range."
1984-03-26,"In such a case, this alternative increases the odds
that a substantial rise of interest rates later this year and into 1985
may be needed to keep money growth rates within their long-run target
bands and/or to forestall greater upward pressures than currently
projected on the average price level..
(17) Alternative C involves a more restrictive policy than
either A or B--slowing M1 growth, for example, over the March-to-June
period to about 5 percent at an annual rate, which would place it at
about the middle of its longer-run range by mid-year."
1984-07-16,"Borrowing in that area might involve
a federal funds rate of around 10-1/2 percent-unless the recent relative
reluctance of banks to borrow from the discount window abates, in which
case the funds rate could be lower for such a level of borrowing..
(25) Alternative C contemplates a very considerable decelera-
tion in M1 growth-as more consistent with growth around the midpoint
of its longer-run range over the year as a whole-and greater restraint
on growth of the broader money and credit aggregates."
1984-08-21,"Expansion of both M3 and debt is
more likely to be somewhat further above the upper ends of their respective
long-run ranges than under alternative B as private credit demands respond
to the stronger economy..
(15) Alternative C calls for sane tightening in money market
conditions over the period ahead, should it be desired to place even more
constraint on the growth of credit."
1984-12-17,"(16) Alternative C is designed to hold growth of M1 and M2 to
rates close to the midpoints of their tentative long-run ranges and is
expected to involve some tightening of reserve conditions."
1985-05-21,"Core deposits in the nontransactions
M2 are likely to expand more rapidly than the 6 percent pace of April,
and net inflows to MMMFs are likely to pick up, given the usual lagged
adjustments in changes in returns on these instruments relative to declines
in market rates..
(12) As compared with alternative B, alternative C involves
tighter reserve conditions thought more likely to be consistent with
constraining M1 growth to the 6 percent path for March to June chosen
by the Comittee at its last meeting."
1985-07-09,"Under those conditions, growth of M1, M2 and debt for
the QIV 1984 to QIV 1985 period could be around the upper ends of the
specifications of alternative II..
(27) Alternative C contemplates a more marked slowing of money
growth over the months ahead than alternative B, with M1 specified to
grow at a 4 percent annual rate."
1985-10-01,"In contrast, M3 would very likely stay well within its
annual range, moving only slightly more above its midpoint by December, as
reduced reliance by depository institutions on issuance of managed liabilities
partly offsets the greater influx of core deposits..
(17) Alternative C assumes some tightening of reserve conditions
consistent with a marked slowing of M1 growth over the next three months
to around a 5-1/2 percent annual rate and with enough moderation of M2 growth
possibly to move just within the target range for the year."
1985-11-04,"The dollar would probably drop
noticeably further on foreign exchange markets..
(14) Alternative C assumes an increase in borrowing at the
discount window to the $700 to $800 million area, which would be expected
to involve federal funds trading around 8-1/2 percent."
1986-07-08,"M3 growth, though, would not be expected to
accelerate as much since some of the pickup in core deposits would be
offset by reduced issuance of managed liabilities..
(24) Alternative C contemplates a tightening of reserve condi-
tions and a more sizable slowing of growth in the monetary aggregates
from their pace of recent months."
1986-09-23,"M1 growth from August to December would be
expected to continue near its rapid pace for the year to date, bringing
growth for the year to 14-3/4 percent..
(16) Alternative C assumes an increase in discount borrowing to
$500 million."
1986-11-05,"The dollar might weaken appreciably under this alternative, absent any
further easing actions abroad..
(16) Alternative C contemplates an increase in discount window
borrowing to $500 million."
1986-12-15,"In addition, bank funding needs might be enlarged by more lending to busi-
nesses, especially if long-term rates did not similarly decline..
(15) Under alternative C, reserve paths would be drawn with an
assumed $500 million of discount window borrowing."
1987-02-10,"Absent a major adjust-
ment, M1 growth in March might return to close to the 15 percent path of
funds and heavier bank funding needs as businesses took down more bank loans,
especially if long-term rates did not register appreciable declines..
(24) Under alternative C, reserve paths would be drawn with a
borrowing level of $500 million, which would likely lead to a rise in the
federal funds rate to the 6-1/2 percent area."
1989-02-07,"(20) The two near-term policy alternatives presented involve
adjustment plus seasonal discount borrowing of $600 million for alterna-
tive B with funds trading at around 9 percent or a bit above, and borrow-
ing of $800 million for alternative C with funds 1/2 percentage point
higher."
1989-05-16,"In any case, some downward pressure on
the exchange value of the dollar would be likely as interest differentials
favoring dollar assets narrowed further..
(13) The tightening of policy under alternative C would be a
considerable surprise to financial markets, and would likely induce a
substantial-backup in rates."
1990-07-02,"M3 from June to
September would be expected to expand at only a 1-1/2 percent rate,
placing growth from the fourth-quarter base of its annual range through
September at 1-1/4 percent..
(27) The tightening of monetary policy under alternative C would
not accord with the prevailing expectations of investors, and interest
rates across the maturity spectrum, along with the exchange value of the
dollar, would ratchet higher."
1990-08-21,"M2, and to a lesser extent M3, would be a bit stronger
under alternative A than with an unchanged funds rate; the staff projects
growth rates from June to September of 4-1/2 percent for M2 and 2-3/4
percent for M3..
(15) Under alternative C, a considerable backup in short-term
rates would appear likely, as a monetary policy tightening would fly in
the face of market expectations."
1991-07-02,"(28) Alternative C also would catch market participants un-
awares, and short-term interest rates likely would adjust upward rather
sharply."
1994-02-03,"The exchange value of the dollar also is likely to trade in a
relatively narrow range around current levels..
(26) The firming in the stance of policy under alternative C
would come sooner than now built into market quotes and would be re-
flected in increases in short-term rates nearly equal to the 50 basis
point hike in the federal funds rate."
1996-01-30,"Against this background, incoming economic data suggest-
ing a more buoyant economy could cause a sharp reversal of the inter-
est rate declines..
(27) If the Committee agreed with the staff outlook for
spending and inflation and wanted to make deliberate progress toward
price stability, the choice of a quarter-point increase in the federal
funds rate under alternative C might be favored."
1996-08-20,"While keeping policy on hold for a time in these cir-
cumstances might imply the need for a greater tightening later to
reverse the pickup in inflation, so long as the action were not post-
poned too long, a wrenching adjustment to output should be avoidable..
(11) Given the recent adjustment to their expectations for
monetary policy, market participants would be somewhat surprised by a
Committee decision to raise its intended federal funds rate by 25
basis points, as under alternative C."
1996-09-24,"Given uncertainties about the
outlook and the perceived lack of a policy consensus within the
Federal Reserve, markets are likely to remain highly sensitive to new
economic data and to indications of Committee members' inclinations..
(10) A tightening of policy at this Committee meeting,
whether by 50 basis points, as assumed in alternative C, or by only 25
basis points, would improve the chances that price pressures would be
contained and inflation outcomes would be consistent with the Commit-
tee members' expectations in July."
1997-05-20,"The exchange
value of the dollar probably would fluctuate around its recent lower levels or even drift lower..
(11) The 1/2 percentage point rise in the federal funds rate under alternative C
would come as a major surprise to financial market participants and likely would spark a
considerable rise in interest rates and the exchange value of the dollar."
1997-11-12,"(9) If the Committee shares the staffs assessment that the U.S. economy has
overshot its sustainable productive potential, it may be disposed to tighten its policy stance, as
in the 25 basis point rise in the funds rate in alternative C."
1997-12-16,"(11) The 25 basis point tightening of Alternative C might be favored if the
Committee wanted to lean against the inflationary bias that may well be inherent in the
current and prospective tautness of labor markets."
1998-02-03,"The drop in yields would tend to boost equity prices
and depress the dollar..
(24) Alternative C might be favored if the Committee saw the economy as
continuing to operate beyond its potential, with the risk that sustained pressures on labor
markets might show through more forcefully than in the staff forecast to higher labor costs
and prices, perhaps hinted at in the recent employment cost report."
1998-05-19,"If so, the
Committee may be willing to accept the significant probability of such an uptick through
economy will prove able to sustain the high operating rate built into the staff forecast without
a rise in underlying inflation..
(11) The Committee instead may prefer to raise its intended federal funds rate by 25
basis points at the May meeting, as under alternative C."
1998-12-22,"As a consequence, spreads in many markets should remain appreciably above their
levels of last summer and liquidity somewhat reduced..
(12) The choice of the quarter-point increase in the federal funds rate of alternative C
would seem to rest on the judgment that the inflation outcome in the staff forecast is
unacceptable or that there are significant risks of a more substantial pickup in inflation."
1999-10-05,"This year borrowers seem to be
securing financing somewhat earlier than the norm, which may help to relieve some
pressures, though not by enough to prevent spreads from remaining quite elevated..
(9) The Committee instead could favor a 1/4 percentage point firming in the
intended federal funds rate to 5-1/2 percent, as in alternative C."
1999-12-21,"Nonetheless, the Committee might wish to
contemplate the 25 basis point tightening of policy at this meeting under alternative C--
perhaps as background for selection of an asymmetric directive or even for consideration of
an intermeeting move once risks associated with the century date change have faded."
2000-11-15,"But prices would likely be bid up somewhat if balanced risks were chosen
because participants would see this choice as raising the possibility of a near-term reduction
in the target funds rate..
(10) If the Committee judges that core inflation probably will trend higher, as in
the staff forecast, and finds the likely degree of economic weakness to be less of a concern,
then it might want to act promptly to resist the acceleration in prices by tightening policy 25
basis points, as in alternative C."
