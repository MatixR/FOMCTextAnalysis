1969-11-25,"(6) For the second paragraph of the current economic policy
directive, the Committee might wish to continue the language currently
in force which reads as follows (alternative A):
""To implement this policy, System open market operations until
the next meeting of the Committee shall be conducted with a view to main-
taining the prevailing firm conditions in money and short-term credit
markets; provided, however, that operations shall be modified if bank
credit appears to be deviating significantly from current projections."".
(13) If the Committee should decide to move toward slightly
less firm money market conditions, it might wish to consider the following
second paragraph for the directive (alternative B):
""To implement this policy, System open market operations until
the next meeting of the Committee shall be conducted with a view to
achieving slightly less firm conditions in money and short-term credit
markets; provided, however, that operations shall be modified if bank
credit appears to be deviating significantly from current projections."""
1969-12-16,"(7) For the second paragraph of the current economic policy
directive, the Committee may wish to consider the following wording
(Alternative A):
""To implement this policy, System open market
operations until the next meeting of the Committee
shall be conducted with a view to maintaining the
prevailing firm conditions in THE money [DEL: and-short
term-credit markets; provided, however, that opera-
tions shall be modified if bank credit appears to be
deviating significantly from current projections or
if UNUSUAL LIQUIDITY pressures SHOULD DEVELOP."""
1970-01-15,"(8) If the Committee decides to maintain unchanged conditions
in the money market over the next four weeks, it may wish to consider
the following second paragraph for the directive (alternative A):
To implement this policy, WHILE TAKING ACCOUNT OF
THE FORTHCOMING TREASURY REFUNDING, System open market
operations until the next meeting of the Committee shall
be conducted with a view to maintaining the prevailing
firm conditions in the money market; provided, however,
that operations shall be modified if bank credit appears
to be deviating significantly from current projections
[DEL: or if unusual liquidity pressures should develop.]."
1970-02-10,"(8) If the Committee wishes to maintain an unchanged stance
with respect to its views as to monetary aggregates and money market
conditions, it may wish to consider the following second paragraph for
the directive (alternative A):
To implement this policy, while taking account of the
CURRENT forthcoming Treasury refunding, possible bank regula-
tory change, and the Committee's desire to see a modest
growth in money and bank credit, System open market opera-
tions until the next meeting of the Committee shall be con-
ducted with a view to maintaining firm conditions in the
money market; provided, however, that operations shall be
modified if money and bank credit appear to be deviating
significantly from current projections..
(15) Should the Committee wish to move toward somewhat
easier conditions in the money market, concomitant with somewhat
stronger growth in the banking and deposit aggregates, it might con-
sider the following second paragraph for the directive (alternative B):
To implement this policy, while taking account of the
CURRENT forthcoming Treasury refunding, possible bank
regulatory changes and the Committee's desire to see
MODERATE a-modest growth in money and bank credit, System
open market operations until the next meeting of the
Committee shall be conducted with a view to maintaining
firm MOVING TOWARD SOMEWHAT EASIER conditions in the
money market; provided, however, that operations shall be
modified if money and bank credit appear to be deviating
significantly from current projections..
(17) Under such conditions, banks might be in a position to regain
a substantial amount of CD's, Instead of an attrition running at about
the $100-$300 million per month rate likely under alternative A (depending
on the degree of firmness achieved under the specifications of that
alternative), we would expect banks at least to maintain outstanding CD's
at around the current $10 billion level."
1970-04-07,"(7) If the Committee wishes to continue on the policy course
adopted at the March meeting, it may want to renew the second paragraph
of the directive issued then, with the addition of a reference to the
Treasury financing, as follows (alternative A):
To implement this policy, the Committee desires to see
moderate growth in money and bank credit over the months ahead."
1970-05-26,"(12) Should the Committee--for example, because it wishes
to accommodate what appears to be increased liquidity demands in the
economy--wish to move onto a path that allows for somewhat greater
rates of growth in the monetary aggregates than Alternative A, the
following language for the second paragraph might be considered:
To implement this policy, the Committee desires to
see [DEL: moderate] SOMEWHAT GREATER growth in money and bank
credit over the months ahead THAN PREVIOUSLY SOUGHT."
1972-02-15,"(14) Alternative A."
1972-07-18,"And over the longer run, the still wide spread of
long over short rates seems to permit scope for a rise in short rates
without significant effects on long markets..
(17) Alternative A.
""To implement this policy, while taking account of
[DEL: possible] THE FORTHCOMING Treasury financing, developments
in capital markets, and international developments, the Com-
mittee seeks to achieve bank reserve and money market con-
ditions that will support [DEL: moderate] SOMEWHAT FASTER growth
in monetary aggregates over the months ahead."".
(18) Alternative B.
""To implement this policy, while taking account of [DEL: possible]
THE FORTHCOMING Treasury financing, developments in capital
markets, and international developments, the Committee seeks
to achieve bank reserve and money market conditions that will
support moderate growth in monetary aggregates over the months."
1973-10-16,"The annual rates of growth from December 1972 to September 1973
are as follows: M1, 4.2 per cent; M2, 6.9 per cent; and the bank credit
proxy, 13.0 per cent.
Alternative A
To implement this policy, while taking account OF THE FORTHCOMING
TREASURY FINANCING AND of international and domestic financial
market developments, the Committee seeks to achieve bank reserve and
money market conditions consistent with [DEL: moderate] FASTER growth in
monetary aggregates over the months ahead THAN HAS OCCURRED THUS
FAR THIS YEAR."
1977-08-16,"Longer-term rates, too, might increase somewhat, but
any such increases might not be long sustained if the market came to
believe that the process of tightening was near an end or that the
process would work to restrain inflation..
(17) The easing in the money market envisioned under alternative
A may stimulate rather substantial downward adjustments over the short-run
in intermediate- and longer-term interest rates, particularly in the
Treasury securities market where dealers may be expected to make efforts
to cover short positions."
1977-10-17,"The funds rate under this alternative
would be expected to reach around 8¼ per cent by the third quarter of
Under alternative D, we have assumed an upward adjustment in Regulation
Q ceilings on time deposits of ¼ percentage point across the board in
the second quarter of next year..
(18) The easing in money market conditions over the next few
weeks under alternative A would be consistent with a shift to somewhat
higher longer-run growth ranges than those of alternative B."
1978-07-18,"As indicated in Appendix I, the staff anticipates that the Federal
funds rate would have to rise to the 8¾ to 9¾ per cent range by
fall under alternative B. Interest rates in the fourth quarter would
be about one percentage point lower under alternative A and three-
quarters of a percentage point higher under alternative C..
(9) Even with the assumption that M-1 grows near the
upper end of its ranges, the GNP projection implies relatively
rapid increases in the velocity of M-1."
1978-10-17,"Even under alternative A, some further increase in
the funds rate might well be required."
1979-05-22,"In the short-run, long-term rates would also likely rise; however, such
increases might be moderated if the market came to believe that a tightening
action now will hasten the ultimate peak in interest rates..
(17) Alternative A calls for a decline in the funds rate over
the intermeeting period to the midpoint of a 9 to 10 per cent range."
1979-08-14,"(14) Alternative A involves a decline in the Federal funds rate
to the midpoint of a 9-3/4 to 10-1/2 percent range."
1980-11-18,"1 / However, for all
of next year, the effects of inflation on the transactions demand for money
are expected to require historically high interest rates in order to restrain
growth in the monetary aggregates to the preliminary FOMC targets..
(14) Alternative A encompasses somewhat higher money targets for
the fourth quarter than alternative B--targets that are thought to be
achievable with little change in interest rates from current levels."
1980-12-18,"Alternative A proposes some-
what higher growth rates of money than alternative B. (The charts on the
following pages depict the near-term behavior of the monetary targets under the
three alternatives, with M-1A and M-1B shown both before and after adjust-
ment for the impact of NOW accounts; the alternatives are shown in relation
to the tentative long-run ranges for 1981 established at the July meeting.)."
1983-12-19,"With the renewed expansion
of transactions deposits, total reserves would be expected to increase at
about a 2-1/2 percent annual rate through March, and nonborrowed reserves
would rise at a 4-1/2 percent rate..
(22) Alternative A involves an easing of bank reserve positions-
with borrowing falling to around $400 million and federal funds dropping
to around 9 percent or a little below-that would tend to place M2 and M1 in
the upper halves of their tentative longer-run ranges by March."
1984-07-16,"Growth of M2 would be expected to be
around the midpoint of its long-run range..
(23) Alternative A involves a policy approach that keeps M1
growth nearer the upper end of its longer-run range."
1985-05-21,"(14) Alternative A contemplates lesser restraint on reserve
conditions than B. Borrowing would be expected to drop to around minimum
levels--perhaps around $200 to $250 million--and the federal funds rate
to fall to somewhat under the current 7-1/2 percent discount rate."
1986-11-05,"(14) Alternative A assumes either a reduction in discount window
borrowing to a near-frictional level of $150 million or a cut in the discount
rate of one-half percentage point with borrowing maintained at $300 million."
1987-03-31,"On a quarterly
average basis, M1 would rise at a 7-1/2 percent rate in the second quarter,
the slowest rate since late 1984, and its velocity would decline at only a
at about a 10 percent annual rate..
(14) Alternative A assumes a reduction in discount window borrow-
ing to a near-frictional $150 million or a 50 basis point decrease in the
discount rate with borrowing maintained at $300 million."
1988-05-17,"M3 could
be supported somewhat by a further shifting of business credit demands to
banks as higher bond yields curtail firms' offerings of longer-term debt,
necessitating greater reliance on managed liabilities by banks than under
alternative B..
(14) Alternative A would be implemented through restoring the
assumption for adjustment plus seasonal borrowing to the level of $200 mil-
lion that was in force from late January through late March, with federal
funds probably returning to the 6-1/2 percent trading area; even lower rates
could prevail if seasonal credit, which is now above $200 million, responded
relatively little to the decline in reserve pressures."
1988-11-01,"And, in
general, trend growth in bank and thrift credit should remain damped in
response to capital requirements and regulatory pressures..
(14) Under alternative A, money market interest rates would
decline about 1/2 percentage point, with the 3-month Treasury bill drop-
ping to a little below 7 percent."
1990-02-06,"In the
federal sector, borrowing quickens over the balance of the quarter, while
the average growth of the overall debt of the other sectors should about
maintain the estimated January pace..
(25) The policy easing embodied in alternative A, with the funds
rate moving to 7-3/4 percent, would induce a nearly comparable decline in
other short-term interest rates."
1990-10-02,"Under alternative A, the drop in opportunity costs would boost

Alt."
1995-09-26,"Of course, markets may be buffeted by
developments in the legislative process suggesting shifting odds on
the extent of deficit reduction..
(12) If the Committee saw reasonably high odds of more
restrictive effects on the economy than the staff forecast, it might
favor an easing of the funds rate, as under alternative A."
1997-12-16,"Against this
background, and with labor markets already extremely tight, the Committee might perceive
that counting on sufficient additional restraint coming from Asian developments runs an
unacceptable risk of a rebound in inflation in 1998 that would be disruptive to reverse..
(13) The 25 basis point easing of Alternative A might be favored if the Committee
were concerned that turmoil abroad might have an even greater impact on the U.S. economy
than the staff has built into the forecast."
1998-02-03,"In these circumstances, the Committee should be
able to head off a potential upturn in inflation before higher actual inflation gets built into
wage and price decisions..
(23) The Committee may see sufficient chances of a shortfall in activity from the
staff forecast to suggest a small easing at this time--as in the 25 basis point decline in the
federal funds rate under alternative A."
1998-08-18,"Credit-
risk spreads on domestic private debt, as well as on the obligations of a number of foreign
governments and firms, likely would widen noticeably..
(10) In view of recent developments in global financial markets, the Committee might
be inclined to consider a 25 basis point easing of monetary policy, as in alternative A.
Aggregate demand in the United States apparently has already decelerated appreciably, and
Committee members may believe that the staff forecast does not give enough weight to ongoing
deflationary forces coming from developments abroad."
1998-12-22,"Finally, the surprise easing of monetary policy in continental Europe may indicate an increased
willingness there to respond to signs of demand weakness, which would facilitate easing in other
countries and reduce the risk of a slackening in global economic activity..
(13) The case for easing further at some point, as in the 1/4 point reduction in the
federal funds rate at this meeting of alternative A, might rest on the view that there are
substantial risks of a shortfall in global demand and of more downward pressure on prices than
the Committee might find desirable."
