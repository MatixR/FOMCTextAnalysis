of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was created 
through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned 
versions text-searchable.2   Though a stringent quality assurance process was 
employed, some imperfections may remain.

Recent developments
(1) M1 grew at a 10.6 per cent annual rate in March, a little
more than projected in the last bluebook. Although growth in April is
estimated to be somewhat slower, on average, the extent of the slowing is now
expected to be less than anticipated. Thus, for the two months combined, M1
now appears to be expanding at slightly above a 9 per cent annual rate,
compared with the Committee's 5½ to 8½ per cent range of tolerance adopted
at the last meeting. Growth of M2, on the other hand, appears to be within
the Committee's two-month range of tolerance,as shown in the table below.
With business loan demands very strong, and with large CD run-offs expected
around the tax date, banks have bid actively for large CD's and non-deposit
sources of funds. As a result, expansion of the adjusted credit proxy has
been much more rapid than anticipated--accelerating to a 12 per cent annual
rate in March, and a projected 23 per cent annual rate in April.

(2) Because of the rapid expansion in CD's and bank credit,
RPD growth appears likely to be well in excess of the upper limit of
its range of tolerance. As may be seen from the table below, CD's and
nondeposit sources absorbed considerably more reserves than originally
expected. Private demand deposits also absorbed more reserves than
expected, but the overshoot was considerably less than for CD's.

(3) In accordance with the discussion at the March 19 meeting,
early in the inter-meeting period the Desk sought reserve conditions
that would raise the Federal funds rate from the 9 ½ per cent level just
reached at the time of the meeting to a level more consistent with the
Committee's desires with respect to the monetary aggregates. Early action
was considered desirable because of expected Treasury financing operations
at the end of March; a tax bill was auctioned on March 26 and a 2-year
more reluctant supplier of nonborrowed reserves. By the close of the
period, reserve operations were expected to be consistent with a Federal
funds rate of 10 per cent or somewhat higher. Over the three full
statement weeks ending within the inter-meeting period, member bank
borrowing at Federal Reserve Banks has averaged nearly $1.5 billion,
about $350 million larger than in the three preceding statement weeks.
(4) The combination of heavy business credit demands, tighter
money market conditions, and developing evidence that the economy was
not so weak as anticipated contributed to large across-the-board interest
rate advances during the inter-meeting period. Advances in short-term
rates ranged generally from 50 to 100 basis points. With rates on
commercial paper and large bank CD's rising steeply, major banks came
under particularly heavy pressure as both their business loans and the
costs of funds to cover such loans increased. Reflecting this squeeze,
the bank prime rate moved upward in rapid sequence from 8¾ at the time
of the last meeting to 10 per cent at a number of banks in the latest
week. Bond yields rose 35 to 75 basis points during the period,with the
consequent sudden large capital losses leading to some unsettlement in
(5) Very recently, however, securities markets have shown
some signs of stabilizing. This week's offerings of new corporate and
municipal securities have been well received at the higher interest rate
levels, and yields on some key U.S. Government securities have edged a
little lower. Yield declines were quite sharp in the bill market, where
there is a technical shortage of supply. The 3-month Treasury bill,
for example, has traded most recently at 8.25 per cent, down from the
recent high of 8.65 per cent.
(6) The large recent increases in rates on competing market
securities have begun to exert pressures on non-bank financial inter-
mediaries. While flows to these institutions remained quite favorable
in March, New York City savings banks--typically the first to suffer
from disintermediation--experienced large withdrawals in early April,
comparable in relative magnitude to those of early April 1970. Industry
reports suggest that intermediaries generally are taking a more cautious
approach on mortgage commitments, and the most sensitive interest rates in
mortgage markets have begun to rise.
(7) The table on the next page shows (in percentage annual rates
of change) selected monetary and financial flows over various recent time
periods. Appendix Table III compares money supply growth rates computed on
a quarterly-average basis with those computed on a last-month-of-quarter
basis. Projected figures on the two bases are shown in appendix Table IV
for the three alternatives presented in the next section.

(9) Alternative C represents continuation of the strategy with
regard to the aggregates adopted by the Committee at its last meeting.
That is, the alternative contemplates return of M1 to the 5¾ per cent long-
run growth path (depicted in the chart on the following page) by September.
Accomplishing this would appear to require interest rates somewhat higher
than indicated at the last meeting, and also higher than those currently
prevailing, in view of the stronger growth in nominal GNP that is now
projected for the second and third quarters. The Federal funds rate range
for the inter-meeting period thought to be consistent with the alternative
C pattern for the aggregates is 9¾--11¼ per cent, centering on 10½ per cent.

(10) Alternative B calls for somewhat more rapid growth in the
monetary aggregates over the second and third quarters, typified by a 6 per
cent growth rate for M 1 . The B growth rates seem obtainable with little
further significant change in money market conditions and short-term
interest rates, in light of the sharp increases in short-term rates that
have already occurred during the past two months. Thus, the Federal funds
rate under this alternative centers around 10 per cent. The still more
rapid longer-run growth rates of alternative A--including a 6¾ per cent
rate for M 1 over the second and third quarters--appear likely to be
associated with declines in both short- and long-term interest rates.
(11) Over the April-May period, M1 growth is likely to be
somewhat above the long-run path. Under alternative B, for example, M 1
growth is indicated in the 6--8 per cent range. These above-path in-
creases reflect in large part the sizable expansion in M 1 currently
estimated for April. Given the lagged relationship between interest
rates and money demand, however, M 1 growth is expected to moderate later
as it approaches the longer-run path.
(12) Between now and mid-May, short-term interest rates could
decline somewhat under alternative B. Indeed, the very recent drop in
the 3-month bill rate probably is anticipating some of the potential for
downward rate adjustments. Any decline that did develop over the next
few weeks is very likely to be temporary, assuming a 10 per cent Federal
funds rate. Over the longer run, the 3-month bill rate would seem most
likely to fluctuate around a 8 ½--8¾ per cent range.
(13) A number of factors might contribute to temporary easing
in short-term markets in the weeks immediately ahead. The extremely
large issuance of new CD's by banks, which has contributed to recent
upward pressures on short-term rates, has partly reflected advance
preparation for large tax date maturities, and those pressures should
abate after mid-April. Funds from large oil payments in April may also
become available to the short-term sector of U.S. credit markets via
U.S. banks' use of the Euro-dollar market. In addition, that portion
of the $4½ billion of maturing April tax bills not turned in for taxes
would generate reinvestment demand for short-term securities. Finally,
the Treasury's May refunding--to be announced on May 1--might include
some cash redemption of the $5½ billion of maturing publicly held debt
because of the possibility of debt ceiling problems.
(14) A rise in the funds rate over the next few weeks--such
as would be likely under alternative C-- would generate market expecta-
tions of a further tightening of monetary policy. This would offset any
tendency for short-term rates to decline, even temporarily, and would
probably result in further upward adjustments. Over the next few months,
the 3-month bill rate could be around 9 per cent, and possibly higher in
the summer when Treasury cash borrowing demands are seasonally strong.
(15) Under alternative B, with market interest rates little
changed on balance from current high levels, net savings inflows to
nonbank thrift institutions are likely to be slower than the 8 per cent
first-quarter pace. We would estimate a growth rate of about 6 per cent
in the second quarter and 4 per cent in the third, assuming no change in
Regulation Q. Under alternative C, these institutions would come under
greater pressure, of course, but in either case some tightening in the
availability of mortgage loan commitments would be likely, compared with
the situation in the early months of the year.
(16) Net inflows to commercial banks of time and savings
deposits other than large CD's are likewise expected to be slower over
the months ahead than in the first quarter, though the experience
of banks may continue to be somewhat better than at thrift
institutions. Commercial banks appear to be having greater success
than the specialized thrift institutions in attracting large time deposits
(those of $100,000 or more) that are not subject to Regulation Q ceilings.
Such deposits are reported as part of the other time and savings category
and, unlike large negotiable CD's, are included in the M2 measure.
(17) We would expect banks to offset some part of any loss in
other time and savings deposits through increased issuance of large CD's
or greater borrowing in theEuro-dollar market, depending on relative costs.
However, under any of the alternatives presented, the amount of borrowing
by banks through CD's and nondeposit sources is expected to be considerably
less than in recent weeks, partly because preparations for tax-date run-
offs will have been completed and partly because business loan demand on
banks is expected to moderate from the exceptionally rapid pace of March.
Moreover, it is probable that the spread between the bank lending rate
and the commercial paper rate will favor bank credit less than was the
case in March.
(18) In intermediate- and long-term debt markets, demands
are likely to remain strong over the weeks ahead. Corporate and State
and local government bond offerings remain quite high, despite recent
postponements. Also, the Treasury refunding will probably involve
marketing securities with mainly intermediate-term maturities. Given
the volume of private and governmental securities in prospect, bond yields
could rise considerably further under alternative C. High-grade corporate
issues, which are already above their summer highs, could approach their
Treasury bond is already above the earlier peak). Under alternative B,
further upward adjustments in bond yields are likely to be comparatively
modest, given the increases that already have occurred and the stabilizing
tendencies that we would expect in short-term markets.
(19) Under alternative A, savings inflows to thrift institutions
would be expected to recover to close to their first-quarter pace, as
receding market rates provide less competition for savings funds. At
banks, deposits inflows--both demand and consumer-type time and savings--
would probably be well sustained. As a result, credit demands could be
financed without banks adding to pressures on credit markets through
aggressive issuance of large CD's or reductions in portfolio liquidity.
Proposed directive language
(20) Presented below are three alternative formulations
for the operational paragraph of the directive, which are intended
to correspond to the similarly lettered policy alternatives dis-
cussed in the preceding section. For all three alternatives,
it is proposed to include a reference to Treasury financing because
the regular May refinancing will be announced on May 1.
Alternative A
To implement this policy, while taking account of THE
FORTHCOMING TREASURY FINANCING AND OF international and
domestic financial market developments, [DEL: including the
prospective Treasury financing] the Committee seeks to achieve
bank reserve and money market conditions [DEL: that would moderate
CONSISTENT WITH growth in monetary aggregates over the
months ahead SUFFICIENT TO ACCOMMODATE MODERATE EXPANSION
IN REAL GNP AT THE HIGHER DOLLAR VALUES NOW PREVAILING.
Alternative B
To implement this policy, while taking account of
THE FORTHCOMING TREASURY FINANCING AND OF international
and domestic financial market developments, [DEL: including
the prospective Treasury financing] the Committee seeks
to achieve bank reserve and money market conditions that
would moderate SOMEWHAT growth in monetary aggregates
over the months ahead.
Alternative C
To implement this policy, while taking account of
THE FORTHCOMING TREASURY FINANCING AND OF international and
domestic financial market developments, [DEL: including the
prospective Treasury financing] the Committee seeks to achieve
bank reserve and money market conditions that would moderate
growth in monetary aggregates over the months ahead.
(21) In the event that the Committee wishes to couch the
operational paragraph of the directive in terms of money market
conditions, the specifications of alternative B might be associated
with language indicating that "...the Committee seeks to maintain
about the prevailing money market conditions, provided that the
monetary aggregates appear to be growing at rates within the specified
ranges of tolerance."
