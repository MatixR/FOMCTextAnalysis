MONEY MARKET AND RESERVE RELATIONSHIPS
Recent developments
Spurred by large business tax payment financing needs and a
sizable Treasury tax bill financing, the pace of bank credit expansion
accelerated in June and July and continued relatively high in early August.
In July, bank credit (as measured by the daily average bank credit proxy)
expanded at a 15.2 per cent annual rate. This was at the top of the
(After including borrowing abroad through foreign branches, bank credit
rose by 16 per cent in July). The slightly higher growth rate in bank
credit reflected a somewhat longer lasting expansion in private demand
deposits than had been projected, as the tax bills banks acquired by
crediting tax and loan accounts in the second week of July were sold off
more slowly than originally assumed. Time and savings deposits during
July expanded in line with projections at a 14.5 per cent annual rate.
The money supply, which had been expanding rapidly since the
beginning of May, largely in reflection of a sharp decline in U.S.
last month's growth in the money supply occurred early in the month,

as sizable repayments of banks' business loans did not develop as
soon as expected following the bulge in such lending over the June
tax period. But beginning after mid-July growth in the money supply
leveled off, as considerably larger than usual net repayments of business
loans occurred and continued into early August.
These demands for credit and money were accommodated almost
by a 16 per cent expansion in nonborrowed reserves during July. As a
result member bank borrowings remained relatively low. Federal funds
and dealer loan rates were mostly at the low end of their recent ranges
in the latter part of July, with the Federal funds rate averaging
around 3¾ per cent and dealer new loan rates in New York around 4
per cent. In the latest statement week ending August 9, the funds rate
has averaged slightly above 4 per cent, and dealer loan rates have moved
up some.
In the bill market, rates fluctuated fairly sharply in the
second half of July, but since then the 3-month Treasury bill rate has
tended to stabilize around its mid-July level. Most recently, the 3-
month bill was quoted at 4.17 per cent. Longer-term bills have
drifted up in yield on balance, partly in reflection of the flotation
of the Treasury's new 15-month note, with the 1-year bill most recently
at 5.10 per cent. The President's tax message did not elicit any
extensive reaction on interest rates in money and capital markets, but
may have contributed to the apparent modest lessening of credit market
pressures in private capital markets.
CONFIDENTIAL FR) -3- August 11, 1967.
Member bank borrowings have averaged $78 million during the
past four statement weeks, little changed from previous weeks (except
for the high borrowings during the week containing the banks' midyear
statement date and the July 4 holiday). At the same time excess
reserves have averaged $342 million in the past four statement weeks,
down from the previous four weeks which included a seasonal bulge in
the second week of July. Free reserves averaged $264 million during
the weeks since the previous meeting.
Prospective developments
Credit expansion is expected to slacken during August, with
an annual rate of growth in the bank credit proxy of 5-7 per cent
expected from the week ending August 2 to the week ending August 30.
But for the month on average the bank credit proxy is expected to grow
by a 14-16 per cent annual rate, in large part reflecting the carry-
over effect on the August average of the bank credit growth in July.
In the previous Blue Book the bank credit projection for
the month had assumed that the Treasury would raise no new cash in
connection with the mid-August refunding and that the next cash
financing would be in early September. The current bank credit pro-
jection for August includes the effect of the Treasury cash refunding
with payment date at midmonth, which raised about $300 million of new
cash and avoided attrition that we had earlier estimated might be as
much as $500 million. In addition, it allows for a $2¼ billion for
new cash financing to be paid for at the end of August. This financing
may include a note offering, with a coupon attractive to banks.
CONFIDENTIAL (FR)
The new August projection would lead to a July-August average
bank credit expansion of 14-16 per cent, as compared with 10-12 per
cent shown in the last Blue Book. About half of the difference
reflects the different Treasury financing pattern that is emerging.
The recent strength in business loans persisted longer than expected,
but large repayments have recently developed, as earlier noted.
A slower rate of expansion in the money supply is also
expected in August, as loan demands are expected to continue quite
moderate over the balance of the month. On average in August, money
supply may expand at about a 3-5 per cent annual rate, and shows a
smaller increase over the course of the month.
Time deposits in August are expected to rise fairly sharply
at a 16-18 per cent annual rate. Recently there was a larger than
anticipated growth in outstanding negotiable CD's, as major banks have
tapped both the CD and Euro-dollar market to obtain funds perhaps in
part in anticipation of increasing loan demands this fall. Consumer
time and savings deposits, as best can be judged from the available
data, are still showing strength, although perhaps somewhat less
buoyancy than in the spring.
With these developments in train for August, maintenance of
prevailing money market conditions may be consistent with a more moderate
bank credit growth in September than in recent months. Prevailing money
market conditions would continue to encompass a Federal funds rate
averaging around 4 per cent or below, new dealer loan rates at New York
CONFIDENTIAL (FR) -5- August 11, 1967
banks in a 4 1/8 - 4-3/8 per cent range, member bank borrowings generally
in a $50-$100 million range, and free reserves averaging $200-$300
million. Such conditions would be consistent with an "even keel"
posture, in view of the forthcoming Treasury cash financing assumed to
be in the intermediate-term note area, and may keep the 3-month Treasury
bill rate in a 4.10-4.35 per cent range. The bill rate may drift up
toward the upper end of the range as the September dividend and tax dates
Under these conditions, and with basic economic developments
generally consistent with staff projections in the Green Book, bank
credit expansion in September might be in the order of 7-9 per cent on
average. However, an automobile strike during September could alter the
outlook for bank loans, depending on its duration and on the companies'
ability to stock the dealers with new models before a strike.
Strike uncertainty also, of course, affects projections for
the money supply and time deposits since it could seriously affect
corporate cash flows and personal income. Assuming no strike, or one
of brief duration or limited scope, money supply in September is likely
to decline by about 2-4 per cent on average. Some further increase in
U.S. Government deposits can be expected on average in September, in
view of the tax payments during the month and the new cash borrowing just
prior to the beginning of the month.
A slower rate of growth in time deposits is expected in
September. The recent somewhat less buoyant behavior of consumer time
CONFIDENTIAL (FR)
and savings deposits is expected to continue, but more importantly banks
are not expected to increase outstanding negotiable CD's to the extent
they did in recent weeks. The new Treasury cash offering may provide
some competition for time and savings deposits, especially if it is
necessary to use a highly attractive 5½ per cent coupon on an
intermediate-term security. In addition, corporations may show less
interest in CD's in September when their tax payments--including both
income taxes and withheld employee taxes--will be somewhat larger than
last year and substantially more than in 1965.
This credit and money picture for September--with Government
and private demand deposits taken together showing little net change--
would be consistent with a reduction in the annual rate of expansion
in nonborrowed reserves from about 13-15 per cent in July-August to
about 3-5 per cent in September. Assuming no significant change in free
reserve levels and money market conditions, the System would be providing
about $600 million of reserves between now and early September. Sub-
sequently the System would be a moderate net seller until late September
and early October.
The foregoing projections lead to annual rates of increase for
key monetary variables since last November, as follows:

CONFIDENTIAL (FR) -7- August 11, 1967.
The more moderate expansion of bank credit and reserves
foreseen for the coming month is not likely in itself to exert upward
pressures on long-term interest rates since it basically reflects an
expected moderation of private credit demands from their June-July
high levels. The tax message has also provided some basis for calming
the atmosphere in corporate and municipal markets. However, many
uncertainties persist with respect to the timing and ultimate size of
tax increases and to the reactions of businesses and consumers to a
prospective additional tax bite. Given these uncertainties, as well as
those surrounding the strike situation, a shortfall in bank credit
expansion below the moderate rates projected for September cannot be
ruled out as a possibility. On the other hand, larger than projected
bank credit growth could stem from business loan demands associated with
a stronger than anticipated turn-around in business inventory policies
and somewhat larger than expected tax payments in September.
