MONEY MARKET AND RESERVE RELATIONSHIPS
Recent developments
(1) Preliminary estimates indicate that growth in the adjusted
bank credit proxy for both March and the first quarter was in line with
annual rates regarded as desirable at the time of the last Committee
meeting. While the money supply and time deposits appear to have grown
somewhat more rapidly than projected over the period as a whole, for a
time between meetings the emerging weekly evidence suggested that these
aggregates were falling short of the earlier blue book figures. However,
in the final--Easter--week of March, the preliminary data indicate that
a very large bulge in private demand deposits developed, This reflected
for the most part technical factors affecting cash items and related to
the 4-day holiday week-end abroad and perhaps also the postal strike and
the air traffic slowdown.

(2) Time deposits in March showed their first major monthly
increase on average in over a year, as had been projected. The size of
the increase was a little larger than anticipated, due in large measure
to steeper than forecast declines in short-term market rates. While a
build-up of foreign official CD's continued to account for a sizable part
of the March growth in total time accounts, the pick-up in flows to
consumer-type time and savings accounts--first evident in February--strength-
ened further during March. Also, as Treasury bill yields dropped below
CD rate ceilings, sales of CD's to domestic holders began to develop.
(3) Despite the generally strengthened deposit flows, growth
in the adjusted bank credit proxy for March was about as projected in the
last blue book. In addition to a modest short-fall in U.S. Government
deposits as compared with estimates, the main factors offsetting greater
deposit gains were larger cut-backs than forecast in Euro-dollar borrowing
and slower than estimated growth in bank-related commercial paper. From
the end of February to the end of March, Euro-dollar borrowings of major
banks were reduced by more than $1 billion, while other nondeposit sources
of funds, after their growth slowed in the early weeks of March, showed a
net contraction of $160 million in the week ending March 25 (the latest
for which data are available).
(4) Treasury bill yields have dropped 20 to 50 basis points on
balance from the levels prevailing at the time of the last Committee meeting,
and other short-term rates have dropped commensurately. For a brief
period about ten days ago, bill yields reached substantially lower
levels. This temporary further decline reflected actions by dealers
to build up inventories and sizable seasonal demands for bills--arising
from the pay-off of maturing tax bills, from bank window dressing, and
from the Cook County property tax date--coming at a time when official
statements and emerging financial statistics both seemed to be confirming
market expectations that monetary policy had become less restrictive. Since
late March, bill yields have backed up, with the 3-month issue most recently
bid at about 6.35 per cent, as dealer bill positions expanded sharply to
more than $4 billion and in partial reflection of a normal seasonal
reversal in yields.

(5) Money market conditions on balance have been somewhat
more comfortable over the last four weeks than in the prior inter-
meeting period. Early in the period the Desk sought to achieve eas-
ier conditions that would help to offset the observed shortfall in
the monetary aggregates relative to expectations, but more recently
money market conditions have been permitted to firm up a little
again, partly under the pressure of dealer financing needs. Over
the inter-meeting weeks as a whole, the effective Federal funds rate
averaged close to 7-3/4 per cent, compared to an average of about
costs declined to an average of around 8-3/8 per cent in New York.
Net borrowed reserves have fluctuated in a fairly wide $675-$900
million range. Excluding the most recent week, when bank uncertain-
ties about reserve positions and preparation for the quarterly
statement data increased bank use of the discount window, member
bank borrowings have averaged about $875 million.

Prospective developments
(7) If the Committee wishes to continue on the policy course
adopted at the March meeting, it may want to renew the second paragraph
of the directive issued then, with the addition of a reference to the
Treasury financing, as follows (alternative A):
To implement this policy, the Committee desires to see
moderate growth in money and bank credit over the months ahead.
System open market operations until the next meeting of the
Committee shall be conducted with a view to maintaining money
market conditions consistent with that objective, TAKING
ACCOUNT OF THE FORTHCOMING TREASURY FINANCING.
The path given below for monetary aggregates could be considered as
consistent with the directive (data shown are seasonally adjusted
monthly average levels in billions of dollars). It should be stressed
that while we have specified point estimates,variations around these
individual estimates are likely and should be acceptable, provided they
are not cumulative in one direction.
Adjusted bank Money Time Total
credit proxy Supply Deposits Reserves
Annual rate of in-
crease, second
quarter 4-1/2% 2-1/2% 16% 1-1/2%
p/ Preliminary.
(8) The money supply bulge at the end of March is likely
to be followed by rather sharp declines in the money supply over the
next few weeks--a development somewhat similar to last January.
After this adjustment from the end-of-March bulge, the money supply
path turns upward and the average level for June is somewhat greater
than in the previous blue book, but with the annual rate of increase
a somewhat slower 2-1/2 per cent because of the inflated March
average level. For the adjusted credit proxy, the June average level
is about the same as in the previous blue book.
(9) A weekly pattern spanning the inter-meeting period
consistent with the monthly path of monetary aggregates noted above
is shown below (in billions of dollars, seasonally adjusted), although
it must be recognized, of course, that a weekly pattern is subject to
even more random fluctuation than monthly figures.
Week Adjusted Bank Money Time Total
Ending Credit Proxy Supply Deposits Reserves
p/ Preliminary.
The weekly pattern shown here would lead to an average annual rate of
increase from March to April of about 4 per cent for the money supply,
(reflecting in large part strength at the end of March). A rather
sizable drop in U.S. Government deposits is anticipated in April, and
an even larger drop is likely to develop in May. This does not allow for
the earlier timing of the Federal pay raise, and if the Treasury balance
for this or other reasons tends to drop too low, the Treasury may come
in for cash borrowing before the second quarter ends, a possibility not
allowed for in our projections.
(10) This aggregate pattern for the weeks ahead may require a
Federal funds rate fluctuating in a 7-9 per cent range. Rates may have
to move to the upper end of the range if short-term interest rates begin
to stimulate more rapid growth in time deposits and particularly the
adjusted bank credit proxy than is desired. Net borrowed reserves may
fluctuate in a $650 million--$l.1 billion range, with member bank
borrowings in a $750 million to $1.2 billion range.
(11) The growth path shown for time deposits, both weekly and
over the months ahead, assumes that-the 3-month Treasury bill rate will
remain generally withing a 6-1/8--6-5/8 per cent range, and that there
will be no significant further decline in other short-term rates. A
bill rate in that range would appear to be consistent with some slowing
of growth in time deposits from the very rapid $800 million per
week pace of the latter half of March, which if it were to continue,
would lead to an even larger rate of time deposit growth
than the l1 per cent shown above for the second quarter. In April,
growth in time deposits is expected to slow somewhat as the month
progresses, largely as a result of less active CD issuance by banks,
as explained below. In May, payment for the large AT&T bond offer-
ing may also slow down time deposit inflows. Moreover, the stimulus
from widespread advertising by banks of the new higher ceiling
rates on consumer-type time deposits is likely to diminish as time
goes on.
(12) Consistent with growth in the adjusted bank credit
proxy held to about a 4-1/2 per cent, annual rate, over the second
quarter, net growth in large CD's and nondeposit sources of funds
are estimated to be around $150 million per week. As banks obtain
time deposits in relatively sizable volume, they are not likely to
add to, and may make further repayments of, relatively high cost
Euro-dollar and commercial paper borrowings. We have not, however,
assumed further significant net repayment of such funds, partly
because the greater strength now projected for GNP may sustain
credit demand. Even so, growth in the adjusted bank credit proxy
continues quite moderate, largely as a result of a substantial drop
in U.S. Government deposits over the quarter as a large Federal
cash surplus is utilized to retire debt.
(13) To keep expansion of banks' money market liabilities
within the dimensions of the preceding paragraph might require a 3-
month bill rate in the upper half of the 6-1/8--6-5/8 per cent range
mentioned earlier, unless the Committee wishes to permit somewhat
greater growth in bank credit. As seasonal downward pressures on
bill rates develop as the quarter progresses, this may mean that
the Desk would have to supply less reserves than would otherwise
be the case, thus exerting upward pressure on money market rates.
There is the possibility that such pressures would lead to a
reversal of market expectations that could back up interest rates
on a broader scale.
(14) Long-term interest rates over the next few weeks
are not expected to decline much, if at all, in any event. The
corporate calendar remains large, and, with short-term interest
rates remaining around current levels, there is little reason to
anticipate that investor expectations of credit easing will induce
them to become more willing buyers of long-term debt instruments.
Moreover, the Treasury at the end of April will be announcing a
refunding of almost $5 billion of publicly-held maturing coupon
issues, and if market conditions warrant might also include a pre-
refunding of about $5-1/2 billion of publicly-held August maturities.
Alternative path
(15) If the Committee desires to see somewhat more
growth in money and bank credit over the months ahead, it may wish
to consider the following directive language (alternative E);
To implement this policy, the Committee desires to see
SOMEWHAT MORE moderate growth in money and bank credit over
the months ahead THAN SOUGHT AT THE PRECEDING MEETING. System
open market operations until the next meeting of the Committee
shall be conducted with a view to maintaining money market
conditions consistent with that objective, TAKING ACCOUNT OF THE
FORTHCOMING TREASURY FINANCING.
The following path of the monetary aggregates might be taken to be con-
sistent with this directive.

p/ Preliminary.
Most of the additional expansive effect on the aggregates from this path de-
velops after April. It is assumed that Desk operations supply more reserves
than under the previous alternative as April progresses, and that
Treasury bill rates drop in the latter part of the month to around
easing in monetary policy at a time when short-term rates may be
tending to decline somewhat for seasonal reasons.
(16) A weekly pattern over the next several weeks con-
sistent with this alternative path is shown below.
Adjusted Money Time Total
p/ Preliminary.
With this pattern, the annual rate of increase in April, on average,
for the adjusted proxy would be around 10 per cent; for the money
supply 4 per cent; and for time deposits 22 per cent. It is assumed
that banks would use part of the deposit funds obtained to reduce
other borrowings.
(17) Under this alternative, money market conditions in April
would, on the whole, be somewhat less firm than under the first
alternative. The Federal funds rate might drop below 7 per cent at
times, and generally would not rise much above 8 per cents Member bank
borrowings would generally remain under $900 million, and perhaps
decline to as little as $60O million. Net borrowed reserves would
probably fluctuate in a $500-$800 million range.
(18) Long-term interest rates may decline for a time as a
result both of the initial impact on expectations of such an easing
in policy and the enhanced ability of banks to acquire securities.
However, it is possible that before the end of the second quarter,
interest rates could begin to rise again. Such an outcome would be
particularly likely if there were indications of further easing
fiscal restraints, with a consequent intensification of inflationary
expectations and increased anticipatory borrowing.
