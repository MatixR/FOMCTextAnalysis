through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned 
versions text-searchable.2   Though a stringent quality assurance process was 
employed, some imperfections may remain.

Recent developments
(1) Both RPD and M1 appear to be growing at annual rates below
the low ends of the Committee's March-April ranges of tolerance, as shown
in the table. Expansion in M2 also seems to be on the slow side, at the
low end of the range specified four weeks ago. Growth in the bank credit
proxy--at a 17 per cent annual rate for the March-April period--appears
to be somewhat faster than expected at the time of the last Committee

(2) The shortfalls in RPD and the money supply aggregates relative
to earlier expectations are attributable almost entirely to slower than
anticipated growth in private demand deposits. The reasons for this are
obscure as usual, but one factor may be that processing of Treasury refund
checks has been slower than we had anticipated, thus keeping Treasury tax
and loan balances higher and private demand balances lower than projected.
Also, the steepness of the rise in short-term interest rates since late
last year may be producing a dampening effect on money demands with a
somewhat shorter time lag than usual. In addition, the dramatic first
quarter upsurge in consumer spending and the accompanying sharp advances
in retail prices might have caused households to draw down money balances
below normal levels.
(3) Early in the inter-meeting period, RPD and the money
supply aggregates all appeared to be growing at rates within the Committee's
March-April ranges of tolerance. While the Desk in this period continued
to follow a reserve strategy expected to produce a Federal funds rate
averaging around 7 per cent, unexpected shortfalls in reserve availability
from other reserve factors produced an average funds rate closer to 7-1/8
per cent. When it became clear, in late March, that RPD and M1 were
running below their desired growth ranges and that M2 was at the bottom
of its range, the Desk adopted a reserve strategy expected to be consistent
with a Federal funds rate averaging around 7 per cent, but with doubts
resolved on the side of less tautness. By the statement week of April 11,
the average Federal funds rate had dropped to 6.84 per cent. Late on
Wednesday, April 11, a majority of Committee members concurred in the
Chairman's recommendation that the low end of the range of tolerance for
the funds rate be raised from 6-3/4 to 7 per cent for the remaining part
of the intermeeting period, and the Desk has since sought to keep reserve
availability correspondingly firm.
(4) Other short-term interest rates continued under general
upward pressure during the early weeks of the intermeeting period, but
after early April this trend was reversed, as the market came to expect
an early announcement of a stronger controls program and the view
developed that no further near-term tightening (and possibly some easing)
of monetary policy was likely. Over the full intermeeting period, short-
term rates showed mixed changes. Yields on both Treasury bills and
Federal agency issues with 6-month to 1-year maturities are down
significantly on balance. The 3-month Treasury bill--presently at
around 6.20 per cent--has shown little net change since the last meeting,
although it did at one point reach an intermeeting high of around 6-1/2
per cent. Rates on large CD's and commercial paper increased on balance
by 25 -- 35 basis points, reflecting the pressure of continued rapid net
issuance of CD's by large banks.
(5) Yields on longer-term securities showed little response
to the further rise of short-term rates early in the intermeeting period
and have generally experienced net declines over the period as a whole.
This relative strength was attributable partly to the rather moderate
volume of new longer-term debt offerings. In addition, following the
early April shift in market expectations, professionals moved to reduce
their short positions. Rates in secondary mortgage markets, on the other
hand, continued to edge higher over the period, and there were field reports
of some upward pressure on new mortgage commitment rates as well.

annual rates of change) selected monetary and financial flows over

Prospective developments
(7) Longer-run targets and associated April-May ranges for
key variables are shown below in summary form for Committee consideration
(with figures for aggregates representing seasonally adjusted annual
rates of change). Of the alternatives shown, alternative B--which is
indexed by a long-run growth rate of 5-1/4 per cent for M 1--represents
essentially a continuation of longer-run monetary targets adopted by
the Committee at its last meeting (stipulated at the time as 5--5-1/2
per cent for M1). Alternative A represents an easing of policy, and
alternative C a tightening.

(8) The staff expects that the alternative B path for the
aggregates would be achieved with little change from recently prevailing
money market conditions. Given such conditions--centering on a Federal
funds rate of 7 per cent--growth in M1 is expected to be somewhat
greater than it has been on balance over the first three months of the
year. In April-May, a growth rate of 4--6 per cent for M1 is indicated.
During that period, income tax refunds are likely to add somewhat to
private demand balances. In addition, continued strong expansion in
economic activity will likely lead to a reassertion of the underlying
growth trend in transactions demands for cash. On the basis of historical
experience, the sharp drop in demand for money relative to GNP growth
that developed in the first quarter seems very unlikely to persist.
(9) With a Federal funds rate around 7 per cent, interest
rates generally are expected to show only minor changes on balance over
the next month. However, the recent stability in rates has been based
in part on expectations that a stiffer controls program is in the offing.
If this comes to seem less likely, upward rate adjustments might well
take place. Apart from attitudinal shifts, however, basic supply-demand
conditions do not suggest significant further upward pressure on rates in
the near-term. The Treasury will be announcing a refunding of $4.3 billion
of publicly-held issues on Wednesday, April 25. But this refunding will be
in a quarter when the Treasury will be repaying about $5 billion of debt on
balance. Some attrition in this refunding and the maturity of $2 billion
of mid-April tax bills could keep Treasury bill rates from rising signifi-
cantly from current levels.
(10) It is not clear, though, that long-term interest rates
have yet fully adjusted to earlier advances in short-term rates.
Mortgage interest rates seem likely to rise further in view of our
projection that savings inflows will continue to moderate, given the
current level of short-term market rates and assuming no rise in Q
ceilings. The development of a dual prime loan rate is likely over time
to push some bank borrowers back into the open market, with consequent
upward pressure on the commercial paper market and, to a lesser extent,
on corporate bond rates. Upward yield pressures in bond markets are
likely to be limited by the basically light calendar of corporate bond
offerings scheduled thus far, although increased Federal agency issues
and possible debt lengthening by the Treasury could be adding to the
supply of longer-maturity debt.
(11) The sensitivity of the current market is such that a
drop in the funds rate to the 6-1/2 per cent lower end of the alternative
B range is likely to be accompanied by a drop in the 3-month Treasury
bill rate to under 6 per cent and an accompanying decline in long-term
rates. On the other hand, a rise in the funds rate to the 7-1/2 per
cent top of the range would exert upward pressure on the whole interest
rate structure, including the discount rate.
(12) Bank credit growth in April-May, though expected to slow
from the exceptional pace of recent months, still is likely to be fairly
substantial by historical standards, reflecting continued strength in
business and consumer demands for bank credit. Given roughly the pre-
vailing structure of short-term market rates, growth in time deposits
other than large CD's probably will be quite moderate--at around a
tinue adding substantially to CD's outstanding, although the rate of
growth should decrease somewhat as businesses shift more of their borrowing
to the open narket.
(13) Under alternative A, the staff would expect a decline
in the Federal funds rate to accompany an effort to encourage more rapid
growth in the aggregates, and vice-versa for alternative C. However,
even-keel may constrain the Committee's willingness to adopt reserve
objectives that lead to changes in money narket conditions of the
dimensions of alternatives A and C. If the Committee were to choose
alternative A or C, but limit the downward or upward movement of the
funds rate to smaller dimensions than indicated, it would, of course,
extend the period needed to achieve the aggregate objectives of either
Proposed directive
(14) Presented below are three alternative formulations
for the operational paragraph of the directive, which might be taken
to correspond to the similarly lettered policy alternatives discussed
in the preceding section. For all three alternatives it is proposed
to add a reference to Treasury financing because of the regular May
refinancing to be announced late this month, and to delete the reference
to international developments because only a moderate reflow into dollars
has developed in recent weeks and exchange markets have been relatively
quiet. Also, for the sake of clarity, it is proposed to describe the
conditions sought as those "consistent with" rather than those "that
will support" the aggregate objectives described. Retention of the
reference to credit market developments is proposed only for alternative
C, the one alternative that contemplates a significant tightening of
the money market.
Alternative A
To implement this policy, while taking account of [DEL: possible
domestic credit market and international developments] FORTHCOMING
TREASURY FINANCING, the Committee seeks to achieve bank reserve
and money market conditions CONSISTANT WITH [DEL: somewhat] FASTER [DEL: slower]
growth in monetary aggregates over the months ahead [DEL: than occurred
on growth in the past 6 months.
Alternative B
To implement this policy, while taking account of
[DEL: possible domestic credit market and international develop-
ments] FORTHCOMING TREASURY FINANCING, the Committee seeks
to achieve bank reserve and money market conditions
CONSISTENT WITH [DEL: that will support somewhat slower] MODERATE
growth in monetary aggregates over the months ahead [DEL: than
occurred on average in the past 6 months].
Alternative C
To implement this policy, while taking account of
FORTHCOMING TREASURY FINANCING AND possible [DEL: domestic] credit
market [DEL: and international] developments, the Committee seeks to
achieve bank reserve and money market conditions CONSISTENT
WITH MODEST [DEL: that will support somewhat slower] growth in
monetary aggregates over the months ahead [DEL: than occurred on
average in the past 6 months].
