The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version available 
based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the Board 
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was created 
through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned 
versions text-searchable.2   Though a stringent quality assurance process was 
employed, some imperfections may remain.

1  In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic 
format.  All scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced 
tilting) and lightly cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other 
blemishes caused after initial printing). 
 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optical character recognition computer program (OCR) 
first created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, 
staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.  Please note that the numbers and text in charts and

MONEY MARKET CONDITIONS
Recent developments
(1) Growth of the monetary aggregates slowed in September
to annual rates of 1.3 per cent for M1 and 2.4 per cent for M2. Taking
into account our current October estimate, which is still largely pro-
jected, money growth rates for the combined September-October period
appear to be well below the ranges of tolerance established at the last
Committee meeting, as the table shows. Expansion in the adjusted bank
credit proxy has also been well below expectations, and RPD growth has
been considerably below the lower limit of its two-month range of

(2) Evidence of sluggish growth in the money and reserve
aggregates emerged immediately following the last Committee meeting. In
responding to this weakness, the Desk moved cautiously at first, in part
to avoid encouraging an unduly rapid decline in market rates. The funds
rate declined from an average of 11 48 per cent in the week of the Committee
meeting (week of Sept. 11) to around 11 per cent in early October. On
October 4, the Committee concurred in the Chairman's view that the Federal
funds rate should be reduced to a range of 10½--10¾ per cent and in his
recommendation that the lower limit of the funds rate constraint should
be reduced by ¼ point to 10¼ per cent. In the week ending October 9,
the funds rate averaged 10.43 per cent. With nonborrowed reserves provided
more aggressively, member bank borrowing in that week (apart from Franklin)
dropped to $1.0 billion as compared with an average of about $1.9 billion
in August and September. Most recently, the Desk has been aiming at a
Federal funds rate tending toward the lower end of a 10¼--10½ per cent
(3) Slow growth in the monetary aggregates and the accumulating
evidence of generally sluggish economic activity created widespread
expectations that the System would ease pressures on credit markets
somewhat further. When declines in the Federal funds rate appeared to
confirm these expectations, other short-term rates dropped sharply--in some
cases by more than 200 basis points. As rates on large CD's and commercial
paper declined, many banks lowered their prime rates to 11¾ per cent, and
most recently a few key banks have dropped the rate to 11½ per cent. The
yield on 3-month Treasury bills fell from a level in excess of 9 per cent
at the time of the last Committee meeting to a low of 6-1/8 per cent.
This change was accentuated by large foreign buying
of bills in September, reinvestment demands from holders of maturing
September tax bills, and an unexpected cut-back by the Treasury in the size
of weekly bill auctions during the period of peak quarterly income tax
receipts. Most recently, however, with the Treasury increasing--rather
than cutting--the size of its weekly bill auctions, and with large additional
Treasury cash borrowing anticipated shortly, the 3-month bill rate has
bounced back and closed Friday at around 7.65 per cent.
(4) Interest rates on long-term Treasury and State and local
government securities have declined somewhat since the last meeting--by
roughly 1/8 to 1/4 of a percentage point. Yields on new and recently
offered corporate issues have risen somewhat further on balance to new
highs, because of a sharp expansion in the prospective volume of new bond
offerings; most recently corporate bond yields have edged off. In the
stock market, price indices continued to decline over most of the inter-
meeting period, reaching their lowest levels in 12 years, but in recent
days a sharp rebound raised the Dow-Jones industrial average by about
accompanying better tone in bond markets may be attributable in part to
the Administration's new economic program as well as to recent signs of
a less restrictive monetary policy.

rates of change) selected monetary and financial flows over various recent
time periods. Appendix table III compares money supply growth rates computed
on a quarterly-average basis with those computed on a last-month-of-quarter
basis. Projected figures on the two bases are shown in appendix table IV

Prospective developments
(6) Attached below for Committee consideration are three
alternative specifications to accompany the directive, with additional
detail presented in the table on the following page. The longer-run
targets encompass the same time period (the seven months August 1974 to
March 1975) as employed for target purposes at the September Committee

(7) Of the three alternatives shown, alternative B includes the
meeting. A further decline in the Federal funds rate over the next few
weeks is indicated for that alternative, at least to the mid-point of the
at the previous meeting for two reasons: (a) M 1 growth since the meeting

has fallen short of expectations, and thus a more active provision of
reserves is required in future to move back to path; and (b) demand for
money is expected to be lower, particularly by the first quarter, in view
of the slower growth now projected by the staff for nominal GNP.
(8) Based on partial data for the early days of the month, M1
growth in October is expected to be quite slow. Growth is,expected to pick up
considerably later in the fall and early winter, partly in consequence of
the lagged impact on money demand of recent and projected interest rate
declines. Over the October-November period, M1 growth is indicated to
be in a 4¾-6¾ per cent annual rate range under alternative B. Given the
small rise in September, the 5¾ per cent growth rate from August to March
implies a 6½ per cent rate from September to March--i.e. over the fourth
and first quarters.
(9) Demand pressures on credit markets are expected to be
intense over the next few weeks. A large amount of new corporate and
municipal bond offerings is scheduled. Federal agency financing needs
remain large. And the Treasury will be raising about $4 billion of new
cash by early November--through additions to bill auctions, other
offerings of short-term instruments, and perhaps also an intermediate-term
it will refund $4.3 billion of maturing publicly held coupon issues.
These borrowing demands will tend to moderate the general declines in
interest rates that would otherwise be prompted by a further drop in the
funds rate to around 9¾ per cent.
(10) The additional declines in interest rates expected under
alternative B may involve a further easing in the 3-month commercial paper
rate to the 9-9½ per cent range, compared with around 9¾ per cent currently,
The 3-month Treasury bill should continue to fluctuate very widely--say,
in a 6-8 per cent range--and may average a bit below 7 per cent, although
very large additions to the supply of bills in the days immediately ahead
would likely exert upward pressure on the rate. As short-term market rates
ease off, some pick-up in net inflows of time deposits other than money
market CD's at banks are to be expected, and the position of thrift institu-
tions may show some improvement. Growth rates of 7½ and 6¼ per cent,
respectively, are expected for M2 and M3 over the fourth and first quarters,
up from the relatively low third quarter growth rates of 4-5 per cent.
(11) Bank credit growth is expected to be moderate, on balance,
over the months ahead. Some rebound is likely in business loans from the
unusually low September pace, particularly with business inventory
accumulation projected to be sizable in the fourth quarter. However, loan
growth is not expected to be as large as in earlier months. The strained
liquidity position of banks is likely to keep them from easing nonprice lending
terms significantly, although the prime loan rate may decline further.
Moreover, improved conditions in the commercial paper market should tend
to divert some corporate borrowing away from the banks.
(12) Alternative C involves a Federal funds rate range centering
on 10 per cent, the average rate prevailing in the last full statement
week, M1 expansion in this alternative is expected to be consistent
with a longer-run target rate of growth of 5 per cent, annual rate (from
Aug. '74 to March '75). Over the fourth and first quarters, the rate of
growth would average about 5¾ per cent.
(13) Given the demand pressures noted earlier and the prevailing
expectations of a further easing of monetary policy, it is likely that
some of the recent decline in short-term market interest rates would be
reversed in the weeks ahead under this alternative. The 3-month bill rate
might be expected to average around 8 per cent, and the commercial paper
rate to move back into a 10-10 per cent range. Corporate bond yields
would probably be under upward pressure, while the recent slight moderation
of mortgage market pressures would be unlikely to persist, both because of
the general market atmosphere and because inflows to thrift institutions
would be expected to show little improvement.
(14) Alternative A contemplates a more rapid growth path for
M1 than under alternative B. To achieve this growth a more pronounced
easing of money market conditions is therefore required, and we believe
that the funds rate would need to drop to 9 per cent shortly after the
Committee meeting. Such a decline would generate substantial expectational
effects, with Treasury bill rates probably dropping by more than a per-
centage point, and longer-term market rates easing off. Inflows of
consumer-type time And savings deposits at banks and thrift institutions
would improve noticeably; the thrift institutions would be in a position
to improve liquidity; and lenders would probably become more willing to
make new mortgage commitments.
Proposed directive language
(15) Presented below are three alternative formulations
for the operational paragraph of the directive, which are intended
to correspond to the similarly lettered policy alternatives discussed
in the preceding section. For all three alternatives, it is proposed
to include a reference to Treasury financing because the regular mid-
November refunding will be announced on October 30.
Alternative A
To implement this policy, while taking account of THE
FORTHCOMING TREASURY FINANCING AND OF developments in domestic
and international financial markets, the Committee seeks to
achieve bank reserve and money market conditions consistent with
SUBSTANTIAL [DEL: moderate] growth in monetary aggregates over the months
Alternative B
To implement this policy, while taking account of THE
FORTHCOMING TREASURY FINANCING AND OF developments in domestic
and international financial markets, the Committee seeks to
achieve bank reserve and money market conditions consistent
with RESUMPTION OF moderate growth in monetary aggregates over
the months ahead.
Alternative C
To implement this policy, while taking account of THE
FORTHCOMING TREASURY FINANCING AND OF developments in domestic
and international financial markets, the Committee seeks to
achieve bank reserve and money market conditions consistent with
[DEL: moderate] MODEST growth in monetary aggregates over the months
