through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned 
versions text-searchable.2   Though a stringent quality assurance process was 
employed, some imperfections may remain.

1  In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic 
format.  All scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced 
tilting) and lightly cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other 
blemishes caused after initial printing). 
 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optical character recognition computer program (OCR) 
first created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, 
staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.  Please note that the numbers and text in charts and

MONEY MARKET AND RESERVE RELATIONSHIPS
Recent developments
(1) Interest rates and monetary aggregates have moved in
diverse, and to some extent unanticipated ways, since the System's
recent policy actions. Treasury bill rates generally rose after the
increasesin the discount rate and in reserve requirements were announced
on April 3, and reached a peak on the mid-April tax date. Subsequently
bill rates have drifted back. The 3-month bill was most recently quoted
while longer-term bills have dropped below those earlier levels. Most
short-term rates outside the bill area have risen, on balance, since
early April.
(2) Expectations of future Treasury debt repayment and
greater market convictions that monetary and fiscal policies will slow
inflation were factors tending to press lower the longer-end of the
yield curve in the Treasury bill market. These same factors, together
with peace hopes, also affected interest rates in bond markets. And
yields on U.S. Government, State and local, and corporate long-term
issues moved 15-25 basis points below their early April levels. Most
recently, this rally in bond markets has faded in face of a continued
sizable volume of corporate and municipal offerings and in anticipation
of the sizable Treasury mid-May refunding.

nominal amounts before the tax date. And for a week at mid-month
the Treasury borrowed an average of $723 million a day directly from
the Federal Reserve, resulting in an enlarged need for System
absorbing operations. Also, in meeting cash payments prior to mid-
month tax receipts, the Treasury made unusually large C-bank calls.
Partly as a result of the Treasury cash management policy, the reserve
position of major money market banks came under severe pressure. The
basic reserve deficits of major banks have fluctuated in a $3.5 - $5.0
billion range, with deficits in New York running $1.5 - $2.0 billion,
substantially deeper than in March. Trading in Federal funds since the
last Committee meeting has frequently been at, or above,7-1/2 per cent
with some activity as high as 8 per cent, particularly in the tax
period. The average rate has been around 7-1/4 per cent thus far in
April. Loan rates to dealers have tended mostly to a 7-1/2 - 8 per
cent range.
(6) Net borrowed reserves for all member banks rose to $995
million and borrowings to an average of $1.1 billion in the most
recent statement week, the first week affected by the higher reserve
requirements. In the preceding three statement weeks net borrowed
reserves were in a $650 - $900 million range, with average borrowings
fluctuating between $750 million and $1.2 billion.

Prospective developments
(8) The sharp average annual rates of expansion in money
supply and the bank credit proxy for April are not likely to be repeated
in May--and some reversal could develop--given prevailing money market
conditions. These conditions can be taken to comprise a Federal funds
rate generally fluctuating in a 7 - 7-3/4 per cent range, member bank
borrowings $900 million to $1.2 billion, and net borrowed reserves
$800 million to $1 billion. The 3-month Treasury bill may fluctuate
in a 5.90 - 6.20 per cent range.
(9) It is possible that bill rates will come under some
further downward pressure in the period ahead. The System is expected
to supply a substantial amount of reserves over the next three weeks.
Moreover, the mid-May refunding could generate additional demand for
bills, with the amount depending on the nature of the exchange and
market attitudes at the time. The refunding will probably be announced
the afternoon of April 30, and at the moment many market participants
are expecting a"rights" exchange involving about $6 billion of publicly
held May and June maturities. These potential demands may press on a
relatively limited current and expected market supply of bills. Dealer
bill positions have recently declined; the Treasury has just paid off
$2 billion of April tax bills as well as $200 million of monthly bills;
and further substantial net debt repayment will develop by the end of
(10) Given these demand-supply conditions in the bill market,
it could require relatively high dealer loan rates and a Federal funds
rate fluctuating around the upper end of the specified range to avert
a decline in the 3-month bill rate to, or below, the lower end of the
range in paragraph (8). Even if the 3-month bill rate is maintained
in that range, longer-term bill rates (on a discount basis) could remain
below the 3-month bill. In particular, the yield on the 1-year bill
might possibly be low enough relative to the Regulation Q ceiling to
enable banks to increase sales of longer-term CD's somewhat.
(11) Actual CD attrition in May is expected to drop to a
$250 - $500 million range. But because May is a month when CD's
seasonally show a $500 - $700 million increase, seasonally adjusted
CD experience would be a significant inhibiting factor on bank credit
growth. Consumer-type time and savings deposits are expected to grow
quite modestly, recovering somewhat from the tax-induced April weakness.
All in all, total time and savings deposits in May are likely to decline
on average in a 0 to 3 per cent annual rate range.
(12) Private demand deposits are expected to rise from the
end of April to the end of May, mainly reflecting an expected $1-1/2
billion decline in U.S. Government deposits over the course of the
month, a sizable portion of which represents attrition of the maturing
mid-May Treasury issue. The average level of the money supply in May,
however, is likely to be slightly below that of the April average level.
(13) The bank credit proxy (including Euro-dollars) may
decline in May in a 2 - 5 per cent, annual rate, range. Loan demands
from business and nonbank financial institutions may moderate some
from their April pace, which was influenced by tax period borrowing.
However, security loans could rise more than last month in view of the
Treasury financing, and particularly if temporary holders participate
in the financing to a sizable extent. Given these loan demands, with
member bank deposits tending to contract on average, banks are likely
to remain inactive in the municipal market, to redeem a sizable
portion of their $2 billion holding of the maturing mid-May Treasury
issues, and to sell the "rights" to the June Treasury maturity. At
the same time, banks are not likely to be very willing lenders on
security loans, and interest rates on these loans will probably be
at a substantial penalty relative to the securities to be financed.
(14) Under the circumstances, it would appear that inter-
mediate and longer-term interest rates are likely to move up over the
next few weeks, unless expectations of a weakening economy, or peace,
were to become more prevalent. Should a sizable market interest
develop in new Treasury issues and new corporate and municipal bonds--
say, for expectational reasons--it is quite possible that a strong
demand pull would be exerted on monetary aggregates. In this event,
bank credit and money supply in May could turn out to be stronger than
projected unless the Federal Reserve--through the workings of a proviso
clause or otherwise--operates to hold back on reserves relative to
demand, thereby tightening conditions in the money market toward or
beyond the tight end of specifications in paragraph (8).

the basis of these assumptions, projections reflect expected movements in bank credit and
money in the period ahead, including the effects of such elements as the public's loan demand,
repayments of previous loans, banks' investment preferences and willingness to supply loans,
banks' desires and abilities to obtain time and savings deposits, and the Government's financing
needs. The projections thus encompass normal seasonal developments, temporary bursts of
loans demand and expected associated repayments not currently reflected by the seasonals, and
whatever cyclical and growth demands for money and credit are expected in the projection period.
Assumed Treasury financing operations include: $-0.2 billion, April 30; $-0.4 billion, May 15.
