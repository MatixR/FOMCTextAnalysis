MONEY MARKET AND RESERVE RELATIONSHIPS
Recent developments
Money market conditions have become somewhat tauter since
the last meeting of the Committee. However, credit market psychology
has been successively buoyed by first the balance of payments program
and then, more importantly, by rumors relating to peace negotiations;
and as a result bill yields have recently declined and prices in bond
markets have risen rather sharply.
Nonborrowed reserves declined in December, on average, after
seasonal adjustment, and as a result member banks have become more
active at the discount window and the Federal funds rate has risen to
around 4-5/8 per cent on average. Borrowings rose to $185 million in
the week ending December 20, and then reached particularly high levels
during the past two statement weeks, when they averaged $420 million.
But such a high level was occasioned by a skewed distribution of and
wide swings in reserve funds that resulted in high excess reserves
during the Christmas holiday week and over the year-end. These swings
were accompanied by wide variations in the Federal funds rate, which
touched 5 per cent on the day before the year end statement date.
Free reserves during the past three statement weeks have
averaged $80 million, fluctuating between $50 and $115 million. During
the first half of December and in earlier months of the fourth quarter
such reserves had averaged over $200 million.
The somewhat increased pressure on the banking system from open
market operations was supplemented by the announcement in late December

of a 1/2 percentage point increase in reserves required against demand
deposits over $5 million. The new requirement was made effective in
the statement weeks beginning January 11 and 18 for reserve city and
country banks respectively.
Reaction in short- and long-term credit markets to the recent
policy moves has been relatively mild. The 3-month bill rate rose
about 1/8 of a percentage point to over 5 per cent following the last
FOMC meeting and in the wake of the announced increase in reserve
requirements. During the past two days, however, rumors of peace
negotiations led to a decline in the yield, which was quoted 4.96 per
cent bid at the close of business Friday. Longer-term bill rates have
dropped below levels at the time of the previous meeting.
As noted earlier, credit markets responded favorably to the
new balance of payments program, interpreting it as reducing the need
for intensification of monetary restraint. Not only did longer-term bills
become somewhat more attractive, relatively, but there was also a rise
in bond prices, followed by another boost in the wake of peace rumors.
Earlier, bond markets had shown virtually no reaction to November-
December monetary policy moves, partly because of the technical
position of the market and of the lull during the holiday season in new
issues coming to market. But also it appears that a shift toward
monetary restraint, at least a mild one, had already been largely
discounted by market participants; and some increased investor interest
in bonds is reappearing at current rate levels.
While the rise in shortest-term bill yields and rates on other
money market paper, such as bankers' acceptances, was relatively modest,
CONFIDENTIAL (FR) -3- January 5, 1968.
these rates were approaching critical levels in relation to the 5-1/2
per cent ceiling rate on large negotiable CD's. In December the run-
off in CD's was around $770 million, or about 13 per cent of the total
maturing during the month. The relatively high level of market interest
rates also made other time and savings deposits of banks less attractive.
As a result, total time and savings deposits of banks increased by an
for the year.
While growth in time deposits slowed, outstanding demand
deposits at banks declined rather sharply. The bulk of the decline was
in U.S. Government deposits, but private demand deposits also dropped
slightly as banks liquidated a considerable amount of U.S. Government
securities in accommodating enlarged business loan demands. The money
supply, which had increased more or less steadily from spring to early
November, showed only a slight increase on average during December as
an accelerated growth in currency offset the decline in private demand
The decline in demand deposits in December was sufficient to
offset the restrained growth in time deposits, and the bank credit proxy
showed no change for the month on average. Moreover, allowance for the
reduction in head office liabilities to foreign branches would make for
a 1 percentage point decline in the proxy.-

Prospective developments
Maintenance of the money market conditions that have evolved
in conjunction with open market policy and the announced reserve require-
ment increase during recent weeks would appear to involve free reserves
in a zero to $100 million range; member bank borrowings generally in
a $150 - $300 million range; the Federal funds rate generally above the
discount rate and most frequently in a 4-5/8--4-3/4 per cent area; and
a 3-month Treasury bill rate in a 4.90 - 5.25 per cent range. Prospects
with respect to the Euro-dollar market are uncertain in view of questions
as to the timing and extent of impact of the U.S. balance of payments
program. But if Euro-dollars become more costly and if the December
attrition in Euro-dollar funds obtained by banks continues, these banks
are likely to become more aggressive in Federal funds and CD markets,
pushing yields up in these areas toward the top of the above ranges.
CONFIDENTIAL (FR) -5- January 5, 1968.
The banks may also become more willing borrowers at the discount window,
which would tend to push borrowings toward the upper end of the range
The above set of money market conditions is likely to be
associated in January with a resumption of growth in total and nonborrowed
reserves, and in bank credit expansion perhaps to a 6-10 per cent, annual
rate, range as measured by the proxy. The principal factor contributing
to so sizable a rebound in bank credit will be the reserves supplied to
support bank underwriting of the $2.5 billion tax bills recently
announced by the Treasury for payment on January 15 through full crediting
to tax and loan accounts. As banks distribute these bills during the
second half of the month, this will contribute to a lower bank credit
expansion as measured from the end of December to the end of January.
A tendency for bill rates to rise under the weight of tax bill dis-
tribution may be moderated somewhat both by current relatively light
dealer positions and by the fact that the System will be using the reserve
requirement increase rather than bill sales to help mop up $550 million of
seasonally redundent reserves in January.
A somewhat wider range than usual for the projection of the proxy
has been given in view of the many uncertainties surrounding bank credit,
generated not only by the state of the Euro-dollar market but also by
the narrowing of the margin between domestic market interest rates and
the ceiling rate on time deposits at banks. If the addition to bill
supply or very large business loan demands should drive the bill rate
to near the upper end of its projected range, it is likely that banks'
CONFIDENTIAL (FR) -6- January 5, 1968.
ability to compete for CD's would be so limited as to result in a further
net decline in outstanding CD's. If, on the other hand, the bill rate
were to stay near the middle of the range, banks probably would be able
at least to replace all of the $5.9 billion of CD's maturing in January
if they so wished.
Total time and savings deposits are expected to rise in only
a 2 - 6 per cent annual rate range during January. Not only are CD's
expected to provide little push to the total, but the net inflow of
other time and savings deposits is likely to be no more than the
reduced December pace, and may slow further.
U.S. Government deposits are expected to rise by about $1.5
billion on average in January, largely because of the cash financing.
Private demand deposits, and the money stock, will probably show little
change on average in the month. There has apparently been a moderation
since early November in the enlarged public demand for money that had
been evident throughout the first 10 months of last year. Money holdings
of consumers and, to a degree, of corporations rose in reflection of
increased liquidity demands following the earlier period of strong
monetary restraint. Recently, with liquidity positions improving, and
given high level of interest rates, demands for precautionary balances
have apparently been reduced.
The projected bank credit expansion could be accompanied by
some withdrawal of banks from the municipal and Agency markets. This
will depend in large part on the strength of business loan demands.
Such demands were very large in December, only partly explainable by a
CONFIDENTIAL (FR) -7- January 5, 1968.
number of special circumstances. Loan growth in January is likely to
be at a slower pace than in the previous month, but may remain fairly
sizable as inventory accumulation and reduced capital market financing
by industrial corporations lead to more activation of bank credit lines
and loan commitments.
While industrial corporations appear to be reducing their use
of capital markets, the calendar of new corporate issues will be fairly
large as a result of scheduled offerings by utilities. State and local
government offerings could build up again to near recent rates, unless
increased financing costs trigger further cancellations. And bond
markets will have to absorb $800 million of FNMA PC's just announced.
The total volume of issues, while sizable, appears to be somewhat more
moderate than in 1967. It could be marketed with relatively little rise
in interest rates, even with reduced bank interest in longer-term
markets, so long as expectations of an even tighter monetary policy
and reduced availabilities of loan funds at banks do not become
Policy alternative. Should the Committee wish to move further
in a restraining direction, it may consider a net reserve position for
banks fluctuating around zero (between, say, plus $50 million and minus
$50 million), a rise in borrowings to consistently in a $250 - $350
million range, and a Federal funds rate averaging around 4-3/4 per cent,
with occasional trades at 5 per cent. Such conditions will probably
raise new dealer loan rates in New York from their recent 4-3/4--4-7/8
CONFIDENTIAL (FR)
per cent range to 5 per cent or better. And as a result, bill rates,
especially short-term rates, are likely to adjust upwards. The cost of
carry to dealers will be increased,and at current bill yields in the
will tend to revive market uncertainties about how far monetary restraint
will go, and may make banks anxious to obtain whatever CD funds they
can while they can. As more and more banks offer 5-1/2 per cent for
the 3-month bill into a 5.20--5.40 per cent range.
The equilibrium relationship that emerges between CD flows,
CD rates, and bill rates is nevertheless likely to include a net decline
in outstanding CD's during January, and a consequent retardation in
bank credit expansion. The portfolio adjustments required of banks
will intensify the upward interest pressures in long-term markets that
may be generated by any psychological effects on lenders and borrowers
of negative free reserves and the more frequent appearance of 5 per cent
Federal funds trading.
Such upward interest rate pressures could be partially offset
by a further movement of funds by individuals and others into marketable
obligations at the expense of time and savings accounts in banks and
other savings institutions. Such shifts would, of course, drain funds,
relatively, from the mortgage market. The net result of all these
movements might be a general modest rise in long-term rates, but perhaps
with the largest increase in mortgage rates (or in tightening of
mortgage terms).
