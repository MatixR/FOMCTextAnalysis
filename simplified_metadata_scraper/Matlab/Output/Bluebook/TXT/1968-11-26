MONEY MARKET AND RESERVE RELATIONSHIPS
Recent developments
(1) The relatively firm conditions prevailing in money and
short-term credit markets around the time of the last Committee meeting
were generally maintained in the ensuing four week period dominated by
"even keel." With money markets firm, international financial markets
in flux, and with a large volume of new demands on the credit markets
from Federal and private sectors, most long- and short-term interest
rates rose further over the period.
(2) The 3-month Treasury bill rate, however, did not show any
sustained upward movement since the last Committee meeting. In fact, as
of the close of business Friday, the 3-month bill was yielding around 5.42
per cent, down a few basis points from its level four weeks earlier.
Over that interval, the bill fluctuated in a fairly narrow range,
generally in the upper half of the 5.25-5.60 per cent range specified
in the previous Blue Book. Longer-term bill rates, however, rose about
rates, such as yields on certificates of deposits and bankers' acceptances.
Offering rates by banks for CD's in the 3-month area generally moved up
to the 6 per cent Regulation Q ceiling rate, and some banks are reported
to be offering the 6-1/4 per cent ceiling for six-month money. The one
leading bank whose prime loan rate was relatively low moved that rate up
to 6-1/4 per cent.
(3) The disparate movement of the 3-month bill rate relative
to other short-term rates reflected in part the development of a shortage

in the trading supply of such bills in the face of heavy demand from
foreign and other sources. Net purchases of bills in the market by
foreign accounts (through the agency of the System) have totalled
around $850 million since the beginning of November, mostly in the short-
term area. The increased spread of longer-term over short-term bill rates
also appeared to reflect general market uncertainties, including a view
that evolving credit conditions were on the tight side as compared with
earlier anticipations. However, the Treasury's recently announced offering
of only $2 billion in June tax bills--at the lower end of the range ex-
pected in the market--helped to moderate pressures affecting longer-term
(4) During the first three weeks since the last meeting of the
Committee the Federal funds rate mostly tended to be around 6 per cent or
above, as compared with a neighborhood of 5-7/8 - 6 per cent in October. In
recent days, however, the funds market has eased sharply, reflecting in the
main reserve gluts around the end of the statement week just past, when
float turned out to be unexpectedly high, when banks accummulated reserves
in excess of need early in the week, and when foreign funds became temporarily
more available in the Federal funds market. Rates on new loans to dealers
were firm at 6-3/8 per cent or above for the bulk of the period since the
previous FOMC mmeting.
(5) In the four statement weeks ending November 20, member bank
excess reserves have averaged $286 million, somewhat higher than in the
previous four weeks, while member bank borrowings have averaged $519
million, also somewhat higher than earlier. Net borrowed reserves during
the past four statement weeks have been in a $150-350 million range.
(6) Current estimates of the bank credit proxy for November show a
may add about 1/2 percentage point to the proxy on average. With one week
still to go in the month, the bank credit estimate is, of course,
subject to change in either direction by a percentage point or two.
In the course of November, week-by-week estimates of the credit proxy
varied throughout the 9-12 per cent average annual rate range projected
for the last Committee meeting, as there were wide fluctuations in
reported weekly deposit figures. It should be noted, however, that
after mid-month the range originally projected had to be adjusted to
tax bill financing was not borne out; in the previous Blue Book the
financing had been assumed for payment on November 27, whereas it has
now been announced for payment on December 2 (in the amount of $2 billion).
(7) Growth in bank credit in November was accompanied by only
about a 1 per cent annual rate of expansion in nonborrowed reserves on
current estimates. With the cost of reserve funds in the Federal funds
and Euro-dollar markets generally higher than in the previous month,
banks--to sustain credit expansion--increased their borrowings from the
Federal Reserve more than seasonally, and they also appear to have
economized further on excess reserves after adjusting for past seasonal
patterns. (The increase in excess reserves noted in paragraph (5) would
represent a less than seasonal rise.)
(8) The reception of the Treasury's November refunding
operation turned out to generate somewhat more total attrition than
assumed by the staff; about 25 per cent of the November maturities and
interest in the re-opened 5-3/4 per cent 6-year note was greater than
many in the market had anticipated, with public subscriptions reaching
$1.3 billion. Dealers took around $250 million, net, of this issue into
position, and sold out about one-third by payment date. Their total
position in securities maturing in more than 5 years was around $630
million on Thursday, November 21, or about $100 million higher than such
positions on October 29, just before books were closed on the mid-November
refunding. Dealers appear to have rather mixed attitudes toward these
positions; on balance they are not pressing them actively onto the market
at this time.
(9) Time deposit growth in November is estimated at a 12 per
cent annual rate, in line with earlier projections. However, growth in
the money supply, estimated at a 10 per cent annual rate, is slightly in
excess of earlier projections, mainly because of an unanticipated bulge in
currency in circulation.

Prospective Developments.
(11) Prevailing money market conditions might be taken to
encompass a Federal funds rate fluctuating in the neighborhood of
million range, and net borrowed reserves fluctuating widely, probably
in a $100-$400 million area. These specifications assume banks may be
somewhat more willing to borrow at a given Federal funds rate than
they were in most of November, as they move into the December period
of traditional seasonal pressures. Maintenance of the above money
market conditions between now and the next meeting of the Committee on
December 17 may be associated with some moderate further upward
pressures on short-term interest rates, and with a slower growth in
bank credit (as measured by the proxy on a daily average basis for
the month.)
(12) Under these money market conditions, it would appear
that the 3-month Treasury bill rate may be expected to be in a 5.30-
rate could be pushed to or even somewhat beyond either end of this
range depending on the way in which international exchange market
uncertainties are resolved (unknown by Friday 6:30 p.m.). Effects
will stem both from shifts in market attitudes and also from the
extent and timing of foreign purchases or sales of Treasury bills,
as well as use of swap facilities.
(13) Apart fron international influences, there will be seasonal
upward pressures on the bill rate that might be accentuated by enlarged
corporate tax payments around mid-December. It is also possible that
the Treasury may have to maintain a relatively low cash balance at the
Federal Reserve until mid-December tax payments begin coming in, with
the result that commensurately less Federal Reserve open market purchases
would be made. On the other hand, these interest rate pressures may be
offset to some extent because the market is likely soon to begin focusing
on the probability that the Treasury will be able to repay some debt in
the first half of next year.
(14) In projecting a slowing of bank credit growth in December--
to a 5-8 per cent, annual rate, ranges/--the staff has assumed that CD
attrition will be around $800 million, or no more than seasonal proportions.
This projection assumes that the 3-month bill rate begins to decline in
higher (or lower) for the average December level herein projected
to be achieved. Euro-dollar borrowings would add 1/2 percentage
point to the projection, assuming little change in such borrowings
from their current level.
the latter part of December from a seasonal peak. It presumes that
maintenance of a Federal funds rate consistently in a 5-7/8--6 per
cent area will encourage the market in the view that any upward move-
ment of bill rates that may develop is likely to be temporary and that,
therefore, banks will be able to count on a relatively normal recovery
from mid-December CD attrition. If the 3-month bill rate were to
reach or exceed the upper end of the range cited, it might become
extremely difficult for banks, except for a few prime banks, to avoid
more than seasonal attrition of outstanding CD's. There is somewhat
more scope under the Regulation Q ceilings for banks to issue longer-
term CD's, but the availability of such funds will probably be limited,
particularly for seasonal reasons, next month.
(15) As of the end of October, CD's maturing in December
totalled $5.4 billion, of which about $1 billion matured on the tax
date. It is difficult to tell how much banks will have added to these
liabilities by the end of November, although a comparison of market
rates with Q ceiling rates would suggest that they would have sold
relatively little more of December maturities. Assuming no substantial
build-up in December CD maturities over the last few weeks, the attri-
tion rate of around 15 per cent which we have assumed is not likely
to require banks to undertake significant liquidity adjustments that
would immediately alter lending attitudes, although banks are likely
to add to portfolio investments at a reduced pace.
(16) Growth in time and savings deposits other than negotiable
CD's is likely to slow down further in December, given the higher level
of market interest rates that has emerged and an anticipated moderation
in the growth of personal income. Taking into account both CD's and
other time and savings deposits, the total of banks' time deposits may
be expected to rise in an 8-11 per cent, annual rate, range in December.
Money supply growth next month may be in a 6-9 per cent, annual rate,
range, reflecting for the most part a relatively sharp drop in U.S.
Government deposits during the month, given the small size of the new
tax bill financing and the substantial cash redemptions of the mid-
December Treasury bond maturities that were not exchanged in November.
(17) Over the near-term, some further upward pressure on
long-term interest rates remains possible. It would appear that banks
would have to be considerably less active purchasers of securities,
particularly of State and local Government obligations. And, while
dealers have made progress in distributing the most recent longer-term
Treasury note, their total positions in the over 5 year area (including
the fairly sizable unsold balances from the August refunding) remain
fairly large. In addition, a relatively large calendar of corporate bond
issues may be developing for January, although this may have been dis-
counted by the recent sharp rise of long-term interest rates.
(18) Policy alternative. If the Committee wishes to intensify
the degree of monetary restraint at this time, it may wish to consider a
constellation of money market conditions including a Federal funds rate
fluctuating around 6-1/8 per cent, member bank borrowings in a $550-
$700 million range, and net borrowed reserves of $300-$500 million. In
view of the relatively firm money and short-term credit market conditions
of recent weeks, and given anticipations of seasonal tightness by market
participants, these money market variables would probably have to be rather
consistently toward the tight ends of the indicated ranges for the
market to become aware of a shift in policy over the next three weeks.
(19) As the market absorbs the impact of a consistently
tighter funds market and higher level of borrowings, there may be
greater upward effects on longer-term bill rates and on bond yields
than on the 3-month bill. The relatively small dealer holdings of
short bills may tend to limit the rise in the 3-month bill rate. Longer-
term bill rates are likely to be affected by banks' efforts to nail down
whatever CD funds prove available in the maturity area beyond three
months. Even so, banks could become uncertain about their ability to
recoup December CD attrition, and would likely cut back participation
in the municipal and U.S. Government securities markets fairly sharply.
They are also likely to increase demands on the Euro-dollar market.
Assuming existing ceiling rates, CD attrition in December might be in
the order of $1--$1-1/4 billion--depending in part on the speed of
adjustment of bill and other short-term market rates to the change in
policy stance--and bank credit growth might slow to a 3-6 per cent
annual rate.

MONEY MARKET AND RESERVE RELATIONSHIPS
Recent developments
(1) The relatively firm conditions prevailing in money and
short-term credit markets around the time of the last Committee meeting
were generally maintained in the ensuing four week period dominated by
"even keel". With money markets firm, international financial markets
in flux, and with a large volume of new demands on the credit markets
from Federal and private sectors, most long- and short-term interest
rates rose further over the period.
(2) The 3-month Treasury bill rate, however, did not show any
sustained upward movement since the last Committee meeting. In fact, as
of the close of business Friday, the 3-month bill was yielding around 5.42
per cent, down a few basis points from its level four weeks earlier.
Over that interval, the bill fluctuated in a fairly narrow range,
generally in the upper half of the 5.25-5.60 per cent range specified
in the previous Blue Book. Longer-term bill rates, however, rose about
rates, such as yields on certificates of deposits and bankers' acceptances.
Offering rates by banks for CD's in the 3-month area generally moved up
to the 6 per cent Regulation Q ceiling rate, and some banks are reported
to be offering the 6-1/4 per cent ceiling for six-month money. The one
leading bank whose prime loan rate was relatively low moved that rate up
to 6-1/4 per cent.
