preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned 
versions text-searchable.2   Though a stringent quality assurance process was 
employed, some imperfections may remain.

format.  All scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced 
tilting) and lightly cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other 
blemishes caused after initial printing). 
 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optical character recognition computer program (OCR) 
first created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, 
staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.  Please note that the numbers and text in charts and

MONEY MARKET AND RESERVE RELATIONSHIPS
Recent developments
(1) Shortly after the last Committee meeting, market
expectations turned sharply in favor of a general decline in interest
rates. As a consequence, professional and retail demands for securities
pushed long-term rates markedly lower. Yields on long-term U.S. Government
bonds declined by as much as 50 basis points over a two week period, while
corporate and State and local yields dropped around 26 basis points. In
recent days, however, the bond market rally has faded, and yields have
backed up somewhat. Private short-term market rates have moved lower,
by as much as three-eights of a percentage point, since the last meeting
of the Committee. In the case of commercial paper, this decline occurred
despite a marked increase in the issuance of bank-related commercial paper.
(2) Despite two Treasury tax-anticipation bill auctions
totaling $5 billion--one on October 8 and one on October 23--Treasury
bill rates generally showed little change on balance over the last three
weeks. The market was in a fairly strong technical position as a result
of earlier foreign official bill purchases, and was readily able to absorb
the new Treasury offerings. The foreign purchases were subsequently
reversed in part, as some speculators in German marks cashed in their
gains, but the bill market was partly sheltered from the impact as the

System purchased a substantial volume of these bills, and also made
some market purchases, for reserve supplying purposes. The 3-month
bill was most recently bid at around 7 per cent, near the lower end
of the range specified in the last blue book and about the same as its
level at the time of the last meeting.
(3) In the previous blue book, total member bank deposits
in October were projected to decline in a 5 - 8 per cent annual rate
range. At present, on the basis of two weeks of preliminary and one
week of partial data for the month, we estimate the decline to be in the
slightly deeper range of 7 - 9 per cent. Euro-dollars and other non-
deposit sources of funds appear to be offsetting about 1-1/2 percentage
points of the decline in member bank deposits. A week ago, staff
estimates of the proxy had suggested an even weaker performance for
October. As a result the proviso clause of the directive was marginally
in effect in the statement week ending October 22.
(4) The performance of deposit components thus far this
month, and also currency, has differed from earlier expectations, though
most of the deposit variation has been mutually offsetting. U. S.
Government deposits are declining considerably more than previously
expected, but private demand deposits are stronger by about an equivalent
amount and now appear likely to rise somewhat on average during the
month, in contrast to a slight decline projected earlier. Reflecting
the somewhat stronger private demand deposit performance, as well as
greater growth of currency the money supply for October is now
estimated to increase in a 1 - 4 per cent annual rate range. Total
title and savings deposits have been running slightly weaker than anticipated,
with the October average rate of decline now estimated in a 2 - 5 per
cent annual rate range. All of the weakness relative to projections
was in time deposits other than large CD's.
(5) Net borrowed reserves at member banks during the past
three statement weeks have fluctuated in a fairly wide $875 million to
$1.2 billion range, and average borrowings in the $950 million to
$1.4 billion range. The Federal funds rate also showed considerable
fluctuation with the weekly average effective rate varying between 8-3/4
and 9-5/8 per cent. Money market conditions were influenced not only
by the marginal implementation of the proviso clause, but also by the
wide variations in the day-to-day needs for funds among major banks--
arising in part, of course, from the Treasury's financing operations.
For example, the basic reserve deficit of the major banks in New York
(borrowings from the Federal Reserve and net Federal funds purchases
less excess reserves) fluctuated between $650 million and $1.8 billion,
while the deficit of the 38 major banks outside New York varied from
about $2.7 billion to about $4 billion.

Prospective developments
(7) For the second paragraph of the current economic policy
directive, the Committee might wish to consider language along the following
lines (alternative A):
'To implement this policy, System open market operations until
the next meeting of the Committee shall be conducted with a view to main-
taining the prevailing firm conditions in money and short-term credit
markets; provided, however, that operations shall be modified if bank
credit appears to be deviating significantly from current projections.
This language is the same as that of the directive issued on October
(8) Prevailing firm conditions in the money and short-term
credit markets might be taken to encompass ranges for the Federal funds
rate of about 8-1/2--9-1/2 per cent, for member bank borrowings of
$1--1-1/2 billion, and for net borrowed reserves of $900 million
to $1.2 billion--in each case, the approximate ranges prevailing since
the last meeting of the Committee. It should be noted that money market
conditions in the last statement week were toward the easier end of the
ranges, with the proviso marginally in effect.
(9) Given the conditions specified in paragraph (8), the
range. Market distribution of the most recent bill financing and
probable further foreign bill sales will be putting upward pressure
on the bill rate, but System reserve supplying operations--estimated
at around $800 million over the next four weeks--and the current strong
technical condition of the short bill market will work toward offsetting
these upward rate pressures.
(10) The recent $3 billion tax bill financing will be paid for
on October 29, thus giving a sizable boost to the average level of
U.S. Government deposits in November and to total member bank deposits.
The latter are expected to grow on average at an annual rate in a 5 - 8
per cent range in November, supported by a 4 - 7 per cent annual rate
of growth in nonborrowed and total reserves. Combining the member
bank deposit growth expected in November with the 7 - 9 per cent rate
of decline now estimated for October would result in little net change
on average for member bank deposits over the two month period. Out-
standing total member bank deposits also are expected to show little
net change on average in December, as the anticipated November bulge of
Government deposits fades.
(11) Continued sizable inventory accumulation by business,
in conjunction with diminishing profits and reduced liquid asset
positions, may lead to takedowns of loan commitments at banks sufficient
to keep outstanding business loans growing in November at a somewhat
faster pace than in the third quarter. Given the pick-up of business
loan demands, and with individual banksviewing the increase in U.S.
Government deposits as temporary, outstanding funds obtained from
non-deposit sources may increase over the next month; any such increase
would be accounted for mainly by further growth of commercial paper
issued by bank affiliates. The expected increase of all nondeposit
sources, including Euro-dollars, would be the equivalent of adding about
Thus, the bank credit proxy adjusted to include Euro-dollars and other
non-deposit sources is projected to rise on average in November in 6 - 10
per cent annual rate range.
(12) Time and savings deposits at banks are likely to decline
in a 4 - 7 per cent annual rate range in November, largely because of
continued weakness in the trend of consumer-type time deposits and in
large CD's issued to domestic business and individuals. Since mid-
September time deposits of foreign official accounts at U.S. banks
have risen about $675 million. Most of this represents a one-time
switching of BIS funds to U.S. banks. Head offices of U.S. banks can
now offer slightly higher yields on foreign official time deposits than
their branches offer on Euro-dollars, reflecting the somewhat lower
reserve requirement on head office time deposits as compared with marginal
deposits (above the base) obtained through foreign branches. As a result,
there may be some continued increase in foreign official time deposits
at head offices.
(13) The money supply is expected to show little net change,
on average, in November, Part of the October rise in the average may
have reflected greatly enlarged activity in financial markets, particularly
stock markets, during the last two weeks. The November projection
assumes a more normal level of activity.
(14) As noted in paragraph (1), sharp declines in bond yields
during the past few weeks strongly reflected market expectations. With
constraints on supplies of funds at most major types of financial
institutions expected to persist, it seems likely that interest rates
there is
will move upward again unless /strong additional evidence as to a weakening
of the economy, peace in Viet-Nam, or a shift in monetary policy.
Indeed, in the last few days, long-term rates have risen, particularly
in the minicipal bond market.
Policy alternative
(15) If the Committee should decide to move toward somewhat
less firm money market conditions, it might wish to consider directive
language along the following lines (alternative B):
"To implement this policy, System open market operations
until the next meeting of the Committee shall be conducted with a view
to achieving slightly less firm conditions in money and short-term credit
markets; provided, however, that operations shall be modified if bank
credit appears to be deviating significantly from current projections.
(16) The slightly less firm money market conditions to
be sought might involve a Federal funds rate averaging around 8-1/4 to
less, and net borrowed reserves fluctuating around $800 million. Such
a move, as it becomes evident to the market, could tend to moderate or
even reverse the developing tendency of recent days for some interest
rates to rise. The 3-month bill rate would probably move down in a 6-1/2 --
conditions on monetary aggregates would likely be minor over the near-
term, unless resulting market exuberance should carry interest rates
sharply down, and the bill rate were permitted to fall well below
the range specified. Assuming the bill rate remains within the range,
however, we would not expect the November aggregatesto be more than a
percentage point or two stronger than projected under alternative A of
the directive.
(17) Even a slight easing of money market conditions would
probably lead over time to expectations of further easing and encourage
banks to add more to loans and investments than otherwise, financing
them at very short-term in the Federal funds, Euro-dollar, and commercial
paper markets. In these circumstances, as the Federal Reserve provided
the reserves to keep the Federal funds rate down, demand deposits would
also tend to become somewhat stronger than otherwise. Thus, relative
to the alternative A projections, bank credit and deposit expansion,
might show a more noticeable strengthening in December than in November.
