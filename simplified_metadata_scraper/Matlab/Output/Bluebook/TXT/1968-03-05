MONEY MARKET AND RESERVE RELATIONSHIPS
Recent developments
The bank credit proxy rose on average in February at a 10 per
cent annual rate, at the upper end of the range projected in the pre-
vious blue book. Most of the strengthening became evident in the
latter part of the month, as banks experienced a sharp expansion in
security loans and also held on to a relatively large proportion of the
new 15-month note issued for cash by the Treasury (payable through full
crediting to tax and loan accounts).
In view of the rise in bank credit, open market operations
became more restraining to the extent permitted by the progress of the
Treasury financing, and banks were induced to increase borrowings from
the Federal Reserve to obtain reserves required by deposit expansion.
As a result, the net reserve position of member banks moved from average
free reserves of $120 million in the first two statement weeks in
February to average net borrowed reserves of $93 million in the last
two statement weeks. Between those periods, average borrowings in-
creased from $312 million to $424 million.
With the reserve position of banks under increasing pressure,
Federal funds traded around 4¾ per cent, and not infrequently at 4-7/8
per cent. Rates on such short-term instruments as Treasury bills,
bankers' acceptances, and Agency issues generally have moved slightly
higher than they were before the last Committee meeting, with the
March 1, 1968.

short-term
These / yield increases were relatively small partly
because business loan demands were not especially strong, so that banks
were under little pressure to compete actively in the short-term market
through issuance of negotiable CD's. In addition, major reporting
banks continued to run only a relatively small basic reserve deficit--
one considerably less deep than a year ago--as they remained cautious
in managing their money positions and as Euro-dollar funds continued
generally available at relatively favorable rates. Moreover, with the
wider spread of the Federal funds rate over the discount rate in
February as compared with January, some banks preferred to use the
discount window to help finance their basic reserve deficits. In
consequence, dealer new loan rates in New York have thus far changed
little from the 5 -- 5-1/8 per cent range reached in early February;
and, with financing outside New York fairly readily available, there
has not been much additional pressure from financing costs on dealers'
still-large inventories of bills, not to mention their moderate-sized
holdings of notes and bonds.
Dealers did not acquire an exceptionally large position in
either the 5¾ per cent 7-year note issued in the mid-February re-
financing or the 5-5/8 per cent 15-month note issued in the February 21 cash
financing. In the case of the longer note, this was partly because
the volume acquired in exchange was on the conservative side; in the
March 1, 1968.
CONFIDENTIAL (FR)
case of the shorter note, it was partly because banks have been quite
willing to hold on to their acquisitions as an investment. Since the
new issues have held up very well in price, dealers have been under
little compulsion to effect sharp reductions in their holdings. Their
positions in securities maturing in more than one year were $407 million
on February 29, down only about $100 million from peak holdings during
the month.
With short-term interest rates rising only moderately, bank
time deposits rose, on average, in February at a 9 per cent annual
rate--at the upper end of the range of expectations--following a small
decline in January on average. Most of the rise was in consumer-type
deposits. As noted above, major banks showed little inclination to
solicit funds aggressively through CD's. Toward the end of the period,
however, an uptick of bank interest appeared, perhaps representing the
beginning of preparation for the March and April tax periods.
Money supply growth in February was relatively small, at an
annual rate of about 2½ per cent. This represented a substantial
reduction from the January rate of growth, consistent with staff
expectations. Growth in private demand deposits in February was
somewhat above anticipations, however, partly offsetting a smaller
than projected rise in U.S. Government deposits.
Over the period since the shift in policy late last fall, key
monetary variables have shown annual rates of increase as shown below,
in comparison with increases over the preceding seven months of relatively
stable money market conditions.

Prospective developments
Relationships among money market and monetary variables with
no policy shift. Given prevailing money market conditions, the bank
credit proxy is likely to show a smaller annual rate of increase in
March than in February--perhaps in a 5 to 7 per cent range, and the
figure would be this large only because of the carry-over effect in
the monthly average comparison of the sharp late February credit
expansion associated with the $4 billion Treasury cash financing. From
the end of February to the end of March, the proxy is likely to show
little growth.
Prevailing money market conditions might be taken to include
a net borrowed reserve position for banks in a zero to $150 million
range, member bank borrowings generally in a $350 - $450 million range,

range. The rate could be near the lower end of the range because of
seasonal downward pressures stemming in part from anticipation of re-
investment demand from maturing March and April tax bills. An offset
to such seasonal forces could develop if rising Federal expenditures
lead the market to anticipate sizable Federal Government new cash needs
during the months immediately ahead, or if the persistence of net
borrowed reserve figures alters market attitudes further. Some
upward pressure could also develop out of the cumulative impact of the
current $100 million additions to the weekly bill auctions.
The slower rate of growth anticipated for the bank credit
proxy in March reflects mainly the absence of sizable Treasury cash
financings, such as there were in January and February. And an even
more moderate growth rate is in prospect for April unless the Treasury
accelerates its financing schedule or unless business loan demand
strengthens considerably further. Banks have responded to the gradual
tightening of policy since late fall mainly through reducing the rate
of acquisitions of state and local government issues, and, at times,
by selling Treasury bills rather than bidding aggressively for CD
In part, bank reluctance to compete for high-cost funds
reflects the still relatively moderate pace of business loan demand.
Growth in outstanding business loans at banks thus far in 1968 appears
to have been somewhat faster than in late summer and early fall of

of a build-up in loan commitments, and continued inventory expansion,
suggest that such loans could grow at a faster pace in coming months.
However, corporate income tax payments in March and April, though
sizable, are not expected to be quite as large as in the spring of
last year.
Unless business loan demands strengthen considerably further,
or unless expectations of an even tighter monetary policy became more
widespread, it is not expected that banks will be highly aggressive in
the CD market--though probably evincing more interest than in recent
weeks in view of the large maturities in prospect with the approach
of the March and April tax periods. A maximum likelihood estimate
of the change in outstanding CD's in March would be for a small
decline of $200 - $300 million, or about in line with seasonal
With such CD developments, and consumer-type time deposits
growing at near their February rate, the total of time and savings
deposits in March is expected to rise in a 9 - 11 per cent range.
Private demand deposits are expected to rise further in March, largely
reflecting a decline during the month in U.S. Government deposits.
The money supply may increase in a range of 4 - 6 per cent, annual
rate. With a somewhat slower rate of growth projected for bank credit
and total bank deposits, and with the bulk of deposit expansion in the
form of time deposits, total member bank reserves in March are likely
to rise in a range of 2 - 5 per cent, annual rate, well below the
February pace.
CONFIDENTIAL (FR)
Long-term rates may change little from current levels in
the weeks immediately ahead, though some updrift is possible. Municipal
yields have already adjusted substantially upwards in light of the
reduced bank interest and the large calendar of new issues, and could
come under further upward pressure from a surge of industrial revenue
bond issues; however, any further rise in municipal yields could be
moderated by postponements of prospective new issues. Market
participants have not yet begun to focus on the possible magnitude
of remaining Treasury cash needs, which may be financed in part through
PC issues. In the corporate market, the calendar appears relatively
light. Interest rates would be most likely to rise if the market
sensed a renewed upsurge in defense spending--and one not likely to
be offset by a tax increase--a further tightening in monetary policy,
and re-appearance of anticipatory borrowings at banks and in the
security market.
Further restraint through open market operations. If the
Committee wishes to add further to pressure on bank reserve positions
and the money market, it may want to consider conditions including
net borrowed reserves in a $100 - $250 million range and member bank
borrowings generally in a $450 - $550 million range. Federal funds would
be likely to trade most frequently around 5 per cent, although bank
preferences for meeting reserve needs through the discount window could
tend to moderate upward pressures on the funds rate. Along with an
associated rise in dealer new loan rates to around 5¼ - 5 per cent,
March 1, 1968.
CONFIDENTIAL (FR)
the 3-month bill rate may move into a 5-1/8 -- 5-3/8 per cent range--
moving more toward the upper end if expectations of a discount rate
increase became more prevalent.
Such a tightening of money market conditions may have
relatively little effect on bank credit and deposit expansion in March,
although the additional restraint would force banks to rely more on
borrowed reserves in meeting their reserve requirements. It is
possible that the most immediate effect of the tightening would be a
sharp burst of bank interest in expanding outstanding CD's to secure
funds in advance of large maturities in the weeks ahead. But in so
doing, banks would place further upward pressures on market interest
rates, and their capacity to continue acquiring new CD funds, except
in the very shortest maturities, would quickly become severely
Apart from any temporary spurt, bank credit growth is likely
to moderate further in the wake of the tighter policy posture, as
higher market interest rates lead to a further slowdown in time deposit
growth following the spring quarterly interest-crediting period--as
would also be true for deposit accounts in thrift institutions. With
the cumulative effect of the further tightening action coinciding with
an expected lull in major Treasury cash financing demands, bank credit
and deposit expansion in April would probably be quite small. And as
banks become even less willing buyers of U.S. Government and municipal
securities, and perhaps reappraise their over-all lending policies,
upward pressures on long-term interest rates would become more marked.
