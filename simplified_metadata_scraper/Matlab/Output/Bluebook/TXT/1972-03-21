Prefatory Note 
 
 
The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version available 
based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the Board 
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was created 
through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned 
versions text-searchable.2   Though a stringent quality assurance process was 
employed, some imperfections may remain.

1  In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic 
format.  All scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced 
tilting) and lightly cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other 
blemishes caused after initial printing). 
 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optical character recognition computer program (OCR) 
first created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, 
staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.  Please note that the numbers and text in charts and 
tables were not reliably recognized by the OCR process and were not checked or corrected by staff.

MONEY MARKET CONDITIONS
Recent developments
(1) Growth in seasonally adjusted total reserves available to
support private nonbank deposits appears to be expanding at about an 11 per
cent annual rate for February and March combined. (See attached Table 1).
This would be slightly above the upper end of the 6--10 per cent range targeted
by the Committee, and at the upper end if adjustment is made for the small
downward revision in the January level. For February alone, the growth rate
was only 3.7 per cent. In March, however, the growth pace of such reserves
has accelerated; actual reserve data through mid-month, and required reserve
figures for the last half of the month (given the lagged reserve accounting),
now suggest March growth at around an 18 per cent annual rate.
(2) It appears that the money and credit aggregates are growing
at rates slightly in excess of the first quarter pace desired by the Committee.
In February, M1, M2, and the adjusted credit proxy grew at annual rates of
thus far available for March suggest continued high growth rates for M 1 and
M2, though not so high as in February, and an upsurge in the credit proxy.
For the first quarter as a whole, our current estimate (with half of March
projected) is for growth in M1 at a 9-1/2 per cent annual rate, which compares
with a 7--8 per cent rate desired by the Committee.
(3) When it became apparent that growth of reserves was close to
the upper end of the desired February-March range and growth of the aggregates
seemed to be running a bit above the desired first-quarter ranges, the Desk
began to hold back on reserve provision and allowed money market conditions
to firm. As a result, the Federal funds rate rose to an average of 3-7/8 per
cent in the latest statement week and most recently has continued to trade
around that level. This compares with a weekly low of 3.18 per cent, reached
about mid-way in the intermeeting period.
(4) Even before the firming of money market conditions, Treasury bill
rates had begun to rise from their mid-February lows, as a marked earlier dearth
in the market supply of immediately available bills began to be remedied.
Increased bill supplies came chiefly from the Treasury's $3 billion offering
of strip bills early in March and the continuing $300 million weekly increments
to its regular bill auctions. Other bills came into the market during the
latter part of February when a Treasury decision to drop its balance at the
Federal Reserve by $2.3 billion elicited sizable System bill sales to help
absorb the resulting release of reserves. In part, however, the marked rise
in bill rates has reflected the sharp recent advance in Federal funds and
dealer loan rates. Very recently, 3-month Treasury bills have traded at about
of the last Committee meeting.
(5) Rates on other short-term market instruments have also moved
up recently, by 25--75 basis points. A bank with a flexibile prime rate policy
that had been quoting a rate of 4-3/8 per cent has raised its rate in two
stages to 4-3/4 per cent. Yields in markets for longer-term securities have
changed little on balance since the last Committee meeting, but most recently
there has been some small rise in response to increases in money market rates.

Prospective developments
(7) Three alternative patterns of prospective relationships among
monetary aggregates and money market conditions are summarized below. Monthly
and quarterly patterns for key monetary aggregates through the second quarter
are shown in the table on the next page.

(8) The rates of expansion in reserves available to support non-
bank deposits that are consistent with the three patterns in the paragraph

As indicated in paragraph (7), under patterns II and III member bank
borrowings would be expected to rise from current levels as the Federal
funds rate rises relative to the discount rate. Expansion in nonborrow-
ed reserves supporting nonbank private deposits would be slower than for
the total of such reserves in patterns II and III. The average annual
rate of expansion for such nonborrowed reserves in March-April would be
expected to be around 12 per cent for pattern I, 8 per cent for II, and
(9) With transactions demands for cash expanding in reflec-
tion of the 10 per cent annual rate of rise projected for nominal GNP
in the second quarter, M1 growth would be expected to decline only
slightly from the substantial first quarter rate of growth of about 9-1/2
per cent if prevailing money market conditions are maintained. If the
Committee should seek to reduce growth in M1 significantly below the
estimated first quarter rate, money market conditions would be expected
to tighten. For example, if the Desk were to provide reserves at a rate
consistent with M growth rates in the pattern II area (around 6-1/2 per
cent for April and 7-1/2 per cent for the second quarter), the staff
would expect the Federal funds rate to rise to near the upper end of the
increase to around the upper end of their $50-$200 million range. Likewise,
in attaining pattern III aggregates, the staff would expect money market
conditions to move to the tight end of the ranges shown for that alterna-
(10) With the 3-month Treasury bill rate around 3-7/8 per
cent, the market has probably largely adjusted to a Federal funds rate
in a 3-3/4--4 per cent range and may have discounted some of the pros-
pective Treasury cash borrowing. It is not yet certain whether the
Treasury will borrow additional cash in early April, or how much might
be borrowed if they come to market, or in what maturity area. For
projection purposes, we have assumed only $2 billion of borrowing in
the short- or short-intermediate-term area. If the Treasury does not
undertake some such market borrowing, it probably would have to borrow
directly from the System for a few days around mid-April. With such a
moderate amount of borrowing the 3-month bill rate might remain around
rise in the Federal funds rate, however, toward 4-1/2 per cent would
involve a further, perhaps commensurate, rise in the bill rate. And
as the funds rate penetrated the 4-1/2 per cent discount rate, the bill
rate might begin to rise more rapidly in anticipation of a discount
rate hike.
(11) The still wide spread of long- over short- rates
will tend to minimize effects on long markets of rising short-term
rates. We would expect, though, that a further rise in the bill rate of
ward rate pressures in bond markets. Corporate and municipal bond
volume is still fairly sizable, though well below last year, and only a
modest further decline in volume is anticipated into the summer. Upward
rate pressures may be largest in the municipal market as bank demand
weakens in the face of rising costs of CD funds and banker attitudes
toward liquidity become more cautious.
(12) Growth in time deposits other than large CD's is
likely to slow in the months ahead from the very rapid January-February
pace, and particularly if short-term market rates rise. As a result,
growth in M2 in the second quarter is likely to be noticeably slower
than in the first under all three patterns.
(13) The adjusted bank credit proxy, too, is expected to
grow less rapidly in the second quarter than the first, mainly in
reflection of the considerably slower growth in consumer-type time
deposits. Expansion in outstanding large CD's is expected to be
little changed from recent months under pattern I, but some pick-up
is anticipated under tighter money market conditions as banks attempt
to compensate in some degree for slower growth in other deposits.

Proposed directive
(14) On the assumption that the Committee will want to continue
to use the general procedure agreed upon at the February 15 meeting, the
following language for the second paragraph of the directive, which is
similar to that adopted then, is suggested:
"To implement this policy, while taking account of
international developments, the Committee seeks to achieve
bank reserve and money market conditions that will support
(I - AMPLE )
(II - moderate ) growth in monetary aggregates over the
(III - MORE moderate)
months ahead."
If the Committee so wishes, each of three alternative adjectives qualifying
"growth in monetary aggregates over the months ahead" can be taken to
correspond with the similarly numbered pattern of aggregate growth rates
described in the preceding section. For expository purposes these patterns
have been expressed as single point values, but as at the February meeting,
the Committee may, of course, wish to specify its objectives in terms of
