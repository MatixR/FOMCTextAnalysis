of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was created 
through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned 
versions text-searchable.2   Though a stringent quality assurance process was 
employed, some imperfections may remain.

1  In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic 
format.  All scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced 
tilting) and lightly cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other 
blemishes caused after initial printing). 
 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optical character recognition computer program (OCR) 
first created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, 
staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.  Please note that the numbers and text in charts and

Recent Developments
(1) M1 increased at a 15,7 per cent annual rate during April,
as both currency and demand deposits rose sharply. Even though M1
expansion appears to be moderating in May, growth for April and May
combined is projected at around a 12¼ per cent annual rate, well above
the 8½ per cent upper bound of the Committee's range. Growth in M2 over
the April-May period is projected at about 12 per cent, at the upper end
of the Committee's range. Inflows to savings accounts at commercial banks
have remained strong, though continuing to decelerate from February's
extraordinary pace; growth in time deposits other than CD's has strengthened

(2) Following the April 20 FOMC meeting, the Desk promptly
became somewhat less accommodative in the provision of reserves and sought
a funds rate around 4-7/8 per cent, a shade above the then prevailing rate
of 4¾ per cent and equal to the mid-point of the range that had been adopted
by the Committee. Subsequently, with incoming data suggesting rates of
growth in M1 well above the Committee's desired range and M2 near the upper
end of the range, the Desk adopted successively higher funds rate objectives,
In moving to these higher rates the Desk took care in early May to avoid any
undue disruption of the Treasury's refunding operation. Most recently,
the Desk has been in process of establishing a 5¼ per cent Federal funds
rate in the market, and as of this writing funds were trading around
(3) Growth in nonborrowed reserves in the April-May period,
though quite modest, has been somewhat more rapid than contemplated at
the time of the previous FOMC meeting. Such reserves increased at only a
in CD's outstanding freed reserves to support the expansion of other
deposits, but they show signs of increasing somewhat more rapidly in early
May.1/ Member bank borrowings averaged about $40 million in the interval
between Committee meetings, little changed from the previous intermeeting
(4) Since the last Committee meeting, short-term market yields
have risen 35 to 50 basis points in response to the rising funds rate, to
indications of a significant pickup in growth in the key monetary aggregates,
and to further signs of vigorous economic recovery. Rates on most long-term
securities have moved up by roughly 25 to 40 basis points. Rates in the
secondary mortgage market have increased along with yields in other sectors
of the credit markets; however, primary mortgage rates have only halted
their downward trend as deposit growth continued strong at nonbank thrift
(5) The Treasury announced that its May refunding would include an
offering of three issues, with the following amounts available to the
public: $2 billion of 1-year, 11½-month notes and $750 million of reopened
stantially oversubscribed, and $4.7 billion of them were allotted. As a
result, new cash raised in the refunding amounted to about $3½ billion.
The issues have been readily absorbed by the market despite the recent
rise in interest rates, and dealers have distributed nearly all of the
$1.4 billion of securities they received in the operation. Most recently,
the two notes traded about ¼-½ of a point below their average issue
price, while the bond has been near issue price.
(6) Total short-term business credit remained unchanged during
April as a $1 billion rise in outstanding commercial paper issued by non-
financial firms offset a similar decline in bank loans to businesses.
Total loans at all commercial banks are estimated to have contracted slightly
during the month, but banks' net acquisitions of U.S. Government securities
were substantial. Weekly reporting banks allowed another $3½ billion of CD's
to run-off in April, as inflows from other deposits were strong.
(7) The table on the following page shows (in percentage annual
rates of change) related monetary and financial flows over various time
periods. The data in this table and all subsequent tables except Table 2
in the back of the blue book incorporate benchmark revisions for the money
supply based on nonmember call reports for December 31, 1975. These
revisions were relatively small in magnitude, and a comparison of the
unrevised and revised data may be found in Appendix table VI.

Prospective developments
(8) Summarized below for the Committee's consideration are three
alternative sets of short-run specifications for the monetary aggregates
and the Federal funds rate. (More detailed data, as well as longer-run
growth rates, are shown in the tables on pp. 6 a and 6b, while reserve
aggregates consistent with the specifications are presented in appendix

(9) Alternative B assumes a Federal funds rate range centered
on 5-1/4 per cent, the most recent Desk objective, while alternative A
assumes some easing of the money market and alternative C some further
tightening. Under all three alternatives, the rate of growth in M1 over
the May-June period is expected to be considerably reduced from its April
pace, though remaining stronger than in the latter part of 1975 and early
per cent annual rate range.
(10) The very rapid rate of expansion of M1 in April may have
been caused in part by a large decline in U.S. Treasury deposits. However,
the underlying demand for money also appears strong, and a relatively

rapid growth in M1 is likely to continue. Perhaps indicative of the
strength of underlying money demand, there was no significant reversal
in late April and early May of the large build-up in private demand deposits
in the first half of April.
(11) Growth in M2 over the May-June period is expected to
remain relatively rapid under alternatives A and B. Nevertheless, growth
under alternative B--as measured by the mid-point of a 7-11 per cent,
annual rate, range--is expected to be slower than during the first four
months of the year. This reflects the higher level of market interest
rates that has developed as well as some shift of funds out of savings and
time deposits in payment for the $4.7 billion of new 10-year notes recently
offered by the Treasury.
(12) Under alternative C, growth in M2 is expected to slow more
markedly over the May-June period. The further rise in the Federal funds
rate that is envisaged would lead to a continued rise in other short-term
rates, with the 3-month Treasury bill rate likely to move up to the 5-3/4-6
per cent area. This would probably lead to a considerable outflow from
savings deposits of those interest-sensitive funds that were shifted into
such accounts when short-term market rates first moved down to around 5 per
cent, the Regulation Q ceiling rate on commercial banks' savings deposits.
(13) The firming of money market conditions associated with
alternative C would also exert upward pressure on longer-term interest
rates over the next few weeks. Loan demands are still focused more on
securities markets than on banks. The corporate bond calendar has built
up further in recent weeks, partly in anticipation of higher interest rates
later, and the municipal calendar remains sizable. Moreover, the Treasury
is likely to continue raising much of its new cash in the coupon area.
Even if the Federal funds rate stabilizes around 5-1/4 per cent between
now and the next Committee meeting--as is contemplated under alternative B--
some further upward adjustment in longer-term, as well as short-term inter-
est rates may still occur, since markets probably have not yet fully
adjusted to a 5-1/4 per cent funds rate.
(14) Over the coming year, the staff expects interest rates
generally to be under considerable upward pressure, assuming M1 growth
from QI '76 to QI '77 is at a rate around the mid-point of the 4-1/2-7
per cent range adopted by the Committee. Interest rates are projected to
reach higher levels than anticipated at the time of the last meeting for
three main reasons: (a) the FOMC lowered its longer-run growth rates for
M1 and M2 slightly; (b) the staff has revised upward somewhat its projec-
tion for the rate of growth in nominal GNP; and (c) the much faster than
expected increase in the money stock apparently in store for the second
quarter probably reflects, at least in part, an increase in money demand
relative to GNP. Because the annual rate of M1 growth in the second
quarter now seems likely to be in the area of 9½-10 per cent, annual rate,
over the next three quarters the growth rate would have to be held to
about 4-1/4 per cent (annual rate) if the 5-3/4 per cent growth of the
QI '76-QI '77 range is to be achieved.
(15) The staff's longer-run projections of the Federal funds
rate under each of the three alternatives are shown in appendix table IV.
As may be seen, the staff expects that under alternative B the funds rate
would peak out at around 8-1/2 per cent early next year. However, under
alternative C, which contemplates a prompt further move toward restraint,
the funds rate may peak out at a lower 7-3/4 per cent level by the winter
of this year. A considerably higher ultimate level for the funds rate is
envisaged under alternative A, since it would be necessary to offset later
the effects of near-term easing in reserve conditions contemplated by that
alternative. In view of these interest rate expectations, we have assumed
for all alternatives an increase in Regulation Q ceiling rates in the fall
of this year of 50 basis points for certificates maturing in 4 years or
more and 25 basis points for shorter-term certificates. Even so, as
indicated in the last two lines of the table on p. 6a, over the QI '76-QI '77
period, growth in M1 at a rate equal to the mid-point of the FOMC's range
is expected to be associated with growth in M2 and M3 at rates near the
bottom of their respective ranges.
Proposed directive
(16) Given below is a proposed operational paragraph if the
Committee wishes to formulate its instructions in terms of desired growth
in monetary aggregates over the months ahead. No alternatives are pre-
sented for this formulation, in the expectation that the reference to
desired growth will be taken to apply to the longer-term targets and that
at this meeting the Committee will not reconsider those targets.
'Monetary Aggregates" Proposal
To implement this policy, while taking account of develop-
ments in domestic and international financial markets, the Committee
seeks to achieve bank reserve and money market conditions consistent
with moderate growth in monetary aggregates over the period ahead.
(17) Should the Committee desire to place main emphasis on bank
reserve and money market conditions, the language needed would depend on
the specific conditions sought. Three alternative "money market" direc-
tives intended to correspond to the similarly lettered policy alternatives
are given below.
Alternative "Money Market" Proposals
Alternative A
To implement this policy, while taking account of develop-
ments in domestic and international financial markets, the Committee
seeks to achieve SOMEWHAT EASIER bank reserve and money market condi-
tions consistent with moderate growth in monetary aggregates over the
period IMMEDIATELY ahead, PROVIDED THAT MONETARY AGGREGATES APPEAR
TO BE GROWING AT ABOUT THE RATES CURRENTLY EXPECTED.
Alternative B
To implement this policy, while taking account of develop-
ments in domestic and international financial markets, the Committee
seeks to achieve MAINTAIN PREVAILING bank reserve and money market
conditions consistent with moderate growth in monetary aggregates
over the period IMMEDIATELY ahead, PROVIDED THAT MONETARY AGGREGATES
APPEAR TO BE GROWING AT ABOUT THE RATES CURRENTLY EXPECTED,
Alternative C
To implement this policy, while taking account of develop-
ments in domestic and international financial markets, the Committee
seeks to achieve SOMEWHAT FIRMER bank reserve and money market condi-
tions consistent with moderate growth in monetary aggregates over the
period IMMEDIATELY ahead, PROVIDED THAT MONETARY AGGREGATES APPEAR TO
BE GROWING AT ABOUT THE RATES CURRENTLY EXPECTED.
