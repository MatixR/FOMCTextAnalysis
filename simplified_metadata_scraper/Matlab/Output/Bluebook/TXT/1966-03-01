Prefatory Note 
 
 
The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version available 
based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the Board 
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was created 
through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned 
versions text-searchable.2   Though a stringent quality assurance process was 
employed, some imperfections may remain. 
 
Please note that some material may have been redacted from this document if that 
material was received on a confidential basis.  Redacted material is indicated by 
occasional gaps in the text or by gray boxes around non-text content.  All redacted

1  In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic 
format.  All scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced 
tilting) and lightly cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other 
blemishes caused after initial printing). 
 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optical character recognition computer program (OCR) 
first created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, 
staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.  Please note that the numbers and text in charts and 
tables were not reliably recognized by the OCR process and were not checked or corrected by staff.

MONEY MARKET AND RESERVE RELATIONSHIPS
Money markets
Recent developments. Since early February, short-term
interest rates have moved somewhat higher. In the bill market, the
largest increases have occurred in the longest maturities. Demand
for Treasury bills has been seasonally strong, but mostly concentrated
in the shortest maturities.
The reserve position of central money market banks has been
relatively comfortable during recent weeks -- in contrast to January --
partly because of a sizable drop in funds absorbed in dealer operations.
Dealers have had relatively light financing needs because of their
reduced positions in bills and their net short positions in inter-
mediate- and long-term coupon issues.
Despite the easier position of major money market banks
the banking system as a whole has been under greater reserve pressure.
In the three statement weeks ending February 23 net borrowed reserves
averaged about $120 million, and member bank borrowings close to $500
million -- each up about $70 million from their January average. And
the Federal funds market has been somewhat tauter, with trading
generally at 4-5/8 per cent and some at 4-3/4 per cent.
Prospective developments. Assuming net borrowed reserves
work somewhat deeper so as to average around $150 million over the
next three weeks, the 3-month bill rate is likely to average within

a 4.65-4.75 per cent range. While bill demand from the System and
continuing demand from liquidity-seeking investors may serve to hold
bill rates down in the early part of the period, short-term markets
probably will be strained over the March tax and dividend date, and
it is possible that the pressure will be greater and more extended
than usual. Bank and corporate liquidity remains low, with banks
faced by sizable CD maturities in the weeks immediately ahead. In
addition, by the end of March or early April the Treasury is likely
to be raising a small amount of cash in the short-term area and by
mid-April corporations are likely to need extra cash to meet accelerated
tax payments.
To some extent, however, the money market has begun to pre-
pare for a sizable increase in the demand for funds. Dealers have
maintained bill positions at relatively low levels, and the more
comfortable reserve position of some major money market banks was
partly developed in anticipation of an expansion in loan demand. The
maturing March tax bill, amounting to $3 billion, is larger relative
to tax liabilities than was the case a year ago, which will tend to
moderate some portion of market pressures.
Even so, banks will have to bid for sizable blocks of CD
money over the coming weeks simply in order to keep from losing ground.
And this raises the possibility of repercussions on the bill market,
the long-term sector of which may already have been affected by
recent increases in CD offering rates.
CONFIDENTIAL (FR) -4-
Interest rates in bond markets are likely to be subject
to further upward pressure in the weeks ahead. Corporate and
municipal sectors will be absorbing a large volume of new issues.
Pressure in the municipal market may also be compounded by lessened
bank participation. But the sharp recent adjustments in bond yields
may to some extent have already discounted prospective credit demands.
Neither is it clear to what degree anticipatory borrowing has been a
factor in the long-term rate adjustment.
While some further shift in monetary policy may also have
been discounted in recent market rate movements, a further lessening
of reserve availability in the period ahead to net borrowed reserves
staying around $200 million or somewhat above would likely lead to
greater upward yield movements in both short- and long-term markets.
Partly these would reflect the coincidence of lessened reserve avail-
ability with seasonal money market pressures, which would likely lead
to immediate effects particularly on Federal funds and CD rates.
Moreover, a consistently deeper net borrowed level and tauter money
market conditions might lead to more pervasive expectations of rises
in the prime loan rate and the discount rate.
Reserve flows, bank credit, and money
Recent developments. Growth in total and nonborrowed
reserves slowed substantially further in February on a monthly
average basis. And expansion in total member bank deposits is
CONFIDENTIAL (FR) -5-
estimated at about 4.5 per cent (annual rate), as compared with
The small increases in reserve aggregates and member bank
deposits for February in part belatedly reflect the reversal of the
extremely large reserve expansion that peaked during the first week
of January (as judged by weekly figures for reserves against private
deposits). Aggregate required reserves against private deposits
declined through January after the first week and have shown only
a relatively small expansion thus far in February.
Prospective developments. Some supply of reserves from
System open market operations is projected the statement week ending
March 9. But an about offsetting reserve absorption will be required
after midmonth because an increase in float and inflow of currency
are projected to more than offset a tax period expansion in required
In March, U.S. Government deposits are projected to decline
on average, reaching very low levels by around midmonth prior to the
tax date and then recovering. This pattern suggests that money supply
will be expanding early in March. Its continued growth as spring
progresses will depend in large part on the extent of bank loan
demands. With such demands expected to be strong, the growth in
the private demand deposit component of the money supply is very
likely to accelerate from its recent reduced pace perhaps to an annual
rate averaging 5 per cent over the next few months.
CONFIDENTIAL (FR) -6-
Growth in time and savings deposits thus far in 1966 has
remained at a considerably reduced pace (8 per cent annual rate).
In the months immediately ahead, there is little reason to expect
growth to accelerate. Expansion of total time and savings deposits
has been relatively strong at country banks, and this may continue.
City banks, however, are likely to find it difficult.to obtain CD
funds in the coming March-April period. And this may be a period
when their need for CD money will rise if they find loan demand very
strong and asset liquidation more difficult.
Deposit movements such as those described above would add
up to only a moderate expansion in bank credit over the months ahead,
perhaps in the order of 5-6 per cent on average. This would also
imply only moderate growth in total and nonborrowed reserves.
