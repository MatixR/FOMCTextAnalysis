MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES
Recent Developments
(1) Open market operations since the last FOMC meeting have been
aimed at maintaining reserve pressures at the level prevailing since late
last year. The federal funds rate stayed mostly around 8-1/4 percent.
Abstracting from special situation borrowing by the Bank of New England,
initially classified as adjustment borrowing, the allowance for adjustment
plus seasonal borrowing incorporated in the nonborrowed reserve objective
during the intermeeting period was $150 million. Seasonal plus adjustment
borrowing averaged $160 million in the three maintenance periods since the
February meeting. Borrowing generally has run well below this level,
except for occasional surges on settlement Wednesdays owing to unexpected
movements in the supply and demand for reserves; not only was adjustment
borrowing usually quite low, but the increase in seasonal borrowing has
been somewhat less than typical over this part of the year. Market
concerns about financial strains on some institutions evidently have made
banks even more chary of being seen at the window, and needs for liquidity
have been held down by sluggish loan demand and robust inflows of retail
(2) Although the federal funds rate was steady over the inter-
meeting period, other short-term rates edged higher as have yields on
intermediate-term issues, maintaining a modest upward tilt to the Treasury
yield curve out to 3 years. Somewhat mixed economic information received
over the intermeeting period evidently was interpreted as pointing, on
balance, to some firming of economic activity and the persistence of price
pressures. The Federal Reserve, consequently, is now seen as unlikely to
ease policy any further in the near term, especially against the back-
ground of its stated commitment to reducing inflation gradually, and pos-
sibly even having to tighten over a somewhat longer horizon. Treasury
bond yields, though fluctuating over a fairly wide range, fell slightly on
balance over the period, despite increases in long-term rates in other
major countries, which reflected importantly increases in inflation
expectations, as discussed below in paragraph (3). Indeed, bond yields
may have been held down to an extent by shifting demands toward dollar
assets, as evidenced also by a rise in the foreign exchange value of the
dollar. Stock prices also were firm, with major indexes rising 1 to 2
percent over the intermeeting period. The collapse of Drexel Burnham
Lambert had little impact on financial markets outside the noninvestment-
grade sectors. Its collapse, along with potential sales by some large
institutional holders, contributed to a widening of the spread between
yields on junk bonds and other long-term securities. In addition, some
corporations that had been issuing low-grade or unrated commercial paper
through Drexel were unable to roll over maturing issues.
(3) The dollar's exchange value has appreciated by about 3 per-
cent on a weighted-average basis since the last Committee meeting, rising
The dollar's strength generally seemed to reflect various political and
financial difficulties in foreign countries. Despite a favorable result
for the ruling LDP in the Japanese parliamentary elections, a generally
bearish mood continued to prevail in Japanese financial markets. Stock
prices declined by about 20 percent while long-term bond yields rose by
more than 50 basis points. Three-month interest rates in Japan also rose
by 50 basis points, all in advance of the Bank of Japan's one percentage
point increase in its discount rate on March 20. In Germany, increased
inflation expectations, related to monetary unification, propelled bond
rates more than 50 basis points higher, while 3-month German rates rose by
period. In the United Kingdom, an uncertain political situation combined
with a more pessimistic outlook for inflation and the external deficit to
depress sterling.
the Desk accounted for
nearly $1.7 billion, $1.5 billion against yen and $200 million against DM.
All of the Desk's sales of dollars after March 2--$830 million--were for
the Treasury's account.
(4) M2 accelerated to a 9-1/2 percent rate of increase in Febru-
ary but, based on partial deposit data through March 19, is estimated to
be slowing to a 6 percent rate this month. This pattern would bring the
rate of increase from December to 6-1/2 percent, a bit below the 7 percent
path specified by the Committee for the December-to-March period. Demands
for M2 this quarter likely have been boosted by strength in nominal in-
come, by some acceleration in personal income tax refunds, and, perhaps
earlier in the quarter, by a reluctance to commit funds to junk bond and
stock markets in view of unsettled conditions. However, the opportunity
costs of holding M2 instruments have risen over the first three months of
the year, as retail deposit offering rates have remained relatively flat,
especially at shorter maturities, while most market rates have risen. In
addition to the usual lag of deposit behind market rates, depository
institutions may have held down offering rates as core deposits remained
fairly strong relative to asset growth. The damping influence on M2
demand of higher opportunity costs is evidenced by the recent strength in
noncompetitive tenders at Treasury auctions, and, along with the ebbing
effects of earlier market rate decreases, has contributed to a small
estimated increase in M2 velocity in the first quarter, after two quarters
of substantial declines.2
(5) Following a 5-1/2 percent rate of expansion in February,
growth of M3 is estimated at a 1-1/2 percent rate in March. Over the
first three months of the year, M3 has grown at a 3 percent rate, 1/2
percentage point below the pace specified by the Committee for the
December-to-March period. Expansion of M3 thus far this year has been
curbed by continued contraction of the thrift industry, though apparently
the rate of decline has been slower than in the fourth quarter. In addi-
tion, a variety of influences have damped M3 growth at banks: growth of
bank credit was weak in January, while the financing of stronger asset
growth in February and March relied heavily on non-M3 managed liabilities
and government deposits. Although banks have tapped the Eurodollar
deposit market for funds this year, holdings of those deposits by U.S.
residents--a component of M3--has continued to decline, further depressing
growth of this aggregate. Apparently, U.S. residents have found these
investments less attractive at the unusually narrow spreads prevailing
relative to returns on domestic investments.
(6) Growth in the debt of nonfinancial sectors over the first
quarter is estimated to have continued at about the 7-1/2 percent pace of
the last three months of 1989, leaving this aggregate around the middle of
its monitoring range. Treasury borrowing has picked up, seasonally ad-
justed, in anticipation of funding RTC working capital needs; borrowing by
private sectors, however, evidently moderated slightly. Business borrow-
ing remained subdued. Equity retirements dropped further, reflecting
inhospitable conditions in the junk bond market and more stringent credit
standards by banks and other lenders; on the other hand, business needs
for external funds to finance increases in capital spending widened as
internal funds dropped further. A survey of large banks also suggested
they were taking a more cautious approach to lending to below investment-
grade business borrowers for other purposes; however, recent business-loan
price information does not provide any evidence of widespread increases in
spreads of loan rates over funding costs. For the first time in the cur-
rent expansion, banks showed virtually no overall increases in their wil-
lingness to extend consumer installment loans over recent months, and a
substantial proportion have tightened standards on home equity lines of
credit. Nevertheless, consumer credit extended by banks and others so far
this year appears to be expanding at around its moderate fourth-quarter
pace, maintained in part by generous auto incentive packages. Mortgage
rate spreads suggest that credit for residential first mortgages is gener-
ally available, but survey evidence coupled with Call report data indicate
that banks have reduced the availability of commercial real estate credit,
particularly for construction and land development purposes.

Policy Alternatives
(7) Three policy alternatives are presented for Committee con-
sideration. Under alternative B, maintaining federal funds trading around
adjustment plus seasonal borrowing, the assumption used since the last
FOMC meeting in constructing reserve paths. Although seasonal borrowing
should increase over coming weeks, underlying demands for adjustment bor-
rowing, absent unusual settlement day pressures, are likely to remain
weak. Alternative A embodies a 7-3/4 percent federal funds rate and a
borrowing assumption of $100 million, while the 8-3/4 percent funds rate
of alternative C reflects borrowing of $200 million. Predicting the rela-
tionship between the federal funds rate and discount window borrowing
remains difficult, however, justifying continued flexibility in the Desk's
approach to the borrowing objective.
(8) Projected growth rates for the monetary aggregates from March
to June under the three policy alternatives are given in the table below.
(The table and charts on the following pages show more detailed data.)
Under all the alternatives, M2 and M3 are likely to remain within the
upper and lower halves of their respective annual growth ranges through
June. The monthly pattern of monetary growth is highly uncertain because
of normal difficulties in assessing the effects of individual tax payments
around the mid-April tax season. Last year, liquid balances were
depressed by tax payments in April and by still more in May, before
rebounding sharply over the summer. We have assumed that the element of
surprise in tax payments reflected in the behavior of money in 1989 will
be absent this year, so that deposit flows will be better captured by the
current seasonal factors and hence will be smoother, seasonally adjusted.
Still, with total individual nonwithheld tax payments expected to exceed
last year's elevated pace by a little, the possibility of above-normal
reductions in liquid balances to pay those taxes poses a downside risk to
the money paths given below. Another such risk, particularly at the M3
level, is the possibility of very large expenditures by the RTC. These
expenditures tend to depress M3 by, in effect, substituting Treasury
financing for monetary liabilities. The staff has assumed a substantial
pickup in RTC activity in the second quarter, though by less than the
announced plans of the RTC.

(9) Financial market participants evidently expect no monetary
policy change in the near term, meaning that a funds rate around the 8-1/4
percent level of alternative B is built into the current structure of
market interest rates. Even so, alternative B would involve some easing
in Treasury bill rates from most recent levels to the extent that supply
pressures in the market dissipate. That will depend to some extent on the
pace of RTC activity and associated working capital needs. Greater RTC

funding needs would be met in the first instance by a drawdown in Treasury
cash balances--since some RTC working capital usage has already been
financed--and only subsequently by augmenting Treasury borrowing. Conse-
quently, we are projecting a substantial paydown in Treasury bills over
the intermeeting period after the tax date. Moreover, central bank sales
of Treasury securities to fund their dollar sales in foreign exchange
markets could drop off at any time should intervention activity decline.
The staff anticipates relative stability in the exchange value of the
dollar under alternative B. Decisions regarding economic and monetary
union of East and West Germany, which are to be made by the end of April,
could affect the dollar's value against the mark. If those decisions
heighten expectations of German inflation, the dollar could continue under
upward pressure against the mark; increases in German interest rates owing
solely to such expectations would not necessarily affect real and nominal
interest rates in the United States. Bond prices in the U.S. will remain
most sensitive to prospects for U.S. economic growth and inflation.
Incoming data on prices and the economy about in line with staff expecta-
tions should not change market expectations that Federal Reserve policy
will remain essentially unchanged for a time, and consequently would be
associated with only minor movements in bond yields.
(10) An immediate policy easing under alternative A that brought
the federal funds rate down to 7-3/4 percent would run counter to market
sentiment and ripple through the money market, with other short-term rates
likely declining a similar amount. Lower short-term funding costs also
should engender reductions in lending rates on business and consumer
credit. The exchange value of the dollar would tend to adjust downward.
A dollar depreciation might combine with prospects for somewhat stronger
U.S. economic activity to heighten domestic inflationary expectations,
limiting the declines in longer-term yields.
(11) The rise in the federal funds rate under alternative C to
the-board increase of comparable size in other short-term rates. Recent
upward pressure on the exchange value of the dollar would continue. Bond
yields would tend to rise, though with inflation expectations lessened by
the monetary policy tightening, the increases could be muted. The addi-
tional policy restraint might reinforce current concerns about default
risk on some loan categories, and would tend to encourage a further firm-
ing in credit standards, implying additional restraint on economic
(12) Under alternative B, M2 growth from March to June is pro-
jected at a 6 percent annual rate--about 1/2 percentage point below its
average growth rate over the first three months of the year. Nominal
income growth is projected to slow next quarter. Opportunity costs may
narrow only a little from recently elevated levels. Thrifts are discour-
aging deposit inflows as part of their effort to trim balance sheets; many
of these deposits are going to banks instead, and these deposit shifts
would be augmented as the RTC steps up the rate at which it resolves
institutions. Banks may be unwilling, however, to expand their assets in
line with deposit inflows, given concerns about loan quality and the
capital requirements associated with a pickup in asset growth. In such
circumstances, offering rates on retail deposits are likely to stay some-
what depressed relative to Treasury bill rates. With opportunity costs
little changed, velocity probably will be about flat in the second quar-
ter.3 M1 is expected to continue expanding at a 4-1/2 percent annual
rate from March to June, as a slowing of currency growth is offset by a
little faster inflow to transactions deposits than over the first quar-
(13) M3 growth under alternative B is projected at a 4 percent
pace, somewhat higher than the December-to-March rate of advance. The
acceleration primarily owes to some pickup in bank credit growth from
reflecting a resumption of business lending; as a consequence, the decline
in large time deposits at commercial banks should cease. In addition, the
runoff of the term Eurodollar component of this aggregate is likely to
ebb. Greater RTC activity would tend to hold down M3 growth to the extent
that such activity necessitated additional government borrowing; the
expenditure of funds previously borrowed by the Treasury would not affect
M3 because such funds are already on deposit at commercial banks. Thrifts
are assumed to continue trimming their large time deposits at about the 25
percent annual rate of the first quarter, while their runoffs of term RPs
abate a bit because the outstanding stock of these liabilities has fallen
to a rather low level.
is projected to record a 4-3/4 percent annual rate of change from March
to June, compared with the 10 percent increase from December to March.
(14) Domestic nonfinancial debt is projected to grow at a 6-1/2
percent annual rate from March to June, down from an estimated 7-1/2 per-
cent pace over the previous three months.5 The slowing is attributable
to net federal borrowing, which is projected to slacken substantially,
despite some borrowing to finance RTC working capital. The household,
business, and state and local sectors are all expected to maintain debt
growth at about their first-quarter rates. Some continued restraint on
business credit expansion is assumed to derive from a further reduction in
net equity retirements. Overall debt growth from the fourth quarter of
last year to June is foreseen at the middle of its 5 to 9 percent monitor-
ing range.
(15) Under the less restrictive policy posture of alternative A,
M2 and M3 growth from March to June would be boosted to 7 and 4-1/2 per-
cent rates, respectively. M2 would be close to the 7 percent upper limit
of its annual range, and on a trajectory that would carry it above its
upper bound in the third quarter. M3 would remain well below its midpoint
in June, reflecting both the downsizing of the thrift industry and a lower
responsiveness than M2 to movements in market interest rates. Under the
tighter financial market conditions of alternative C, M2 and M3 growth
from March to June likely would slow to 5 and 3-1/2 percent rates,
respectively. M2 growth from the fourth-quarter base of its annual range
to June would be 6 percent. The associated growth for M3 by June would be
growth cone.

OPERATIONAL PARAGRAPH
In the implementation of policy for the immediate
future, the Committee seeks to DECREASE SOMEWHAT/maintain/
INCREASE SOMEWHAT the existing degree of pressure on reserve
positions. Taking account of progress toward price stabil-
ity, the strength of the business expansion, the behavior of
the monetary aggregates, and developments in foreign ex-
change and domestic financial markets, slightly (SOMEWHAT)
greater reserve restraint (WOULD/ MIGHT) or slightly
(SOMEWHAT) lesser reserve restraint would (MIGHT) be accept-
able in the intermeeting period. The contemplated reserve
conditions are expected to be consistent with growth of M2
and M3 over the period from [DEL: December through] March THROUGH
JUNE at annual rates of about ____ AND ____ [DEL: 7 and 3-1/2] percent
respectively. The Chairman may call for Committee consul-
tation if it appears to the Manager for Domestic Operations
