Prefatory Note 
 
 
The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version available 
based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the Board 
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was created 
through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned 
versions text-searchable.2   Though a stringent quality assurance process was 
employed, some imperfections may remain. 
 
Please note that some material may have been redacted from this document if that

format.  All scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced 
tilting) and lightly cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other 
blemishes caused after initial printing).

MONEY MARKET CONDITIONS
(1) Growth of M1 accelerated to an 11.3 per cent annual rate
in May, and recent data suggest that growth may continue at around that pace
in June. For the two months combined, expansion in Ml thus appears to be
exceeding the high end of the Committee's 7-9½ per cent range of tolerance,
as the table shows. Likewise, with flows to bank time deposits other than
large CD's very strong in recent weeks, growth of M2 appears to be running
significantly above its two-month range of tolerance--at about a 13 per cent
annual rate. The rapid disbursement of tax rebates, amounting to about
$8 billion in May and June, is thought to be the key factor contributing
to the accelerated monetary growth. In addition, recent Congressional action
has cleared the way for disbursement in the second half of June of $1.7
billion in one-time payments to social security recipients.

(2) The bank credit proxy appears to be growing at only
about a 5 per cent annual rate in the May-June period. With loan
demands weak, banks have continued to run off large CD's and have
allocated the bulk of their net deposit growth to investments in Treasury
(3) Shortly after the May FOMC meeting, with the aggregates
strengthening, the Desk sought to achieve reserve conditions consistent
with a Federal funds rate trading in the upper half of the 5-5¼ per cent
range that represented prevailing money market conditions. As the
aggregates continued to strengthen--growing at rates close to or above
the upper limits of the Committee's ranges of tolerance--the Desk sought
to achieve an average funds rate of 5¼ per cent or a little higher.
In the statement week ending June, the funds rate did average about
(4) Private short-term market interest rates have shown
little change on balance during the intermeeting period, although bank
prime rates were reduced ¼ of a percentage point to 7 per cent at most
banks (and to 6¾ per cent at one major bank). Treasury bill rates also
showed little net change over most of the intermeeting period, but
during the past several days have posted net declines of 12-25 basis points
from the levels prevailing at the time of the last FOMC meeting. The 3-month
bill has traded most recently at around 4.95 per cent. The recent
downturn in bill yields reflects market adjustments to the prospective
seasonal shrinkage in bill supply over the latter half of June.
(5) In bond markets, yields showed little change during late
May, despite the continued heavy volume of corporate financing and the
general erosion of confidence in municipal issues stemming from the
problems of New York City. Since then, bond yields have dropped
considerably, with the decline especially sharp in the corporate bond
market. This rally appears to have reflected the more moderate volume
of Treasury financing in prospect through July, the growing conviction
in market circles that long-term rates may decline for some months
ahead, and most recently the respite for New York City arising from
creation of the Municipal Assistance Corporation.
(6) The table on the following page shows (in percentage annual
rates of change) selected monetary and financing flows over various
time periods. Appendix table III compares money supply growth rates
computed on a quarterly-average basis with those computed on a last-
month-of-quarter basis.

(7) Alternative longer-run growth rates for the monetary
aggregates covering the 12-month period from June 1975 to June 1976
are summarized in the table below for Committee consideration.
Alternative B encompasses generally the same growth rates that had
been adopted by the Committee for the March '75--March '76 period at
its April meeting. The M1 growth range--at 5 to 7½ per cent--is exactly
the same, but minor downward adjustments have been made to growth ranges
for other monetary and credit aggregates. These adjustments take
account of changing relationships among the aggregates based on the
up-dated longer-run time period and re-assessment of the economic and
financial outlook.
Alt. A Alt. B Alt. C
M1  6-84 5-7½ 4-6½
M2  9-11 8-10 7-9
M3  10-12 9-11 8-10
Bank credit proxy 6-9 5½-8½ 4½-7
(8) The longer-run path for M1 in alternative B does imply
a somewhat more rapid rate of growth from March '75 to March '76 than
contemplated by the mid-point of the 5-7½ per cent range adopted by the
Committee at its previous meetings. This is because M1 growth in the
second quarter seems likely to be at about a 9 per cent annual rate,
as compared with the around 7 per cent rate earlier contemplated. The
growth rate from March '75 to March '76 implicit in the currently pro-
posed alternative B is around 7 per cent (based on mid-points). This is,
of course, within the adopted range, though toward the upper end.
(9) Shorter-run alternative operating guides for policy are
tabulated below, with an indication of the most likely 6-month monetary
growth rates that would be associated with each alternative. More detailed
figures on the aggregates are presented in the table on pp. 6a and 6b. And
alternative operating guides expressed in terms of nonborrowed reserves,
as well as other related reserve measures, are shown in appendix
table IV.

(10) As an operating guide for the intermeeting period under
alternative B, the short-run specifications include a rise in the Federal
funds rate to a range centered on 6 per cent. Given the substantial
second half of calendar 1975, this alternative assumes that a tightening
up on bank reserve and money market conditions over the near-term would

be necessary if growth in the monetary aggregates is to be constrained
in an environment of rising incomes and transactions demands. Even if
the funds rate rises in the weeks ahead to around 6 per cent, staff
projections are that M1 growth over the second half of this year is
likely to be on the order of 7 per cent, annual rate, assuming no further
increases in the funds rate until late in the period.
(11) The relationship between alternative short-run operating
targets and longer-run objectives for the monetary aggregates is, of
course, a relatively loose one. Maintenance over the weeks immediately
ahead of prevailing money market conditions (as shown for the short-run
specifications of alternative A) would probably not be inconsistent with
the longer-run objectives of alternative B, but such an approach would
appear to entail the need for a more substantial constraint on monetary
growth later on, and hence a larger rise in the Federal funds rate later
in the summer. We have, therefore, assumed that maintenance of pre-
vailing money market conditions over the short-run would be more con-
sistent with adoption by the Committee of higher longer-run growth
objectives for the monetary aggregates, as shown under alternative A.
(12) Given prevailing money market conditions, M1 growth over
the June-July period is expected to be in an 8-10 per cent annual rate
range. Growth is expected to slow from the very rapid pace of May and
the first part of June as the effect of Treasury disbursement of tax
rebates wears off. However, disbursement of the $1.7 billion of one-
time payments to social security recipients in the second half of June,
as noted earlier, will tend to sustain private deposits. Thus, any
significant slowdown in M1 growth probably will be delayed until July.
Tightening of the money market over the intermeeting period, as con-
templated under alternative B, would work to lower these growth rates
slightly, but most of the effect of higher interest rates on the monetary
aggregates would develop later on.
(13) Over the next four weeks credit markets are not expected
to be subject to significant, additional demand pressures. In fact,
between now and mid-year the Treasury will repay a modest amount of
debt, on balance. However, the Treasury will need to raise new cash
again in early July, with the bulk of this financing probably taking the
form of additions to bill auctions. Longer-term credit demands from
corporations and state and local governments may remain quite large,
but private short-term credit demands will probably continue quite
weak for some while as businesses continue to liquidate inventories and
utilize the proceeds of capital market issues to repay short-term debt.
Thus, on the basis of demands for credit, interest rates are not likely
to be under any significant upward pressure over the weeks ahead, apart
from a potential seasonal rebound in bill rates after mid-year.
(14) Although the pace of expansion in time deposit funds
(other than large CD's) at banks and thrift institutions should diminish
with the ending of tax rebate and special social security benefit payments,
inflows of such funds are expected to remain generally large. Thus,
expansion of M2 and M3 is expected to continue sizable--under alternatives
A or B--over the next month or two. The continued availability of such
funds will permit banks to reduce outstanding large CD's further during
early summer, given weak loan demand at banks. Thrift institutions will
be encouraged to continue expanding mortgage loan commitments, and
mortgage interest rates could edge down somewhat further if conditions
in money and capital markets remain stable.
(15) A significant rise in the Federal funds rate--for example,
to the 6 per cent mid-point of the alternative B range--would, however,
alter market expectations and lead to upward adjustments in interest
rates. The adjustments would probably be most marked in short-term
rates, with the 3-month bill rate rising to perhaps 5¾-6 per cent by
mid-July. Adjustments in longer-term rates might be moderated by market
expectations of a continued slowing in the rate of inflation, a gradual
reduction in the prospective volume of new offerings, and by the
relatively substantial upward slope to the yield curve that now exists.
(16) Alternative C contemplates more tightening in money
market conditions over the near-term--with the funds rate range centered
on 6 per cent--than under alternative B. Such an approach appears
compatible with longer-run growth objectives that include holding
growth in M1 over the next year in the 4-6 per cent annual rate range,
as shown in the table in paragraph (7). Under this alternative, growth
in M1 over the March '75-March '76 period would be at the mid-point of
the 5-7 per cent long-run range earlier adopted by the Committee. But
this alternative implies enough further tightening in the money market
so that growth in the monetary aggregates would be below the bottom
of the 5-7 per cent range for M 1 in the first half of 1976.
(17) Near-term tightening in the money market of the magnitude
suggested for alternative C would almost certainly lead to a fairly
sharp reaction in other short-term markets and to an upward adjustment
in long-term rates. It could even engender expectations of a rise in
the discount rate from its current 6 per cent level. Some adverse impact
on savings flows to banks and intermediaries could be expected, but short-
term rates--typified perhaps by a 3-month bill rate around 6 3/2 per cent--
would not be likely to rise so high as to sharply curtail such inflows.

the operational paragraph of the directive, which are intended to
correspond to the similarly lettered policy alternatives discussed in
the preceding section.
