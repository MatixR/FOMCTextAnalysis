MONEY MARKET AND RESERVE RELATIONSHIPS
Recent developments
Day-to-day money market rates have generally been slightly
lower during the past three weeks--a period including an "even keel"
stance in relation to the Treasury's mid-November refunding--than in
earlier weeks of September and October. In large part, the easing
of such rates has reflected the usual seasonal improvement toward
the end of October and in early November of the basic reserve deficiency
of major money market banks in New York. With net demands for Federal
funds by these banks reduced, the Federal funds rate averaged below
compared with 4 per cent or slightly above in earlier September-October
weeks. New dealer loan rates in New York also averaged about 4 1/8 per
cent during the recent period, as compared with 4¼ - 4-3/8 per cent
In view of the reserve distribution favoring major money
market banks, the money market rates noted above were consistent with
net free reserves running more toward the lower end of the recent range.
During the past three weeks net free reserves averaged $200 million and
member bank borrowings $90 million, Excess reserves of country banks
were relatively low in this period, which included two double settle-
ment weeks.
This ease in day-to-day rates was accompanied first by an
updrift in bill rates, followed by some easing of bill rates later.

The 3-month bill was most recently quoted around 4.60 per cent.
Liquidity demands of investors have been a tempering influence on bill
rates, and very short-term bills, as typified by the 1-month bill, have
declined in yield. There was little evidence of reaction in short-term
markets to the most recent increase in British Bank rate.
In contrast to the bill market, there were marked upward
interest rate adjustments in the Treasury note and bond market.
Intermediate- and longer-term yields rose 15-25 basis points over the
past three weeks, largely because of disappointed market hopes for tax
action in this session of Congress and in reaction to current and
prospective additions to the calendar of new issues in the corporate,
municipal, and Federal Government PC markets. Against this background
of capital market gloom, the new Treasury issues in the mid-November
refunding have traded almost continuously below par since the books
were closed. Speculative selling of the long note created some serious
pressures in the first few days after books were closed, but such
selling has subsequently been minimal. As of the end of business
Thursday, dealers' holdings of the 7-year note were down to about
$75 million; the bulk of early dealer sales of this note were to
Treasury investment accounts, but a steady small investor interest
has been in evidence. With respect to the 15-month note, dealer holdings
have been reduced to around $335 million, down some $300 million from
their original holdings.

despite a sizable reserve provision. In October, total reserves rose at

about 16 per cent annual rate and the bank credit proxy by 12 per
cent, close to expectations. This brings the annual rates of increase
for these two variables to 12 and 13 per cent respectively over the
first 10 months of the year. Time deposits rose by a 13 per cent
annual rate in October, and the money supply, following virtually
no growth in September, rose by about 6.5 per cent. For the year to
date these two variables have risen at annual rates of 16.5 and 7
per cent respectively. To some extent this year's rapid increase
in monetary variables offsets the suppressed rates of growth during
the second half of 1966. Over the 16-month period since mid-1966,
the bank credit proxy (including Euro-dollars) rose by a 9 per cent
annual rate and the money supply 4 per cent.
Prospective developments
If monetary policy maintains an unchanged stance in terms of
money market conditions, the complex of such conditions might include
a Federal fund rate ranging around 4 per cent, member bank borrowings
averaging around $100 million, and free reserves in a $150-$300 million
range. The 3-month bill rate is normally under upward seasonal pressure
between now and mid-December, and a 4.50 - 4.80 per cent range for the
bill rate seems reasonable over the coming weeks. Upward pressures on
bill rates, particularly relatively short bills, may be moderated by
the favorable technical position of the bill market, by continued
investor demands for liquid market instruments, and by the hiatus in
new Treasury bill financing. With respect to the technical position of

the market, dealers continue to have a sizable positive carry on their
bill positions. In addition, relatively strong market demand for bills,
supplemented by recent System purchases of almost $500 million, has
contributed to a reduction in dealer bill holdings from a recent peak
of $3.4 billion on October 25 to around $2.5 billion currently.
The System will be supplying reserves on balance between
now and the next meeting of the Committee, although the precise amount
is subject to more than the usual degree of uncertainty. Open market
at the Federal Reserve
buying will be reduced if, as seems likely, the Treasury cash balance/
will have to be drawn down as the mid-December cash low approaches.
Direct borrowing by the Treasury from the System is also a possibility
in December.
A likely upward drift in bill rates will probably be
accompanied by continued uncertainties and upward rate pressures in
bond markets in reflection of the heavy municipal and corporate
calendar and the concentration of Federal cash borrowing in the PC
area (including a possible 20-year maturity as part of the FNMA PC
offering). Factors tending to intensify such upward rate pressure are
market worries over sterling, concern about the possibility of capital
issues control, and prevailing expectations that monetary policy will
tighten in view of the doubts surrounding enactment of a program of
fiscal restraint. Since the upward rate pressures have so large an
expectational component, any political or economic events altering
attitudes could be quickly reflected in stabilization of bond markets.
November 10, 1967.
With maintenance of prevailing money market conditions
appearing consistent with a further updrift in interest rates, the
rate of bank credit expansion over the last two months of the year is
likely to slow somewhat further, assuming no unexpected shift in credit
demands. In the mid-November refunding about $2 billion of new cash
was raised, but relatively high interest rates offered on the new
issues appeared to attract considerable nonbank subscriptions, including
some from individuals. In addition to the placement of new Treasury
debt outside the banking system, bank credit expansion is likely to be
slowed somewhat as banks' ability to obtain CD funds outside the
short maturity area is further limited by continued upward pressures on
bill rates and yields on other short-term market instruments.
Time and savings deposits in November are expected to increase
in a 9-11 per cent range, the slowest monthly increase for the year to
date. The competitiveness of large CD's has been adversely affected by
yield levels reached by longer-term bills. And there are indications
of some retardation in the flow of consumer saving to banks, just as
is the case with other savings institutions. In December, the rate of
increase in time deposits might remain moderate, influenced by the likely
attrition of CD's in connection with the mid-December dividend and
tax dates, although some part of funds raised in heavy capital market
financing may be temporarily invested in CD's.
It is not expected that banks will make particularly aggressive
efforts to rebuild CD's rapidly next month--with short CD's the main

practical instrument--unless business loan demands tend to show a
resurgence. Neither business inventory nor capital spending behavior
yet suggest such a resurgence, but a moderate pick-up in business loan
growth at banks might be anticipated if some corporate borrowers shy
away from capital markets in view of the high rates there and if
business activity in the coming weeks is especially buoyant.
Private demand deposits at banks in November are expected to
increase on average at an annual rate of 8-10 per cent, and money
supply by 6-8 per cent. This growth in money supply follows sharp
declines in the last half of October after U.S. Government deposits
were increased by the large $4.5 billion tax bill financing. The $2
billion of cash raised in the current refunding is not expected to have
so dampening an effect on money supply growth since all the cash will
have to be paid out by the Government within a few days of receipt. In
December, U.S. Government deposits are expected to decline sharply
throughout the month, contributing to a further rapid growth in the money
supply on average.
Given these diverse deposit flows, bank credit in November is
projected to increase in a 7-10 per cent annual rate range, and total
reserves by a similar amount. And as a result of offsetting gyrations
in private and Governmental demand deposits, in conjunction with the
continued slower growth in time deposits, the bank credit proxy in
December is likely to grow at a somewhat slower rate than in November.
CONFIDENTIAL (FR) -7- November 10, 1967.
Policy alternative. "Even keel" considerations are not
likely to be a significant constraint on monetary policy from mid-
November, or shortly thereafter, until at least the latter part of
December. Distribution of issues in the mid-November refunding is
proceeding relatively well. And, as noted earlier, dealer positions
in the long note are comparatively low, while sales of the short note
have been at a steady pace.
Should the System wish to make a move toward restraint
through open market operations, the Committee might consider aiming
at a constellation of money market conditions including a Federal funds
rate centering on 4 1/8 per cent, member bank borrowings averaging $150-
$200 million, and free reserves $50-$200 million. The 3-month bill rate
under the circumstances might move closer to 5 per cent, as it became
apparent that monetary policy was finally tightening, with most market
participants probably assuming further tightening to come, and with
major money market banks coming under increased pressure in view of the
CD ceilings. At the same time, the market would begin to raise questions
about possible changes in Regulation Q ceilings and the discount rate.
Long-term rates may already reflect some expectations of a
tighter monetary policy, but firm evidence that it has developed is
likely to lead to further upward rate movements. Moreover, any
expectations that this policy change may be the first of a series of moves
would tend to increase the premium on anticipatory borrowing and investor
reluctance in capital markets.
CONFIDENTIAL (FR) -8- November 10, 1967.
Borrowers may also attempt to raise or firm up their line
of credit with banks, and perhaps even to take down existing commit-
ments to ensure availability of cash at existing rates. If such
demands develop, banks are likely to attempt to find additional funds
through a variety of means, including sale of short CD's, by active
bidding in the Euro-dollar market, and some more aggressive activity
in the Federal funds market. Such developments would, in turn, lead
to a temporarily somewhat faster growth in reserves and bank credit
than with no change in policy. Over the longer run, as policy remains
taut, the rate of bank credit and money expansion may moderate, depending
on the extent to which banks dispose of assets rather than take their
chances in the Federal funds or CD markets, on the response of borrowers
to the higher cost of money, and on policy with respect to Regulation Q.
