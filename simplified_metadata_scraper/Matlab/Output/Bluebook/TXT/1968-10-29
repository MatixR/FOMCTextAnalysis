Prefatory Note 
 
 
The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version available 
based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the Board 
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was created 
through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned 
versions text-searchable.2   Though a stringent quality assurance process was 
employed, some imperfections may remain. 
 
Please note that some material may have been redacted from this document if that 
material was received on a confidential basis.  Redacted material is indicated by

1  In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic 
format.  All scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced 
tilting) and lightly cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other 
blemishes caused after initial printing). 
 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optical character recognition computer program (OCR) 
first created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, 
staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.  Please note that the numbers and text in charts and 
tables were not reliably recognized by the OCR process and were not checked or corrected by staff.

MONEY MARKET AND RESERVE RELATIONSHIPS
Recent developments
(1) Interest rates have continued to move higher in general
since the last meeting of the Committee, although some yields receded
from their most recent highs as a result of peace hopes. The 3-month
Treasury bill rate for the most part fluctuated near the upper end of
the projected 5.10 - 5.40 per cent range. The growth of major deposit
and reserve aggregates has also been near, or slightly above, the upper
end of the ranges specified in the last Blue book. Growth in the bank
credit proxy in October is now estimated at a 12 per cent annual rate,
on average, a shade below the upper end of the range specified earlier,
after allowance is made for the smaller-than-assumed October tax bill
financing. (Inclusion of Euro-dollar borrowings of banks would reduce
the proxy by one-half percentage point, less than previously assumed.)
(2) The Treasury on Wednesday offered two issues--an 18-month
and a 6-year note--in a "rights" exchange for the maturing Ncvember and
December coupon issues, of which $5.6 billion are held by the public.
The short note has a 5-5/8 per cent coupon and is priced to yield 5.73
per cent, while the longer note is a re-opening at par cf an outstanding

issue with a 5-3/4 per cent coupon. Books will be open October 28-30,
with settlement on November 15. The market reacted with some surprise
to inclusion of a 6-year note in the offering in view of the fair-sized
inventory of 5-5/8's of August '74, which were issued last August, still
in dealer hands. As of Friday, market reaction to the whole package
appeared satisfactory, although many investors are likely to delay decision,
particularly with respect to the longer term note, until the last minute
in hopes that the status of peace negotiations will become clearer.
(3) Day-to-day money market rates have shown little net
change during the interval since the last meeting. The Federal funds
rate has averaged close to 5-7/8 per cent. In the earlier part of the
period funds traded frequently around 6 per cent, while later the rate
dropped, often to 5-3/4 per cent, as there was a sizeable reduction in
the basic deficits of banks in the central money market (although periods
of very temporary tightness or ease have been recurring around the end of
statement weeks). The rate for new loans to dealers in New York has
centered around 6-1/2 per cent, although both higher and lower rates
have not been uncommon.
(4) Member bank borrowing has averaged $425 million during
the last 2 full statement weeks since the Committee meeting, despite a
sharp drop in borrowings in the most recent week. Excess reserves have
averaged $160 million, down $100 million from the preceding four weeks.
Over the whole period since the new reserve procedures have been in
effect, excess reserves have averaged about 30 per cent lower than they
were in the two months before the change. The bulk of the decline has
been at reserve city banks, which have begun actively to utilize the
reserve carry-over provision. Thus far, a bi-weekly pattern of excess
reserve fluctuations has developed, as banks in one week have accumulated
excess reserves and have utilized them by running reserve deficiencies
in the succeeding week.
(5) Growth in the bank credit proxy in October reflected
relatively strong loan demands from businesses and reduced though
continued fairly sizable investments in municipal securities. These
asset additions have been financed by somewhat larger inflows of time
deposits and private demand deposits than projected in the previous
Blue book. However, these inflows have been partly offset by lesser
availability of U.S. Government deposits than projected, while there
was a small net drain of funds, on average, through Euro-dollar deposits.
(6) The growth in total time and savings deposits in October
on average is now projected at a 17 per cent annual rate, mainly because
of larger than anticipated rise in negotiable CD's outstanding. There
was a spurt in CD issues by major money market banks in late September
and early October, when Euro-dollar borrowingswere dropping and when
business loan expansion was quite strong. Money supply growth is
estimated at around 7 per cent annual rate for the month.

deposit and reserve aggregates for several recent periods are shown

Prospective Developments
(8) Demands for bank reserves--given current money market
conditions and the economic outlook--are likely to remain on the
strong side in the weeks ahead, though perhaps showing some tapering
off from most recent experience. Banks are expected to continue to be
active buyers of municipals at close to their October rate. Business
loan demand may remain fairly substantial as economic activity, though
moderating, continues at a fairly rapid pace in the fourth quarter and
inventory accumulation remains high. However, net cash raised by the
Treasury, if any, is expected to be of less than seasonal proportions
in the period ahead.
(9) We are assuming that banks will be called upon to help
underwrite a $2.5 billion Treasury tax bill financing in the last week
of November, although the financing may be delayed until early December.
This cash financing would recoup the attrition from the holders of
November "rights" (assumed in our projections to be only around 10 per
cent) and would provide the means for paying-off holders of the December
"rights" who did not accept the current exchange offering (which could
come to 50 per cent or so of the public holdings). The $2.5 billion
tax bill assumption also allows for about a $1 billion of net new cash
to be raised by the Treasury.
(10) The bank credit proxy in November is projected to rise
in a 9-12 per cent, annual rate, range on average. This reflects large
differences in within-month patterns. The proxy is projected to be at
a much higher level in the last week of October than in the last week
of September partly because banks credited tax and loan accounts on
October 24 in payment for the tax bill financing just completed. The
level of the proxy will show little change from the end of October to
the end of November, although the average level for the month will be
significantly above the average for October. About 1 percentage point
would be added to average growth in the proxy during the month
if Euro-dollar borrowings remain, on average, at current levels.
(11) Because the next Treasury tax bill financing will not
be before late November, most of its impact will be felt in December.
Even so, growth in the bank credit proxy in December could be lower
than in November since the amount of net new cash assumed to be raised
by the Treasury is less than usual for this season of recent years.
(12) The bank credit projections for November assume
maintenance of a Federal funds rate fluctuating around 5-7/8 per cent,
new loan rates to dealers in New York centering around 6-1/2 per cent,
and member bank borrowings in a $400 - $600 million range. The recent
large fluctuations in banks' excess reserves make it difficult to
project the net reserve position of banks consistent with the above
conditions. But assuming excess reserves fluctuate around the average
of the past few weeks, net borrowed reserves could move within a
$100 to $400 million range.
(13) During November, and into the first half of December,
the bill rate usually rises for seasonal reasons in the order of 10
to 15 basis points, despite seasonal System reserve supplying operations.
This rise could be intensified if it turns out that the Treasury does
need any significant amounts of net new cash, if current hopes for
peace negotiations are disappointed,or if further strong economic news
is reported. On the other hand, a successful outcome to current peace
negotiations would likely be accompanied by downward pressures on both
short- and long-term rates over the near-term. And a good market
reception of the current "rights" offering could also increase demands
for bills as holders of the maturing issues sell them in the market and
re-invest the proceeds in bills. Given the uncertainties influencing
market attitudes, the 3-month bill rate might be in a 5.25 - 5.60 per
cent range over the weeks ahead.
(14) In November, banks' time and savings deposits are
expected to rise in a 12-14 per cent, annual rate, range. Growth in
outstanding CD's is likely to be slower than the unusually rapid
October pace. Private demand deposits are expected to continue rising,
and money supply may grow in a 7-9 per cent,annual rate, range. This
projected growth mainly reflects continued transactions needs and credit
demands, as only a small decline, on average, in U.S. Government deposits
is anticipated.
(15) "Even keel" considerations appear to be involved over
the greater part of the interval between this and the next meeting of
the Committee on November 26. While the specification in paragraph (12)
would be consistent with an "even keel" posture, it remains possible
that a rise in the 3-month bill rate toward the upper end of the range
in paragraph (13) might be construed by the market as reflecting a
shift in the attitude of the monetary authorities. However, if such a
rise did not occur until toward the end of the period, it would be at
a time when "even keel" considerations would be less constraining.
