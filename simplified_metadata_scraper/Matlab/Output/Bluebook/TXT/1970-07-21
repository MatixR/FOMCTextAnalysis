tilting) and lightly cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other 
blemishes caused after initial printing).

MONETARY AGGREGATES AND
MONEY MARKET CONDITIONS
Recent developments
(1) Pressures have moderated considerably in a number of
financial markets since the last meeting of the Committee. In long-
term credit markets, yields on newly-issued corporate bonds, State
and local securities, and U.S. Treasury bond yields have declined by
about 40-70 basis points. Most recently, however, there have been
some signs of hesitation in this bond market rally. Also, investors
are behaving quite selectively in regard to the quality of bond issues,
and spreads between the highest rated and lower rated issues have
(2) In short-term markets, Treasury bill rates have dropped
below levels prevailing in the first three weeks of June. The 3-month
bill has generally fluctuated around 6-1/2 per cent since the last
Committee meeting, but was most recently quoted at 6.40 per cent.
Commercial paper rates, on the other hand, have tended to edge upwards,
reflecting the fall-off of investor confidence in some large paper
issuers. There was, more notably, a diminished availability of credit
in this market, with outstanding nonbank-related paper declining by
over $2 billion, or considerably more than seasonally, in the week
ending July 1 and showing only a very minor recovery in the ensuing
week. Much of the liquidation of outstanding commercial paper was
financed out of bank loans. At all weekly reporting banks, in the two
weeks ending July 8 loans rose by $2.5 billion (all of this increase
occurred in the week ending July 1 and was concentrated in loans to
finance companies and businesses), and the volume of large-denomination
CD's expanded by $2.2 billion, mainly in the 30-89 day maturity area for
which rate ceilings have been suspended. Credit availability in the
commercial paper market appears to have improved in recent days; in
general, banks have demonstrated that they are willing to stand behind
commercial paper borrowers, by actually extending credit and by granting
additional bank lines. However, the practice of differential pricing
is spreading, and investors continue to be selective. Thus further net
attrition remains possible, though it probably will not be of end-of-
June dimensions.
(3) With the need for bank financing enlarged by the actual
and potential attrition of commercial paper, bank deposits grew more
rapidly than earlier projected in the two statement weeks ending July 8,
mainly as a result of a faster-than-expected rise in CD's. While
money supply and private demand deposit growth in late June and early
July was also substantially faster than anticipated, partial data
suggest that the rate of growth subsided in the statement week just
past and that the outstanding money supply in that week may be back
to the level projected at the time of the last FOMC meeting.
The churning associated with commercial paper market uncertainties
may have been partly responsible for the apparently temporary bulge
in the money supply; also there was a larger-than-seasonal drop in
overnight Euro-dollar borrowings by U.S. commercial banks (which
affected "cash items") around the end of the fiscal year. Reflecting
these various influences, rates of increase for the money supply and
bank credit in July are now projected to be considerably above those
contemplated on the assumption of unchanged money market conditions at
the time of the last FOMC meeting--even though the faster-than-expected
rise in time deposits has been partially offset by a decline in use of
non-deposit sources of funds.

(4) The recent moderation of overall financial pressures was
facilitated not only by expansion of bank credit but also by a related
reduction in the Federal funds rate to a weekly average level around
lllll IF
ending July 15, however, the Federal funds rate backed up to a 7-1/2 to
during that week to keep it from moving even higher. During the two
weeks ending on July 1, the lower level of the Federal funds rate was
accompanied by net borrowed reserves that averaged around $940 million.
During the two weeks ending July 15, however, member bank borrowing
increased by $550 million to an average of $1.5 billion, with borrowings
highest in the most recent statement week; and net borrowed reserves
increased by around $600 million to $1.4 billion. The rise in borrowings
was related chiefly to emergency discount window accommodation of
banks lending to previous issuers of commercial paper; reports
indicate that average bank borrowings of about $400 million were for
such purposes during the past two statement weeks. Because of this
special discount window assistance, there was no additional pressure
on the Federal funds rate in the initial days as borrowings built up.
But as borrowings were sustained at a high and rising level, pressures
on the Federal funds rate did increase, although the funds rate has
remained low relative to the level of member bank borrowings as com-
pared with experience earlier in the year.

Prospective developments
(6) Of the three financial markets which were of concern to
the Committee in its last two meetings--the stock, bond, and commercial
paper markets--pressures have abated on the first two but problems
remain in the commercial paper market. In view of the continued
pressure on profits and on liquidity in some areas, difficulties could
arise in credit markets which cannot be foreseen at the moment--for
example, if a large industrial or financial concern were to be forced
into bankruptcy. Thus, it would appear reasonable for the FOMC to con-
tinue to show some concern for the possible emergence of undue pressures
on financial markets, although conditions at the moment do not seem to
necessitate the degree of concern shown in the last two FOMC directives.
In general, during the past few weeks, credit market conditions appear
to have improved enough for the FOMC, if it wishes, to return to the
type of emphasis on monetary aggregates that was contained in the
directives issued in March and April.
(7) Of the two alternatives shown below for the second
paragraph, alternative A calls for continuing the same degree of con-
cern with financial markets as the previous two directives. Alterna-
tive B calls for giving more emphasis to monetary aggregates in day-
to-day open market operations, while providing for modifications in
case excessive pressures on financial markets develop. Both directives
take account of the forthcoming Treasury refunding, to be announced on
July 29, of $5-1/2 billion of publicly-held coupon issues maturing
August 15.
Alternative A
"To implement this policy, in view of persisting market
uncertainties and [DEL: liquidity strains] TAKING ACCOUNT OF THE
FORTHCOMING TREASURY FINANCING, open market operations until
the next meeting of the Committee shall continue to be con-
ducted with a view to moderating pressures on financial
markets. To the extent compatible therewith, the bank
reserves and money market conditions maintained shall be
consistent with the Committee's longer-run objective of
moderate growth in money and bank credit, ALLOWING FOR taking
[DEL: account of the Board's regulatory action affective June-24
and some] A possible CONTINUED [DEL: consequent] shifting of credit
flows from market to banking channels."
Alternative B
"To implement this policy, [DEL: in view of persisting market
uncertainties and liquidity strains;] THE COMMITTEE SEEKS TO
PROMOTE MODERATE GROWTH IN MONEY AND BANK CREDIT OVER THE
MONTHS AHEAD, ALLOWING FOR A POSSIBLE CONTINUED SHIFT OF CREDIT
FLOWS FROM MARKET TO BANKING CHANNELS. SYSTEM open market
operations until the next meeting of the Committee shall een-
tinue-to be conducted with a view to [DEL: moderating pressures on
financial markets. To the extent compatible therewith; the]
MAINTAINING bank reserves and money market conditions [DEL:maintained
shall be consistent with THAT the committee's longer run objective],
of moderate growth in money and bank credit;] taking account of
the FORTHCOMING TREASURY FINANCING; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT
OPERATIONS SHALL BE MODIFIED AS NEEDED TO COUNTER EXCESSIVE
PRESSURES IN FINANCIAL MARKETS, SHOULD THEY DEVELOP [DEL: Board'
regulatory action effective June 24 and some possible conse-
quent shifting of credi flows from markets to banking channels."]
(8) Only one set of interrelationships among monetary
aggregates, money market conditions, and interest rates more broadly
is discussed in the analysis that follows. This set can be considered
as consistent with either alternative A or B since, so far as the staff
can judge now, money market conditions similar to those recently pre-
vailing might be accompanied by a moderate growth in the money supply
and no strong upward pressure on interest rates. The maintenance of
money market conditions on a fairly even plane will need to condition
open market operations in any event in view of the large Treasury
financing that will be in the market during much of the inter-meeting
period. The practical difference between the two alternatives would
be in reactions of the Desk to misses in the aggregates. Under
alternative B, the Desk would be freer to react--though equally
subject to "even-keel" considerations as in alternative A--should the
aggregates be deviating from the indicated path, or from whatever
modification of it the Committee may wish to make.
(9) The table below shows a growth path for monetary
aggregates in which the money supply grows at a 5 per cent annual
rate over the course of the third quarter and the adjusted bank credit
proxy at a 14 per cent annual rate.

Months Levels of Change Levels of Change Levels of Change
(10) The relatively rapid expansion in the adjusted bank credit
proxy reflects continued sizable growth in large CD's, and hence in time
deposits as a whole. Time deposits are expected to rise at about a 30 per
cent annual rate in July, but the rate of expansion should slow down as
banks work through their initial adjustment to the increased availability
of short-term CD's and as the need for additional financing of commercial
paper market attrition subsides. Banks are expected to continue to
receive fairly sizable net inflows of other time and savings deposits, if
their good experience during the recent midyear interest crediting period
is any guide. Over the quarter as a whole total time and savings deposits
are expected to rise at a 25 per cent annual rate, but such deposits
other than large CD's may rise at only about half that pace, which would be
just a little more rapidly than in the second quarter. It is expected
that banks will substitute some of these expanded time deposits flows for
non-deposit sources, thus probably resulting in at least some small net
pay-down. This contributes to the considerably slower rate of growth
for the credit proxy than for time deposits over the quarter.
(11) Money supply growth is likely to taper off in the period
ahead as financial markets remain generally calm and as U.S. Government
deposits rise. The annual rate of increase in August and September is
expected to drop to around 2 per cent, reflecting in part some further
adjustment in cash balances following the recent midyear surge.
(12) A weekly path for the monetary aggregates consistent with
the monthly figures is shown below (daily average levels, seas. adj. in
billions of dollars):
Week ending Adjusted Credit Proxy Money Supply Total Reserves
e/ Partly estimated.
(13) In the period ahead money market conditions are likely
to encompass a Federal funds rate generally in fairly wide 7-1/4--7-3/4
per cent range. Increased day-to-day financing demands associated with
the forthcoming Treasury refunding, and with the most recent Treasury tax
bill financing, will exert upward pressure on the funds rate. It is
difficult at this point to predict bank demands for borrowings--and
therefore pressures on the Federal funds market associated with any given
level of borrowings--in view of uncertainties afflicting the commercial
paper market, but we would expect some diminution of borrowing demands
from recent levels. Member bank borrowings may move back closer to $1
billion, on average, with the Federal funds rate in the range noted
above. Net borrowed reserves are likely to fluctuate around $900 million.
(14) The 3-month Treasury bill rate may be in a 6-1/4--6-5/8
per cent range over the next four weeks. Over the short-run, the bill
rate could be on the low side as a result of technical factors. Dealer
bill positions are not large and are relatively low in short bills. In
addition, there could be an enlarged demand for bills from holders of
maturing Treasury securities who do not opt for the exchange. On the
other hand, the Treasury is likely to need about $4 billion of new cash
by late August or early September, some of which might be raised in
the bill area, and some of which could be raised in connection with the
August refunding. Moreover, if, as suggested in paragraph (9), growth
in money and bank deposits slows as the summer progresses; this may
lead to diminished demand for bills. However, should GNP turn out to
be weaker than projected for the third quarter, bill rates could remain
on the low side in reflection of reduced credit demands from other
sectors of the economy.
(15) Over the longer run--between now and early next year--we
would expect bond yields to decline significantly further as the rate of
inflation moderates. In the period immediately ahead, though, such
interest rates could level off or even rise a bit, in a technical reaction
to the large recent yield declines and as the volume of new corporate
and State and local Government securities coming to market remains
large in a period when the Treasury is engaged in a sizable refunding.
However, if loan demands on banks were to weaken over the next few
weeks, banks may be in a position to place more of their funds in
securities, which could help both the Government and municipal market
and lead to an improved tone for corporate offerings.
