preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned 
versions text-searchable.2   Though a stringent quality assurance process was 
employed, some imperfections may remain.

format.  All scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced 
tilting) and lightly cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other 
blemishes caused after initial printing).

first created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, 
staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.  Please note that the numbers and text in charts and

MONEY MARKET AND RESERVE RELATIONSHIPS
Recent developments
During the past four weeks money market conditions have
eased further, including declines in key short-term interest rates.
Intermediate and long-term bondyields, however, have risen considerably.
The reduction in discount rates on April 7 from 4 to 4 per cent had
its most immediate impact, as expected, on Federal funds and dealer
loan rates, on CD offering rates, and on Treasury bill yields. Since
the discount rate cut, Federal funds have averaged close to 4 per cent
and have often traded somewhat below the discount rate. Rates on new
dealer loans in New York have moved down into a 4-1/8 - 4 per cent
In the bill market, the 3-month Treasury bill has declined
about 20 basis points to around 3.75 per cent from its level just
before the discount rate was cut. Longer-term bill rates have
registered smaller declines, and are currently 10 - 15 basis points
above the 3-month bill rate. This follows a sustained period when
longer-term bill rates were below or about equal to the 3-month
bill rate. The changes that have occurred within the structure of
bill rates are indicative of the shift in market attitudes away from
expectations of further rate declines toward a feeling that, with the
discount rate reduction accomplished and with business news appearing
more optimistic, rates may have eased about as much as is likely over
the near term.

CONFIDENTIAL (FR) -2- April 28, 1967.
Such a shift in market attitudes, in conjunction with the
continued large corporate calendar and the sizable U.S. Government
financing program, has had a pronounced influence on long-term markets.
Yields on new high grade corporate bonds and long-term U.S. Government
securities have risen 15 - 25 basis points since the discount rate was
cut. Yields on State and local government issues have also risen, and
dealer inventories of such securities have increased.
Banks have reduced rates on large denomination CD's in
line with reductions in other short-term rates, and outstanding CD's
have declined by almost $600 million over the tax period (measured
by the three weeks ending April 19). This decline is more than we
had expected; it apparently reflects a deliberate policy of banks
in light of continued rapid increases in other time and savings
deposits, the ready availability of Federal funds at reduced rates,
and the prospect of reduced loan demand following the mid-April tax
borrowing. On average in April, total time and savings deposits rose
at a 14.5 per cent annual rate accounting for the bulk of the 13.5
per cent rise in the bank credit proxy. (The rise would be about 1
percentage points less after including a decline on average in Euro-
dollar borrowings.)
Bank credit expansion moderated in the course of April.
From the week ending March 29 to the week ending April 26, the proxy
rose at a 9.5 per cent annual rate; bank credit outstanding is projected
to decline in the current statement week ending May 3 as U.S. Government
deposits begin to decline sharply.
CONFIDENTIAL (FR) -3- April 28, 1967.
U.S. Government deposits rose in April about in line with
earlier expectations and contributed to a 6 per cent annual rate of
decline in private demand deposits on average (and a 5 per cent rate
of decline in the money supply). The decline in such private deposits
was slightly greater than projected, as loan demands around the tax
period were relatively moderate despite the large accelerated tax
In general, money markets and banks accommodated tax
period churning with relative ease. This may have reflected not
only the availability and lower cost of reserves to banks but also
probably the partial use of capital market proceeds to finance tax
Nonborrowed reserves on average in April increased at a
was a decline in bank excess reserves, as the effects of the March
reserve requirement reductions apparently worked themselves through.
Member bank borrowings also declined in April, and the increase in
total reserves was even less than for nonborrowed on average during
the month.
During the past four weeks, free reserves averaged $210
million and borrowings averaged $150 million. During the previous
four weeks, free reserves had averaged $218 million and borrowings
$203 million.
CONFIDENTIAL (FR) -4- April 28, 1967.
Prospective developments
Maintenance of prevailing money market conditions over the
next three weeks would involve a Federal funds rate averaging 4 per
cent or a shade below and a 3-month bill rate fluctuating generally
in a 3.65 - 3.85 per cent range. Member bank borrowings are likely
to be in the $100 - $200 million area. Free reserves could vary
more widely, perhaps in a $150 to $300 million range, depending in
part on bank reserve management policies, on dealer financing needs
and reinvestment flows associated with the Treasury refunding, and the
need to maintain an "even keel" monetary posture.
Books will be open for the current Treasury refunding and
pre-refunding operation from May 1 through May 3, with settlement
date on May 15. The issues were attractively priced but, as of this
writing, their ultimate market reception is uncertain.
The yield outlook is even more uncertain in other capital
markets. Some observers are beginning to conclude that the recent
rise in long-term rates has been overdone, and that a minor bond
market rally is a possibility. But others point to the continuing
large supply of corporate, municipal, and Federal agency issues in
the market or in prospect and to expected large Treasury financing
in the second half and see the odds favoring some further yield rise.
On balance, it would seem that maintenance of prevailing money market
conditions could permit--but not ensure--a rally in the bond market.
Such a development would be less likely if the financing calendar were
CONFIDENTIAL (FR)
to expand further, or if money market conditions were permitted to
drift toward the tight end of the ranges specified above.
With an even keel maintained in the money market, growth
in nonborrowed reserves is likely to slow further in May on average.
Expansion in bank credit, as measured on a daily-average basis by
the proxy, may slow to an annual rate in the 1 - 4 per
cent range. With the March-April tax period passed, net business
loan demands in May are expected to be quite moderate. Projected
needs for inventory financing are small and--given the continuing
large corporate calendar and the sharp recent uptrend in use of the
commercial paper market--bank loan repayment may rise. Needs of
Government security dealers for bank financing will largely depend
on general interest in the refunding. If bank credit expansion in
May is in the range projected, the annual rate of increase in the
proxy over the 6 month December-May period would be around 11 per
cent (and 2 percentage points less after including the decline in
Euro-dollar borrowings).
The May projections allow for a sharp reversal of the April
rise in U.S. Government deposits, only partially offset by a rise
in private demand deposits. The money supply is currently projected
to rise in May on average at an annual rate of 8 - 10 per cent, bringing
the annual rate of growth over the December-May period to around 5
per cent.
April 28, 1967.
CONFIDENTIAL(FR) -6- April 28, 1967.
Time deposits are expected to show a somewhat slower growth
rate in May, perhaps in a 10 - 13 per cent range, if commercial banks
continue to exhibit only mild interest in increasing the volume of
outstanding CD's. However, it is possible that attractive yields
emerging in securities markets and additional indications of strong
economic expansion may encourage some banks to seek additional
investible funds. The rate of growth in other time and savings
deposits may moderate, especially if consumer spending continues to
pick up.
