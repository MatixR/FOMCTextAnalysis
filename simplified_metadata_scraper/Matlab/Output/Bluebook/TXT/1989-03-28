MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES
Recent developments
(1) Monetary policy was tightened in two steps over the intermeet-
ing period. On February 14, in view of mounting evidence of inflationary
pressures, the borrowing assumption was raised to $700 million from the
$600 million level that had been continued after the February FOMC meet-
ing. Federal funds were expected to trade around 9-1/4 to 9-3/8 percent,
up from 9 to 9-1/8 percent at the time of the meeting. Although federal
funds did trade mostly in this higher range, borrowing averaged only $366
million in the maintenance period ending February 22. In association with
the increase in the discount rate to 7 percent on February 24, federal
funds moved up to average a little above 9-3/4 percent. Borrowing con-
tinued to fall short of the $700 million allowance, coming in at just $550
million for the maintenance period ending March 8. In light of these
indications of additional weakening in borrowing demands, the borrowing
assumption was reduced to $500 million in the maintenance period beginning
March 9 as a technical adjustment to make it more consistent with expected
conditions in reserve markets. In that maintenance period, which ended
March 22, adjustment plus seasonal borrowing was $422 million and the
federal funds rate averaged 9.85 percent.
(2) The tightening of policy, together with renewed concerns about
inflation and associated future policy moves, propelled other interest
rates higher across the maturity spectrum over the intermeeting period.
Increases in private short-term rates have totaled nearly 1 percentage
point, including two half-point increases in the prime rate, somewhat more
than the almost 3/4 percentage point rise in the funds rate. The addi-
tional increase in these rates followed release of the second large jump
in producer prices, which was seen as raising the odds of a further near-
term firming of policy. It may also have reflected greater supplies of
short-term paper, especially bank CDs to fund stronger bank credit and
sponsored agency obligations to meet demands for FHLB advances as thrift
deposits ran off. By contrast, Treasury bill supplies have been flat, and
with substantial retail demand for these instruments through noncompeti-
tive tenders, bill rates rose only about half a percentage point.
(3) Long-term rates rose immediately following the FOMC meeting,
when an unchanged Federal Reserve policy stance in the face of strong
economic data apparently led to renewed concerns about the possible inten-
sification of inflation, especially since the dollar weakened as well.
Further increases in long-term rates were registered as incoming price
data--both broad indexes and prices of oil and other commodities--were
interpreted as signalling an actual pickup in inflation and a need for
further policy firming. On balance, yields on Treasury bonds are 40 to 50
basis points higher over the intermeeting period. Actual and anticipated
sales of mortgages and mortgage-backed securities by thrifts may have
contributed to larger increases in yields on these instruments in both
primary and secondary markets. In the primary market, rates on fixed-rate
mortgages rose nearly 70 basis points to 11.22 percent over the intermeet-
ing period, while the spread between secondary market mortgage securities
and Treasuries widened around 15 to 35 basis points.
(4) The dollar's weighted-average foreign exchange value rose
marginally on balance over the intermeeting period. The dollar weakened
early in the period, given the restrained response of the Federal Reserve
to incoming economic and price data and in view of expected further
monetary tightening by foreign central banks, especially the Bundesbank.
Market perceptions reversed and the dollar strengthened substantially,
however, shortly after the Federal Reserve's discount rate increase and
amid clear signals from the Bundesbank and other central banks that they
would not raise rates in the near term. As the dollar moved back toward
its earlier peak against the Deutschmark, the Desk sold
$650 million for marks.
(5) After considerable weakness in January, growth of M2 and M3
strengthened in February and is estimated to have picked up further in
March. Still, expansion of the aggregates so far this year has remained
subdued, reflecting high opportunity costs and probably also the problems
of the thrift industry. M2 growth of 1-1/2 percent since December is
slightly slower than the 2 percent specification of the Committee, which,
however, did not embody the policy tightening that occurred. Growth of M3
for the December-to-March period at a 3-3/4 percent rate is in line with
the Committee's expectations for this interval. The levels of M2 and M3
in March are estimated to be a little below and a little above the lower
bounds of their respective annual growth cones.
(6) Within M2, liquid deposits have remained quite weak--M1 was
about unchanged over February and March--and small time deposits rela-
tively strong. Offering rates on retail time deposits have moved up sub-
stantially, but remain unusually low relative to Treasury yields, espe-
cially at thrifts. Deposits at thrift institutions with FSLIC insurance
have continued to decline, though outflows in late February and early
March may have abated from earlier in the quarter. While most of these
funds seem to have remained within M2, the thrift situation still appears
to have depressed growth of this aggregate in the first quarter. Some
apprehensive depositors seem to have opted for market instruments, and
regulatory pressures on deposit rates at thrifts have held down offering
rates more generally and widened the opportunity cost of holding M2
assets. Thrift behavior may also have affected M3. S&Ls have substituted
non-M3 sources--FHLB advances--for deposits and probably have restrained
credit expansion; S&L assets declined in January, the latest month for
which data are available. On the other hand, the expansion of M3 over the
past two months has been supported by the strong reliance of commercial
banks on managed liabilities, particularly large time deposits, to fund
increased lending. Bank credit growth was spurred in February by
borrowing used to retire shares in RJR Nabisco.
(7) Even abstracting from the RJR Nabisco deal, business borrowing
has shown renewed vigor in February and March. Concerns about event risk
and the higher level of interest rates have pushed these demands into

NOTE: Monthly reserve measures, including excess reserves and borrowing, are calcu-

months. The March figures assume an average level of adjustment plus seasonal borrow-
ing of $500 million and excess reserves of $950 million for the maintenance period
ending April 6. Reserve data incorporate adjustments for discontinuities associated
with changes in reserve requirements.
shorter-term areas: both bank lending and commercial paper issuance net
of merger effects picked up in February, and at least for commercial
paper, this strength has continued into March. In addition, recent weeks
have seen a flurry of new investment-grade industrial bonds concentrated
in short maturities, often of one year. Mortgage lending has strengthened
somewhat from late 1988, and consumer borrowing has held steady. With
government borrowing also picking up in February, overall domestic non-
financial debt accelerated that month, lifting this aggregate to the mid-
point of its range.
Policy alternatives
(8) Three alternatives are presented below for Committee consider-
ation. Alternative B maintains the current degree of reserve market pres-
sure, with federal funds trading around 9-3/4 percent or slightly higher
in association with adjustment plus seasonal borrowing of $500 million.
Alternative A entails federal funds around 9-1/4 percent and borrowing of
$300 million, and alternative C involves funds around 10-1/4 percent and
borrowing of $700 million. These relationships assume that the heightened
reluctance of banks to tap the discount window of recent weeks will per-
sist over the intermeeting period. Uncertainties about the relationship
between borrowing and the spread of the funds rate over the discount rate
suggest a continued flexible approach to the borrowing objective in open
market operations. Even with this approach, funds could temporarily trade
above expected levels in coming days should significant quarter-end
pressures emerge and again in the latter half of April should individual
income tax payments prove to be larger than anticipated, leading to a
sharper advance in required reserves and a larger drain in bank reserves.
(9) Projections of growth in the monetary aggregates for March to
June are presented below for the three alternatives, together with implied
growth from the fourth-quarter base to June. (Detailed data are pre-
sented on the table and charts on the following pages.) Under all three
alternatives, monetary growth would remain subdued, largely reflecting
recent increases in market interest rates and slow adjustment of offering
rates on liquid accounts. In addition, the thrift situation is expected
to depress growth of the broader aggregates in the second quarter, though
to a lesser extent than in the first quarter. The reduced impact should
result from a tendency for the most concerned depositors to flee first,
and assumes no new information that would exacerbate depositors' fears,
such as a Congressional stalemate on the proposed legislation. It also
assumes no greater regulatory pressure on thrift deposit offering rates;
changes in the average own rate on M2 components are likely to respond in
more typical ways to changes in market rates, although the level of oppor-
tunity costs should remain unusually wide. M2 growth rates under the
alternatives are a bit lower than would be suggested by various models of
money demand given the staff GNP forecast. At the M3 level, further sub-
stitutions of FHLB advances for deposits and restraint on asset growth at
thrifts are expected to have a continuing but diminishing effect on
However, M2 and M3 growth is expected to be depressed slightly in
May by a transfer of the government securities trading operation of a
major bank dealer, with associated RP financing, to a nonbank affiliate.
RP liabilities of nonbank dealers are not included in the definition of
the money aggregates.

(10) The existing structure of interest rates appears to incor-
porate some expectation that monetary policy may be a little firmer in the
near term than is assumed under alternative B. As a consequence, with
federal funds continuing around 9-3/4 percent or even a little above under
alternative B, money market rates might tend to decline a bit. Three-
month Treasury bills at the current level of 9 percent would seem appro-
priately priced in relation to the prevailing federal funds rate under
usual supply and demand conditions; but if strong retail demands continue,
these rates also might edge lower, especially once the early-April cash
management bill is absorbed. The dollar might come under some downward
pressure as short-term rates softened and the prospects for further near-
term monetary tightening in the United States were reassessed. Given
recent mixed signals about the strength of the expansion, bond markets are

likely to be especially sensitive to incoming information about devel-
opments in the economy. Should the incoming data point more clearly to
continued strength in the economy and prices, consistent with the
greenbook forecast, bond yields would be unlikely to fall with an
unchanged System policy stance and could even move higher.
(11) Growth in M2 under alternative B, at 3 percent from March to
June, would be stronger on average than over the first three months of
this year. As discussed above, deposit weakness at thrifts is expected to
continue, but to abate. In addition, with short-term market rates moving
a bit below current levels and rates on deposits edging higher in response
to previous increases in market rates, opportunity costs would be narrow-
ing, rather than rising as in recent months. Even so, the lagged effects
of earlier substantial increases in opportunity costs would continue to
restrain M2 growth and result in a 4-1/2 percent increase in its velocity
in the second quarter, somewhat faster than in the second half of 1988.
M1 would continue about flat over the March-to-June period as outflows of
transactions deposits about match growth in currency; consequently, its
velocity would increase at around the projected 7-3/4 percent increase in
nominal GNP.
(12)- M3 is projected to grow at a 5 percent annual rate over the
March-to-June period under alternative B, somewhat faster than from
December to March. Commercial banks are expected to continue issuing
substantial amounts of large CDs to fund still strong merger-related loan
demands. At thrifts, even if asset growth doesn't pick up, M3 could still
be boosted relative to earlier this year as less weakness in retail
deposits is reflected in reduced reliance on FHLB advances. Contributing
to the pickup in M3 growth would be a resumption of inflows to institu-
tion-only money funds as their returns catch up to market rates. On a
quarterly average basis, M3 would grow at a 5 percent rate, implying an
increase of 2-1/2 percent in its velocity.
(13) In credit markets, the smaller role of thrifts in acquiring
and perhaps even originating mortgage loans is not expected to have a
material impact on overall mortgage debt growth, which is projected to
taper off only a little in the second quarter in response to the recent
climb in mortgage rates. Business borrowing should diminish as corporate
restructuring activity and associated borrowing to finance share retire-
ments fall off somewhat from the record first-quarter pace. Reflecting
elevated bond rates and investor concern about event risk, firms are
likely to continue to focus their credit demands on bank loans and
shorter-term paper. Aggregate growth in the debt of nonfinancial sectors
is projected at an 8 percent annual rate over the second quarter, bringing
expansion through June to around the middle of its 6-1/2 to 10-1/2 percent
annual monitoring range.
(14) The extent of immediate policy tightening embodied in alter-
native C is more than currently seems to be built into market interest
rates. In response to the federal funds rate moving into the 10-1/4 per-
cent area, other short-term market rates would be expected to rise some-
what less; the prime rate would be hiked again, probably by 1/2 percentage
point. The dollar would be expected to firm. Bond rates are likely to
increase under this alternative, but the extent of any rise might be
limited, and over time yields could drop back, if market participants saw
the tightening action as reducing the risks of greater inflation and
raising the odds on an appreciable moderation in economic growth. With
the further rise in market rates, M2 would expand at a 2 percent annual
rate over the March-to-June period under alternative C, only a bit faster
than the December-to-March pace. Growth at this rate would place this
aggregate noticeably below its 3 to 7 percent growth cone by June. Higher
market rates along with the lagged adjustment of offering rates on M3
type-money market mutual funds would weaken inflows to such funds. M3
expansion, at 4-1/2 percent over the March-to-June period, while picking
up some from the sluggish rate of recent months, would remain in the lower
portion of its long-run range.
(15) With the lower money market rates of alternative A, M2 growth
would strengthen to a 4 percent pace, lifting it above the lower bound of
its growth cone by June. M3 would move more into the middle portion of
its range. The decline in other short-term market rates might be less
than the one-half point drop in the federal funds rate, depending on per-
ceptions of the sustainability of the policy easing. The dollar could
fall substantially. Investors are likely to be confounded by this
policy action, which would be seen as reversing the thrust of policy over
the past year. Unless subsequent data suggested substantial weakness in
the economy and price pressures, inflation expectations and bond yields
ultimately could rise under this alternative.
Directive language
(16) Draft language for the operational paragraph, including
the usual options and updating, is shown below.
OPERATIONAL PARAGRAPH
In the implementation of policy for the immediate future, the
Committee seeks to DECREASE SOMEWHAT/maintain/INCREASE SOMEWHAT
the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions. Taking
account of indications of inflationary pressures, the strength
of the business expansion, the behavior of the monetary aggre-
gates, and developments in foreign exchange and domestic
financial markets, somewhat (SLIGHTLY) greater reserve restraint
would (MIGHT), or (SOMEWHAT) slightly lesser reserve restraint
(WOULD) might, be acceptable in the intermeeting period. The
contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be consistent
with growth of M2 and M3 over the period from December through
March THROUGH JUNE at annual rates of about ____ [DEL: 2] and ____ [DEL: 3-1/2]
percent, respectively. The Chairman may call for Committee
consultation if it appears to the Manager for Domestic Oper-
ations that reserve conditions during the period before the next
meeting are likely to be associated with a federal funds rate
persistently outside a range of ____ TO ____ [DEL: 7 to 11] percent.
