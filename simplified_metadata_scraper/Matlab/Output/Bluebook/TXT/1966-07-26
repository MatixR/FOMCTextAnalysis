of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was created 
through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned 
versions text-searchable.2   Though a stringent quality assurance process was 
employed, some imperfections may remain.

format.  All scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced 
tilting) and lightly cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other 
blemishes caused after initial printing).

first created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, 
staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.  Please note that the numbers and text in charts and 
tables were not reliably recognized by the OCR process and were not checked or corrected by staff.

MONEY MARKET AND RESERVE RELATIONSHIPS
Money markets
Recent developments. Money markets tightened further during
recent weeks. Yields on commercial paper, finance company paper, bankers'
acceptances, and Federal Agency issues continued to rise. Dealer loan
rates posted by major New York City banks reached a new high of 6-1/2 per
cent, as these banks developed large basic reserve deficiencies and were
heavy buyers of Federal funds at rates ranging up to a high of 5-3/4
per cent.
In this environment and partly in anticipation of a discount
rate hike, Treasury bill rates moved sharply higher to levels somewhat
more in line with other short-term rates. The 3-month bill was auctioned
at almost 5 per cent on July 18, although it subsequently fell back to
around 4.85 per cent. At that level, the 3-month bill had risen about
luctance to position bills at a time when financing costs were extremely
high and when bill demand from the public had moderated was the principal
cause of the rate increase.
During the past few days, the System has sold bills, partly to
offset the effect on float of the airlines strike. But the interest rate
impact of sales was reduced through the use of matched sale-purchase
transactions. A total of $1.8 billion of such transactions was made be-
tween July 13 and July 22. But each of these transactions was only out-
standing for a few days so the bulk were in effect rollovers. In the

July 13-22 period, in addition, outright sales of bills to the market
amounted to about $300 million.
Net borrowed reserves have fluctuated sharply in recent weeks,
with a low of $93 million in the week of July 13 and a high of $479
million (before revision) in the week just past. The initial impact of
the airlines strike was felt in the July 13 week, and in addition the
second week of July has traditionally been a period of very large
country bank excess reserves. Member bank borrowings have averaged
almost $760 million so far in July.
Prospective developments. Assuming net borrowed reserves in
a $400 - $500 million range over the next four weeks, the money market
is likely to remain generally tight, although over the near-term some
rates may tend to decline. Major New York City banks are likely to have
a more comfortable reserve position as pressures related to recent tax
payments finally subside. As a result, dealer loan rates in New York
may be somewhat below recent peaks, though remaining at penalty levels.
This assumes that banks do not experience further difficulties in re-
placing maturing CD's over the near-term. The 3-month Treasury bill
rate may also decline some in the immediate future, given the continuing
relatively limited market supply, the need for System purchases of about
$1.5 billion during the first half of August (on the basis of current
projections), and prospective public demands for bills generated by the
August refunding and by large corporate security flotations in the weeks
CONFIDENTIAL (FR) -3- July 22, 1966
As the summer progresses, however, bill rates are likely to
move higher. Corporate demand for bills tends to diminish in the latter
part of summer, partly in consequence of the reduced cash flow during
the auto change-over period. Also, the Treasury will probably be
announcing a financing to raise new cash during the second week of August
and may obtain $2 - $3 billion of funds through tax bills. It will
probably raise additional cash in early fall.
The bill rate may fluctuate widely with shifting demands and
supplies over the period ahead as dealers continue to maintain relatively
low positions in view of their relatively high borrowing costs. The
and might rise back toward 5 per cent before the end of August.
Long-term credit markets probably will remain tight over the
weeks ahead, with interest rates showing a tendency to rise. The cor-
porate calendar is sizable in August, dominated by two large offerings.
Bank participation in the municipal market has diminished. And the
Treasury may offer an attractive coupon in its August refunding, to be
announced July 27, which may encourage some switching out of bonds.
The public holds $3.2 billion of the maturing Treasury issues.
The reception that would be accorded the new offerings--whatever they
may be--is quite uncertain in the current market atmosphere. This sug-
gests the need for "even keel" at least through the August 15 settlement
date, and possibly beyond depending on the after-market.

Reserve flows, bank credit, and money
Recent developments. Bank credit expansion appears to have
been on the high side of the Staff's expected range in July. Rather
sluggish growth prior to the mid-June tax date held the rate of expansion
in June on average to below 5 per cent. The average rate of growth in
July has apparently increased to about 11.5 per cent, mainly because
growth was rapid in the three weeks ending July 6. Part of the enlarged
credit expansion reflects banks' success in obtaining time deposits.
After rising moderately in June, time deposits grew more rapidly in July,
as banks apparently received funds transferred out of other savings
Fluctuations in bank credit and in Government and private de-
mand deposits during June and July were unusually large because of the
impact of the accelerated payments by corporations of their income taxes
and of withheld individual income and social security taxes. While show-
ing wide weekly fluctuations, private demand deposits rose sharply on
average in June when Government deposits declined, and then declined
almost as sharply in July when Government deposits rose. Over the two
months combined, private demand deposits rose at just under a 2 per cent
seasonally adjusted annual rate.
Total reserves, which had declined following their April bulge,
are now expected to rise by about 12 per cent on average in July. Re-
quired reserves are expected to grow by about 10 per cent. (Both of these
aggregate reserve increases are after taking out the rise due to the in-
crease in the legal requirement against time deposits.) The difference
between the increases in total and required reserves represents unusual
CONFIDENTIAL (FR) -5- July 22, 1966
additions to excess reserves occasioned mainly by the airlines strike.
Nonborrowed reserves in July increased somewhat more slowly than either
of the other reserve aggregates.
Prospective developments. Bank credit declined in the middle
weeks of July as some of the earlier borrowing was repaid and as banks
made adjustments to the reserve requirement increase. Expansion is
likely to resume in the weeks ahead, but the growth rate for August on
average may be fairly low--perhaps in a 4 - 6 per cent range, assuming
only a relatively small attrition in the refunding. The expansion is
likely to be more toward the upper end of the range on the assumption
of payment for a Treasury tax bill financing through tax and loan credit
toward the end of August.
Time deposits are expected to grow less rapidly in August than
in July, partly because of the ending of transfers out of savings insti-
tutions after the mid-year interest crediting period. On the other hand,
demand deposit (and money supply) growth is expected to be resumed.
Government deposits are likely to decline somewhat in August, partly be-
cause of the absence of receipts from withheld income and social security
taxes that had been accelerated to June and July. Although the money
supply is declining substantially in July, it is likely to rise over the
next few months at a rate somewhat higher than the almost 4-1/2 per
cent increase of the first half of the year.
CONFIDENTIAL (FR) -6- July 22, 1966
Only a small growth in required reserves is likely to accompany
the August bank credit and monetary expansion. Demand deposits in total
may show little change because of offsetting movements of Government and
private deposits. As a result, the rise in required reserves would
reflect mainly expansion in time deposits. Total reserves could decline
slightly in August, assuming the ending of the airline strike which
would bring excess reserves back to more normal levels. The projected
movement of total and required reserves assumes net borrowed reserves
of around $400 - $500 million and borrowing around $800 million.
