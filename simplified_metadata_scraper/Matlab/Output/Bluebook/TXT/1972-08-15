Recent developments
(1) Reserves available to support private non-bank deposits now
appear to be growing at about a 6.5 per cent annual rate over the July-August
target period, at the upper end of the 3-7 per cent annual rate range desired
by the Committee. Over the past two weeks it had appeared that RPD growth
was running slightly above the target range, but various technical revisions
as well as lower than projected excess reserves in the week just ended
reduced the RPD level somewhat.
(2) During most of the interval since the previous Committee
meeting, the Federal funds rate averaged around 4-1/2 per cent, down slightly
from the 4-5/8 per cent level that had prevailed briefly early in July.
With RPD growth appearing to be on the high side of the target range and
M1 expanding substantially more than projected, however, the Desk began to
hold back on its reserve supplying operations, forcing banks to meet a larger
share of their reserve needs through borrowing at the discount window. This
edged the funds rate back to the 4-5/8 per cent level. Since the large-scale
Treasury refunding was in progress at the time, the Desk felt constrained by
even-keel considerations from putting pressure on the funds rate much beyond
that point. Most recently, although dealer inventories of the new refunding
issues are still large, the favorable general performance of securities
markets has made it possible for the Desk to press a little harder on reserves,
and the funds rate has moved up to about 4-3/4 per cent.
(3) The early July bulge in private demand deposits evident at
the time of the last Committee meeting receded somewhat over the latter part
of the month, but this drop-off was significantly smaller than expected.
As a result, M1 rose at a 15 per cent annual rate during the month, even
faster than the 10.4 per cent rate estimated for the policy alternative
approved at the last meeting. 1/ Data for the first two weeks of August
indicated that M1 is continuing to exceed levels thought likely a month ago,
although the differences are not so sharp as in July. During the second
quarter, the demand for cash balances had seemed on the low side, given the
rapid expansion of nominal GNP and the marked earlier decline of interest
rates extending into early 1972. Thus, the stronger July and August perform-
ance may be signaling a catch-up to more normal relationships between changes
in M1, interest rates, and GNP.
(4) In contrast to M1, growth of M2 was about as projected in
July, as slower than forecast growth in time deposits other than large CD's
offset the stronger advance in demand deposits. While savings inflows appear
to have strengthened a bit in early August and are tending--in combination
with demand deposits--to boost M2 a little above earlier expectations, growth
in other time and savings deposits has remained below the rapid pace set
earlier in the year.
(5) The adjusted credit proxy expanded much more in July than thought
likely at the time of the Committee meeting, and in early August it continues
to show somewhat greater strength than anticipated. The strength in private
demand deposits and a larger than projected increase in negotiable CD's
accounted for much of this overshoot, but the principal factor at work was
the failure of U. S. Treasury deposits to decline as expected from their
relatively high June level. Large foreign central bank acquisitions of
special Treasury issues and lower than estimated Federal spending accounted
for this relative stability in Treasury balances.
(6) Investors responded enthusiastically to the Treasury's August
refunding package, and the consequent attrition of only $630 million was
readily met out of the Treasury's ample cash position. Exchange offers
accepted totaled $8.1 billion, of which $4.1 billion was in the longer
seven and twelve year options. The new issues have performed well thus far in
the after-market, although dealer holdings of these issues still totaled $910
million on August 10.
(7) Interest rates on market securities--both long and short-term--
have declined on balance during the interval between Committee meetings, in
some cases by as much as 25 basis points. Treasury bill yields have edged
up recently from the lows reached during the Treasury refunding--when holders
of "rights" not wishing to make the exchange were switching into other short-
term Treasury issues--but they are a touch below the levels prevailing at the
time of the last meeting. The 3-month bill, for example, was bid at 3.84 per
cent on Friday, down 5 basis points from the last meeting.

Prospective developments
(9) The persistent recent tendency for M1 levels to come in
higher than projected has led the staff to raise its estimates of likely
money demands in both the third and fourth quarters. While some of the
early July bulge in private demand deposits does seem to have been
transitory, continued rapid GNP expansion over the months ahead, along
with the lagged influence of the relatively stable interest rate levels
since spring, can be expected to generate sizable further growth in
money demands. Special factors that may add to money demand in the coming
quarter include the large boost in social security payments and the prospect
of a retroactive revenue sharing payment to States and localities by the
Federal government. For the third quarter, the deposit data thus far
available suggests that expansion in M1 is moving along a path that will
produce an annual growth rate of about 9 per cent. This is well above the
adopted at the last meeting, and is close to the 9-1/2 per cent expansion
rate now projected for nominal GNP.
(10) Adherence to an RPD target at this juncture that might
achieve 6-1/2 per cent M1 growth rate in the third quarter would produce
a drastic tightening in money market conditions. Moreover, money market
conditions would have to ease markedly after the third quarter in order to
keep growth in the aggregates from falling too sharply in the fourth and
first quarters. To avoid the resulting whip-sawing effect on credit
conditions, the suggested policy alternatives that follow are designed to
achieve a moderation in growth of the aggregates over a longer interval.
Since even a policy directed at slowing money growth substantially in the
fourthquarter would be likely to generate significant lagged interest
rate effects on money demands during early 1973, the staff has carried
its projection of M1 changes under the three directive alternatives
through the first quarter. Estimates this far ahead, of course, are
subject to considerable uncertainty.
(11) Patterns of monetary aggregates, RPD, and money market
conditions are summarized for the three suggested directive alternatives
in the table below, with details in the tables on the two following
pages. Alternative C would set an RPD growth path designed to slow
expansion in M1 down to a 6-1/2 per cent annual rate by the fourth quarter.
The staff's best judgment is that this RPD would be associated with a
sharply higher Federal funds rate, perhaps fluctuating around 6 per cent.
General interest rate increases resulting from such a change would be
expected to lead to further reduction in money growth to about 4-1/2
per cent rate in the first quarter of 1973. Alternative B would move
less aggressively to slow growth in the aggregates--moderating the ex-
pansion of M1 to an annual rate of 7-1/2 per cent in the fourth quarter
and 6 per cent in the first. Under this approach, the response of
interest rates would be less marked than under
Alternative C; the Federal funds rate would be expected to fluctuate
around 5-1/4 per cent, about 50 basis points above its recent level.
Alternative A would achieve the least moderation in M1 growth, and would
be associated with little change in money market conditions. Under this
alternative, M 1 would be expected to grow over the fourth and first
quarters combined at about a 7-1/2 per cent rate, the same rate as had
been specified for the third quarter under alternative A in the last
bluebook. Under all three of the policy alternatives outlined, M2 and
the bank credit proxy are expected to average close to a 9 per cent annual
rate of growth in the third quarter. Thereafter, the rate of growth in
M2 is expected to slow, as rising interest rates on market securities
become increasingly attractive to savers. Anticipated more aggressive
bank issuance of large CD's, however, would be expected to sustain the
rate of growth in the credit proxy during the fall.

(12) Under all three of the alternatives, short-term rates are
likely to be moving upward in the fourth quarter under pressure from rising
credit demands. Some of this pressure will come from business demands on
banks and the commercial paper market, but the major factor will be the
heavy anticipated Federal cash borrowing--which will undoubtedly be mainly
in short-term markets. (The period of heavy Treasury borrowing will not come
until October, but some financing may be needed in September, possibly close
to the time when the System will also be selling Treasury issues to absorb
the excess reserves released by the combined effects of changes in Regulation D
and J.) Even under alternative A, although little change would be anticipated
in the Federal funds rate, the 3-month Treasury bill rate might rise from
its recently depressed rate by 50 basis points or so during the fourth quarter,
and very likely will advance further in early 1973. Upward pressure on
short-term rates, of course, would be considerably greater under alternative B--
and more so under C. Thus, the 3-month bill rate might rise to 5 per cent
or more by the end of the fourth quarter under B and could be approaching
(13) Rising short-term interest rates would begin to have an
increasing impact on rates of growth in M1 as the fourth quarter progressed,
but their major restraining effects on M1 would probably not occur until the
early months of 1973. The temporary slowing shown for August in the monthly
average M1 growth rate is a statistical consequence of the early July bulge;
from the last week in July to the last week of August, the projected annual
growth rate in M1 is over 9 per cent.
(14) As money market instruments rise in yield, their increasing
relative attractiveness can be expected to dampen fourth quarter flows
into consumer-type time and savings deposits. Even under alternative A
a moderate slowing of inflows to accounts is expected to occur; under
alternative B the higher level of short-term market rates would have a
more noticeable effect. The money market rates associated with
alternative C would reduce inflows still further, and given present
rate ceilings, they could also make all but the highest yielding longer-
term accounts non-competitive with market instruments by the time of
the year-end interest-crediting period. As shown in the table on page 8,
growth in M2 over the fourth quarter is expected to slow progressively
more than M1 under alternatives B and C.
(15) Under alternatives B or C, banks could be expected to take
a more aggressive stance in the CD market, as inflows of other time
deposits decelerate and as business loan demands rise. Additional
borrowing in the Eurodollar market would be expected to remain modest,
however, so long as the 20 per cent marginal reserve requirement on such
borrowings remains in effect. The latitude for bank issuance of CD's
should be a major factor tending to sustain the rate of growth of the
credit proxy even under the firmer money market conditions associated with
alternatives B or C.
(16) Under alternative A, interest rates in longer-term markets
would probably remain relatively stable until late in the year. It is
likely that corporations, with relatively high liquidity and increased
emphasis on equity financing, private placements, and short-term borrowing,
will continue their relatively moderate pace of bond offerings, and
that State and local borrowings will remain below last year's high
Mortgage demands are expected to moderate in any event, both seasonally
and in line with the decline in housing starts. However, the increases
in money market rates associated with alternative B could produce an
earlier advance in long-term rates, and under alternative C the upward
movement in long rates would undoubtedly be both large and prompt. In
the latter circumstances investors would tend to withdraw from the market
to await anticipated higher yields and issuers could be expected to
accelerate offerings now planned for 1973. The tax-exempt market would
be adversely affected by reduced bank purchases, and the impact on the
mortgage market could be quite substantial as institutional lenders began
to experience a slowing of savings inflows in the context of a record volume
of outstanding commitments.
Proposed directives
(17) Three alternative formulations for the operational
paragraph of the directive are presented below. They might be
associated with the correspondingly lettered patterns of growth in
the aggregates described in the preceding section.
(18) Alternative A.
"To implement this policy, while taking account of
[DEL: the forthcoming Treasury financing developments in capital
markets and] international developments, the Committee
seeks to achieve bank reserve and money market conditions
that will support [DEL: moderate] growth in monetary aggregates
over the months ahead AT ABOUT THE AVERAGE RATES RECORDED
IN THE FIRST HALF OF THE YEAR."
(19) Alternative B.
"To implement this policy, while taking account of
[DEL: the forthcoming Treasury financing,] developments in capital
markets, [DEL: and international developments,] the Committee seeks
to achieve bank reserve and money market conditions that will
support moderate growth in monetary aggregates over the months
(20) Alternative C.
"To implement this policy, while taking account of [DEL: the
forthcoming Treasury financing,] developments in capital markets,
[DEL: and international developments,] the Committee seeks to achieve
bank reserve and money market conditions that will support
[DEL: moderate] SOMEWHAT SLOWER growth in monetary aggregates over
the months ahead."
(21) In all three alternatives it is proposed to delete the
reference to the Treasury financing, now that it is completed. The
Committee has interpreted a reference to international developments in
other recent directives as calling for use of operating techniques designed
to minimize downward pressures on short-term interest rates. Retention of
this reference is proposed only in alternative A, since that is the only
policy course herein described under which there is believed to be any
significant possibility for short-term rate declines. It is proposed to
delete the reference to capital market developments in alternative A, since
generally stable long-term rates are foreseen under that alternative.
Retention of this reference in alternative B could be construed, as in
past directives, to call for the types of operations best calculated to
minimize upward pressure on long-term rates. In alternative C the same
language could be interpreted as calling for adopting Desk operations as
necessary to facilitate orderly market adjustments to the higher long-term
rate levels foreseen.
