By the staff Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System

Class I - FOMC
MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES
Recent Developments
(1) Over the intermeeting period, federal funds traded close
to the FOMC's intended rate of 5-3/4 percent, apart from some tempo-
rary elevation around the end of the third quarter. To date, reserve
management has not been complicated significantly by the Treasury's
efforts to cope with the looming debt-ceiling constraint. However, in
order to prevent the supply of bills available to the market from
being unduly constricted by the Treasury's decision to slash the
auction on October 23, the Desk did elect to run off $900 million of
maturing issues from the System Open Market Account in that week,
adding to reserve needs during the intermeeting period.
(2) Yields on intermediate- and longer-term Treasuries fell
extending the rally that began about a year ago and bringing rates on
long bonds to their lowest levels since early 1994. In part, the
decline in rates may have reflected further reductions in inflation
expectations (chart), spurred by favorable inflation and labor compen-
sation data. In addition, commentary on the basis for ultimate budget
compromise between the Congress and the Administration suggested
better odds that substantial fiscal restraint over the long run would
be forthcoming. In recent days, however, clashes over debt ceiling
and interim appropriations measures apparently have begun to concern
market participants, heightening volatility in the Treasury market and
causing rates to back up slightly. Although economic data were mixed
over the period, market participants seemed to conclude that private-
sector spending in the current expansion was not likely to be so
strong as to forestall a future easing in monetary policy. Money
market yields and futures quotes indicate that market participants
see only slim odds of any near-term monetary policy moves but still
look for an easing late this year or early 1996, presumably timed to
follow a budget agreement. On balance, money market interest rates
were about unchanged over the intermeeting period. Falling
longer-term interest rates and continued good news on corporate
earnings again lifted stock prices, with major indexes increasing 1/2
to 2 percent to new records over the intermeeting period.
(3) The dollar's weighted-average exchange value moved in a
fairly narrow range over most of the intermeeting period, but softened
somewhat in recent days, in part on concerns about a U.S. default and
about the unsettled Mexican situation. It ended the period about
countries, on average, moved down somewhat, but by less than in the
United States. The Canadian dollar was volatile over the period but
strengthened against the U.S. dollar in the wake of the defeat of
Quebec's separation referendum, permitting a substantial reduction in
short-term rates by the Bank of Canada. The dollar traded firmer
against the yen for much of the period, seemingly influenced by market
concerns over the financial condition of the Japanese banking system.
Short-term interest rates in Mexico rose more than 25 percentage
points as the peso came under sharp downward pressure against the
dollar, reflecting some apparent loss of confidence in the govern-
ment's willingness to maintain anti-inflationary policies in the face
of continued weakness in the economy. U.S. monetary authorities did
not intervene in foreign exchange markets during the period.
(4) The expansion of debt and broad money seems to have
moderated somewhat in recent months. With a slowing in both private
and federal borrowing, growth in the debt of all domestic nonfinancial
sectors fell to a 3 percent annual rate in September, leaving this
aggregate around the middle of its 3 to 7 percent monitoring range.
Data for October, while still sparse, point to another month of modest
borrowing. Bank credit growth came to a near-standstill last month.
Business loans were flat, and growth in consumer and real estate loans
slowed. Some of this weakness owed to a shifting of borrowing to
securities markets (corporations tapped capital markets in size, and
securitization of consumer and real estate loans rose), but it appears
that credit demands also were sluggish. On the supply side, senior
loan officers reported continued easing of terms on business loans,
especially for large firms, but had tightened slightly the terms and
standards for consumer lending in response to increased delinquencies.
In the open markets, spreads on investment-grade paper have stayed
narrow, but junk bond spreads have widened somewhat, adding to sig-
nificant increases already experienced earlier in the year.
(5) Owing to reduced funding needs of banks, M3 expanded at
only a 3-1/2 percent pace in October, its slowest growth in eight
months. This moderation brought the growth rate of this aggregate
from the fourth quarter of 1994 to 6-1/2 percent, leaving it only a
little above the upper end of its 2 to 6 percent annual range. Con-
tinuing the sharp deceleration from its rapid summer pace, M2 was
about unchanged last month, and its growth from the fourth quarter was
expansion of. instruments in M2 held primarily by households (NOW
accounts, MMDAs, money funds, and small time deposits) has fallen off
sharply over the past two months. Although total flows into bond and
stock mutual funds have been substantial, they do not appear to have
strengthened significantly of late, and net noncompetitive tenders for
Treasury securities have remained anemic.2 Thus, the recent weak-
ness in M2 is not easily explained.
(6) The contraction in M1 steepened in October to a 10-1/2
percent annual rate. Much of the decline in this measure was again
accounted for by the implementation of additional retail sweep ar-
rangements.3 Even after adjusting for the initial effects of such
programs, however, M1 dropped at a 2-1/2 percent rate. Demand depos-
its fell, and currency growth, at a 4-1/2 percent pace, remained weak
compared with its average of the past few years. After moderating
last spring, net foreign shipments of U.S. currency have continued to
run at a markedly lower rate in recent months.4 Anecdotal informa-
tion points to some developing reluctance in foreign countries to hold
the current series $100 bills in advance of the introduction of the
new bill next year, apparently reflecting concern about the future
acceptability of the current series.

Policy Alternatives
(7) Recent GDP and labor market data have been stronger than
anticipated by the staff at the time of the September FOMC meeting,
and output is now projected to grow about 1 percentage point faster
over the second half of 1995 than expected in September. In effect,
the levels of interest rates over the past year seem to have been less
restrictive than thought before, and greater strength in aggregate
demand is seen as persisting in 1996 and 1997: with a sustained 5-3/4
percent federal funds rate. output is projected to expand at close to
the growth rate of potential GDP. Thus, the unemployment rate holds
in the 5-1/2 to 5-3/4 percent range through the forecast period,
appreciably below the path in the previous Greenbook. However, the
staff also has interpreted recent data on prices and compensation as
suggesting that the economy can operate at unemployment rates around
those levels without an acceleration of inflation. As a consequence,
core inflation is seen as holding fairly steady at around 3 percent,
even at the relatively low unemployment rates projected. The staff
forecast thus has the economy operating in 1996 with higher output and
lower unemployment than the Committee members' midyear expectations,
though with inflation in the central tendency range for the CPI.
(8) On the federal budgetary front, the eventual outcome
remains uncertain, and a sustained lapse in annual appropriations or a
default on Treasury debt cannot be ruled out as a by-product of the
negotiating process. As to appropriations, it may be difficult for
the President and the Congress to agree on a continuing resolution to
authorize spending past November 13. At this writing, a real pos-
sibility exists that nonessential operations of the government will
have to shut down beginning November 14 and that any eventual continu-
ing resolution would involve more fiscal restraint in the near term
than incorporated in the greenbook forecast.5  However, because
many government operations would be deemed essential and allowed to
continue, and because others are funded by multi-year appropriations,
the quantitative effect on activity would be small, even if a spending
lapse were to persist. As to default, market prices so far have been
affected only a little by such a possibility, presumably because in-
vestors anticipate some political compromise or a resort to unusual
financing devices by the Treasury to enable it to make timely pay-
ments. The possible implications for markets and for monetary policy
of a default are discussed in paragraphs (17) to (19) below.
(9) The Greenbook forecast assumes no significant macro-
economic effects from any temporary disruptions incurred in the
process of determining the longer-run stance of fiscal policy. As
core consumer inflation staying at about 3 percent. Despite the lack
of a downward tilt to the inflation projection, the Committee still
might favor the unchanged stance of policy in alternative B if it
viewed the benefits of further disinflation as insufficient to justify
a more restrictive policy stance that pushed the economy below its
potential. The case for alternative B would be even stronger if the
Committee viewed the staff inflation forecast as too pessimistic--
either because spending would be weaker or because the price-output
relationship would be more favorable than the staff assessment.
Moreover, uncertainties about the economic outlook might seem par-
ticularly large, both because of the fiscal situation and because of
conflicting signals about spending and production. Such circumstances
could reinforce the desire to stand pat, awaiting clarification of the
(10) Earlier expectations of the possibility of easing at the
November FOMC meeting have largely been erased and, thus, the choice
of alternative B should have little impact on market interest rates.
The dollar would trade on foreign exchange markets around its current
level. Although market attention over the intermeeting period is
likely to remain focused on the budget deliberations, evidence of
persistent strength in private final demands along the lines of the
staff forecast might cause markets to begin to question their expecta-
tions about the path of interest rates going forward, and intermedi-
ate- and long-term rates could edge higher.
(11) The choice of easing under alternative A might be
favored if it were thought that some information about spending--for
example, soft industrial commodity prices and a sluggish manufacturing
sector or slowing growth of broad money and credit--was suggesting a
weakening in aggregate demand not yet evident in more general statis-
tics. These indicators might be signalling that real interest rates
already have been on the high side, and these rates could be rising
further, especially at the short end of the maturity spectrum, in
light of the recent decline in inflation and, most likely, inflation
expectations. In effect, the downward slope to the near-term yield
curve and narrow spread of the entire curve could be signalling that
real short-term rates are above those consistent with moderate growth,
especially in the face of impending fiscal restraint.
(12) The cut in the federal funds rate of 50 basis points
under alternative A would come sooner and be larger than now expected
in the market. Consequently, it would show through to other money
market interest rates, and banks would trim 1/2 percentage point off
the prime rate. The dollar would be expected to weaken on foreign
exchange markets as interest rates on dollar-denominated assets fell
in relation to those on other major currencies. The sustainability of
any decline in bond rates would depend on whether market participants
similarly saw the easing to be called for or rather viewed it to be
premature and unsustainable, as might become the case if indicators in
the period just ahead were broadly in line with the staff forecast.
(13) The choice of alternative C might be favored to the
extent that the Committee wished to have greater assurance that infla-
tion would continue to edge down. A more restrictive policy to
accomplish this objective might be seen as all the more needed in
light of recent strength in broad measures of output and labor input.
Furthermore, intermediate- and long-term interest rates have declined
substantially in recent months, potentially providing considerable
further impetus to spending.
(14) A move to tighten policy by 50 basis points as under
alternative C would especially surprise market participants, who con-
tinue to hold the view, supported by statements from some Committee
members, that the next policy move will be to ease. Money market
rates would rise by at least the 50 basis point increase in the fed-
eral funds rate. The dollar would tend to strengthen on foreign
exchange markets, and intermediate- and long-term interest rates would
retrace some of their recent declines as a higher path for real short-
term rates came to be built into market expectations.
(15) The table below presents expected growth of money and
debt under the unchanged reserve conditions of alternative B. In
credit markets, supply conditions are expected to remain generally
favorable. However, the likely cutback in business lending by Japa-
nese banks and possible tendency for consumer lenders to become more
selective suggest that credit may become less freely available for
some borrowers. Nonetheless, borrowing by nonfederal sectors is
expected to firm a little from the subdued pace of recent months. For
businesses, strong cash flow and some slowing in the pace of inventory
accumulation will act to hold down financing needs, although this
effect will be offset by the scheduled completion of some large merg-
ers and associated share retirements in coming months. In the house-
hold sector, debt growth will be sustained in the near term in financ-
ing further healthy advances in durable goods outlays and fairly
robust housing activity. Total nonfederal debt is projected to expand
at below a 5 percent annual rate over late 1995 and early 1996. Fed-
eral borrowing will be light in the months immediately ahead, even
absent a spending lapse or debt-ceiling crisis, before strengthening
late in the winter. Taken together, total nonfinancial sector debt is
projected to grow 5-1/4 percent in 1995, around the middle of its
monitoring range, and to maintain that pace early in 1996.

(16) The broad monetary aggregates, especially M2, are
expected to strengthen after October. Moderate nominal income growth
and fairly narrow opportunity costs will tend to buoy expansion in
household demand for M2, helping to return growth in this aggregate to
the 4-1/2 percent area over the October-to-March period under alterna-
tive B. The rebound in M2 growth, combined with still-brisk issuance
of large time deposits to fund bank credit, would result in about
velocity would continue to decline over the fourth quarter of this
year and the first quarter of next year, albeit at a slower pace. The
velocity of M2, in contrast, should edge up over these two quarters,
reversing part of its unexpectedly large third-quarter decline. Mean-
while, M1 is projected to remain on a downward trajectory, owing to
the further spread of retail sweeps. For the year 1995, the staff
projects M2 to rise 4-1/4 percent, in the upper portion of its 1-to-5
percent range, and M3 to advance 6-1/2 percent, a little above its 2-
to-6 percent range. In March of 1996, both aggregates would be near
the upper ends of their tentative ranges for next year.
Contingencies Regarding a Treasury Default
(17) While a Treasury default on November 15 seems extremely
unlikely, given the financing flexibility apparently available to the
Secretary of the Treasury, the threat of default may linger for some
time. Considerable uncertainty surrounds the financial market conse-
quences of the inability of the U.S. Treasury to meet its obligations.
Payments on principal, interest, and a variety of other obligations
would be delayed for an unknown length of time, creating liquidity
strains for many banks and their customers. Strains could be com-
pounded by frictions in pricing, trading, and financing of matured
securities and overdue interest coupons. If trading conventions were
established to minimize those frictions, and if the Treasury could
clarify that interest would continue to accrue after maturity,
liquidity in the market for these instruments could be maintained to
some extent,.likely mitigating price changes. Nonetheless, with no
experience to guide judgments about these effects, sizable price
movements are conceivable--and, in any case, markets are likely to be
quite skittish. Treasury securities are the benchmark for pricing
many financial instruments and widely used as collateral, and, conse-
quently, the potential exists for spillover effects to other markets.
(18) Some of the uncertainties and skittishness could be
ameliorated by System and Treasury actions. In the payments area,
allowing matured securities to be transferred on the book-entry system
should foster secondary market trading, as would an announcement about
the procedures to be followed for delayed interest payments. More-
over, an announcement of the Desk's willingness to take defaulted
obligations as collateral in repurchase agreements should serve to
encourage that practice more generally. As to potential liquidity
problems, accepting defaulted Treasury obligations as good collateral
for discount window borrowing should aid those depositories, and
indirectly their customers, experiencing delays in receipt of pay-
ments. If liquidity problems seem to have the potential of becoming
severe or widespread, it may be necessary to consider steps to
encourage greater use of the discount window. Unpredictable demands
for adjustment credit, along with uncertainty about the total demand
for excess reserves in volatile markets, would complicate the
implementation of policy over this period, requiring considerable
flexibility in daily open market operations. If, despite these steps,
serious market disruptions threatened the health of the economy, the
FOMC might want to address the question of whether the System Open
Market Account should be used to purchase defaulted Treasury
obligations from the public, taking account of the Federal Reserve
Act's limitation that securities only be purchased in the open market.
Such a step, presumably, would be considered in the context of the
overall stance of policy in the circumstances.
(19) If market disruptions were limited, the effects on eco-
nomic activity of a Treasury default should be fairly small, with
little implication for the underlying stance of monetary policy. If
it looked as if significant reductions in the deficit would be forth-
coming, a run-up in Treasury yields might not be large and might not
be matched by increases in private rates. The Treasury would continue
to purchase goods and services and to take in tax receipts in accord-
ance with existing authority. A strong market reaction could present
policymakers with difficult choices. A generalized loss of confidence
and flight from dollar assets would tend to raise interest rates and
discourage spending, but it could also cause the dollar to drop

OPERATIONAL PARAGRAPH
In the implementation of policy for the immediate future,
the Committee seeks to DECREASE (SOMEWHAT/ SLIGHTLY)/
maintain/INCREASE (SOMEWHAT/SLIGHTLY) the existing degree of
pressure on reserve positions. In the context of the
Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and
sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration
to economic, financial, and monetary developments, slightly
(SOMEWHAT) greater reserve restraint (WOULD/MIGHT) or
slightly (SOMEWHAT) lesser reserve restraint would (MIGHT) be
acceptable in the intermeeting period. The contemplated
reserve conditions are expected to be consistent with
MODERATE growth in M2 and M3 over COMING [DEL: the balance of the
year near the pace of recent] months.
