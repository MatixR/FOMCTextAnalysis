Prefatory Note 
 
 
The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version available 
based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the Board 
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was created 
through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned 
versions text-searchable.2   Though a stringent quality assurance process was 
employed, some imperfections may remain. 
 
Please note that some material may have been redacted from this document if that 
material was received on a confidential basis.  Redacted material is indicated by 
occasional gaps in the text or by gray boxes around non-text content.  All redacted

1  In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic 
format.  All scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced 
tilting) and lightly cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other 
blemishes caused after initial printing). 
 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optical character recognition computer program (OCR) 
first created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, 
staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.  Please note that the numbers and text in charts and 
tables were not reliably recognized by the OCR process and were not checked or corrected by staff.

MONEY MARKET AND RESERVE RELATIONSHIPS
Recent developments
(1) Since the last meeting of the Committee, yields on
money and short-term credit market instruments, and movements in
reserve and deposit aggregates, have generally been in line with
staff projections. The bank credit proxy rose by a 9 per cent annual
rate on average in September (10 per cent after including Euro-dollar
borrowings), while the 3-month bill rate fluctuated in about a 5.10--
the bill rate declined to the bottom of the range as the System returned
to the buying side of the market and seasonal pressures associated with
the tax date passed. Most recently, the 3-month bill has been trading
around 5.20 per cent, affected in part by the fact that such bills
now carry the relatively less popular January dates.
(2) Other short-term rates have declined slightly since the
last meeting of the Committee, while long-term rates have fluctuated
in a relatively narrow range. The reduction in prime loan rates--with
most banks reducing the rate by only 1/4 point to 6-1/4 per cent--had
little effect on market rates. In the past few days some upward
pressure on market interest rates has developed, as market sentiment
about the economic outlook shifted somewhat and as dealers became
more eager to reduce security inventories.

October 4, 1968.
(3) Money market conditions since the last meeting of the
Committee have been influenced by changes in reserve distribution,
partly related to the emergence and subsidence of pressures around the
tax date; by banks' initial adaptations to the new reserve settlement
regulations; and by a decline in Euro-dollar borrowings in the latter
part of September. The Federal funds rate has averaged near 5-3/4 per
cent although fluctuating fairly widely around this level, with most
trading at 6 per cent during the past statement week. Rates on new
loans to dealers posted by major money market banks have fluctuated
around 6-1/4 per cent, and have been relatively more on the high side
in recent days.
(4) Member bank borrowings averaged around $475 million over
the past three statement weeks, as compared with $520 million in the
preceding four. At the same time, excess reserves in the past three
weeks declined relative to the preceding four weeks to an average
level of $290 million, as banks adapted to the new reserve provisions.
(5) With banks economizing on excess reserves and with
reserves released by a shift in the deposit mix from demand to time
deposits, total reserves of banks declined slightly, on average, in
September. Total demand deposits at banks declined last month as a
small rise in U.S. Government deposits was more than offset by a
marked decline in private demand deposits. The money supply fell by
about 6 per cent, at an annual rate, on average. On a weekly basis,
the last substantial increase in the money supply occurred in late
June and the early days of July, and related partly to the large cash
redemption of June tax bills. Since that time, the money supply has
fluctuated in a narrow band and shown virtually no change on balance.
(6) Time deposits in September grew at an 18 per cent annual
rate, on average, a slightly lower rate than August. The decline in
outstanding bank CD's in September was less than seasonal, even though
banks reduced CD offering rates on most maturities. Other time and
savings deposits continued to increase at around their fairly rapid
August pace.

Prospective developments
(8) Assuming a policy which permits member bank borrowings
to remain in a $400 - $600 million range, the Federal funds rate in the
coming three weeks is likely to center around 5-7/8 per cent. Any
significant reduction in the continued exceptionally deep basic reserve
deficit of major banks--either because Euro-dollars become more available
or simply because banks become less inclined to borrow short--would
tend to ease conditions in the funds market. Working in the other
direction would be increased financing demands associated with the
expected $3.5 billion Treasury tax bill financing, probably to be paid
for in the latter half of October.
(9) The 3-month bill rate over the coming period may fluctuate
in a 5.10--5.40 per cent range. The System's own operations are not
expected to be a significant net influence on the market, in contrast to
recent weeks when large-scale System buying helped to reduce dealer
inventories in both the bill and coupon areas. Since the last Committee
meeting dealer positions in all maturities have declined about $900
million (from September 10 to October 1), with total bill positions
down about $500 million and coupon issues maturing in more than 5 years
down almost $300 million.
(10) Some additional demand for bills may be forthcoming in
the near future from auto companies and from state and local governments
utilizing the proceeds of capital market issues. However, the supply of
bills will be substantially increased by the expected treasury tax
bill financing. To the extent that the mid-November refunding--to
be announced about a week before the next FOMC meeting--may result in
very little debt lengthening, this too could exert marginal upward
pressure in short-term market sectors.
(11) With banks expected to underwrite the Treasury tax bill
financing, the bank credit proxy in October may rise in a 10-13 per
cent, annual rate, range. The Treasury financing (including related
financing of dealers) accounts for about 4-1/2 percentage points of the
projected rise. (If Euro-dollar borrowings remain at the early October
level--which is $700 million below the mid-September peak--the combination
of the proxy plus Euro-dollars would be reduced by about 1-1/2 percentage
points on average in October).
(12) Such a continued relatively strong pace of total bank
credit expansion reflects not only Government financing but also
persisting large inflows of time and savings deposits. Only a moderate
slowing in the pace of expansion of interest-bearing deposits is projected
for October--to a 13-16 per cent annual rate range. However, there is
some likelihood that the extent of bank intermediation in the saving
process could diminish, as thrift institutions, whose inflows appear
to be lagging relatively, begin to compete more actively. In addition,
bank credit growth might fall short of projections if both banks and
other active market participants adopt more pessimistic attitudes toward
future declines of interest rates, and become less willing long-term
investors and short-term borrowers, Business loan growth is expected
to be on the moderate side. Assuming such business loan growth and no
sharp turn-around in bank attitudes toward future interest rates, out-
standing CD's are expected to rise in a $500-$750 million range, about
twice seasonal growth.
(13) The money supply is not expected to show any very rapid
growth in the period ahead. In October, money growth may possibly be
in a 1-4 per cent, annual rate, range for the month on average, mainly
as a result of currency growth.
(14) Looking ahead to November, bank credit growth is likely
to be slower than in October. Unlike most previous Novembers, the
Treasury may not have to raise very much new cash during the month--
having anticipated their November cash need in October. Moreover, a
further slowing in time deposit expansion appears likely, as income
growth remains on the moderate side and as some funds that would other-
wise go into time deposits are attracted by the newly issued tax bills
(with secondary market distribution occurring in very late October and
early November) and by coupon issues offered in the November refunding.
(15) The combination of Treasury financing, a continued large
volume of new municipal issues, and possibly more widespread investor
uncertainties as to the future course of interest rates and inflation
all suggest the possibility of upward pressure on the interest rate
structure in the weeks ahead, probably of moderate dimensions.
