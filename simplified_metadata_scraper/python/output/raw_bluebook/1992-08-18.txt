text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain. 
 

Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These

Strictly Confidential (FR) Class I FOMC

MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Prepared for the Federal Open Market Committee

By the staff Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System



Strictly Confidential (FR)
Class I - FOMC August 14, 1992

MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Recent Developments

(1) On July 2, the day after the FOMC meeting, the discount

rate and the intended federal funds rate were reduced 50 basis points to

3 and 3-1/4 percent, respectively. These actions were taken in response

to data suggesting that the economic expansion was more subdued than

anticipated, and against a background of marked weakness in the broad

monetary aggregates, sluggish credit growth, and continuing disinfla-

tion. Over the balance of the period, the intended federal funds rate

remained at 3-1/4 percent. The allowance for adjustment and seasonal

borrowing was maintained at $225 million until July 30, when it was

raised by $25 million to account for increasing demands for seasonal

credit. Borrowing averaged close to its allowance in the two complete

maintenance periods since the meeting, and the federal funds rate has

averaged 3.25 percent.

(2) The weak economic data and policy easing prompted a con-

siderable decline in market rates across the maturity spectrum on

July 2. Note and bond markets have rallied further in recent weeks, as

incoming information suggested limited momentum in the economic recovery

and more favorable price and wage trends. On balance over the period,

rates on both three-month Treasury bills and on thirty-year Treasury

bonds dropped a little more than 40 basis points. Intermediate-term

rates fell by even more--from 60 to 70 basis points. This pattern sug-

gests that the drop in long-term rates was accounted for by downward

revisions of expected credit demands and inflation over the next few

1. Financial markets quotations in the bluebook reflect data

years, rather than a reconsideration of longer-term inflation expec-

tations. Rates on fixed-rate home mortgages fell about 45 basis points

over the intermeeting period, somewhat less than yields on intermediate-

term Treasuries, partly reflecting a reassessment of prepayment risk as

a result of the unexpectedly sharp pickup in refinancing activity. In

other markets, spreads of yields on private securities over Treasury

issues remained quite narrow. Most broad stock price indexes were

little changed on balance over the period.

(3) The dollar's foreign exchange value on a weighted average

basis has declined about 2-1/2 percent since the last FOMC meeting, as a

depreciation of about 3-1/2 percent against the mark and other ERM cur-

rencies more than offset a slight appreciation against the yen. Since

its recent peak in mid-April the dollar has fallen 10 percent, more than

retracing the runup from year-end. The net depreciation of the dollar

over the intermeeting period mainly reflected a weakening of near-term

U.S. economic prospects and the associated declines in U.S. interest

rates. Although the Bundesbank raised its discount rate 75 basis points

on July 16, market interest rates in Germany moved only slightly higher.

However, against the backdrop of questions about the future of monetary

union, interest rates in other European countries rose somewhat more as

central banks had to tighten to support their currencies. The Desk

intervened on July 20, August 7, and August 11, purchasing a total of

$770 million against marks to moderate the dollar's decline.

The Bank of Japan lowered

its discount rate by 1/2 percentage point; short-term market rates in



Japan declined about 60 basis points, while long-term rates dropped by

40 basis points. Japanese stock prices declined by 6 percent, reaching

six-year lows, while European stock markets fell 7 to 11 percent.

(4) M2 and M3 continued to contract in July, decreasing at

1-1/4 and 1-3/4 percent annual rates, respectively, leaving them below

the parallel bands associated with their annual ranges. Both aggregates

were substantially weaker than projected, reflecting in part a shortfall

in the expansion of nominal income. In addition, velocities may have

shifted up a little more than anticipated, perhaps owing to a further

rechanneling of credit demands outside of the depository sector, encour-

aged by the drop in long-term market interest rates. Bank loans con-

tinued to slide in July and overall bank credit was flat. With little

need for additional funds, institutions cut rates on retail deposits

promptly following the July 2 easing. Rates on liquid deposits de-

creased substantially, but by less than the reduction in money market

yields, and growth of those deposits (including demand deposits, other

checkable deposits, savings deposits, and MMDAs) picked up.2 Yields

on retail time deposits were reduced more in line with declines in mar-

ket rates of comparable maturity, and small time deposits extended their

steep runoff. Outflows from retail money market mutual funds acceler-

ated, in contrast to the usual pattern following declines in short-term

yields. Faced with wide spreads between yields on M2 balances and rates

on both capital market instruments and household credit, many households

evidently have continued to redirect balances toward bond and stock

funds and the repayment of credit. Weakness in bank credit was also

reflected in sizable runoffs of large CDs, but the non-M2 component of

2. Reflecting strong growth of transaction deposits and an acceler-
ation of currency, M1 growth rebounded to an 11-1/2 percent rate in
July. Growth in total reserves resumed, and the monetary base ex-
panded at a 9-1/2 percent rate.



M3 was supported by flows into institution-only money market funds,

whose yields fell less quickly than market rates.

(5) Recent declines in long-term interest rates fueled ac-

tivity in bond and mortgage markets, but private debt growth overall

apparently remained sluggish. In the household sector, mortgage ap-

plications shot up as mortgage rates touched new lows; most such

applications were to refinance existing mortgages, but those for home

purchases climbed as well. Consumer installment credit contracted at a

1 percent rate in June, and bank data for July suggest little pickup.

Nonfinancial firms continued to issue bonds at a brisk pace in July,

mainly to refund high-cost debt and pay down short-term loans. Both

business loans at banks and commercial paper ran off in July, and over-

all funding needs appear to have remained modest. Senior lending

officers at commercial banks reported that underwriting standards on

business loans were about unchanged over the past three months, continu-

ing the trend of recent surveys; in contrast to previous surveys, banks

did not report further tightening in other terms of lending. Bond

offerings remained brisk in the tax-exempt sector, but a sizable pro-

portion of the issues were for refunding purposes, and a large volume of

bonds were retired with the proceeds of issues sold some time ago. With

federal debt continuing to expand at a rapid pace, overall nonfinancial

sector debt has increased at an estimated 4-3/4 percent rate through

July, leaving this aggregate just within its monitoring range.

Policy Alternatives

(6) Three alternatives are presented below for consideration

by the Committee. Under alternative B, federal funds would continue to

trade around 3-1/4 percent in combination with an initial allowance for

adjustment plus seasonal borrowing of $250 million.3 Under alterna-

tive A, the federal funds rate would drop to 2-3/4 percent. This could

be achieved by a reduction in the borrowing allowance to $225 million

with the funds rate dropping below the discount rate, or by a cut in the

discount rate of 1/2 percentage point with an unchanged borrowing al-

lowance. Alternative C involves a return of the federal funds rate to

3-3/4 percent and a borrowing allowance of $275 million.

(7) Market sentiment of late seems to have tilted toward some

prospect of another policy ease in coming months. Although money market

interest rates might firm a bit over the intermeeting period under the

unchanged policy of alternative B, any increase would be limited if,

consistent with the Greenbook forecast, information continued to suggest

modest economic expansion. Bond rates also should remain around their

current reduced levels, and could even edge down if inaction by the

Federal Reserve, along with indicators of wages and prices, were seen as

reinforcing disinflationary trends. If political dynamics seem to

portend even higher budget deficits ahead, these downward pressures on

bond yields may tend to be offset. The dollar, under alternative B,

would be expected to trade around its recent lower levels.

(8) Under alternative A, short-term interest rates would fall

by nearly the full 50 basis point drop in the federal funds rate, espe-

cially were the easing to take the form of a discount rate cut, which

3. The borrowing allowance likely will need to be reduced in late
September to reflect the usual fall-off in demands for seasonal
credit.



would be seen as implying that the reduction more likely would be sus-

tained. Banks would be expected to trim another 1/2 percentage point

off the prime rate, still preserving large spreads over funding costs.

Some market participants might read the easing as increased emphasis on

spurring economic activity, at the cost of limiting progress against

inflation. Nonetheless, given the outlook for tepid economic expansion

and slower inflation that recently has come to be more firmly embedded

in market expectations, nominal as well as real bond yields would be

likely to decline noticeably. Easing in the United States might lessen

constraints on more expansive monetary policies in a few other coun-

tries, but with many countries, especially in Europe, highly unlikely to

follow suit, the dollar would tend to depreciate significantly further.

(9) A reversal of the July easing would take market partici-

pants completely by surprise and short-term interest rates would rise by

at least 1/2 percentage point under alternative C. Bond rates, too,

would retrace some of their recent declines under this alternative, at

least initially, and quality spreads on private debt could widen if such

a tightening were seen as placing the recovery at risk. The dollar

would rebound appreciably.

(10) Growth rates of the monetary aggregates under the three

alternatives are presented below. The table gives projected money

growth rates through year-end, on the assumption that the contemplated

reserve conditions under each alternative are maintained over that

period. Growth rates for M2 and M3 are projected to be quite subdued.

For the June-to-September period, expansion in the broad aggregates is

likely to fall well short of the rates envisioned at the time of the

last Committee meeting, even if alternative A is adopted. Moreover,

growth of M2 and M3 over the rest of the year would remain damped,



leaving these aggregates below their annual target ranges under all

the alternatives.4  Ml, on the other hand, is likely to expand at a

double-digit pace over coming months, boosted by mortgage prepayments,

low time deposit rates, and special factors.5

(11) Data for late July and early August indicate that ex-

pansion of the monetary aggregates is strengthening a bit, perhaps as

a consequence of the substantial decline across the maturity spectrum

in market interest rates since the last FOMC meeting. However, the

shortfall in July is not expected to be recovered, and underlying

4. To reach the lower end of its annual range, M2 would need to
grow at a 5-1/4 percent annual rate from July through the end of the
year and M3 at a 4 percent rate.

5. Ml and M2 will be boosted in mid- to late-September by shifts to
OCDs of funds now commingled in large time deposits under sweep
account arrangements recently prohibited by the Board. About $4 to $5
billion of such accounts has been identified at , but other
banks may be affected as well. The staff foresees little effect on
the monetary aggregates from the closing of other Regulation D loop-
holes to take effect in September; the provision classifying teller's
checks as transactions deposits will not take effect until December.

growth rates are expected to be slower than might have been antici-

pated at these lower interest rate levels. As noted above, weaker

expansion of income than previously anticipated likely plays an impor-

tant role in explaining the lower path of money. In addition, how-

ever, the forces restraining money relative to income appear to be

more intense than we thought. Spending is being financed out of in-

ternal funds and by drawing down money balances, and what net borrow-

ing there is seems likely to be even more concentrated in capital

markets and away from banks. Bank credit is now projected to increase

at only a 2 percent annual rate in the second half of the year. The

redirection of household funds to capital market instruments and debt

repayment will continue to be encouraged by the further declines in

deposit rates. Moreover, runoffs of brokered deposits may be acceler-

ating after the June 16 effective date of FDICIA restrictions.

(12) Under alternative B, M2 is expected to resume expanding

this month and to grow at a 2-1/4 percent pace on balance over the

remainder of the year. M2 growth will be supported by large inflows

to demand deposits in the months ahead, owing to the resumption of

strong mortgage refinancing activity and a buildup in compensating

balances occasioned by recent declines in market rates. With

flows into OCDs also strong, Ml is projected to expand at a 10 percent

pace over the balance of the year. Beyond Ml, outflows from M2

money funds are projected to abate, although the very steep yield

curve is expected to continue to draw balances from such accounts and

6. Actual growth in the fourth quarter will be boosted relative to
expectations at the last meeting effects.

7. Nearly half of the growth in M2 over the balance of the year is
projected to come from increases in demand deposits and MMDAs associ-
ated with mortgage prepayments.

8. Total reserves and the monetary base would be expected to in-
crease at around a 10 percent pace over June to December.



from retail time deposits to capital market investments. On a quar-

terly average basis, M2 would contract slightly this quarter, and

increase at a 2-1/4 percent rate in the fourth quarter. This projec-

tion assumes the unchanged federal funds rate of alternative B ex-

tended through year-end and the Greenbook economic forecast. It im-

plies velocity growth at a 4 percent annual rate in the third quarter

and 3-1/4 percent in the fourth. With the assumed income and interest

rates, standard money demand models predict velocity decreases through

this period; experimental models that embody yield-curve effects and

other alternative measures of opportunity costs are predicting veloc-

ity increases in the second half of the year, though not as large as

embodied in the staff forecast.

(13) The firming in M2 under alternative B shows through in

part to M3, which bottoms out in coming months and then edges higher.

Acting to limit any pickup in this aggregate is the likelihood of

anemic advances in bank credit and funding needs and some further

declines in thrift credit. The failure of M3 to grow this year, as

implied in all the alternatives, would be unprecedented in the

official series, which begins in 1959. The extraordinary behavior of

M3 is a function not only of weak depository credit but of restrained

credit growth overall. With spending financed out of higher profits

and by drawing down liquid assets, the debt of nonfederal sectors is

projected to expand at only a 2-3/4 percent pace over the balance of

the year, implying a further drop in debt-to-income ratios for both

households and businesses. Continued strong federal borrowing will

boost total debt growth to 4-3/4 percent for the year--near the lower

end of its annual monitoring range.

(14) The lower interest rates of alternative A would be

expected to buoy money growth over the balance of the year. Although



-12-

there is some question about the strength of the near-term response of

M2 to lower short-term rates, the anticipated decline in long-term

rates under this alternative should damp additional adverse yield

curve effects. Over time, the lower real and nominal interest rates

would raise income growth and, through that channel, further augment

demands for money, though the effects through year-end would be small.

The slightly faster growth in M2 deposits would feed through partly to

M3, as would relatively more attractive rates on M3 money funds,

leading to a resumption of 1 percent expansion in this aggregate over

the balance of the year.

(15) Under alternative C, M2 and M3 would drop further below

their annual ranges, as opportunity costs widen, banks become even

more cautious lenders, and income growth is more restrained. The

effects on M1 would be especially marked in the fourth quarter, given

the drop in mortgage prepayments that would accompany the backup in

long-term rates. Still, M1 would be expected to increase at a 10 per-

cent rate from June to December.

Directive Language

(16) Draft language for the operational paragraph is pre-

sented below. Four alternatives for the last sentence, labeled a, b,

c, and d, are shown. The first, (a), would follow the usual practice,

retaining the current mid-quarter approach of updating the Committee's

expectations for the quarter. The second, (b), would retain the cur-

rent format but extend the money projections through year end. A third

alternative, (c), would give an indication of Committee expectations

for growth in M2 and M3, but would also suggest that continued expan-

sion at a subdued pace leaving the aggregates below their long-run

ranges would be acceptable in the context of unusual strength in

velocity. A fourth alternative, (d), would convey the same thought

without giving precise expectations for money growth.

OPERATIONAL PARAGRAPH

In the implementation of policy for the immediate

future, the Committee seeks to DECREASE SOMEWHAT/maintain/

INCREASE SOMEWHAT the existing degree of pressure on re-

serve positions. In the context of the Committee's long-

run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic

growth and giving careful consideration to economic,

financial, and monetary developments, slightly (SOMEWHAT)

greater reserve restraint might (WOULD) or slightly

(SOMEWHAT) lesser reserve restraint (MIGHT) would be

acceptable in the intermeeting period.

(a) The contemplated reserve conditions are expected to

be consistent with growth of M2 and M3 over the

period from June through September at annual rates



-14-

of about ____ AND ____ [DEL: 2 and 1/2] percent, respec-

tively.

(b) The contemplated reserve conditions are expected to

be consistent with growth of M2 and M3 over the

period from June through [DEL: September] DECEMBER at

annual rates of about ___ AND ____ [DEL: 2 and 1/2] per-

cent, respectively.

(c) The contemplated reserve conditions are expected to

be associated with some pickup in the growth of M2

and M3 to annual rates of about ____ and ____ per-

cent over the period from June through December.

Such growth would leave the expansion of both

aggregates below the Committee's ranges for the

year but is anticipated to be consistent with the

Committee's policy objectives given the unusual

strength in velocity.

(d) The contemplated reserve conditions are expected to

be consistent with some pickup in the monetary

aggregates, but if unusual strength in velocity

persists, M2 and M3 below their annual ranges could

be consistent with the Committee's policy

objectives.
