MONEY MARKET AND RESERVE RELATIONSHIPS

Recent developments

The past four weeks were marked first by a sharp upward

movement of long-term bond yields and a tightening of short-term

markets, and then later in the period by a return to easier money

market conditions and some downward re-adjustment in long-term rates.

Expectational as well as supply-demand factors had an important

bearing on the rate movements. Concern about the viability of

prevailing interest rate levels developed early in the period as

many narket observers concluded that monetary policy had stopped

trending toward ease, as a large and continuing build-up in bond

issues came to market, and as security dealers made efforts to

lighten inventories. In consequence, the yield on new high grade

corporate issues rose from a little over 5 per cent at the time of

the last FOMC meeting to around 5.50 per cent, while outstanding

20 year U.S. Government bonds rose from 4.50 to 4.70 per cent.

Toward the end of February, bearish bond market expectations

were moderated byTreasury trust account purchases of coupon issues for

debt limit purposes and by System open market operations, leading to

the development of a Federal funds rate fluctuating below 5 per cent,

with trading most frequently in a 4-1/2 - 4-3/4 per cent range. And

CONFIDENTIAL (FR) -2- March 3, 1967.

a more bullish market psychology materialized with the announcement

of a reduction in reserve requirements on savings deposits and on the

first $5 million of time deposits. Government bond yields appear to

have retraced about half their previous rise, but the response in the

corporate market has been more sluggish.

As open market operations attempted to moderate rising

interest rates in February, nonborrowed reserves rose by an 18.5 per

cent annual rate on average. Banks used part of these funds to

reduce borrowings from the Federal Reserve. Required reserves did

grow rapidly, however, and supported a 15 per cent rate of expansion

in total member bank deposits (the bank credit proxy), with most of

the rise occurring early in the month. Inclusion of repayments of

member bank borrowings from abroad would reduce the bank credit

proxy expansion to about 13-14 per cent on average last month.

Despite the rapid aggregate reserve expansion and even

with the net reserve position of banks averaging just about zero

during the four weeks ending March 1, the money market remained

relatively taut for much of the period. Member bank borrowings from

the Federal Reserve averaged $360 million. Federal funds traded at

an average rate of around 5-1/8 per cent until the last few days.

The vicissitudes of the Federal funds market were reflected in the

3-month bill rate. It rose to a peak of 4.64 per cent on February 23,

and then dropped to 4.54 per cent on February 28. Following the

reserve requirement reduction announcement, the rate fell to a new

1967 low of below 4.40 per cent.



CONFIDENTIAL (FR) -3- March 3, 1967.

The tautness of the Federal funds market over the first

three weeks of February partly reflected the development of somewhat

larger basic reserve deficiencies at major New York City banks than

is usual for this time of year. At the same time, funds supplied

to the Federal funds market turned out to be smaller than in recent

months. Banks were holding on to larger amounts of excess reserves

in the middle weeks of February, and the volume of Federal funds

transactions reported through the New York market declined from

the over $5 billion daily average of the past few months to $4.4

billion during the three weeks ending February 22.

The willingness of large banks to pay up for Federal funds

appears consistent with the reduced interest that these banks showed

in selling negotiable CD's last month, especially those maturing in

2 months or more. With bank issuing rates reduced, the net increase

in outstanding CD's declined to around $600 million (measured from

the week ending February 1 to an estimate for the week ending

March 1). Gross CD sales declined to $4.8 billion in February from

$7.4 billion in January. It would appear that banks early in

February may have come to prefer to borrow at short-term, including

day to day in the Federal funds market, in the expectation at that

time that market interest rates were going to decline further or

simply because credit demands were not burgeoning. In any event,

this behavior tended to put upward pressure on the Federal funds

rate, which in turn, as it persisted, contributed to the fading of

declining rate expectations.



CONFIDENTIAL (FR) -4- March 3, 1967.

The growth rate of time deposits was 20 per cent on

average in February, but the rate of growth dropped considerably as

the month progressed and banks became less active in the CD market.

Private demand deposits and the money supply also rose in February

on average--at annual rates of 6.2 per cent and 6.4 per cent

respectively--and the increases were sharper from month-end to

month-end. Private deposit expansion reflected the active buying

by banks of U.S. Government and State and local government securities

during the month. U.S. Government deposits showed little net change

on average during the month.

Looking at bank deposits and bank credit from the perspective

of the past three months (December-February), the daily average series

for total member bank deposits has risen at an annual rate of 11.8

per cent (and 10.5 per cent after inclusion of borrowing from abroad).

At the same time, the end of month series for outstanding credit of

all commercial banks has risen by a 10.8 per cent annual rate (on

the basis of preliminary estimates).

Most of this expansion has been based on time deposits,

of course. In terms of relative shares, time and savings deposits

account for 75 per cent of total member bank deposit growth during

the 3-month period. Using a rough and ready seasonal adjustment,

negotiable CD's accounted for 35 per cent of such total deposit

growth. Private demand deposits account for about 10 per cent of

the growth, and U.S. Government deposits 15 per cent.



CONFIDENTIAL (FR) -5- March 3, 1967.

Prospective developments

The easier conditions in the money market that have recently

prevailed (excluding the unusually easy conditions related specifically

to the end of a double reserve settlement period) can be characterized

as including a Federal funds rate in the 4-1/2 - 5 per cent range, but

averaging a little below 4-3/4 per cent, and a 3-month Treasury bill

rate in a 4.30 - 4.50 per cent range. The difficulties in specifying

consistent money market relationships are compounded by the uncertain

effects of the reserve requirement reduction. The reserves released

will be widely distributed throughout the country, and, in particular,

will affect a great many smaller banks who may be sluggish in utilizing

the funds. Thus, over the next few weeks it is probable that a

fairly substantial level of net free reserves (possibly rising into

the $100-$200 million range) will at times be needed in order to

maintain the more comfortable over-all money market conditions that

have developed.

Factors that would tend to tighten the money market in the

weeks ahead include: (a) the auction of $2.7 billion of June tax

bills on March 7 (with only 50 per cent tax and loan credit); (b)

the CD maturities and loan demand associated with March dividend and

tax dates; (c) the reduction in the usual seasonal System bill

purchases in the open market in view of the reserve requirement

reduction and of the expected temporary decline in the Treasury's

balance at the Federal Reserve (and perhaps direct borrowing by the



CONFIDENTIAL (FR) -6- March 3, 1967.

Treasury) prior to mid-March; and (d) the possibility that part of

the expected $600-$900 million of publicly offered FNMA PC's may

be in the relatively short-term area. However, over the coming

period as a whole, bill demand from the public is likely to be

fairly strong, including re-investment of proceeds from large capital

market issues, and will provide an offset to such upward market pressures.

Money market pressures are most likely to develop in

connection with the March tax date. The corporate income tax

payments themselves in March, at an estimated $6.8 billion, are

slightly lower than last year, but they are funded to a relatively

lesser extent by maturing tax bills; however, the regular weekly bill

matures the day after the tax date and the proceeds may be used by

some corporations to finance tax payments. CD's maturing on the

tax date, at $760 million this year, are little changed from last

year. It might also be noted that corporations will not have to

remit withheld individual income taxes on the corporate tax date

this year, but will make these payments in two instalments on March 5

and March 20. Thus, one might not expect the tax date, taken alone,

to be associated with exceptional money market pressure, but normal

seasonal stresses may be augmented by other factors noted in the

previous paragraph, and in particular by the market's need to

absorb the new tax bills.



CONFIDENTIAL (FR)

With respect to long-term market rates, it

appears likely that they will not back up significantly over the period

ahead in view of the recent abatement of bearish expectations about the

course of bond prices. But the very large March corporate and State

and local government calendar, plus the longer-term portion of the

PC's, will probably tend to forestall any very significant rate

declines--unless investors and borrowers come strongly to expect

further market easing because of additional monetary policy actions

and/or mounting signs of economic weakness.

On the bank credit and deposit side, the easier money market

conditions that have developed appear consistent with a 6-8 per cent

increase in the bank credit proxy during March on average. This

reflects mainly a continuation of the slower pattern of time

deposit growth, especially of CD's. For the month on average time

deposits are expected to rise by 8-10 per cent. While banks have

the potential for increasing their outstanding CD's sharply, they

no longer appear so interested, given the rebuilding they have already

accomplished and the uncertain outlook for loan demands, especially

beyond the coming March and April tax dates.

The current bank credit projection, which we believe

consistent with developments in the real economy projected in the

green book, assumes that business loan growth at banks will be moderate

in March and that banks will not repeat the unusually rapid February

restocking of security portfolios. However, the June tax bill

CONFIDENTIAL (FR) -8- March 3, 1967.

which will be paid for on March 13, will have an expansive effect on

bank credit in the latter part of the month. Partly for that reason

the bank credit proxy is projected to expand at a 10-12 per cent

annual rate from the beginning to the end of the month, as compared

with about a 7.5 per cent annual rate from the beginning to the

end of February.

The money supply is expected to rise sharply in March at

a 9-11 per cent annual rate on average, mainly reflecting the sharp

increases of late February which carry over to affect the March

average. Payments for the tax bill (with 50 per cent coming

directly from the public) are likely to hold down growth later in

March. And from the end of February to the end of March, little net

change in money supply is projected. U.S. Government deposits are

expected to decline slightly on average in March, but will build up

after mid-month.

To encourage a continued downward trend in interest rates,

a further easing of money market conditions would appear to be

required. This could involve a Federal funds rate fluctuating around

the discount rate and a level of net free reserves perhaps as high

as $200-$300 million, depending on bank reactions to the reserve

requirement reduction. This would undoubtedly keep the bill rate

below the present discount rate, perhaps in a 4.15-4.40 per cent

range. Under such conditions, expectations could develop that would



CONFIDENTIAL (FR) -9- March 3, 1967.

contribute to downward yield movement throughout the market structure.

But it would still be unlikely that corporate rates would move the

entire way back to or through their late January early February

lows.

In a period such as that ahead, it is very difficult to

gauge the likely bank credit expansion consistent with easing market

rates. Reportedly, there is still substantial business financing

demand for such activities as restructuring financial positions,

financing take-overs, providing for spring tax payments and other

needs not directly linked to current GNP spending. Some of the

recent bulge in capital market financing has been for such purposes--

perhaps a substantial part--and some of these demands might move back

to banks if bank reserve pressures were eased further and bank rates

reduced. To accommodate these demands and also the financing of

expenditures directly generating industrial activity and employment

might result in substantial reserve provision and bank credit

expansion, associated with further interest rate declines. Under

these circumstances, bank credit expansion might be at an annual

rate of 10 per cent or more. On the other hand, if loan demands were

weak--either because widespread business inventory adjustments are

in process or because earlier backlogs of pending loans are worked

off--bank credit expansion might tend to fall short of these

expectations unless banks continued to expand security holdings

sharply further.
