MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Recent Developments

(1) The effective federal funds rate, at 5.82 percent,

averaged a bit above the FOMC's intended level of 5.75 percent over

the intermeeting period. The overage reflected strong demands for

reserves at the close of two maintenance periods as well as pressures

associated with the bunching of the settlement of several Treasury

issues caused by debt ceiling disruptions and with the mid-December

corporate tax date.1 As they did at the time of the last meeting,

market participants appear to expect a cumulative easing of about 50

basis points in the federal funds rate between December and next

April. As the expected easing drew nearer, shorter-term rates moved

down 5 to 15 basis points over the intermeeting period.2

(2) Long-term rates declined about 1/4 percentage point over

the intermeeting period, as markets interpreted incoming information

as suggesting that spending would be restrained and inflation less

likely to pick up. Available survey evidence suggests that inflation

expectations have been falling (chart). The rate on the thirty-year

Treasury bond has returned to levels last seen in late 1993--before

1. The Treasury's ability to issue marketable debt under the $4.9
trillion debt ceiling was preserved for a time when the Secretary of
the Treasury announced he would liquidate up to $61.3 billion of
nonmarketable debt by disinvesting the Civil Service Retirement and
Disability Fund ($39.8 billion) and the Federal Employees Retirement
Fund ($21.5 billion). The Secretary later indicated that by not
paying interest on the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund
the debt-ceiling constraint can be avoided until February of next
year.

2. The single exception occurred for one-month instruments, as
their maturity dates crossed the year end. However, premiums for
year-end funds are lower than those of recent years, in part
reflecting reduced demands from Japanese banks, which are reported to
have locked in much of their funding needs earlier than usual.

the tightening in monetary policy. The Treasury yield curve out to

ten years is now at or below the current federal funds rate, which is

a fairly rare occurrence (chart). However, the inversion in the cur-

rent term structure is slight--much less than before past recessions.

Moreover, for the most part, previous flattenings and inversions of

the yield curve have occurred when the Federal Reserve was tightening

and long-term rates rose by less than short-term rates. An exception

occurred in 1986, when, much like now, long-term rates declined more

than short-term rates. That episode was followed by a strengthening

in the economic expansion. Over the recent intermeeting period,

equity prices continued to move upward about in tandem with bond

prices; since early this year, bond and equity prices are up about 30

percent.

(3) The dollar's weighted-average exchange value rose nearly

2 percent over the intermeeting period, appreciating more against

European currencies and less against the yen. With growth in many

foreign industrial countries disappointing, interest rates abroad

fell; over the past several days, monetary policy interest rates were

eased 25 to 50 basis points in every major European country except

Italy. Mexican financial markets stabilized somewhat during the

period, perhaps reflecting signs that the Mexican economy has bottomed

out. The peso appreciated 2 percent against the dollar, and Mexican

short-term interest rates declined 5 to 15 percentage points.

U.S.

monetary authorities did not intervene.

(4) Recent data suggest that the federal and nonfederal

components of the domestic nonfinancial debt aggregate have continued

to expand at a slower pace than earlier in the year. Nonfederal debt



is estimated to have risen in October at about a 4 percent pace.

Federal borrowing has been held down by restrictive continuing resolu-

tions and the Treasury running down its cash balance in the face of

the debt-ceiling constraint. Owing to strength earlier in the year,

however, growth of the debt of all nonfinancial sectors from the

fourth quarter of 1994 through October was at a rate of 5-1/4 percent,

about at the midpoint of its monitoring range. The moderation of

borrowing in the second half of the year apparently indicates reduced

credit demands, as little evidence has emerged of any significant

tightening in credit supply conditions. Yield spreads on investment-

grade debt have widened slightly this year but remain narrow by his-

torical standards; for high-yield instruments, the widening has been

more marked, but spreads remain appreciably below those prevailing

from 1989 to as recently as 1993. As for the household sector, banks

have given only scant indication that they have tightened lending

conditions despite increases this year in delinquency and charge-off

rates on consumer loans; it appears, however, that moves toward

greater credit accommodation have ceased.

(5) Bank credit expansion in recent months has been held

down by a shift of funding toward capital market instruments as long-

term rates have fallen. Partly as a result, M3 growth slowed to a

1-1/2 percent rate in November. Even so, M3 expanded at a 6 percent

rate from the fourth quarter of 1994 through November, at the upper

bound of its 1995 growth range. Such growth implies a decline in the

velocity of M3 this year after eight years of increases. The

turnaround in velocity reflects the greater volume of funds supplied



by depository institutions as well as a reduced reliance by banks this

year on their foreign offices as a source of funding. 3

(6) M2 advanced at a 3 percent rate last month, following a

slight contraction in October. As a result of its robust growth ear-

lier in the year, however, M2 remains in the upper half of its 1995

growth cone, posting an increase of 4-1/4 percent since the fourth

quarter of last year. The velocity of M2 is likely to be about

unchanged in 1995, the first year since 1991 in which it has failed to

register a significant increase. M2's advance this year has been

somewhat stronger than predicted by the staff's standard model. This

error may reflect the behavior of long-term rates, a variable not

included in that model but whose substantial decline this year may

have made M2 assets more attractive.4

(7) M1 contracted at a 3-1/2 percent rate last month, as

more banks initiated programs to sweep funds out of other checkable

deposits. Abstracting from these new sweeps, M1 is estimated to have

grown at about a 1 percent rate in November. The other components of

M1 also were weak last month: Demand deposits edged down and currency

expansion slowed to a 1-1/2 percent rate.5  The recent sluggishness

in currency expansion appears to owe mainly to lackluster demand from

3. Exceptions to this pattern were branches and agencies of
Japanese banks, which turned to funding from home offices and
affiliates after they encountered resistance in U.S. funding markets.

4. Preliminary data indicate that M2 plus bond and stock mutual
funds advanced at a 7-1/2 rate in November and at a 7-1/4 percent
rate since the fourth quarter of 1994.

5. In November, the monetary base expanded at a 3/4 percent rate
and total reserves dropped at a 12-1/4 percent rate. Adjusted for the
estimated effect of sweeps on required reserves, the monetary base
expanded last month at a 2 percent rate and total reserves declined at
a 2 percent rate. Reflecting the slowing of currency growth and the
effects of sweep accounts on reserves, the monetary base has grown
about 4 percent this year, down from 8-1/2 percent last year.
Adjusted for the effects of sweeps, the monetary base expanded at a
4-3/4 percent annual rate from the fourth quarter of 1994 to November.



abroad, likely reflecting a reluctance to acquire large denomination

bills in advance of the scheduled introduction of the new $100 note

next year. For 1995, M1 has contracted around 2 percent; the initial

effects of sweeps have depressed this aggregate around 3 percentage

points this year.

6. On a monthly average basis through November, the cumulative
initial effect of sweep arrangements is estimated to have reduced
balances in OCDs by about $45 billion ($35 billion in 1995); the
associated reduction in required reserves is estimated to be about
$4-1/4 billion.

Policy Alternatives

(8) As noted above, credit markets seem to have priced in a

drop of about a half percentage point in the federal funds rate over

the next few months; their expectations include about even odds on a

25 basis point move at the December meeting. Disentangling expecta-

tions about the path of the federal funds rate from the yield curve

beyond the next several months is problematic, but judging from the

current Treasury term structure, as well as from Eurodollar futures

rates, market participants do not appear to have strong convictions as

to subsequent policy moves. The flat profile of nominal rates over

the longer horizon--after a near-term downward adjustment to the

stance of policy is made--would seem to be consistent with stable,

moderate inflation over time, which in turn would imply that the

economy is anticipated to remain around its potential. This reading

from market quotes is broadly in line with the outlook of professional

forecasters, as represented by the Blue Chip survey.

(9) In these circumstances, adoption of the unchanged money

market conditions of alternative B could prompt a small backup in

market interest rates. The rise in yields is likely to be damped, as

investors would continue to expect monetary policy easing before long.

The sense that policy action was merely postponed would be more pro-

nounced if a budget agreement had not been reached by the time of the

Committee meeting. Maintenance of the current monetary policy stance

over time, however, particularly after a budget agreement has been

struck, would lead market participants to reexamine their expectations

for monetary policy. If they saw the current 5-3/4 percent funds rate

being sustained for a considerable period in the context of a satis-

factorily performing macroeconomy, then long-term rates might ulti-

mately rise by no more than the approximately 1/2 percentage point

"surprise" in the funds rate. Such an increase would reverse only a



small portion of the drop in rates over the last year, returning

nominal long-term rates to about their levels of late summer, while

leaving real rates perhaps a bit higher than they were at that time

given the downward drift in inflation expectations over recent months.

(10) The Greenbook forecast embodies a backup of longer-term

yields of this magnitude with a flat federal funds rate through most

of the forecast period. Nonetheless, because the staff assessment is

that aggregate demand will be slightly stronger than implicit in

financial markets or the Blue Chip survey, the higher trajectory of

interest rates is seen as consistent with output remaining close to

potential and inflation running around 3 percent over the next two

years. Accordingly, in the staff forecast, alternative B keeps policy

on a path that produces results for economic growth and inflation over

1996 closely in line with the Committee's expectations for next year

that were reported in July.

(11) Although market participants expect monetary policy to

be eased over the next few months, a reduction of 50 basis points in

the federal funds rate implemented at this meeting, as called for

under alternative A, would be larger than generally expected. Other

short-term rates would fall appreciably, and the value of the dollar

would probably decline on foreign exchange markets. The response of

long-term yields would depend on the market's interpretation of this

action, which in turn could be influenced by the content of the

announcement. Bond rates might decline only modestly to the extent

that the action were viewed as merely realigning nominal rates to the

surprisingly damped inflation of the last half of the year. If mar-

kets thought the Committee were anticipating further moderation of

inflation, especially as a consequence of underlying weakness in

aggregate demand that implied lower real as well as nominal rates

going forward, then rate declines would be more pronounced. Such



substantial reductions in bond yields would fuel additional increases

in equity prices as investors discounted expected earnings at the

lower rates. While there is some risk that market participants would

interpret an easing as indicating insufficient regard for the longer-

term inflation outlook, this risk would be greater for a 50 basis

point cut than for a 25 basis point move. The latter is closer to

market expectations and, judging from the yield curve, would be seen

as consistent with moderate economic growth. Thus, the smaller cut is

less likely to spark major changes in market rates.

(12) Under the staff forecast, alternative A would risk

fostering greater inflation pressures, and the move would eventually

need to be reversed. Thus, choice by the Committee of this alterna-

tive would presumably be based on an assessment that aggregate demand

is more likely to flag than under the staff forecast and that infla-

tion and inflation expectations are more likely to decline. Optimism

on inflation might be based on the observation that inflation has come

in lower than expected at mid-year and inflation expectations have

abated significantly. As a consequence, real short-term rates are

perhaps higher than the Committee had anticipated when it established

the 5-3/4 percent funds rate. The good performance of the economy in

the face of these real short-term rates may be seen as reflecting in

part the rally in capital markets, which, however, has been based to a

degree on expectations of policy ease. In the absence of policy

action, real longer-term interest rates and exchange rates would be

pushed higher, and an easing could be based on concern that these

higher real rates risked an unduly sluggish economy in the future.

Indeed, the favorable inflation-output mix of the second half of 1995

might be seen as indicating that the economy is capable of operating

on a sustained basis at a higher level of output and hence lower

levels of real interest rates than in the staff forecast.



-10-

(13) With market participants expecting an easing rather than

a tightening of policy, the 50-basis-point increase in the federal

funds rate under alternative C would lead to a sharp jump in other

money market interest rates. Yields on intermediate- and longer-term

issues would likely rise as well, as real interest rates expected over

coming quarters firmed considerably, and probably by more in the short

run than any decline in inflation expectations. The value of the

dollar on foreign exchange markets would increase appreciably.

(14) The FOMC might select alternative C if it saw the risks

to inflation at current interest rates as reasonably well balanced and

wished to gain more assurance of making longer-term progress toward

price stability. Despite declines this year, survey-based measures of

inflation expectations have only reached levels of recently observed

inflation and still do not anticipate further disinflation. Given the

demand and inflation relationships incorporated in the staff forecast,

the rise in the federal funds rate under alternative C would tilt the

inflation rate down slightly in 1997. With the economy already

operating in the neighborhood of its potential and aggregate demand

possibly bolstered by the sharp declines in interest rates of the past

year, an increase in inflationary pressures cannot be ruled out.

Although growth of the standard monetary aggregates has been slow

recently, the broad aggregates have expanded fairly briskly for 1995

as a whole, and credit through intermediaries and in the securities

markets remains readily available.

credit growth for the November-to-March period under the unchanged

money market conditions of alternative B.7 Broad measures of money

and credit are expected to pick up some in coming months, partly in

conjunction with stronger growth in nominal GDP. Credit supply condi-

tions should remain favorable under that outlook, especially for

firms. Households reduce their borrowing a bit in view of slackening

growth of spending on durables and rising debt-service difficulties,

but growth of their debt still outpaces that of nominal income. Busi-

ness borrowing picks up, buoyed by a brisk pace of merger deals.

Although firms are drawn to the bond market by attractive long-term

rates, borrowing from shorter-term sources, including banks, remains

substantial. Total debt growth accelerates to a 5 percent pace over

the November-March period, leaving domestic nonfinancial sector debt

near the middle of its provisional 3-to-7 percent monitoring range.

(16) In the staff forecast, bank credit growth edges up in

the next few months from its recent depressed rate, as banks stop

running off securities. With Japanese branches and agencies already

having shifted financing to their home offices or other affiliates,

the runoff of CDs at these institutions should wind down, so that

going forward depository institutions as a whole rely more on liabili-

ties in M3 to finance credit growth. Expansion of M3 picks up to a

5-3/4 percent annual rate over the November-to-March period under

alternative B. M2 growth also firms from its unexpectedly weak pace

so far in the fourth quarter. The projected rebound in nominal income

growth supports an acceleration of retail deposits, and the lagged



-12-

effects of recent declines in short-term rates and associated reduc-

tions in opportunity costs also buoy money demand. M2 would be just

above the upper end of its provisional 1 to 5 percent annual range in

March, and M3 would be at the upper end of its tentative 2 to 6 per-

cent range.

(17) In contrast to the rebound projected for the broader

aggregates, M1 is forecast to continue to decline, at a 3-3/4 percent

annual rate, from November to March. The expected weakness in this

aggregate mainly reflects anticipation that retail sweep accounts will

continue to spread. Supporting money growth, the expansion of

currency, particularly its foreign-held component, should rebound

beginning in February, when the new series $100 bill becomes avail-

able.

(18) The spread of retail sweep accounts will be reflected in

a further decline in required and total reserves.10  The drop in

required reserve balances poses the possibility that required operat-

ing balances (required reserve balances plus required clearing bal-

ances) may not satisfy demands for such balances at all times and

could on occasion prompt increased and unpredictable demands for

excess reserves. In early 1991, following a reduction in reserve

requirements by the Federal Reserve, required operating balances fell

to a low of around $18 billion--apparently lower than the level banks

8. The staff forecast assumes that about $9 billion of new sweep
arrangements are implemented in December and $4 billion in each of the
first three months of 1996. Abstracting from sweep accounts, M1 would
grow at a 1-3/4 percent annual rate through March in the staff
projection.

9. With currency growth projected to increase, the monetary base is
expected to accelerate late in the first quarter, although from
November to March its expansion is projected at only a 1-1/2 percent
annual rate.

10. From November through March, total reserves are forecast to fall
$2 billion, or 11 percent at an annual rate, in seasonally adjusted
terms.



-13-

needed at that time for clearing purposes. As a result, excess

reserve demands temporarily increased on average and fluctuated

appreciably, and money market conditions became quite volatile.

Absent an unexpected explosion of sweep activity in the next few

weeks, the staff projects that required operating balances generally

will remain above $20 billion through the first quarter, though they

could fall below this level temporarily, reflecting seasonal declines

in transaction deposits. How low operating balances would need to

fall before presenting problems is an open question; banks have made

improvements in their reserve management over the past few years, and

the banks introducing sweep programs evidently believe they can manage

their reserve position with balances lower than current requirements.

Nonetheless, the prospects for further erosion of reserves caused by

sweeps suggest that increased volatility could be encountered at some

point.
