The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain. 
 

Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These

1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked

Class II – FOMC

MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Recent D evelopments

(1) The events in financial markets prior to the terrorist attacks might seem

to read like ancient history by now:  The Committee’s quarter-point reduction in the

intended federal funds rate on  August 21 was widely  expected and  barely sent a ripp le

through markets.  In the days that followed, most market interest rates edged lower in

light of generally downbeat news on  the economy, including the release of the August

employment data in ear ly September, and broad  equity indexes fell apprec iably. 

Shortly after the terrorist attacks on September 11, the System announced that the

discount window was available to meet liquidity needs and began to provide a massive

amount of reserves through the window later that day and through open market

operations on the next day.  (See the box for a discussion of Desk operations and

reserve markets in the aftermath of the attacks.)  Market participants  evidently

interpreted the interruptions to production and spending ensuing from the terrorist

attacks and the possible knock-on effects on asset prices and confidence as

necessitating a considerable monetary policy response.  In the event, on September

17, the FOMC reduced the target federal funds rate ½ percentage point to 3 percent

and said in the press release that unusually large volumes of liquidity would continue

to be supplied until more normal financial market functioning was restored.  In recent

days, investors appear to be interpreting the sketchy information available on

economic conditions since September 11 as pointing to a gloomier outlook for the

economy, and federal funds futures quotes seem to incorporate high odds of another

50 basis point move at the October meeting and further easing in coming months that

would bring the funds rate to the neighborhood of 2 to 2¼ percent by early next year

(Chart 2).  As has been the case for some time, market participants apparently expect



- 2 -

that policy will reverse course fairly promptly, with about 1 percentage point of

firming next year embedded in market interest rates, although option prices indicate

that investors are unusual ly uncertain about this trajectory. 

Desk Operations and Reserve Markets in the Wake of the Sept. 11 Attacks 

The operations of some banks and federal funds brokers were seriously disrupted by the
effects of the terrorist attacks.  To help deal with these dislocations to markets and
payment systems, the System provided an immense volume of reserves through open
marke t operations and d iscount w indow lending  and also  established swap  lines with
several foreign central banks, one of which was partially drawn down (as shown in the
table in Chart 1).  A large add itional volume of reserves was created by check float as air
transportation was halted.  Although other factors–notably a significant expansion in the
foreign RP pool–absorbed a portion of these reserves, reserve balances swelled

dramatically, peaking at $114 billion on September 13.  The System suspended its fees and
penalties for daylight and overnight overdrafts for a time to ease the challenges banks
faced in managing reserve positions.  To facilitate settlement in the Treasury securities
market, the Desk temporarily eased its rules on securities lending, and dealers borrowed
record amounts of securities from the System.  Late in the week, discount window
borrowing plunged, returning to more normal levels as a result of the enlarged volume of
nonborrowed reserves and better functioning of the reserve market.  As air transportation
resumed, the level of float dropped back to more u sual levels by ea rly the following week. 

With the fed funds market functioning more normally, the Desk gradually cut back
the provision of reserves through open market operations, and the level of reserve
balances began to drop sharply.  Nonetheless, the demand for and supply of
reserve balances has remained somewhat above usual levels.

In the immediate aftermath of the attacks, banks mostly traded reserves at the 3½ 
percent target federal funds rate under an informal convention, with a substantial
proportion of direct, rather than brokered, transactions.  As more normal
functioning resumed in the funds market, the federal funds rate fell below the
FOMC’s formal targets for several days but fluctuated around the new target last
week (as seen in  the lower panel of Chart 1 ).

(2) Rates on short- and intermediate-term Treasury securities fell about 60

to 110 basis points on balance over the intermeeting period, with the bulk of the

decline occurring after September 11.  The prices for these securities appear to have

been boosted by actual and expected easing of the stance of monetary policy as well as

safe-haven demands amid sharp fluctuations in equity prices and heightened global

economic and po litical uncertainties.  Yields on ten-year Treasury notes declined

about 30 basis points, however, and those on thirty-year bonds were flat, buoyed in

part by investor concerns about the deteriorating outlook for the federal budget

surplus and the future supply of Treasury debt.

(3) Some of the infrastructure of the Treasury securities market was

damaged or destroyed by the terrorist actions.  Since then, market functioning has

improved considerably but remains somewhat impaired.  Virtually all brokers and

dealers have resumed operations, although many are operating at backup locations

and a number of firms have scaled back their market-making.  Trading volumes for

on-the-run issues have returned to historical ranges, and bid-asked spreads have

narrowed.  Nonetheless, such spreads remain slightly elevated, the amounts that can

be transacted at those spreads are smaller than usual, and trading  in off-the-run issues

is quite limited.  W hile clearance and  settlement mechanisms are now generally

performing normally, market participants report that a considerable volume of trades

from September 11  have yet to be reconciled.  Partly as a consequence, the incidence

of failed securities trades remains relatively high.

(4) Yields on investment-grade corporate bonds were generally about

unchanged on balance over the intermeeting period, with the exception of those on

relatively short-term or very highly rated obligations, such as federal agency debt,

which dropped considerably.  Junk bond yields, however, jumped more than  100 basis

points over the period.  Issuance of corporate bonds ceased for a few days after



- 4 -

September 11, and investment-grade firms have accounted for virtually all the issuance

since then.  Trading activity in secondary markets for corporate bonds also has picked

up in recent days but remains noticeably below normal, particularly in the h igh-yield

sector.  The commercial paper market was significantly disrupted, leading to brief

involuntary extensions of paper that would otherwise have matured, but issuance and

activity have since rebounded; during the interruption, some firms reportedly drew on

backup lines of credit at commercial banks.  Discussions with several large banks

indicate that most have not yet adjusted their terms and standards for business loans

since September 11, but loan requests from firms in selected industries are being

scrutinized more carefully; some of the banks contacted said that loan demand had

weakened notably .  Equity markets were closed for  four days following the attacks. 

After the markets reopened, broad  equity price indexes tumbled, but in recent days

they have recovered part of those losses on balance, bringing their cumulative declines

over the intermeeting period to  13 to 22 percent.  Intraday price changes in the equity

market were quite large, and forward-looking measures of uncertainty inferred from

options prices are unusually high.

(5) The dollar’s average exchange value against other major currencies was

about unchanged on balance over the intermeeting period, as modest dollar

appreciation early in the period was erased following the attacks.  The dollar var ied in

a wide range against the yen, ending the period ¾ percent lower.  Against the euro,

the dollar slipped ½ percent on balance.  In contrast, the dollar gained about

2 percent vis-à-vis the Canadian dollar, as investors reacted to signs that the slowdown

in that country could be particularly abrupt.  Central banks in most foreign industrial

countries appreciably eased policy after the attacks, typically by 50 basis points, but

long-term yields generally moved little on net.  Share prices fell sharply on all major

exchanges, in many cases by more than in this country.                                                   ,

                                                                 U.S. authorities did not intervene for the ir

own accounts.

(6) The dollar’s exchange value against the currencies of our other important

trading partners rose 2 percent during the intermeeting period, driven especially by the

reaction in Latin  American markets to  the more uncertain globa l economic

environment.  The dollar gained 7¼ percent against the Brazilian real, and it rose 4¾

percent against the peso, as Mexican output declined and as investors worried about

an intensification of the spillovers from the U.S. slowdown.  Trading in emerging

market debt was severely reduced for almost a week.  Once trading recovered,

emerging market bond spreads increased sharply, with those on Latin American

sovereign debt widening by 50 to 200 basis points on net over the intermeeting

period.  

(7) M2 growth sp iked to an estimated 19 percent annual rate in September

as the result of a record $165 billion surge in this aggregate for the week ending

September 17.  In that week, disruptions to the infrastructure of financial markets led

to a large involuntary accumulation of liquid deposits, which is expected to have

largely run off in the subsequent week.  A heightened demand for safe and  liquid

assets apparently encouraged  further substitutions from equity mutua l funds into

deposits in M2.  The flight to safety and the intermeeting policy easing spurred a

resurgence in institution-only money market funds in September, further lifting M3

growth.  Domestic nonfinancial sector deb t expanded a t a 4¾ percen t pace in August,

about in line w ith its average growth since the fourth quarter  of last year.  The growth

of nonfedera l debt remained relatively low, as the liquidation of inventories likely

allowed firms to run off short-term debt.  With the Treasury raising funds to finance

tax rebates, federal debt rose at around a 7½ percent annual rate in August, somewhat

faster than in the previous month.

Policy Alternatives

(8) The information that had accumulated up to September 11  pointed to

weaker economic activity than the staff had anticipated at the time of the August

FOMC meeting .  Since then, in response to the dislocations to economic activity

arising from the terrorist attacks, the further drop in equity prices, and an expected

marking down of household and business confidence, the staff has revised down

substantially its near-term outlook and now shows a mild downturn in real GDP in

the Greenbook this year and only a modest uptick, on balance, in the first half of

2002.  In light of this much weaker outlook, the staff has assumed that the federal

funds rate will be reduced another 50 basis points this fall and then held steady at 2½

percent until it is raised gradually in the second half of 2003.  Fiscal policy is assumed

to provide a moderate impetus to growth over the next two years.  Long-term interest

rates are expected  to hold at about their current levels into early next year and then to

drift down, the dollar to depreciate slightly, and equity prices to fall in the near term

on earnings disappointments but to trend higher thereafter.  With the growth of

spending projected to fall short of that of potential output growth until mid 2002, the

unemployment rate is expected to reach 6¼ percent and then to decline just slightly

toward the end of the forecast period.  The resulting slack in resources, as well as the

pass-through effects of lower oil prices, allows core PCE and CPI inflation to edge

down to 1½ percent and 2¼ percent, respectively, in 2003.

(9) If the Committee, like the staff, saw a high probability of protracted

economic weakness ahead and, as a consequence, a substantial rise in the

unemployment rate and a decline in core inflation, it presumably would  ease policy

further, as assumed in the Greenbook.  The Committee may see the staff forecast as

embodying an appreciable enough downward revision to the prospects for spending

and inflation pressures to justify reducing the intended federal funds rate 50 basis

points at this meeting.  The equilibrium real federal funds rate, which summarizes the

more persistent factors shaping spending and pressures on resources, is now

estimated to be about a full percentage point lower than was thought at the time of

the August meeting according to the measures based on the staff forecast as well as

historical data (as discussed in the box).  Even if the Committee did not think that the

factors depressing spending were likely to be long lasting enough to lower the

equilibrium real funds rate to that extent, those forces still might be seen as

sufficiently persistent to  warrant add itional policy easing for a time.  In addition, with

household  and business confidence possibly fragile, the Committee  may consider it

important to be seen as moving aggressively with another half percentage point

easing.  Indeed, given the prevailing expectation among market participants of such an

action, the Committee might be concerned that a smaller-sized ease could trigger an

inappropr iate tightening of other financial conditions that could prove especially

problemat ic given the remain ing strains in  the financial  market infrastructure. 

Moreover, the Committee may believe that, if aggregate demand proves to be

surprisingly strong, the cost of having eased policy a little too much a t this time would

be relatively small given that inflation expectations are likely to remain well contained.

(10) Investors have largely priced in a  ½ percentage point easing at this

meeting, along with a characterization of the balance of risks as pointed toward

economic weakness.  Accordingly, financial market prices likely would be little

changed if such expectations were realized.  As always, the press release will be

scrutinized for hints of the Comm ittee’s policy intention going forward, and any sense

in the statement that there were higher-than-expected odds of subsequent policy

easing  would trigger a downward ad justment of the expected path of the funds rate . 

In that circumstance, short- and intermediate-term interest rates would likely decline

and equity prices increase.



- 10 -

Equilibrium Real Federal Funds Rate Estimates

One way to assess the stance of monetary policy is by comparing the actual real
federal funds rate to estimates of its equilibrium level.  The equilibrium real federal
funds rate can be defined as the rate consistent with output being at its potential
level once the effects of transitory shocks–those with  dynamics that play out within
a few years–have dissipated.  Chart 4 shows the range spanned by five estimates of
the equilibrium federal funds rate calculated by Board staff, as well as the actual real
federal funds rate and the real funds rates implied by the po licy alternatives
discussed in the text.  (The real funds rate is measured as the nominal federal funds
rate less the lagged four-quarter change in core PCE prices as a proxy for expected
inflation.)

The recent behavior of these measures is shown in the table below the chart.  The
two estimates of the equilibrium rate based on the historical data have declined over
the intermeeting period because current-quarter activity now appears likely to be
weaker than had previously been anticipated.  The two measures of the equilibrium
rate based on the historical data augmented  by the staff projection have declined
considerably further, reflecting the much weaker assessment of aggregate demand
embodied in the staff forecast.  By contrast, the estimate of the equilibrium federal
funds rate based on indexed Treasury yields has changed little.

The revisions to  the measures of the equilibrium funds ra te, while substantial in
some cases, are fairly modest relative to the uncertainty associated with the
estimates.  In the case of the statistical filter method, standard errors of the
estimates can be calculated.  For 2001Q3, these standards errors imply that a 90-
percent confidence interval is roughly 2¼ percentage points on each side of the
point  estimate.

(11) Easing policy 25 basis points at this meeting might be seen by the

Committee as sufficient to induce an adequate recovery of economic growth over the

time frame that such policy action would be felt on spending.  The Committee might

be especially inclined  to adopt this option if it had reason to suspect tha t aggregate

demand would snap back relatively promptly.  For example, the Committee may read

the current political climate as indicating that a considerable degree of fiscal stimulus

is in the offing.   Or the Committee may be of the view that much of the adverse

effects of the terrorist attacks on confidence is likely to be short lived.  In any case,

the outlook for fiscal policy, the state of confidence, and the economy more generally

is quite uncertain at this time, and the Committee may prefer to await further

developments before committing to a larger policy action.  If events turn more

adverse than expected in coming  weeks, an additional easing step could be taken even

before the next meeting.  In contrast, should aggregate demand prove resilient, this

relatively modest ease would provide a b it more assurance of eventually bringing core

inflation down.

(12) The announcement of a 25 basis point easing would surprise market

participants, likely prompting a rise in interest rates, particularly at the short end of the

yield curve, as well as a decline in stock prices.  While the market fully expects an

announcement that the risks remain tilted toward weakness, a more explicit suggestion

of the Committee’s readiness to consider further steps, even in the intermeeting

period, wou ld work to lim it the market reaction to th is policy choice.  

(13) Under the Greenbook forecast, the growth of domestic nonfinancial

debt is expected  to remain subdued in the months ahead.  The federal government is

forecast to resume paying down debt, albeit  at a slower ra te than earlier  this year. 

Household and business debt is pro jected to continue to expand  moderately  in

reflection of the weak outlook for consumer and investment spending.  Much of the



- 12 -

bulge in emergency financing provided by banks immediately following the terrorist

attack should be repaid quick ly, as bond and paper markets have made considerab le

progress in returning to more normal operations.  However, in light o f the likely

increased perception of and lessened willingness to take on risk, investors will

probably rem ain more cautious in extending credit to lower-rated firms, as reflected in

widened risk spreads since the terrorist actions.  Home mortgage borrowing should be

fairly well maintained because of continuing low interest rates.

(14) Under the  assumptions of the Greenbook forecast, M 2 growth is

projected to slow to a 5½ percent pace over the September-to-March period, owing

to declines in household incomes, the waning of effects on money demand of the

cumulative policy easings, and the running off of balances bloated by market

disruptions.  Over the four quarters of 2001, M2 is expected to post robust growth of

around 10 percent, boosted not only by declines in the opportunity cost of holding

money but also by the surge in mortgage refinancings, by unusual demands for U.S.

currency, especially in Argentina, and by the reduced attractiveness of stock market

investments relative to deposits and money funds.  Partly because of these special

factors, the velocity of M2 is expected to drop at a record annual rate of 6¾ percent

this year, faster than would be predicted by the traditional relationsh ip of velocity to

opportunity costs.

Directive and Balance of Risks Language

(15) Presented below for the members' consideration is draft wording for (1)

the directive and (2) the “balance of risks” sentence to be included in the press release

issued after the meeting (not par t of the directive).

(1) Directive Wording

The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial

conditions that will foster price stab ility and promote sustainable growth in

output.  To further its long-run  objectives, the Committee in the immediate

future seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with MAINTAINING/

INCREASING/reducing the federal funds rate AT/to an average of around

___3 percent.

(2) “Balance of Risks” Sentence

Against the background of its long-run goals of price stability and

sustainable economic growth and of the information currently available, the

Committee believes that the risks [ARE BALANCED WITH RESPECT TO

PROSPECTS FOR BOTH GOALS] [ARE WEIGHTED MAINLY

TOWARD CONDITIONS THAT MAY  GENERATE HEIGHTENED

INFLATION PRESSURES] [continue to be weighted m ainly toward

conditions that may generate economic weakness] in the foreseeable future.
