MONETARY AGGREGATES
AND
MONEY MARKET CONDITIONS

Prepared for the Federal Open Market Committee

By the Staff

BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM



MONETARY AGGREGATES AND
MONEY MARKET CONDITIONS

Recent developments

(1) In January, the seasonally unadjusted level of total reserves

at member banks averaged close to the upper end of the target range adopted

by the Committee at the last meeting. The target range was a 20--25 per cent

increase in total reserves seasonally adjusted. Since that meeting, new

seasonal factors have become available for the total reserves series--the end

process of the annual revision of deposits and related series--and the season-

ally adjusted series has been revised accordingly going back to 1959. While

the old, unrevised seasonally adjusted series shows an annual rate of growth

in total reserves from December to January of about 28 per cent, the new

series shows a growth rate for the same period of about 21 per cent. As

measured by the new series, however, the average growth rate for December

and January combined is about the same as in the old series. The appendix

table on page 12 provides a comparison of the old and new series for the past

year.

(2) While reserves came out close to expectations in January, the

mix of deposits was different from staff anticipations. Growth in the narrowly-

defined money stock for January, at a 3-1/2 per cent annual rate, was short of

expectations, as the table shows, but growth of bank time and savings deposits

other than large CD's greatly exceeded our estimates. This latter increase

seems to have reflected in part business and institutional interest in such

accounts, given existing rate relationships. With time deposits very strong,

expansion in both the broader money supply and the bank credit proxy was more

rapid than projected at the time of the last meeting.

(3) Over the full inter-meeting period, the Federal funds rate

declined by about a half percentage point, from nearly 3.75 per cent to

about 3.25 per cent. With the narrowly-defined money supply growing less

rapidly than expected and with a sizable Treasury financing in the market,

the Desk did not move aggressively to hold growth of total reserves within

the 20-25 per cent range. The easing of money market conditions was reflect-

ed in net declines of most other short-term rates, including further cuts in

the prime rate. Most recently, the 3-month Treasury bill has been trading

around 3 per cent, down about 15 basis points over the period. But the

market has continued to anticipate future short-term rate increases as the

Treasury finances the large deficit. Such expectations, together with reports

of sizable continuing forward calendars of new corporate and municipal bonds

and to some extent the debt extension involved in the Treasury's recent

refinancing, contributed to a general 25--35 basis points yield advance in

bond markets.

Prospective relationships among aggregates and interest rates

(5) The table below summarizes three alternative patterns of

prospective relationships among monetary aggregates and money market con-

ditions that the staff believes to be consistent. The anticipated behavior

of monetary aggregates is indexed in the summary table by data on M1,

but the patterns for all of the key aggregates--M1, M2, the adjusted credit

proxy, and total reserves--are shown in the table on the following page.

The lower portions of the ranges shown for money market indicators under

pattern II are representative of recently prevailing conditions.

(6) For M 1 all three patterns involve a more rapid growth in

February and March than in recent months, and growth in the second quarter

larger than in the first quarter. There are three reasons for this expectation:

(a) the lagged impact of recent short-term interest rate declines will be

raising the demand for cash; (b) cash balances have been worked down to more

normal levels relative to income following their sharp increase over the

first seven months of last year so that the overhang of such liquidity will

no longer be exerting a drag on net money demand; (c) transactions demands

for cash are expected to be enlarged, with nominal GNP projected to expand

at about a 10-1/2 per cent annual rate in the first half of this year as

compared with a 6-1/2 per cent rate in the second half of last year.

Finally, it might be noted that in the short run a sharp drop projected

for U.S. Government deposits at commercial banks in February may temporarily

boost M 1 growth in that month.

(7) While demand for, and expansion in, M 1 is expected to increase

substantially, growth in M 2 is likely to decelerate from the January rate,

particularly after February. The extremely rapid rise of time deposits

other than large CD's of the last two months is not expected to persist

over the months ahead. The favorable spread between interest rates on

time and savings accounts and short-term market rates is likely to

narrow; the degree to which this occurs as a result of rising market or

falling institutional rates will depend in part on whether open market

policy tends toward patterns I, II, or III. With business loan demand

expected to remain quite moderate, cuts in interest rates on passbook

savings accounts and time certificates are likely to become more widespread.

Such cuts would probably snowball if the Federal funds and Treasury bill

rates were to move down into the range associated with pattern I, and be

held back--and in some cases rescinded if they had already occurred--if

market rates moved into the range of pattern III.

(8) The adjusted credit proxy is expected to grow much more

slowly in February than in January mainly because of a projected sharp



-7-

drop in U.S. Government deposits. But this will probably be only a temporary

dip, and the rate of increase in bank credit should be sizable in ensuing

months. Growth will not be as large as in the 3-month November-January

period, when it was at a 12 per cent annual rate on average, because of

the slowing that is expected in expansion of time and savings deposits.

Nonetheless, bank credit is likely to be available in ample enough supply

for banks to help support large contra-seasonal Treasury net cash borrow-

ing between now and the end of April and a continued sizable flow of new

municipal securities. At what level of interest rates such support will

be forthcoming will depend in part on the strength of business credit

demands and on changes in money market conditions, which represent the

cost of day-to-day liquidity to banks.

(9) Pattern I implies a substantial enough easing in money market

conditions so that both short- and long-term market interest rates would

be likely to decline from current levels in the short run between now and

the next meeting of the Committee. The actual decline that develops in

short-term rates might be limited by expectations of an early reversal,

however, assuming economic news is favorable. The range of money market

conditions indicated for pattern II encompasses a Federal funds rate high

enough--the range is 3 to 4 per cent--to leave room for a turn-around in

short rates. Even if the funds rate were to remain in the bottom half of

the range, which would be about the prevailing rate, the bill rate could

begin to rise in reflection of increased Treasury borrowing. And, of course,

pattern III would lead to a sharp reversal in short-term rates.



-8-

(10) It is not clear how much short-term rates can increase

without entailing a rise in longer-term rates. The 3-month bill rate at

the moment appears low relative to other bill and short-term market rates,

so that it might rise 20--25 basis points over the near-term with very

little effect on either other short- or long-term rates. A substantially

larger rise could well involve feedback effects on the whole rate structure.

A sizable volume of corporate and municipal issues is currently pressing on

the market, and there is some--though relatively small--volume of new

Treasury coupon issues overhanging the market. Over the longer-run, the

staff still anticipates a significant moderation in the volume of corporate

bond offerings; if this develops, it would likely contribute over time, to

limiting the upward effect on long rates of short-term rate increases.

(11) The total reserves that are likely to be associated with the

monetary aggregates and interest rates shown in patterns I, II, and III are

summarized in the table on page 5. 1/ The figures indicate that in pattern

II, for example, total reserves--following a sharp rise in January--are

likely to decline somewhat in February, show little net change in March,

and rise sharply in April. This pattern reflects, among other things.

swings in U.S. Government deposits and net interbank deposits. Against

private nonbank deposits alone, reserves in January expanded at about a

15 per cent annual rate, and, under pattern II, in February and March are

indicated to increase at 5-1/2 per cent and 10 per cent rates, respectively.

1/ More detailed reserve figures (in millions of dollars, seasonally
unadjusted, and also nonborrowed reserves) have been prepared on a
consistent basis.



Proposed directive

(12) This section presents two alternative formulations for the

second paragraph of the directive (labeled "A" and "B") which are intended

to be--though they do not necessarily have to be--associated with differing

degrees of emphasis in operating procedures between money market conditions

and reserves. Each of the two formulations shows three alternative adjec-

tives qualifying "growth in monetary aggregates over the months ahead."

These adjectives can be taken, if the Committee so wishes, to represent

alternative target rates of growth. To provide a possible quantitative

interpretation of these adjectives, they are numbered I, II, and III to

correspond with the three aggregate patterns described in the preceding

section.

(13) As will be noted in both A and B, it is proposed to delete

the reference to the Treasury financing, and also to international develop-

ments. The latter deletion is suggested on the assumption that the Committee

will no longer consider it necessary to make explicit provision for the

contingency that sudden large reflows from abroad will pose major problems

for open market operations, given the passage of time since the Smithsonian

agreement and the absence to date of market churning as a consequence of

reflows.

(14) Alternative A. This language is proposed for possible

use if the Committee decides that the Desk should focus primarily on money

market conditions as the day-to-day control variable, giving only as much

weight to bank reserves as was customary in most of 1971. This formulation

could also be used, with appropriate interpretation, to call for about the



-10-

same relative emphasis on aggregate reserves and money market conditions as

was decided upon at the January FOMC meeting.

"To implement this policy, [DEL: while taking account of international

developments and the forthcoming Treasury financing,] the Committee

seeks to ACHIEVE [DEL: promote the degree of ease in] bank reserve and
(I - greater )

money market conditions [DEL: essential to] THAT WILL SUPPORT(II - AMPLE )
(III- MODERATE)

growth in monetary aggregates over the months ahead."

The money market conditions the staff expects to be consistent with each

of the three alternative targets for operations are noted in paragraph (5)

above.

(15) Alternative B. This language is proposed for possible

use if the Committee decides that the Desk should place primary emphasis on

bank reserves as the control variable, subject to a proviso constraining

the range of fluctuations in money market conditions. Under this alternative

money market conditions would, of course, be expected to fluctuate more

widely than under A, with the extent of fluctuation depending on the speci-

fic interpretation the Committee attached to the proviso clause.

"To implement this policy, [DEL: while taking account of inter-

national developments and the forthcoming Treasury financing,]

SYSTEM OPEN MARKET OPERATIONS UNTIL THE NEXT MEETING OF the

Committee [DEL: seeks to promote the degree of ease in] SHALL BE CON-

DUCTED WITH A VIEW TO SUPPLYING bank reserves [DEL: and money market
(I - greater )

conditions essential to] AT A RATE CONSISTENT WITH (II - AMPLE )
(III- MODERATE)

growth in monetary aggregates over the months ahead, PROVIDED THAT

MONEY MARKET CONDITIONS DO NOT FLUCTUATE OVER AN UNDULY WIDE RANGE."



-11-

(16) If the Committee were to adopt alternative B it could base

reserve operating targets on the levels and growth rates for reserves shown

earlier to be consistent with either patterns I, II, or III. The Committee

may also wish to allow, in operations, for the effects on reserve levels of

unanticipated changes in U.S. Government deposits, net interbank deposits,

and perhaps large CD's. The effect of anticipated changes in such deposits

was discussed in paragraph (11).

(17) For the proviso clause in alternative B, the Committee may

wish to consider a range of fluctuation for the Federal funds rate as large

as 2 percentage points, as recommended by the report of the Committee on the

Directive. If the Committee were to adopt as targets the aggregates of

pattern II, for example, this would mean widening the funds rate range from

3--4 per cent to 2-1/2--4-1/2 per cent. The range could, of course, be made

more restrictive on either the up or down side, or both, depending on the

extent to which the Committee may wish to emphasize interest rates relative

to aggregate objectives.
