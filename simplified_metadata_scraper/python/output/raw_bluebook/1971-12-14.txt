of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was created 
through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned 
versions text-searchable.2   Though a stringent quality assurance process was 
employed, some imperfections may remain.

Recent developments

(1) The narrowly defined money stock grew a little in November, from

the (upward) revised level for October. Thus, data now available show that

M1 , instead of continuing to edge lower in both October and November as expected,

grew in both months at about a 0.5 per cent annual rate. The October level of

M2 was also revised upward. While M2 ran increasingly above path during

November, its growth rate for the month, because of the higher October base,

p - Preliminary

r - Money stock measures have been revised, beginning in September 1971, to reflect
(1) the formation of new banking institutions doing primarily an international
business, and (2) certain developments related to the widening of the CHIPS
clearing system for international transactions to include agencies of foreign
banks. These revisions raised the level of the money supply in Sept. and Oct.,
but had virtually no net effect after the first few days of November.

December 10, 1971

was no faster than projected. In the case of the credit proxy--for which there

was no revision in the October base--November growth accelerated to more than

a 12 per cent annual rate, roughly double the rate anticipated. In the two

most recent statement weeks, all three aggregates have widened the spread above

their November 16 paths, although data for the week ending December 8 are, of

course, still partly estimated.

(2) Immediately after the last Committee meeting, money market con-

ditions were generally near the upper end of the range specified as consistent

with the policy directive adopted at the meeting. But as M1 continued to show

virtually no growth, the Account Management gradually lowered its Federal funds

rate target. In the first statement week following the meeting the funds rate

averaged 4.86 per cent; by the most recent week the average was down to 4.59 per

cent; and most recent trading has been around 4-3/8--4-1/2 per cent. A cut in

the discount rate by 1/4 point to 4-1/2 per cent at four Federal Reserve Banks

was announced after the close of the market today.

(3) The funds rate fluctuated fairly widely around this declining

trend partly because shortfalls in projections of other reserve factors some-

times resulted in a smaller availability of reserves than anticipated. This

was particularly so in the statement week prior to Thanksgiving when a $400

million clerical error on vault cash compounded the effects of persistent short-

falls in other factors. Average member bank borrowing also varied rather widely

over the period, running up to $700 million in the statement week ending

December 1, when borrowing aggregating $2.4 billion was carried into the

Thanksgiving holiday period, and dropping to only $60 million in the latest

statement week. Net reserve positions of banks also showed rather sizable changes



-3-

ranging from average net borrowed reserves of $344 million to net free reserves

of $54 million in the latest week.

(4) Short-term interest rates have changed little on balance or in

some cases declined somewhat since the last Committee meeting. Treasury bill

rates fluctuated widely during the period, rising as much as 30 basis points

in the latter part of November. This back-up was concentrated in

the Thanksgiving week when successive weekly, monthly, and tax bill auctions

added substantially to bill market supplies at a time when money market con-

ditions were temporarily tight. Since then--with foreign central bank buying

strong--bill yields have dropped sharply, moving the rate on the 3-month maturity

back to the 4.10 per cent level prevailing at the time of the last meeting.

(5) Bond yields also advanced--from 10 to 30 basis points--in the

latter part of November. This weakness was attributable essentially to the

congested state of dealer inventories, following the large November Treasury

refinancing and sizable continued capital market borrowing by corporations and

particularly State and local governments. In the face of deepening market un-

certainties regarding the likely consequence of the apparent stalemate in

international monetary negotiations, dealers became restive about their large

positions and pressed to reduce their exposure. In the Government market this

process was facilitated by System purchases of about $850 million coupon issues.

Thereafter, reports of progress in international negotiations, together with

reduced dealer inventories, led to some rate declines.

(6) As shown in the table on page'5,the supply of nonborrowed

reserves dropped well below the expected path during the week of November 24.



-4-

Even though required reserves were also below path to meet their needs banks

reduced excess reserves and substantially increased borrowings from the Federal

Reserve. On the other hand, in the two most recent statement weeks, nonborrowed

reserves were above path. They were considerably above path in the week ending

December 8, permitting banks to reduce borrowings substantially even though

required reserves were also above path.

(7) The text table on page 6 shows changes in major financial

aggregates for selected recent periods.

Prospective developments

(8) Current international financial negotiations make forecasts

of interest rates and monetary aggregates, and their interrelationships,

much more uncertain than usual. There is a potential for very large reflows

of funds if participants come to believe that little further is to be gained

from keeping funds abroad. However, the timing and nature of any international

agreement, and the strength and speed of market reaction, are very conjectural.

Estimates of the reaction range from a reflow of funds immediately following

a settlement in the order of $10 billion (out of a potential of $15 billion

or more) to a gradual reflow over a period of months.

(9) Because of these major uncertainties as to the timing, magnitude,

and effect of reflows of funds from abroad, we have not built a specific

pattern of reflows related to an international settlement into our projected

relationships of monetary aggregates and interest rates. When they occur,

such reflows are likely to have mainly transitory effects raising both short-

term interest rates, particularly bill rates, and the money supply. Under

current circumstances bill rates could rise as much as 50 basis points if there

were a very sizable reflow within a relatively short period, but we would

expect most of such a rate increase to be worked off over time as the

repatriated funds percolate through financial markets either as loan repayments

or as investments. Other short-term rates might decline some as a result of

the reflows, and the spread of other rates over bill rates would be likely to

narrow. With respect to money supply, the amount by which it may be augmented



-8-

by the return flow is most difficult to foretell, depending as it does on the

speed with which those who repatriate funds are willing or able to shift into

domestic interest earning assets or to repay debt. We would not expect any

very significant effect, even transitorily, on the domestic money supply unless

the return flow were large and concentrated.

(10) Apart from return flows related to an international settlement,

there are questions with respect to the normal year-end pull-back of funds

from abroad to comply with OFDI regulations. These regulations have been amended

this year to give companies the choice of complying by either the end of

January or the end of February as well as the end of December. We have assumed

that this will lower the January average level of M1 by the equivalent of about

2-1/2 percentage points in the annual growth rate--compensated for by an

equivalent increase in the growth rate from January to February. (There may,

of course, be a similar problem at the end of January and the end of February,

but we will attempt to make allowance for it after end-of-year experience.)

(11) Against this background, three alternative sets of

specifications are summarized below. (It might be noted that the growth rates

would be considered as mid-points of ranges--about 1-1/2 percentage points on

either side for monthly changes.)

The more detailed monthly and quarterly paths for all the monetary aggregates

are shown in the table on the next page (with weekly figures and more detail

on aggregate reserves shown in the tables on pp.16 and 17).

(12) With M1 strengthening in recent weeks relative to earlier

expectations, it now appears as if the December average level of the money

supply will be about 4-1/2 per cent above November, given the money market

conditions of either A or B. Money growth would be slightly less under A

than B, but after rounding the difference in rates of growth and levels does

not show up until January. Under alternative C the growth rate in December

might be about 5 per cent.

(13) The growth rate of M1 is expected to slow in January, except

under alternative C. The assumption of a smaller than usual OFDI-related

reflow at year-end temporarily depresses the level of M1 in January and its

rate of growth relative to December. If the reflow turns out to be larger

than assumed M1 growth would, of course, be greater in January. Over the

longer-run, as any temporary distortions of year-end seasonal patterns are

worked out, we would expect M 1 for the first quarter of next year to grow at

a 6 per cent annual rate under A, a 7 per cent rate under B, and an 8 per cent

rate under C. It should be remembered that we have not worked into the monthly

or weekly figures any allowance for reflows arising from an international

settlement.

(14) If the Committee were to retain a 6 per cent first quarter

rate of growth in M1 as one of its targets, it is the staff's best judgment

at this point that associated money market conditions would be tighter than

those prevailing most recently, with the funds rate, for example, moving up in

a 4-1/2--5-1/8 per cent range. The funds rate is now below the mid-point of

the range the staff earlier thought consistent with a 6 per cent first quarter

growth rate. Moreover, transactions demands in the period ahead now appear

likely to be somewhat stronger than earlier assumed. With a 7 per cent first

quarter growth rate, the funds rate may fluctuate in a 4--4-5/8 per cent range,

while at an 8 per cent growth rate we would expect the funds rate to drop

steadily to an average level somewhat below 4 per cent.

(15) The Treasury bill market between now and the next meeting of

the Committee might have to absorb as much as $2-1/2 billion of new bills issued

for cash if the Treasury decides to cushion itself against the risk of

liquidation of special issues by foreign central banks. At the same time

foreign demands for bills, which recently have been very heavy, may be reduced

somewhat. While these developments would tend to raise bill rates, the

effect could be offset by the usual seasonal abatement of short-term market

pressures after mid-December and any expectational effects from today's

discount rate action. Thus, if day-to-day money market conditions are maintained

around those most recently prevailing, the 3-month bill rate may be in a 3-7/8--

4-1/4 per cent range. It would move down from that range under alternative C

and up under alternative A.

(16) In long-term credit markets, fundamental forces working to hold

interest rates down appear strongest in the corporate and mortgage markets.

The corporate calendar appears to be moderating, and in the mortgage market

credit availability appears ample relative to demand. Even under alternative A,

interest rates in these two markets might not show any significant rise. The



-12-

rather large forward calendar of municipal issues and still sizable dealer

holdings of U.S. Government coupon issues make these two markets particularly

sensitive to any reversal of the easing trend in the money market. On the other

hand, if this easing trend were to be extended further, all bond markets

would certainly strengthen.

(17) The recent sizable expansion in the bank credit proxy is not

expected to continue into the early months of next year. The rate of growth

in time deposits other than large CD's is expected to decelerate from its

rapid recent pace, though remaining--under any of the three alternatives--above

the relatively low third quarter pace. And, with business loan demands expected

to be modest at best, banks are not likely to be very aggressive bidders for

CD's. CD interest rates are likely to decline in line with any over-all

reduction in the short-term rate structure, and it is possible that banks

may also, under such circumstances, begin to reduce interest rates on consumer-

type time and savings deposits. Moreover, U.S. Government deposits available

to banks to finance loans and investments are estimated to drop sharply on

balance from December to February.



-13-

Possible directive language

(18) Alternative A. If the Committee wishes to formulate the

directive in terms of money market conditions subject to a proviso clause,

for purposes of the proviso clause it could employ the growth rates of

either alternative A or B--e.g., 6 or 7 per cent, respectively, for M1

in the first quarter. If the Committee favors the alternative A growth

rates, it might adopt the following language.

"To implement this policy, [DEL: the Committee seeks to promote

somewhat greater growth in monetary and credit aggregates over

the months ahead.] System open market operations until the next

meeting of the Committee shall be conducted with a view to

[DEL: achieving bank reserve and] MAINTAINING ABOUT THE money market

conditions THAT HAVE PREVAILED ON AVERAGE SINCE THE PRECEDING

MEETING; [DEL: consistent with that objective] PROVIDED THAT OPERATIONS

SHALL BE MODIFIED IF IT APPEARS THAT THE MONETARY AND CREDIT

AGGREGATES ARE DEVIATING SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE GROWTH PATHS

EXPECTED."

The primary instruction calls for maintaining "about the money market con-

ditions that have prevailed on average since the preceding meeting" because

the mid-points of the ranges for money market conditions noted in paragraph

(11) for the alternative A growth rates are closer to the average level of

money market conditions since the November 16 meeting than they are to

easier conditions recently prevailing. If the Committee would prefer to

have the aggregates grow along the alternative B paths, it might modify



-14-

the above language to call for "maintaining money market conditions consis-

tent with the recent reduction in Federal Reserve Bank discount rates".

(19) Alternative B. The following language is proposed for

possible use if the Committee decides to continue to formulate the primary

instruction in terms of aggregates, and to seek the growth rates over the

months ahead discussed earlier in connection with alternative B-including

first-quarter rates of 7 and 8-1/2 per cent for M1 and M2, respectively. This

s the same language as that in the directive adopted at the November

meeting except that the reference to "credit" aggregates is deleted. The

deletion is proposed because the credit proxy is not expected to grow more

rapidly on balance in the months ahead than in the fourth quarter.

"To implement this policy, the Committee seeks to promote

somewhat greater growth in monetary [DEL: and credit] aggregates over

the months ahead. System open market operations until the next

meeting of the Committee shall be conducted with a view to achiev-

ing bank reserve and money market conditions consistent with that

objective."

If the Committe favors an aggregate-oriented directive but would like to

have the aggregates grow at the alternative A rates, it might modify the

above language to indicate that it "seeks to promote moderate growth in

monetary and credit aggregates over the months ahead."

(20) Alternative C. This language differs from that of alterna-

tive B only in the omission of the word "somewhat" before "greater growth

in monetary aggregates." It is proposed for possible use if the Committee

decides to pursue the more aggressive easing course contemplated by the

specifications given earlier for alternative C.
