MONEY MARKET AND RESERVE RELATIONSHIPS

Recent developments

(1) The monetary and banking aggregates moved divergently in

January, with current estimates showing the bank credit proxy (adjusted

to include nondeposit sources of funds) to have declined on average at a

3.5 per cent annual rate, andthe money supply to have grown at a 9 per

cent annual rate. The estimate of the proxy is within the range pro-

jected in the last blue book, but that for the money supply is well

above the blue book projection of little change.

(2) The effective rate on Federal funds ranged generally

between 9 and 9-3/8 per cent over the past three statement weeks; member

bank borrowings averaged slightly over $1 billion; and net borrowed

reserves around $900 million. All of these conditions were somewhat

tauter than in the preceding three week period, which had been influenced

by year-end churning. The Federal funds rate during the past three weeks

tended toward the upper end of the range specified in the blue book,

while net borrowed reserves and member bank borrowings were maintained

near the low ends of their respective blue book ranges.

(3) The rate on 3-month Treasury bills rose in late January

toward the upper end of its specified 7-1/2-8 per cent range, reversing

about half of the 25 basis point decline that had developed just prior

to the last meeting of the Committee. Since early February, however,

the 3-month bill rate has dropped sharply again, and most recently was

bid at 7.42 per cent (with an equivalent offering yield on an investment

basis of 7.60 per cent). Rates on the 6-month and 1 year bills have

declined to 7.53 and 7.30 per cent, respectively, on a discount basis

(equivalent to investment yields on the offering side of 7.85 and 7.73

per cent). All of these bill rates are well above the new Regulation Q

rate ceilings for large denomination CD's of corresponding maturities.

Rates on private short-term debt instruments have declined 1/8 to 3/8

of a percentage point since the last Committee meeting, carrying the

quote on 6-month commercial paper down to 8.50 per cent.

(4) The general downturn of short-term rates was triggered by

strengthened market expectations of a near-term lessening of monetary res-

traint that followed various Administration statements and publication of the

new Federal budget. This changed market attitude occurred at a time

when demands for bills were being generated by swaps out of "rights" to

the Treasury's Feburary refinancing, and dealers' positions in short-term

bills were being depleted. The shift in expectations also contributed to

a highly successful Treasury refinancing. Of the $5.9 billion of public

holdings of maturing debt involved in the operation, only about 15 per

cent were redeemed for cash. This relatively modest attrition reduced

the size of the Treasury's estimated remaining need for cash somewhat.



-3-

(5) Other bond markets have also been buoyed to some extent

that
from the same expectational factors / have been affecting the

U. S. Government securities market. Earlier, however, yields in these

other markets had been under substantial upward pressure from the heavy

volume of recent offerings, and had reversed a sizable part of the declines

that had developed early in January during the period of largest savings

withdrawals from depositary institutions. Even in the most recent period,

the continuing weight of new issue volume has tended to brake the size

of the yield decline.

(6) The larger-than-anticipated average growth in the money

supply during January chiefly reflected failure of the sharp year-end

money supply bulge to be eroded as rapidly as projected. To some extent
was

this slower-than-anticipated contraction / probably due to the unusual

volume of security transactions that continued as funds flowed out

of depositary institutions. Despite the unexpectedly large average growth

in the money supply, however, the adjusted bank credit proxy remained

within its projected range because time and savings deposit outflows at

banks were much larger than projected. The blue book forecast for such

deposits in January had been for a decline at an annual rate of 3--6 per

cent; the actual decline is now estimated at a 12-1/2 per cent annual

rate, with the larger attrition entirely accounted for by more rapid

run-off of consumer-type accounts. Among the nondeposit sources of

funds, sales of commercial paper through affiliates rose sharply in January

as several key banks which had not resorted to this source of funds until

late 1969 pressed their sales actively. Altogether, growth in these sales

amounted to the equivalent of about 3-1/2 percentage points in the adjusted

credit proxy. But the effect of this change on the proxy was almost entirely

offset by a decline on average in Euro-dollar borrowings from foreign branches.

Prospective developments

(8) If the Committee wishes to maintain an unchanged stance

with respect to its views as to monetary aggregates and money market

conditions, it may wish to consider the following second paragraph for

the directive (alternative A):

To implement this policy, while taking account of the

CURRENT forthcoming Treasury refunding, possible bank regula-

tory change, and the Committee's desire to see a modest

growth in money and bank credit, System open market opera-

tions until the next meeting of the Committee shall be con-

ducted with a view to maintaining firm conditions in the

money market; provided, however, that operations shall be

modified if money and bank credit appear to be deviating

significantly from current projections.

(9) Over the next four weeks, firm money market conditions

could encompass a Federal funds rate most frequently in an 8-1/2--

9-1/2 per cent range, net borrowed reserves generally in a $750 million

to a little over $1 billion range, and member bank borrowings around

$1 billion, and sometimes a little less. Under these conditions, the

3-month Treasury bill rate is likely to be in a 7-1/4--7-3/4 per cent

range. The Treasury may announce a small cash offering, presumably

in bills, toward the end of February to cover the seasonal drain on its

cash balance during the first half of March, and another similar

operation may be needed at the end of March.



-6-

(10) Assuming day-to-day money market conditions averaging

in the middle of the range noted above--which would be a shade lower

than the last three weeks for the Federal funds rate--growth in the

money stock is likely to be at about a 3--4 per cent annual rate over

the first quarter (measured from the December daily average level to

the March daily average level). On the same assumption, the adjusted

bank credit proxy appears likely to decline over the quarter in about

a 2--4 per cent annual rate range. Thus, our projections would appear

to suggest that money market conditions may have to be toward the lower

ends of the ranges specified above if modest growth in the aggregates,

taken together, is to be achieved,

(11) In terms of monthly average levels, the money stock
on average

--following the unexpectedly large rise/in January--is projected to

decline in February and then to rise in March, changing little on

balance in the two months. During the course of February, the money

stock is likely to begin rising as Government deposits decline. The

average level now projected for March is above that projected four

weeks ago, in part because of large transactions needs for

cash in connection with sizable bond and money market transactions,

and a smaller-than-expected Treasury cash financing paid in early March.

(12) The projected decline in the bank credit proxy is

based largely on continuation of the recent greater weakness in time

and savings deposits, particularly consumer-type deposits. In

February, we expect total time and savings deposits to drop in an



-7-

8-11 per cent annual rate, range, on average. However, the quarter's

decline may come to a halt in late February and March, as holders of

claims on depositary institutions tend to defer further withdrawals

until after March interest-crediting. The new higher Regulation Q

interest rate ceilings have not yet had a discernible effect on time

deposit flows, but by March large CD's, particularly for longer maturities,

may begin to become marginally competitive.

(13) In view of the recent and expected behavior of time

deposits, it would appear to be difficult to bring about even a modest

growth in the adjusted bank credit proxy over the first quarter without

an immediate drop in the 3-month Treasury bill rate to below 7 per cent.

But keeping money market conditions near the low end of the ranges specified

in paragraph (9) would be a step in the direction of halting bank credit

contraction. The expectational effects on markets could move the bill

rate down from current levels toward or possibly even below the 7-1/4 per

cent bottom of the range projected above. Assuming commensurate declines

throughout the bill yield curve, this would permit banks to sell more longer-

term CD's and draw more successfully on customer relationships to hold down

the rate of attrition on shorter maturities. Under the circumstances, the

decline in the adjusted bank credit proxy might be stemmed, accompanied by

only a minor additional increase in the rate of growth in the money stock.

Additionally, market expectation of further interest rate declines could,

at some stage, stimulate speculative purchases of securities that would

further enhance bank credit totals and bank demands for reserves.



(14) Our projections have assumed that banks will continue

to issue commercial paper over the next two months, but at a slower

pace than in January, when several large banks entered the market for

the first time. In addition, if a 10 per cent reserve requirement on

such paper is made effective at the end of February, the additional

costs would reduce the relative attractiveness of this source of funds.

Euro-dollar borrowings through branches are assumed to change little,

on balance, in February and March.

(15) Should the Committee wish to move toward somewhat

easier conditions in the money market, concomitant with somewhat

stronger growth in the banking and deposit aggregates, it might con-

sider the following second paragraph for the directive (alternative B):

To implement this policy, while taking account of the

CURRENT forthcoming Treasury refunding, possible bank

regulatory changes and the Committee's desire to see

MODERATE a-modest growth in money and bank credit, System

open market operations until the next meeting of the

Committee shall be conducted with a view to maintaining

firm MOVING TOWARD SOMEWHAT EASIER conditions in the

money market; provided, however, that operations shall be

modified if money and bank credit appear to be deviating

significantly from current projections.

(16) Somewhat easier conditions in the money market, con-

sistent with moderate growth in money and bank credit, could encompass



-9-

a Federal funds rate in a 7-1/2--8-1/2 per cent range, net borrowed

reserves in a $550 - $750 million range, and member bank borrowings of

around $750 million. Such an easing in money market conditions would

likely be accompanied by a sharp drop in short-term interest rates,

partly on expectational grounds, with the 3-month Treasury bill rate,

for example, moving to and probably somewhat below 7 per cent.

(17) Under such conditions, banks might be in a position to regain

a substantial amount of CD's, Instead of an attrition running at about

the $100-$300 million per month rate likely under alternative A (depending

on the degree of firmness achieved under the specifications of that

alternative), we would expect banks at least to maintain outstanding CD's

at around the current $10 billion level. And if the bill rate fell to

6-3/4 per cent or below, banks would probably have considerable opportunity

to add to CD's. Indeed, they might well add substantial amounts if loan

demand remains strong or if they wish to replenish their liquidity and

to start rebuilding investment portfolios at attractive yields. Another

alternative for banks would be to move into CD's at the expense of non-

deposit sources. On balance, a reasonable guess would be that CD's

could rise at a rate of $500 million per month, or even more.

(18) The effects of easing money market conditions would first

become pronounced in the March aggregates, since February is in large

part already determined and since it would take some time to effect the

degree of easing specified. Assuming that large CD's rise at around

$500 million per month, that consumer-type time and savings show less



-10-

weakness, and that banks are somewhat less active in the Euro-dollar

and commercial paper markets, the adjusted bank credit proxy in March

could rise in a 3 - 6 per cent annual rate range. For the first quarter

as a whole, the adjusted credit proxy might show little net change, or

a slight growth, with the main thrust of the greater rate of bank credit

expansion being seen in the second quarter figures.

(19) The money stock, too, would be likely to show more ex-

pansion in March under easier money market conditions, as the public

rebuilds its liquidity. For the first quarter the money stock

could grow in a 4 - 5 per cent annual rate range, assuming the economy

does not weaken more than projected.

(20) Long-term interest rates would decline under this policy

alternative, as banks began to re-enter the bond markets and as dealers

took larger positions in longer-term U.S. Government and corporate

securities in anticipation of more favorable market conditions ahead.

Moreover, the volume of corporate bond offerings could abate somewhat,

at least in the short-run, as some businesses deferred financing temporarily

to await even more favorable market conditions.

Explanation of Projections in Table 6

1. Changes in Federal Reserve credit indicate reserves needed to offset projected changes in
required reserves and factors affecting the supply of reserves.

2. Projected changes in currency outside banks reflect seasonal movements plus an allowance for
growth of about $50 million per week.

3. Projected effects of Treasury operations, included in "technical factors," reflect scheduled
and assumed calls in current two weeks and maintenance of Treasury balances with Federal Reserve
at $1.0 billion, thereafter.

4. Projected changes in required reserves assume the existing net reserve position of banks and
the structure of interest rates in the market, as well as the current economic outlook. On
the basis of these assumptions, projections reflect expected movements in bank credit and
money in the period ahead, including the effects of such elements as the public's loan demand,
repayments of previous loans, banks' investment preferences and willingness to supply loans,
banks' desires and abilities to obtain time and savings deposits, and the Government's financing
needs. The projections thus encompass normal seasonal developments, temporary bursts of
loans demand and expected associated repayments not currently reflected by the seasonals, and
whatever cyclical and growth demands for money and credit are expected in the projection period.
Assumed Treasury financing operations include: $-0.2 billion, February 16; and $2.5 billion.
March 3.
