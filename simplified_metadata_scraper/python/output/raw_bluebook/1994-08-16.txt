MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Prepared for the Federal Open Market Committee

By the staff Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System

Class I - FOMC August 12, 1994

MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Recent Developments1

(1) Consistent with the Committee's decision to maintain the

existing degree of pressure on reserve positions, the intended federal

funds rate was kept unchanged at 4-1/4 percent during the intermeeting

period. The allowance for adjustment and seasonal borrowing was

raised in several steps over the period, by a total of $125 million,

to accommodate increasing demands for seasonal credit. The federal

funds rate averaged 4.28 percent in the intermeeting period.2

(2) Other market interest rates showed mixed changes

over the intermeeting period. Rates generally edged lower in the

first half of July, after the FOMC left policy unchanged at its meet-

ing and as incoming data seemed to suggest continued moderation in

aggregate demand and a lower trajectory for System firming. (See

upper panels of chart.) However, after the Chairman's Humphrey-

Hawkins testimony and the strong employment report made substantial

near-term tightening appear considerably more likely, rates began to

back up. Most of the net rate increases over the intermeeting period

were registered on short-term Treasuries, which may have been affected

as well by expectations of a large swing in bill issuance from the

second to the third quarter. Expected bond market volatility con-

tinued to decline (chart), helping to hold down long-term yields, and

spreads on the standard mortgage instruments stayed relatively nar-

1. Financial market quotations in this section are taken as of
noon, Friday, August 12.

2. Adjustment plus seasonal borrowing averaged about $22 million
above its allowance in the two complete reserve maintenance periods
since the last FOMC meeting.

row. With corporate profit reports for the second quarter gener-

ally better than expected, most stock prices rose 3 to 4 percent over

the intermeeting period.

(3) The weighted-average foreign exchange value of the dol-

lar was little changed, on balance, over the intermeeting period. The

currency continued to move lower in early July but seemed to gain some

support from statements about the desirability of a stronger dollar by

U.S. Treasury officials and by Chairman Greenspan at the Humphrey-

Hawkins hearing. In Japan most interest rates rose 20 to 25 basis

points in response to increasing indications of a turnaround in the

Japanese economy. Three-month interest rates showed little net change

in Germany, but bond yields there rose 25 basis points. Bond yields

in Europe generally increased sharply late in the period in the wake

of discount rate increases in Italy and Sweden intended to support the

lira and the krona.

; the Desk did

not intervene.

(4) Growth of all of the monetary aggregates in July was

considerably stronger than projected at the time of the last FOMC

meeting; although data for early August suggest a return to subdued

expansion, on balance the broad aggregates remain above expected

levels. M2 and M3 increased at 5 and 6 percent rates, respectively,

last month, leaving these aggregates slightly above the lower ends of

their annual ranges. Despite the likely depressing effects of declin-

ing mortgage refinancings and compensating balances, demand deposits

expanded at a rapid pace last month, helping to boost M1 growth to a

fects of a shift to a newly auctioned bond at the end of the period.



7-1/2 percent rate.4 In addition, a jump in overnight Eurodollars

buoyed the nontransaction components of M2 and M3. Even aside from

these volatile components, however, M2 accelerated in July, perhaps

owing partly to a resumption of runoffs in bond mutual funds.5

Flows into money market funds were particularly strong, likely bene-

fitting from their close substitutability with bond funds within a

family of funds. In addition, the contraction of savings and MMDAs

slowed a bit, and the expansion of other checkable and small time

deposits picked up in July, perhaps partly reflecting a greater

appreciation of the protection of principal in deposits. Rates on

small CDs continued to increase, but their response to rising market

rates this year has been unusually sluggish, and an especially wide

gap to market rates remains. The continuing attraction of direct

holdings of short- and intermediate-term market instruments is indi-

cated by persistently high levels of noncompetitive tenders in Trea-

sury auctions. Rather than bid aggressively for retail deposits,

banks have relied on wholesale sources--especially funds raised by

their foreign offices and, recently, in the domestic large CD market--

to finance increases in bank credit.

(5) Bank credit surged in July. Growth of security holdings

rose, but that pickup primarily reflected revaluation of banks' off-

balance sheet positions; banks reduced their holdings of U.S. govern-

4. Total reserves and the monetary base increased in July at 1-3/4
and 8 percent rates, respectively, with currency growth remaining at a
robust 10-1/4 percent pace.

5. M2 plus bond and stock mutual funds is estimated to have
expanded at a 3-3/4 percent rate last month. This aggregate has
increased at a 1 percent pace since the fourth quarter of 1993.



ment securities slightly.6 Much of the jump in overall bank credit

growth was accounted for by a strong pickup in lending. Business

loans rose at an 17 percent annual rate. According to responses to

the August Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey, demand for business

loans has increased, reflecting needs to finance inventory and fixed

investment. Reduced financing in the capital markets as well as bor-

rowing to finance mergers also appear to have prompted a portion of

the recent growth in business loans.7  In the household sector,

consumer loans expanded sharply at banks in July, suggesting that

overall consumer credit about maintained June's strong pace. In the

aggregate, the expansion of the debt of nonfederal sectors is esti-

mated to have continued in recent months at about the 5 percent pace

of earlier this year. From the fourth quarter of 1993 through June,

total debt rose at a 5-1/2 percent rate, leaving this aggregate well

within its 4-to-8 percent monitoring range.

6. An interpretation by the Financial Accounting Standards Board
(FIN 39) requires banks to include on their balance sheets the net
value of off-balance-sheet contracts with each individual
counterparty. If the net value of contracts with a given counterparty
is positive, it is included in "other securities holdings" on the
balance sheet; if negative, it is reported as a liability. In
contrast to the first three months of this year, when banks were
phasing in such reporting, the bulk of the rise in "other securities
holdings" in July reflected a revaluation of existing positions. Such
a rise does not necessarily indicate an increase in bank net worth,
however, as offsetting changes may have been recorded on the liability
side.

7. The loan officer survey also suggests that banks continued to
ease terms and standards on business loans over the past three months.

Monetary Policy Alternatives

(6) Three monetary policy alternatives are presented for

consideration by the Committee. Under alternative B, federal funds

would continue to trade around 4-1/4 percent in association with re-

taining the $450 million allowance for adjustment plus seasonal bor-

rowing.8 Under alternative C, the federal funds rate would be

raised to 4-1/2 percent and the initial borrowing allowance to $475

million. Under alternative D, the funds rate would be moved to 4-3/4

percent, either through an increase in the initial borrowing allowance

to $500 million or a hike in the discount rate to 4 percent and un-

changed adjustment plus seasonal borrowing.

(7) In the staff economic forecast, the federal funds rate

rises a full percentage point by early next year and remains at that

higher level over the balance of 1995. The economy is already essen-

tially at potential, and aggregate demand will continue to be bol-

stered by, among other factors, the aggressive lending posture adopted

by banks and by foreign demands for the U.S. goods and services owing

to the lower dollar and stronger growth abroad. In these circum-

stances, further policy tightening is seen as needed to hold total

output at potential to keep inflation from rising. The Greenbook rate

assumption does not necessarily entail a tightening at the August FOMC

meeting itself, but it does imply that the upward trajectory of short-

term rates will be resumed fairly promptly.

(8) Alternative B might be preferred if it were thought that

there would be less strength in the economy than in the staff fore-

cast. Such a view might follow from placing more weight on recent

8. Later in the intermeeting period it may prove necessary to
reduce the borrowing allowance a little to reflect the onset of the
typical unwinding of the summer bulge in seasonal borrowing.



soft spending indicators, on undesired inventory buildups, or on the

effects of previous policy tightenings. Waiting for more clarifica-

tion of how much slowing in spending growth is already in train would

be seen as posing fewer risks than implied in the staff forecast if it

were thought that favorable readings on price indexes suggested that

some slack remained in the economy.

(9) Market participants now seem to expect at least a 25

basis point increase in the federal funds rate at the August meeting,

with some possibility of a 50 basis point increase; a 4-3/4 percent

funds rate is anticipated by late September. In these circumstances,

the choice of no change in the stance of policy under alternative B

would result in some decline in short-term interest rates, and the

dollar might tend to weaken on foreign exchange markets. Long-term

rates could move lower, at least initially. Market participants might

view the absence of action as indicating a milder degree of tightening

into the future as well--perhaps because the Federal Reserve saw less

inflation in the outlook than previously thought. However, rate de-

clines would be limited to the extent that market participants ques-

tioned the Fed's anti-inflation resolve; absent subsequent data point-

ing to further weakening in aggregate demand or surprisingly modest

price pressures, concerns about inflation would mount, pushing up

longer-term interest rates.

(10) A tightening of reserve conditions might seem appropriate

if the Committee saw significant risks of greater inflation from the

pressure of demand on available resources under an unchanged policy. An

immediate rise in short-term interest rates might also be seen as more

consistent with the Committee's longer-run intention to make progress



toward price stability. The question in these circumstances would be

how large an increase in the federal funds rate should be sought.

(11) Alternative C embodies a move of 25 basis points. An

increase of this size, by itself, would be unlikely to have a substan-

tial effect on spending or prices, but a small tightening could lend

assurance that policy had firmed enough to keep the economy around its

potential. Although further tightening could prove to be necessary, the

Committee might judge that the case for a larger move is not yet estab-

lished. As noted above, alternative C is about what is built into the

structure of market interest rates, and neither interest nor exchange

rates are likely to react very strongly to such an action. However,

this would be the first move since the announcement in May that excess

accommodation had been substantially removed and could be seen as mark-

ing a return to the usual practice of reacting to incoming data with

small changes in reserve conditions. Markets could become somewhat more

unsettled and volatile, especially if the rise in short-term rates were

perceived as less than needed and therefore likely to be followed by

another increase but of uncertain timing.

(12) The more forceful move of alternative D might be chosen

if the Committee viewed the economic situation as highly likely to

require substantial additional monetary tightening, for example, of the

scope embodied in the steep tilt to the yield curve over the next few

years. Alternatively, the Committee also might take this action if it

believed that only moderate further tightening were required to hold

inflation in check. In this regard, the 50 basis points of alternative

D would imply more assurance of this outcome than alternative C and,

therefore, would be more likely to be followed by a period of stability

of short-term rates. Given these alternative rationales, the Committee



might want to explain its reasoning publicly--an opportunity for which

would naturally occur if the increase were accomplished through a hike

in the discount rate. The market response might depend importantly on

how the action was perceived. If the market saw it as one of a series

of further steps, interest rates could rise substantially along the

maturity spectrum. On the other hand, if markets saw the increase as

the last at least for a time, short-term rates would rise, but inter-

mediate- and possibly long-term rates might move very little. Some

forward rates would be revised down and reductions in expected volatil-

ity might lower risk premiums on longer-term assets.

(13) Under all of the alternatives, borrowing by nonfederal

sectors is expected to remain around the pace of recent months. Bor-

rowing by nonfinancial businesses will be buoyed by further increases in

external financing needs and large cash-for-equity merger transactions.

The more aggressive posture of bank lenders and the higher levels of

bond rates since earlier this year suggest that banks will continue to

be a major source of credit in the months ahead, although businesses

are likely to take advantage of any intermittent rallies in the bond

market to lengthen debt maturities. Still-large outlays for housing and

consumer durables will boost growth in mortgage and consumer credit to a

pace roughly in line with that of personal disposable income. With

federal debt growth firming a bit in the months ahead, total debt of

domestic nonfinancial sectors is projected to grow at nearly a 5 percent

pace over the remainder of the year--placing annual growth in this

aggregate at 5-1/4 percent, in the lower half of its 4 to 8 percent

monitoring range.

(14) Growth of the monetary aggregates over July to December

is presented below for alternatives B and D. The path for alternative B



-10-

is based on the assumption of no change in the federal funds rate for

the rest of this year. Alternative D assumes a 50 basis point increase

in the funds rate at this meeting and no change thereafter.9  (Money

growth under the reserve conditions of alternative C would lie half way

between alternatives B and D.)

Implied growth 93Q4 to 94Q4

M2 1-1/2 1-1/4
M3 1/2 1/2
M1 4 3-1/2

(15) M2 would grow at a 1-1/2 percent rate over the July-to-

December period under alternative B, down from the July pace but

quicker than that over the first six months of the year. Acting to

boost growth in this aggregate would be some narrowing of opportunity

costs as deposit rates, especially those on small time deposits, moved

up in lagged response to earlier increases in market rates. Renewed

outflows from bond mutual funds over recent weeks, even as bond rates

9. The interest rate path of the Greenbook forecast, because it
assumes continuing increases over the balance of the year, corresponds
to none of the bluebook alternatives. With the interest rates and
nominal income of the Greenbook, the staff would expect M2 growth at a
1 percent rate for the July-to-December period and 1-1/2 percent for
the year, and M3 growth at a 1/2 percent pace for both intervals; M1
growth would be at a 2-1/4 percent rate from July to December and
3-3/4 percent for the year. Although these money growth rates are
roughly the same as those projected for alternative D, the higher
year-end level of rates assumed in the Greenbook implies slower growth
of money and income in the first half of 1995 than would
alternative D.

have fluctuated around levels attained in the spring, suggest that

households may continue to rebalance portfolios in a way that might

also impart some upward tilt to growth of the broader aggregates.

Restraining monetary growth is some projected slowing of nominal

income growth, even under the unchanged interest rate assumptions of

this alternative.10 M2 velocity would rise at around a 3 percent

rate in the third and fourth quarters, somewhat slower than over the

first half and about in line with predictions of traditional models of

money demand.11 M3 is projected to grow at a 3/4 percent pace in

the July-to-December period, a bit less slowly than in the first half

of the year. Abstracting from the effects of FIN 39, we expect a

little more growth in bank credit over the second half of the year--

though not a persistence of the unusually rapid increase in July.

Moreover, with short-term rates unchanged under alternative B, insti-

tution-only money funds should be stable after large runoffs through

the spring.

(16) Under alternative D, M2 would grow at a 1 percent rate

over the July-to-December period. Opportunity costs would widen under

this alternative, particularly damping M1 and savings deposits. How-

ever, if bond yields backed up under this alternative, the additional

capital losses might accentuate a redirection of savings back into M2,

offsetting some of this restraining effect. M3 would grow at only a

10. M1 would expand at about a 3 percent rate over the July-to-
December period under alternative B. Continued rapid currency growth
would account for this expansion, as higher opportunity costs reached
earlier this year and slow mortgage refinancing activity hold
transaction deposits about flat. The monetary base would grow at a
7-1/2 percent rate and total reserves would contract at a 3 percent
rate over this period.

11. M2+ is predicted to grow a little more rapidly than M2 over the
second half of this year, but not as fast as nominal output, and its
velocity would still register an appreciable increase.
