  1.   Over the  intermeeting period, federal funds have traded at rates near the  target levels. 
The Desk redeemed $11.8 billion of Treasury securities, including $7.5 billion of bills and
$4.4 billion of coupon securities, to continue bringing SOMA holdings into conformance
with the guidelines on per-issue limits.  To offset the resulting reserve drain and meet longer-
term reserve needs, the Desk purchased outright $13.6 billion of Treasury coupon securities
in the market and $486 million of Treasury bills from foreign customers.  The volume of
outstanding long-term RPs was kep t unchanged at $12.0 billion .

MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Recent D evelopments

(1) The 50-basis-point reduction in the target federal funds rate at the 

March 20 meeting was less than some investors had expected, but the accompanying

statement contributed to expectations that an intermeeting ease would follow.1  Those

expectations gradually diminished over subsequent weeks as incoming data and

statements by several Federal Reserve officials evidently were read by investors as

suggesting less weakness in the economy going forward.  Thus, the 50-basis-point

reduction in the federal funds ra te on Apr il 18 caught investors by surprise .  Short-

term interest rates declined in response, as market participants marked down the

expected path of the federal funds rate over the next year or so.  More recently,

surprisingly weak employment data added to the amount of near-term easing built

into asset prices.  Futures rates currently indicate that market participants expect the

federal funds rate to be cut another 50 basis points at the May meeting to 4 percent

and to decline to about 3¾ percent by fall–-about ½ percentage point lower than was

anticipated before the March meeting (chart 1).  On balance over the intermeeting

period, short-term  interest rates fell ½ to  1 percentage point.

(2) Despite the sharp decline in short-term interest rates, longer-term yields

rose on balance over the intermeeting period.  Most of the increase occurred before

  2.  Some of the increase in the ten- and  thirty-year nominal constant maturity Treasury
yields reflected a decline in the on-the-run premium that is typical of the Treasury auction
schedule.  At the ten-year maturity, the narrowing of this premium is estimated to have
added about 10 basis points to the increase in the constant maturity yield over the
intermeeting period. 

the intermeeting policy move, as investors became more confident tha t output growth

will pick up; the growing likelihood of substantial federal tax cuts also may have added

pressure on long-term yields.  Although  yields on longer-term nominal Treasury

securities increased nearly ½ percentage point, those on comparable inflation-indexed

securities drifted lower.2  The implied run-up in inflation compensation left that

measure above the levels observed before its sharp decline in late  2000 associated with

emerging weakness in the economy.  The improved  sentiment about the economic

outlook and the surprise intermeeting policy easing may have contributed to a

narrowing of risk premiums, especially on lower-grade corporate debt securities, and

to a rise in stock prices.  Equity markets were also bolstered by first-quarter earnings

reports, which generally came in above sharply reduced expectations, although

analysts continued to lower forecasts for earnings in subsequent quarters.  Over the

intermeeting  period, the Wilshire 5000 index  gained more than 7½ percent, leaving it

about 5 percent below its year-end level. 

(3) Equity prices and long-term yields rose in other industrial countries as

well, likely reflecting in part the importance of the United States for the global

economy and the perceived improvement in prospects for globally important

industries, including those in the high-technology area.  The increase in equ ity prices

was particularly large in Japan–about 15 percent–reflecting in part a favorable market

reaction to the Bank of Japan’s announcement of policy changes the day before the

March FOMC meeting, which included a return to a zero interest rate target, and the

formation of the new Koizumi-led government in late April.  Short-term yields abroad



3

generally declined, although by less than in the United States.  The European Central

Bank ended its “wait and see” policy recently with a 25-basis-point cut in its policy

rates.  The reduction came amid increasing indications of economic weakness in the

euro area and despite some signs of increased inflationary pressure.  Policy rates also

were cut by 25 basis points in Canada and Switzerland and by 50 basis points in two

steps in the United Kingdom since the March FOMC meeting.  The dollar appreciated

against a basket of major currencies early in the intermeeting period , but it later

retraced that movement, particularly after the FO MC’s surprise interest rate cut in

mid-April, and finished the intermeeting period about unchanged (chart 2).            

                                                                                                                              over the

intermeeting period         U.S. authorities did not intervene.

(4) The dollar was also essentially unchanged on balance against a basket of

currencies of our other important trading  partners.  Argentine financial markets were

roiled by growing uncertainties about the country’s financial situation and speculation

that its exchange rate peg might be modified, as well as by an open dispute between

the Argent ine government and central bank over  the use of reserve requirements. 

Market pressures spilled over to Brazil, where the real fell almost 5 percent against the

dollar.  Risk spreads on dollar-denominated Argentine and Brazilian debt moved up

sharply.  In contrast, the Mexican peso appreciated about 4 percent against the dollar,

as monetary authorities held to their tight policy stance, and spreads on Mexican debt

narrowed.  The Turk ish lira regained some of its previously lost ground, and Turkish

financial markets calmed, as the country’s financial problems appeared  to have been

brought under better control partly in response to the prospect of additional funding

from the IM F and World Bank.  The Indonesian rupiah and the Philipp ine peso both

declined sharp ly against the dollar in reaction to financial problems and domestic

political turmoil.



4

(5) The debt of nonfederal sectors in the United States is estimated to have

advanced at a round an 8 percent rate on average over March and April, about equal to

its robust pace of the second half of 2000 and early 2001 (see chart 2).  However,

growth of business debt fell back in recent months, likely reflecting a  reduction in

inventory and capital investment and in merger and acquisition activity.  Firms

continued to  borrow heavily in the corporate bond market, but they reduced their

reliance on short-term financing markets.  Commercial paper outstanding ran off

further in March and April, albeit at a much slower pace than earlier in the year, and

business loans at commercial banks also declined very recently, possibly damped by

the further tightening of credit conditions indicated in the most recent Senior Loan

Officer Opinion survey.  Household borrowing also has showed some signs of

slowing in recent months.  Growth in consumer credit declined moderately in March

and is estimated to have slowed further in April, as outlays on durable goods appear

to have fallen back from the surprisingly strong pace early in the year.  Mortgage debt

growth, by contrast, seems to have largely sustained its rapid pace, reflecting strength

in the residential housing sector and substantial refinancing activity.  State and local

government borrowing picked up further in M arch and April, as lower interest rates

fueled advance refunding of existing debt.  The federal government, in contrast, paid

down a considerable amount of debt in April, which pulled down the growth of total

domestic nonfinancial debt that month.

(6) Spurred by the drop in its opportunity cost, M2 expanded at an average

pace of 12½ percent over M arch and April, with particular strength in liqu id deposits

and retail money funds.  M2 growth was boosted by several special factors, including

extensive mortgage refinancing activity and, in April, households' accumulation of

liquid balances to make nonwithheld tax payments, which increased by more than

allowed for by seasonal factors.  In addition, portfo lio flows into safe, liqu id assets

amid volati le movements in equity prices likely added to M2 growth in recent months . 

However, weekly data suggest that M2 growth has slowed some of late, perhaps

reflecting an unwinding of tax-related balances and the resumption of more normal

portfo lio flows into equities.  M3 a lso expanded  at a rap id pace in recent months . 

Growth of institution-only money funds remained very brisk, in part because rates on

those funds do not decline as quickly as short-term market rates.  Managed liabilities

included in M3 also increased in April, apparently to help finance a pickup in bank

credit growth and a shift in bank fund ing from foreign to U.S. sources.

Policy Alternatives

(7) The staff forecast for this meeting embodies a weaker outlook for

aggregate demand than in the March Greenbook, reflecting in part incoming

information suggesting lower-than-expected trajectories for investment and

consumption spending.  With pro jected spending on capital equipment softer than in

the last forecast and estimates of multifactor productivity growth over recent years

revised down, the staff has trimmed its estimate of the growth of structural

productivity somewhat, which further damps prospective aggregate demand.  The

staff has assumed that the Federal Reserve will respond to this more negative outlook

by easing policy  50 basis points a t this meeting.  Thereafter, the federal funds rate is

held unchanged at  a level one percentage point below  that of the last Greenbook.  

Earnings disappointments are expected to trigger some near-term declines in stock

prices, but long-term interest rates and the dollar are expected to hold near current

levels given this policy path.  The impetus provided by the cumulative policy easings

and the support to investment and real income from continuing efficiency gains

engendered by new technologies contribute to a strengthening of the growth of

spending over the forecast period.  In addition, fiscal stimulus spurs consumption

demand beginning later this year.  By the end of the projection period, economic

growth rises back to a rate close to that of its potential.  With slack emerging in labor

and product markets and energy prices declining, core PCE inflation slips back under

2 percent in 2002.  

(8) In considering the appropriate stance of policy , it may be useful to

compare the real federal funds rate with estimates of the current level of the

equilibrium real federal funds  rate.  The equilibrium rate is defined here to be the rate

that, if maintained, eventually would return output to potential once the effects of any

transitory disturbances have dissipated.  Thus, the equilibrium rea l federal funds rate



8

  3.  All measures of the real federal funds rate are calculated using the core PCE inflation
rate over the previous four quarters as a proxy for expected inflation.
  4.  Note that since expected inflation is assumed to equal past actual inflation, a given
change in the  nomina l federal funds ra te target translates into an equal immediate change  in
the real federal funds rate.

reflects the longer-term forces shaping the outlook for the real econom y and so

provides one benchmark for judging the implications of alternative policy stances.  To

be sure, the appropriate stance of policy relative to that equilibrium rate in a given

instance will depend on policymakers’ objectives, the current levels of output and

inflation, and an assessment of the transitory factors that may influence the paths of

inflation and output over the next few years.

(9) The chart on the next page shows a range of estimates of the equilibrium

real federal funds rate, as well as the actual real funds rate and its historical average.3 

The range is constructed from severa l indiv idual estimates of the equi librium rea l rate. 

Two are derived from the FRB/US model; two others are calculated from the

relationship between the real funds rate and the output gap  using a statistical filter to

separate permanent changes in that relationsh ip from temporary deviations.  In both

of these approaches, one estimate is based on h istorical data while the other augments

these data with  the staff forecast through 2002.  A fifth  estimate, which  begins in

1998, is inferred from actual indexed debt yields.  As can be seen in the chart, the

estimates imply some decline in the equilibrium rate over recent quarters, likely owing

in part to the longer-term effects on demand of an increase in the equity premium,

which reduces wealth, and of a slowing in the growth of potential output, which holds

down the expansion of  permanent real income and earnings.  The FOMC’s current

target for the nominal funds rate implies a real federal funds rate of about 2¾

percent–around the lower end of the range.  The chart also shows the real funds rates

implied by the three policy alternatives discussed below.4

(10) If the Committee, like the staff, anticipates a prolonged period of weak

aggregate demand, it might choose the 50 basis point reduction in the target federal

funds rate assumed in the staff forecast.  While such a reduction would leave the real

funds rate noticeably below the range of the estimates of its equilibrium value, an

accommodative policy stance may be seen as needed for a time to counter temporary

restraints on aggregate demand.  In particular the Committee may be concerned about

household spending in an  environment of a weaken ing job market and about business

investment outlays in view of the drags from the previous slowdown in final demand

and the over-accumulation of capital in som e sectors.  In these circumstances, growth

would remain slugg ish for a time even after further policy easing, lessening pressures

on resources and likely rolling back the recent upticks in inflation and inflation

expectations.  Indeed, the Committee may view the resource gap likely to open up

under this scenario as sizable enough to imply a margin in which spending could snap

back faster than expected without producing a deterioration in the inflation

environment.  Market participants already expect a substan tial reversal of policy in

2002, suggesting that they would be prompter than usual in bringing forward in time

and increasing the size of the anticipated tightening if evidence of such a snap-back

emerged.  As long as the Committee reinforced such sentiment with its words and

actions, the resulting increase in real interest rates would work to stabilize the

economy and constrain inflation. 

(11) Investors are expecting a 50 basis point move at this meeting, along with

a statement ind icating that the balance of risks remains weighted  toward economic

weakness, to be followed by an additional 25 basis point move by fall.  Validating

market expectations for this meeting would leave interest rates, equity prices, and the

foreign exchange value of the dollar largely unchanged.  The Committee  may find this

outcome especially attractive if it believes that the balance of risks is sufficiently tilted



10

toward weakness to make the added  policy easing bu ilt into asset prices a reasonable

possibility.

(12) The Com mittee might choose a more modest 25 basis point reduction

in the federal funds rate at this meeting if it views aggregate demand going forward as

likely to be noticeably less weak than in the staff forecast, perhaps because it sees the

large cumulative easing of policy since the start of the year as providing more support

for demand than in that forecast.  Among financial indicators, the rapid growth of

money and the steepness of the yield curve may suggest that considerable stimulus is

already in place.  In these circumstances, with the real funds rate at the low end of the

range of estimates of its equilibrium level, and with equity markets having risen

appreciably over the intermeeting period, the Committee may believe that a more

forceful policy action at this meeting would create unacceptable odds of a policy

overshoot, with potentially adverse consequences for inflation.  Concerns in this

regard might be accentuated by the recent firmer tone of the inflation data and the

increases in survey and market measures of expected inflation.  Thus, even if the

Committee suspects that additional easing m ight well be appropriate at som e point, it

might choose a smaller policy step at this meeting to allow time for more evidence to

accumulate on whether the economy will be soft enough to contain inflation pressures

and warrant additional  easing . 

(13) Market participants would be surprised by a 25 basis point easing.  Even

if such a policy move is accompanied by a statement that the balance of risks remains

weighted toward economic weakness, short-term interest rates would rise as investors

marked up their expectations for the path of the federal funds rate over coming

months.  Higher interest rates, together with a sense that monetary policy is less

focused on fostering a return to robust economic growth, wou ld lead to a fall in stock

prices.  If the drop in equity prices is quite substantial, longer-term interest rates also



11

might decline, reflecting the weaker outlook for the economy.  These effects in

financial markets would be attenuated if, in light of the statement accompanying the

policy announcement, the Federal Reserve is seen more as stretching out the timing of

its policy moves than as reducing the total amount of easing that will be forthcoming.

(14) If the Committee believes that the outlook for aggregate demand is

probably weaker than in the staff forecast, or that the risks around that forecast are

skewed substantially to the downside, it might choose a 75 basis point reduction in

the target federal funds rate.  Such weakness could owe, for example, to a more

protracted falloff in high-tech investment as businesses reconsider the profitability of

these capital projects, which in turn would damp structural productivity growth and

be reflected in a more pronounced decline in the equilibrium real funds rate.  Even if

the Committee agrees with the staff forecast of output and employment, it still may

view their projected paths as unacceptably weak, justifying a larger cut in the federal

funds rate than is assumed in that forecast.  For example, the Committee may think

that the unemployment rate does not need to rise as much or as qu ickly as in the staff

forecast to keep inflation in check. 

(15) A 75 basis point easing accompanied by a statement that the risks remain

weighted toward economic weakness would lower the expected near-term path of

policy, reducing other shorter-term interest rates and easing financial conditions more

generally.  The larger-than-expected policy move would presumably bo lster

expectations of economic growth and corporate earnings, boosting stock prices. 

Effects on longer-term nominal interest rates are less clear.  Such rates would tend to

be pulled down by the change in near-term policy expectations and the associated

decline in real interest rates, but that tendency could be more than  offset by a rise in

inflation premiums if market participants read the larger-than-expected policy move as

increasing the odds of a significant pickup in inflation . 



12

(16) Although market participants expect the Committee to retain its view

that the balance of risks is weighted toward economic weakness, the Committee might

believe that the level of rates selected at this meeting is sufficiently low to balance the

risks of economic weakness with those of increased inflation pressures.  If, for

example, rates are cut by 50 or 75 basis points, the Committee might view the

resulting real federal funds rate of 2¼ or 2 percent as low enough to make the 

reduced risks of economic weakness comparable to the increased risks of higher

inflation.  Most investors would probably read a shift by the Committee to a

statement of balanced risks as indicating that the current cycle of policy easing had

ended.  As a result, a combination of a 50 basis point policy move and a sh ift to

balanced risks would cause interest rates to back up and stock prices to decline, as

investors take out the additional easing that had been expected in the near term.  By

contrast, a 75 basis point reduction in the target federal funds rate accompanied by a

statement of balanced risks would tend to  lower interest rates a little, since it would

move up the timing  of policy easing that is already expected, and boost stock prices

slightly.  However, market participants might view a move to balanced risks as

suggesting that the Committee could be less likely to react quickly to future signs of

economic weakness, in which case stock prices might slip, causing long-term rates to

fall a bi t further. 

(17) Under the  staff forecast, a significant further tightening of credit

conditions is not anticipated in coming quarters, although with the economy soft and

profits not rebounding, lenders are likely to remain cautious.  The expansion of

domestic nonfinancial sector debt is projected to slow to about a 5 percent pace from

April to December.  Expected federal surpluses result in further substantial paydowns

of Treasury debt in coming months before the need to finance the projected tax

rebate requires the Treasury to temporarily become a net borrower.  Nonfederal debt



13

growth is projected to moderate some, but it remains considerably faster than the

expansion in  nominal spending.  Although mortgage growth is expected to remain

brisk, household debt growth should slow as weaker consumption spending damps

the expansion of consumer credit.  Business borrowing also is anticipated to soften, as

a widening of the gap between internally generated funds and capital expenditures in

the second half of the year is more than offset by a reduction in equity retirements.

(18) Under the Greenbook forecast, M2 is projected to expand at a 5½

percent pace from A pril to December , well below i ts average rate in recent months . 

The deceleration owes in part to the projected slowdown in the growth of nominal

spending and the waning effects of policy easings on opportunity costs.  In addition,

some of the special factors that have boosted M2 growth of late–including mortgage

refinancing and tax-season effects, and perhaps some safe haven  flows out of equity

markets–are  expected to unwind over coming m onths.  M3 growth is projected to

decline to a 7 percent pace over the April-to-December period, reflecting the

moderation in M2 expansion and smaller increases in institutional money funds as

their rates ad just to lower  market interest rates.
