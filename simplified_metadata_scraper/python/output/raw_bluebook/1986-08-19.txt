Prefatory Note 

 
 

The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain. 
 

Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a redaction process that removed information obtained on a 
confidential basis.  All redacted passages are exempt from disclosure under applicable 
provisions of the Freedom of Information Act.    

 

                                                 
1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked 
and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not 
reliably recognized by the OCR process and were not checked or corrected by staff.

MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Recent developments

(1) Growth of all the monetary aggregates accelerated in July.

M2 and M3 expanded at 12-3/4 and 13 percent annual rates last month, well

above the Committee's 7 to 9 percent paths for these aggregates for the

June-to-Septeber period.1/ The rapid growth in the broader aggregates

lifted them into the upper portions of their longer-run ranges. Expansion

in M1 was at around a 17 percent rate last month, somewhat faster than in

June and about in line with its average pace over the second quarter.

(2) The acceleration in the broader aggregates in July was

associated in part with strengthening credit growth at banks and thrifts.

A sharp rebound in overnight RPs, used to finance record bank acquisitions

of government securities, accounted for most of the pickup in M2 growth.

In addition, the remainder of M2--essentially core deposits and money

market funds--continued to expand rapidly in July, as it has since spring,

apparently bolstered by declines in market interest rates. Reflecting the

sluggish adjustment of offering rates on OCDs, MMDAs and savings accounts,

as well as a relatively flat yield curve, flows into liquid instruments

continued heavy in July while small time deposits once again contracted.

1. Preliminary results from the June benchmark survey of RPs indicate a
considerably higher level of RPs than now reflected in published data. Most
of the additional strength is in term RPs at thrifts, where they apparently
were being used to obtain relatively low cost financing for an expanding
volume of mortgage securities issued or guaranteed by federal agencies and
Treasury issues. With the revisions to overnight RPs fairly small, the
effects on M2 are relatively minor. For M3, growth from the fourth quarter
to July has been revised upward by about one-half of a percentage point at
an annual rate to 8.8 percent. The new information, which mainly affects
second-quarter estimates, has been incorporated in the figures presented in
the table on the following page and the discussion in this bluebook. Revised
data are expected to be published this Thursday, and are strictly confidential
until that time.

regulatory changes to reserve requirements.



M3 growth also was boosted by a resumption in issuance of large time deposits

by thrift institutions, which may be building up their balance sheets in

anticipation of more stringent capital requirements on growth; assets of

institution-only money funds also increased sharply, owing to relative rate

movements. Strength in M1 reflected continued rapid expansion of demand

deposits as well as OCDs.

(3) The growth of the debt of domestic nonfinancial sectors in

July is estimated to have remained near the 10 to 11 percent pace of recent

months, with expansion from its fourth-quarter base at a 12-1/2 percent

annual rate, above the 11 percent upper end of its long-run range. Treasury

borrowing remained brisk in July, before being constrained by debt ceiling

limitations in August. The Treasury was able to raise a substantial amount

of new money at its mid-quarter refunding auctions settling in mid-August,

but only by utilizing the borrowing authority of the Federal Financing Bank

and paying down bills. Overall borrowing by nonfinancial businesses appears

to have slowed somewhat from earlier in the year, despite continued heavy

share retirements associated with mergers and financial restructurings; the

sum of bank loans and commercial paper contracted a bit in July and bond

sales, while still strong, were near the slowest pace of the year. Fragmen-

tary information on household borrowing in July suggests that mortgage debt

growth remained sizable while consumer credit slackened. Bond issuance in

the tax-exempt market surged in advance of a tax reform deadline scheduled

for September 1.

(4) Nonborrowed and total reserves increased in July at about

23 and 25 percent annual rates, respectively, reflecting rapid growth of

required reserves against transactions deposits. With the decline in the



-4-

discount rate, reserve paths continued to be constructed assuming $300

million of adjustment plus seasonal borrowing. In the two complete reserve

maintenance periods since the last meeting, such borrowing has averaged just

under $400 million. In the conduct of open market operations over the inter-

meeting period, the Desk recognized that a substantial portion of this total

represented borrowing by institutions facing special situations.

(5) Federal funds have traded generally in the 6-1/4 to 6-3/8

percent area since the cut in the discount rate announced shortly after

the last FOMC meeting, down from the 6-7/8 percent level prevailing around

the time of the last meeting. With the discount rate reduction already

widely expected by the time of the July FOMC meeting, other short-term

rates declined by somewhat less. In long-term credit markets, rates in-

creased in the first part of the intermeeting period as economic develop-

ments and the absence of policy moves abroad were seen as reducing the

scope for further Federal Reserve ease; in addition, weakness in bond

markets reflected anxieties near the time of the Treasury refunding about

foreign demand for dollar-denominated securities in circumstances of a

weakening dollar. More recently, with the completion of the Treasury

refunding and a rekindling of some expectations of a coordinated discount

rate cut in key industrial countries in response to disappointing economic

growth, bond rates have retraced much of their earlier rise and short-term

rates have declined an additional 1/8 of a percentage point or so.

(6) The dollar has fallen a further 3-1/4 percent on a weighted-

average basis since the last Committee meeting. Declines of 5 percent

against the mark and 3-3/4 percent against the yen were partly offset by a

2-1/4 percent rise against sterling. Indications that other central banks

would not follow, at least immediately, the Federal Reserve's discount rate



-5-

cut in July and various statements by U.S. officials suggesting the

possibility that additional dollar declines might be needed to correct

massive trade deficits contributed to the dollar's weakness.



Policy alternatives

(7) The table below presents three alternative specifications for

the monetary aggregates for the June-to-September period and associated

federal funds rate ranges. (More detailed data, including implied growth

for the July-to-September period and from the fourth quarter of 1985 to

September, are given on the table and charts on the following pages.)

M3 9-1/2 9 8-1/2
M1 16 14-1/2 13

Associated federal funds
rate range 3 to 7 4 to 8 5 to 9

(8) Growth in all the monetary aggregates is expected to slow

over August and September from the very rapid pace of July. Even so, with

reserve conditions about unchanged as assumed for alternative B, growth of

the broader aggregates would be expected to come in around the upper end

or a bit above the Committee's 7 to 9 percent range for June to September.

Growth within that range would seem to require a moderate increase in pres-

sures on reserve positions, as embodied in alternative C. Should pressures

be eased as under alternative A, M2 in particular would be expected to be

more noticeably above the short-run range, though likely remaining just

within its long-run range through September. M1 growth would be anticipated

to remain quite rapid under any of the alternatives, though below the extra-

ordinary pace of the second quarter.

(9) Alternative B assumes adjustment plus seasonal borrowing at

the discount window averaging around $300 million (abstracting from any

special situation credit). Federal funds would probably continue to trade

in the 6-1/4 to 6-3/8 percent area. M2 growth would be expected to slow to

around 8 percent over August and September, reflecting in large measure a

leveling off in overnight RPs as banks stop adding aggressively to their

holdings of U.S. government securities in a more stable interest rate environ-

ment. In addition, growth of retail deposits and money market funds is likely

to moderate as offering yields come more in line with market rates around cur-

rent levels. Fragmentary data for early August suggest that expansion of M2

is indeed slowing from its rapid July pace. Even with the anticipated moder-

ation in M2, growth would average 9-1/2 percent fran June to September and

10-1/2 percent on a quarterly-average basis in the third quarter, implying

an unusually large drop in its velocity (given the greenbook forecast for

GNP) of 5-1/2 percent at an annual rate. The projected moderation in M3

growth from its July bulge reflects less rapid expansion in its non-M2 compon-

ent as well as in M2. Inflows to institution-only money funds should abate

in response to the realignment of fund yields with market rates, and the

expected deceleration in bank credit would act to reduce issuance of managed

liabilities.

(10) Growth of M1, while diminishing over August and September

under alternative B, is likely to remain quite strong at around 13 percent.

Both its demand deposit and NOW account components should still grow fairly

rapidly in the near term, given recent declines in open market rates and, in

the case of OCDs, sluggish adjustment of deposit offering rates, which imply

extremely thin opportunity costs at least for a while. The decline in the

velocity of M1 would be at an 11 percent rate in the third quarter, nearly as

large as the 12 percent drop in the second quarter.



(11) The money growth specifications of alternative B imply

increases in both M2 and M3 from their fourth-quarter base to September of

around 8-1/2 percent at an annual rate, with growth in M1 at nearly a 14 per-

cent annual rate through September. Expansion in all the monetary aggregates

would be expected to moderate a little further in the fourth quarter, should

interest rates remain close to current levels as in the staff's greenbook

forecast. In that forecast, nominal GNP is projected to strengthen only

moderately in the fourth quarter, while the effects of earlier declines in

interest rates on money demand should continue to diminish. Under these

circumstances, both M2 and M3 are likely to remain fairly high in their

long-run ranges, growing perhaps around 8-1/2 percent from QIV 1985 to QIV

1986. M1 expansion for the year might be about 13 percent, with its velocity

registering a record postwar decline.

(12) Total debt of domestic nonfinancial sectors is likely to ex-

pand a little more rapidly over August and September than in recent months.

Boosting debt growth this month is the surge in bond issuance by state and

local governments. We anticipate some rebound in borrowing by the Treasury

in coming weeks, assuming some action on the debt ceiling, to cover its

considerable financing needs and rebuild its cash balance. Business credit

needs probably will continue to be bolstered by heavy share retirements

associated with mergers and financial restructurings, although the financing

gap should remain relatively small, reflecting flat capital spending and

internal funds. Household mortgage borrowing should remain substantial,

given the continued strength of the single-family home market, while consumer

credit expansion is expected to moderate further. From its fourth-quarter

base, debt is projected to stay well above the upper end of its monitoring



-10-

range through the third quarter and to remain above the upper end of its

range for the year, despite sane further moderation expected in the fourth

quarter.

(13) Short- and long-term interest rates are expected to remain

around their current levels under alternative B, at least initially, though

with federal funds continuing to trade in a 6-1/4 to 6-3/8 area some modest

upward pressures on interest rates could emerge as market participants begin

to reassess the odds on a near-term easing in policy. Nevertheless, the

dollar could continue to drift lower on foreign exchange markets. In addi-

tion to the usual economic news, financial markets may be confronted with

important developments in tax reform and federal budget policy that could

significantly affect investor sentiment during the weeks ahead.

(14) Alternative A involves an easing of pressures on reserve

positions, either through a reduction in regular adjustment plus seasonal

borrowing to a frictional level of perhaps $150 million or so, or a cut in

the discount rate by 1/2 percentage point with discount borrowing maintained

at the current specification of $300 million. The federal funds rate would

probably decline to 5-3/4 percent or a little above. The associated decrease

in market interest rates would be expected to boost M2 growth to a little

over a 10 percent annual rate over the June-to-September period, moving this

aggregate to just below the upper end of its long-run range. There is a risk

that M2 growth could be even more rapid if institutions prove especially

reluctant to reduce offering rates on conventional NOW and savings accounts

as market rates drop closer to the previous regulatory ceilings of 5-1/4 and

5-1/2 percent on these accounts. In any event, given the lagged effects of

any near-term easing in market conditions, M2 growth in the fourth quarter



-11-

could continue at a fairly rapid pace, absent a subsequent move toward more

reserve restraint; this would leave the aggregate around the upper end or

even somewhat above its long-run range for the year. M3 would grow at around

a 9-1/2 percent annual rate over the June-to-September period under this

alternative, entering the fourth quarter near the upper end of its annual

range. The risks of M3 running significantly above the upper end of its

annual range, even in the event of a surge in OCDs and savings deposits,

would be limited by offsetting reductions in issuance of managed liabilities

by banks and thrifts. M1 would be expected to increase at a 16 percent rate

between June and September under this alternative, moving even further above

the upper end of its range by the end of the quarter.

(15) Short-term rates would decline appreciably, with the 3-month

Treasury bill rate falling toward 5-1/4 percent under alternative A. Bond

yields probably would also decline, but any sustained sizable drop likely

would require signs of continuing sluggishness in the economy and lack of

price pressures, as well as the absence of substantial weakness in the dollar.

The dollar could come under heavy selling pressure with this alternative,

unless key foreign central banks were also to take easing steps.

(16) Alternative C assumes a tightening of reserve positions,

with borrowing from the discount window rising to around $500 million and the

federal funds rate backing up to the 6-3/4 to 6-7/8 percent area. Under this

alternative, the slowing in M2 and M3 likely would be sufficient to move growth

of these aggregates to within the 7 to 9 percent three-month range established

at the last meeting. In addition, the tighter reserve conditions of this

alternative would place these aggregates on a trajectory that would better



-12-

assure that they would remain well within their annual ranges for the year.

Growth in M1 also would slow substantially by September and into the fourth

quarter as market interest rates backed up. Growth for the year still would

be considerably above the upper end of its range, however, perhaps in the

vicinity of 12 percent.

(17) Treasury bill rates could rise by more than 50 basis points

to around 6-1/4 percent as reserve conditions tightened unexpectedly. Rates

on CDs could jump by even more if such a move were viewed as aggravating re-

payment difficulties of bank borrowers, especially if the rise in rates were

seen as likely to restrain economic activity substantially. The slide of the

dollar on foreign exchange markets would, at least temporarily, be slowed or

halted. A firmer tone to the dollar and a reassessment of the inflation out-

look could act to limit somewhat the accompanying rise in long-term interest

rates.



-13-

Directive language

(18) Draft language for the operational paragraph, with the

usual options for alternative specifications of reserve pressures, is

shown below. This draft follows the format used at the July meeting

in specifying expected growth rates for M2 and M3 but not for M1. With

respect to M1, the draft retains language referring to the expectation of

a reduction in M1 growth from the second-quarter pace. Under all three

bluebook alternatives, the staff is projecting some slowing in the rate

of M1 growth for June to September relative to the previous three months,

although the degree of slowing is not very marked, especially under alter-

native A. Should the Committee choose this alternative, it may wish to

delete the language referring to the expected moderation in M1 growth,

leaving the statement that M1 will be judged in light of the broader aggre-

gates and other factors. With regard to possible intermeeting adjustments

in the degree of reserve pressures, the draft provides for symmetry in

either direction, as in the July directive, but could be adapted to an

asymmetric approach (with the appropriate use of "might" and "would")

as in a number of earlier directives.

OPERATIONAL PARAGRAPH

In the implementation of policy for the immediate future, the

Committee seeks to decrease somewhat (Alt. A)/MAINTAIN (Alt. B)/INCREASE

SOMEWHAT (Alt. C) the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions-

[DEL: taking account of the possibility of a change in the discount rate.]

This action is expected to be consistent with growth in M2 and M3 over



-14-

the period from June to September at annual rates of about ____ TO ____

[DEL: 7 to 9] percent. While growth in M1 is expected to moderate from

the exceptionally large increase during the second quarter, that

growth will continue to be judged in the light of the behavior of

M2 and M3 and other factors. Somewhat greater or lesser reserve

restraint might (WOULD) be acceptable depending on the behavior of

the aggregates, the strength of the business expansion, developments

in foreign exchange markets, progress against inflation, and condi-

tions in domestic and international credit markets. The Chairman

may call for Committee consultation if it appears to the Manager for

Domestic Operations that reserve conditions during the period before

the next meeting are likely to be associated with a federal funds

rate persistently outside a range of ____ TO ____ [DEL: 4 to 8] percent.
