MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Prepared for the Federal Open Market Committee

By the staff Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System

Class I - FOMC March 27, 1992

MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Recent Developments

(1) The Federal Reserve's stance in the reserves market re-

mained unchanged over the intermeeting period.1 In the three com-

plete maintenance periods since the February FOMC meeting, the federal

funds rate averaged 4 percent, and funds have continued to trade mostly

at or a little below that level in the current maintenance period. The

allowance for adjustment plus seasonal borrowing was raised $25 million

to $100 million immediately after the FOMC meeting to reflect an ex-

pected rise in seasonal credit and has since remained unchanged. Bor-

rowing averaged only $67 million in the three complete maintenance

periods and is running at $73 million in the current period; adjustment

credit has remained unusually low and seasonal borrowing--subject to a

less attractive rate under the new market-based rate program implemented

this year--has increased relatively little.

(2) Despite the stable federal funds rate, most market inter-

est rates rose from 20 to 60 basis points over the intermeeting period,

as spending picked up and expectations took hold that a solid economic

2
expansion was underway. Perhaps reflecting the changed cyclical

outlook, the most pronounced increases occurred at intermediate maturi-

ties, with the three-year Treasury note rate moving around 60 basis

points higher versus a 20 basis point rise in the thirty-year bond

yield. Currently the yield on thirty-year bonds is about one-half per-

centage point above its low in early January, though it remains about

1. On February 18, the Board announced a reduction in the reserve
requirement on transaction deposits from 12 to 10 percent, to take
effect April 2. This action was designed to free up funds for lending
and to strengthen the financial condition of banks, thereby improving
their access to capital markets and putting them in a better position
to extend credit.

2. Discussions of interest rates, exchange rates, and stock prices
are based on data available through noon, March 27.



one-half percentage point below its peak in June and July of 1991. The

interest rate on conventional fixed-rate mortgages is now 80 basis

points above its trough in early January, having increased by 35 basis

points to about 9 percent over the intermeeting period. Yields on

corporate bonds rated A and above rose in tandem with Treasuries, pre-

serving their narrow spreads, but bond rates for many lesser-rated

borrowers, whose prospects apparently were seen to be especially

improved by the stronger economic outlook, were unchanged or even fell

somewhat. Spreads on bank debentures also narrowed, and indexes of bank

stocks rose 2 to 3 percent, with only a very small boost from the

announcement of the reserve requirement cut. while most broad stock

price indexes were down between 2 and 4 percent.

(3) Since the last Committee meeting, the dollar has appre-

ciated about 3-1/2 percent on a weighted-average basis, primarily in re-

sponse to the indications of a more buoyant economy in the United

States. In addition, economic activity in several foreign countries

showed signs of falling short of expectations. Economic weakness in

Japan reinforced expectations of a discount rate cut and, along with

further political and financial scandals, contributed to a 5-1/2 percent

drop in the yen against the dollar. Japanese short-term interest rates

declined 25 basis points, while long-term rates were down about 15 basis

points. German short-term rates, on the other hand, rose 20 basis

points and long-term rates 15 basis points on balance as money growth

remained robust and inflation concerns intensified, despite faltering

economic activity.

On two occasions, the Desk

sold small amounts of dollars against yen in cooperation with Japanese



monetary authorities. Of the total amount of $150 million, $125 million

was for Treasury account and $25 million for System account.

(4) The broad monetary aggregates accelerated sharply in

February, but M2 is estimated to have flattened and M3 to have con-

tracted somewhat in March. From December to March, M2 and M3 grew at

4-1/4 percent and 2 percent rates, respectively, compared with the 3 and

1-1/2 percent rates expected at the last FOMC meeting. The pickup in

growth from the fourth quarter to the first likely owed in part to the

strengthening of income and spending. In addition, declines in market

interest rates in late 1991 also provided some impetus to money growth,

although that impetus probably was partly offset by increases in oppor-

tunity costs associated with the recent backup in market rates. Also

contributing to faster money growth, especially in February, were ac-

celerated individual tax refunds resulting from increased electronic

filings and a surge in refinancings of securitized mortgage loans.

The deceleration of M2 in March likely reflects diminished effects of

these special factors and the widening opportunity costs. Runoffs of

money funds, occasioned by the rise in short-term market interest rates,

also weakened the broad aggregates in March. Although M2 picked up in

the first quarter and ran above the path expected at the last meeting,

its growth is still appreciably below the pace predicted on the basis of

historical relationships with income and short-term interest rates.

Velocity is estimated to have been about flat in the first quarter,

compared with a 2 percent decline predicted by the standard staff model.

3. Prepayments on mortgages that have been securitized typically
are held in demand deposits for 15 to 45 days prior to disbursement to
holders of mortgage-backed securities, in accordance with the provi-
sions of GNMA and FNMA contracts. Data on GNMA prepayments are not
yet available for February, but estimates based on the experience of
FNMA securities suggest that overall prepayment activity may have
boosted M2 growth a percentage point or less last month. The effect
of accelerated refunds likely was of roughly similar magnitude.



A number of factors likely account for this continuing shift in M2

demand, including sizable outflows to bond and stock mutual funds, which

remained quite strong into March, and preferences for financing spending

by drawing down financial assets rather than taking on new debt.

(5) Liquid components continued to provide the major impetus

to money growth over February and March, in part reflecting still narrow

opportunity costs relative to short-term market rates and to returns on

small time deposits. Demand deposits have been particularly strong,

expanding at a 35 percent rate over February and March. A Senior Finan-

cial Officer Survey of large banks in March indicated that the recent

bulge in demand deposits was attributable mainly to the effects of lower

interest rates, operating through increased compensating balance re-

quirements and reduced incentives to economize on these deposits by

shifting funds to other instruments. A number of respondents also cited

increased activity in financial markets and higher balances held by

mortgage servicers (likely because of the surge in refinancings). The

bulge in demand deposits helped to boost M1 growth to a 19-1/4 percent

rate from December to March.4

(6) Bank credit has grown little in February and March. Bank

acquisitions of government securities continued to run below the pace of

late last year, perhaps owing to a reassessment of the repayment risk

associated with CMOs in light of the recent heavy volume of mortgage

refinancings. At the same time, bank real estate loans have increased

on balance, perhaps as the backup in rates encouraged them to hold

rather than to securitize loans whose market value had declined. None-

theless, total bank loans have declined over recent months, held down by

4. The increased strength in transaction deposits and required
reserves lifted the growth of total reserves to a 26-1/4 percent rate
over December to March. Currency expanded at a 7-1/2 percent rate and
the monetary base at a 10-1/4 percent rate over the three months.



falling business and consumer loans. The dropoff in business loans does

not seem to result from any further tightening of lending terms; indeed,

the February Survey of Terms of Bank Lending indicated that the spread

of business lending rates over market rates has narrowed and the January

Bank Lending Practices Survey suggested little change in credit stan-

dards for such loans. The latter survey also showed a bit more willing-

ness to provide consumer credit; the drop in consumer loans partly re-

flected continuing securitization of such credit.

(7) Along with bank lending, total credit growth appears to

have remained quite weak, despite the pickup in spending. Growth in the

debt of domestic nonfinancial sectors is estimated to have increased at

an average rate of only 3 percent over January and February, restrained

by an anemic 2 percent average rate of growth for the debt of nonfederal

borrowers. Business funding needs have been quite modest as inventories

have declined and corporations have found it attractive to issue high

volumes of equity to reduce reliance on debt. Gross issuance of cor-

porate bonds, which remained strong in February and March, included

sizable refinancing of callable debt. Households seem to be taking on

larger volumes of mortgage debt to finance home purchases. In addition,

households may be increasing primary mortgage indebtedness in the pro-

cess of refinancing existing mortgages, although reports suggest they

are using the extra cash to repay home equity and consumer credit.

Nonetheless, consumer credit probably increased slightly over the first

two months of the year, after dropping through much of 1991.

Policy Alternatives

(8) Three policy alternatives are presented below for con-

sideration by the Committee. Under alternative B, federal funds would

continue to trade around 4 percent in association with an initial bor-

rowing allowance of $100 million. Over the intermeeting period, the

borrowing allowance likely would need to be increased to accommodate a

rise in demands for seasonal credit, but probably by less than in pre-

vious years owing to the less attractive rate on such credit under the

new program. Under alternative A, the federal funds rate would decline

to the 3-1/2 percent area in conjunction with a reduction in the initial

borrowing allowance to $75 million.5 In contrast, the funds rate

would return to 4-1/2 percent and the initial borrowing allowance would

increase to $125 million under alternative C. Under any of the alterna-

tives, the staff anticipates little difficulty in bank reserve manage-

ment from the cut in reserve requirements effective in early April, and

as a result there is unlikely to be much additional funds market vola-

tility. Part of the initial reduction in required reserve balances,

estimated at $8-1/2 billion, will be offset by the seasonal upsurge in

required reserves on transaction deposits; but even after this bulge

abates, the total of required reserves plus required clearing balances

should be above the level needed for clearing purposes.

5. The difference in the borrowing assumptions between alterna-
tives B and alternatives A and C has been narrowed from $50 to $25
million. This modification has been made to take into account the
advent of the market-based rate for seasonal credit, which likely
renders such credit unresponsive to changes in federal funds rates,
and also the damped response of adjustment credit to variations in the
spread between the federal funds rate and discount rate observed over
the last year.

6. To date, only a few banks have increased their required clear-
ing balances or communicated their intention to do so to offset the
drop in required reserve balances.



(9) Markets appear to anticipate no change in policy over the

intermeeting period, and thus interest rates should remain close to

current levels under alternative B. Nevertheless, there could be a

downward bias to rate movements over coming months. Information on the

economy consistent with the greenbook forecast may be somewhat more

mixed than recent releases, and with aggregate price measures damped and

money growth slower, expectations of future inflation and the likelihood

of monetary tightening later in the year could be revised down. Any

tendency toward rate declines might be reinforced if the market became

convinced that a fiscal stimulus package had been definitively ruled

out. Under these circumstances, the dollar could reverse some of its

recent gains.

(10) The steepening yield curve for maturities out to two

years and the pattern of futures market quotations suggest some firming

of expectations that policy will tighten beginning later in the year.

In this context, the unexpected easing of money market conditions of

alternative A might cause a market reassessment of the intentions of the

Federal Reserve, leading to a significant downward revision in the

expected course of short-term interest rates for the next year or so.

Short-term rates would fall by about the 1/2 percentage point drop in

the funds rate, and some intermediate-term rates might drop quite sub-

stantially as well. Effects on expected rates at longer horizons are

more difficult to judge. In the absence of a worsening in the economic

outlook, the easing might be interpreted as expansionary--and poten-

tially inflationary--and short-term rates would be expected to rebound

ultimately to even higher levels than market participants now antici-

pate; in this event, bond yields might drop relatively little, if at

all. If the policy ease came to be seen as needed to counter threats to



the expansion, however, arising perhaps from recent upward movements in

long-term interest rates and exchange rates, the action could be viewed

as promising lower short-term rates for a considerable period, and bond

rates would move down appreciably. In either case, the dollar would

fall.

(11) The tightening of policy under alternative C would lead

to about a 50 basis point rise in money market rates, which likely would

be passed through fully to the prime rate. Long-term rates also would

rise and the dollar would firm, especially if the Federal Reserve's

action were taken as confirming views that a robust expansion was well

established with inflationary potential. On the other hand, to the

extent that market participants saw the early move as improving pros-

pects for disinflation or that the action would be reversed quickly

because it risked undermining an acceptable economic recovery, effects

on bond yields would be limited.

(12) Absent an easing of reserve conditions, expansion in M2

and M3 is expected to be slower over the second quarter than over the

first. Projections for money growth over the March-to-June period under

all three alternatives are given in the table below and on the table and

charts on the following pages. Under the unchanged reserve conditions

of alternative B, M2 growth is projected to moderate to a 3-1/2 percent

rate from March to June. leaving this aggregate below the midpoint of

its annual range. Although more rapid income growth would tend to boost

demands for M2 at the relatively stable interest rates of this alterna-

tive, the lagged effects of the rise in market interest rates over the

past few months will be restraining money growth relative to income. In

addition, a number of the special factors boosting money growth in the

first quarter will no longer be at work, and in some cases their effects

will be reversing. One such factor is the shifting of tax refunds

into February from later months. Another involves mortgage refinancing;

such activity already may have leveled out with depressing effects on

growth of demand deposits, and refinancing could well decline

subsequently in response to the rise in mortgage rates, causing

currently swollen demand deposit accounts of mortgage servicers to be

drawn down. The slowdown in M2 over the March-to-June period would be

concentrated in the M1 component, which still is expected to expand at a

11 percent rate.8  Given that opportunity costs on its more liquid

7. Projections of money growth are especially uncertain at this
time of year owing to the massive payment flows associated with the
April 15 tax date. Changes in nonwithheld tax payments this year are
projected to be well within the experience of recent years. Thus, we
are assuming that these flows are captured by existing seasonal
factors.

8. The cut in the reserve requirement on transaction deposits is
expected to have little net effect on M1. Banks may bid slightly more
aggressively for NOW accounts, but compensating balance requirements,
which are usually calculated to incorporate the cost of reserve re-
quirements, will be lower.

The continued strength in transaction components results in
projected growth over March to June in required and total reserves at
rates of 13-1/2 and 14-3/4 percent, respectively, after adjusting for
the effects of the change in reserve requirements. The monetary base
would expand at a 7-1/2 percent rate.

components remain favorable, inflows to nontransaction M2 are expected

to continue to be concentrated in savings deposits (including MMDAs),

while sizable outflows from retail time deposits persist.

(13) As a consequence of rising opportunity costs and waning

effects of special factors, M2 velocity is projected to increase sig-

nificantly in the second quarter--at about a 2 percent annual rate under

alternative B. The modest deceleration of M2 embodied in this alterna-

tive is expected to be consistent with the greenbook forecast of a con-

tinued pickup in the economy. With credit flows concentrated in longer-

term markets, depositories will remain fairly unaggressive bidders for

deposits, and households will continue to direct savings to capital

market instruments. In these circumstances, the staff is forecasting a

1-1/2 percent increase in M2 velocity over the four quarters of 1992

under the greenbook forecast, the same change in velocity as was fore-

cast in February. For the year, M2 now would be expected to increase

around 4 percent, a little faster than projected in February in line

with stronger projected nominal GDP.

(14) Growth in M3 under alternative B would moderate slightly

to a 1-1/2 percent pace over the March-to-June period. In addition to

weaker M2 growth, M3 money funds should be about unchanged over the

second quarter under conditions of stable money market rates. On the

other hand, deposit inflows at banks might firm as their asset growth

strengthens a bit. With improving capital positions and better access

to funding markets, banks might become a little more willing to hold the

loans that they originate, rather than sell them. Demands for commer-

cial and industrial loans are likely to strengthen a little, as inven-

tory liquidation abates. Nonetheless, businesses are expected to con-

tinue to concentrate much of their financing in bond and equity markets

as they repair balance sheets. Net mortgage borrowing by households is

expected to rise, accompanying the recovery in housing activity, with

the bulk of these funds coming from the open market through mortgage

securities. Indebtedness of the nonfederal sectors should grow a little

faster over the March-to-June period, but, at only a 3 percent annual

rate of expansion, will remain quite anemic. Federal debt, in contrast,

will accelerate noticeably, boosting overall debt growth to a 6 percent

pace over the second quarter and lifting the debt aggregate to within

its 1992 monitoring range at quarter-end.

(15) Under the lower interest rates of alternative A, M2 is

expected to grow at a 4-1/2 percent rate over the March-to-June period,

keeping this aggregate around the midpoint of its 1992 target range.

The decline in market rates would boost inflows to M1 accounts and money

market mutual funds, although the still-lower return on retail balances

in M2 relative to those seen on capital market instruments would again

encourage some M2 holders to divert balances to the bond and equity

markets. M3 would continue to grow at a 2 percent rate over the March-

to-June period, remaining noticeably above the lower end of its range.

(16) M2 growth would slacken to a 2-1/2 percent rate over the

March-to-June period under alternative C, bringing this aggregate ap-

preciably below the midpoint of its annual range. Much of the slowing

would be in its M1 component. In the context of a somewhat more uncer-

tain outlook for the recovery, bankers might remain highly cautious

lenders and continue to hold their balance sheets in check; sluggish

bank credit growth and likely runoffs of M3 money funds would imply M3

growth of only 1 percent at an annual rate over the March-to-June

period.
