Recent developments

(1) M1 grew at a 10.6 per cent annual rate in March, a little

more than projected in the last bluebook. Although growth in April is

estimated to be somewhat slower, on average, the extent of the slowing is now

expected to be less than anticipated. Thus, for the two months combined, M1

now appears to be expanding at slightly above a 9 per cent annual rate,

compared with the Committee's 5½ to 8½ per cent range of tolerance adopted

at the last meeting. Growth of M2, on the other hand, appears to be within

the Committee's two-month range of tolerance,as shown in the table below.

With business loan demands very strong, and with large CD run-offs expected

around the tax date, banks have bid actively for large CD's and non-deposit

sources of funds. As a result, expansion of the adjusted credit proxy has

been much more rapid than anticipated--accelerating to a 12 per cent annual

rate in March, and a projected 23 per cent annual rate in April.

(2) Because of the rapid expansion in CD's and bank credit,

RPD growth appears likely to be well in excess of the upper limit of

its range of tolerance. As may be seen from the table below, CD's and

nondeposit sources absorbed considerably more reserves than originally

expected. Private demand deposits also absorbed more reserves than

expected, but the overshoot was considerably less than for CD's.

(3) In accordance with the discussion at the March 19 meeting,

early in the inter-meeting period the Desk sought reserve conditions

that would raise the Federal funds rate from the 9 ½ per cent level just

reached at the time of the meeting to a level more consistent with the

Committee's desires with respect to the monetary aggregates. Early action

was considered desirable because of expected Treasury financing operations



-3-

at the end of March; a tax bill was auctioned on March 26 and a 2-year

note on March 28. As the aggregates strengthened, the Desk became an even

more reluctant supplier of nonborrowed reserves. By the close of the

period, reserve operations were expected to be consistent with a Federal

funds rate of 10 per cent or somewhat higher. Over the three full

statement weeks ending within the inter-meeting period, member bank

borrowing at Federal Reserve Banks has averaged nearly $1.5 billion,

about $350 million larger than in the three preceding statement weeks.

(4) The combination of heavy business credit demands, tighter

money market conditions, and developing evidence that the economy was

not so weak as anticipated contributed to large across-the-board interest

rate advances during the inter-meeting period. Advances in short-term

rates ranged generally from 50 to 100 basis points. With rates on

commercial paper and large bank CD's rising steeply, major banks came

under particularly heavy pressure as both their business loans and the

costs of funds to cover such loans increased. Reflecting this squeeze,

the bank prime rate moved upward in rapid sequence from 8¾ at the time

of the last meeting to 10 per cent at a number of banks in the latest

week. Bond yields rose 35 to 75 basis points during the period,with the

consequent sudden large capital losses leading to some unsettlement in

markets.

(5) Very recently, however, securities markets have shown

some signs of stabilizing. This week's offerings of new corporate and

municipal securities have been well received at the higher interest rate

levels, and yields on some key U.S. Government securities have edged a

little lower. Yield declines were quite sharp in the bill market, where



-4-

there is a technical shortage of supply. The 3-month Treasury bill,

for example, has traded most recently at 8.25 per cent, down from the

recent high of 8.65 per cent.

(6) The large recent increases in rates on competing market

securities have begun to exert pressures on non-bank financial inter-

mediaries. While flows to these institutions remained quite favorable

in March, New York City savings banks--typically the first to suffer

from disintermediation--experienced large withdrawals in early April,

comparable in relative magnitude to those of early April 1970. Industry

reports suggest that intermediaries generally are taking a more cautious

approach on mortgage commitments, and the most sensitive interest rates in

mortgage markets have begun to rise.

(7) The table on the next page shows (in percentage annual rates

of change) selected monetary and financial flows over various recent time

periods. Appendix Table III compares money supply growth rates computed on

a quarterly-average basis with those computed on a last-month-of-quarter

basis. Projected figures on the two bases are shown in appendix Table IV

for the three alternatives presented in the next section.

(9) Alternative C represents continuation of the strategy with

regard to the aggregates adopted by the Committee at its last meeting.

That is, the alternative contemplates return of M1 to the 5¾ per cent long-

run growth path (depicted in the chart on the following page) by September.

Accomplishing this would appear to require interest rates somewhat higher

than indicated at the last meeting, and also higher than those currently

prevailing, in view of the stronger growth in nominal GNP that is now

projected for the second and third quarters. The Federal funds rate range

for the inter-meeting period thought to be consistent with the alternative

C pattern for the aggregates is 9¾--11¼ per cent, centering on 10½ per cent.

(10) Alternative B calls for somewhat more rapid growth in the

monetary aggregates over the second and third quarters, typified by a 6 per

cent growth rate for M 1 . The B growth rates seem obtainable with little

further significant change in money market conditions and short-term

interest rates, in light of the sharp increases in short-term rates that

have already occurred during the past two months. Thus, the Federal funds

rate under this alternative centers around 10 per cent. The still more

rapid longer-run growth rates of alternative A--including a 6¾ per cent

rate for M 1 over the second and third quarters--appear likely to be

associated with declines in both short- and long-term interest rates.

(11) Over the April-May period, M1 growth is likely to be

somewhat above the long-run path. Under alternative B, for example, M 1

growth is indicated in the 6--8 per cent range. These above-path in-

creases reflect in large part the sizable expansion in M 1 currently

estimated for April. Given the lagged relationship between interest

rates and money demand, however, M 1 growth is expected to moderate later

as it approaches the longer-run path.

(12) Between now and mid-May, short-term interest rates could

decline somewhat under alternative B. Indeed, the very recent drop in

the 3-month bill rate probably is anticipating some of the potential for

downward rate adjustments. Any decline that did develop over the next

few weeks is very likely to be temporary, assuming a 10 per cent Federal

funds rate. Over the longer run, the 3-month bill rate would seem most

likely to fluctuate around a 8 ½--8¾ per cent range.



-8-

(13) A number of factors might contribute to temporary easing

in short-term markets in the weeks immediately ahead. The extremely

large issuance of new CD's by banks, which has contributed to recent

upward pressures on short-term rates, has partly reflected advance

preparation for large tax date maturities, and those pressures should

abate after mid-April. Funds from large oil payments in April may also

become available to the short-term sector of U.S. credit markets via

U.S. banks' use of the Euro-dollar market. In addition, that portion

of the $4½ billion of maturing April tax bills not turned in for taxes

would generate reinvestment demand for short-term securities. Finally,

the Treasury's May refunding--to be announced on May 1--might include

some cash redemption of the $5½ billion of maturing publicly held debt

because of the possibility of debt ceiling problems.

(14) A rise in the funds rate over the next few weeks--such

as would be likely under alternative C-- would generate market expecta-

tions of a further tightening of monetary policy. This would offset any

tendency for short-term rates to decline, even temporarily, and would

probably result in further upward adjustments. Over the next few months,

the 3-month bill rate could be around 9 per cent, and possibly higher in

the summer when Treasury cash borrowing demands are seasonally strong.

(15) Under alternative B, with market interest rates little

changed on balance from current high levels, net savings inflows to

nonbank thrift institutions are likely to be slower than the 8 per cent

first-quarter pace. We would estimate a growth rate of about 6 per cent

in the second quarter and 4 per cent in the third, assuming no change in



-9-

Regulation Q. Under alternative C, these institutions would come under

greater pressure, of course, but in either case some tightening in the

availability of mortgage loan commitments would be likely, compared with

the situation in the early months of the year.

(16) Net inflows to commercial banks of time and savings

deposits other than large CD's are likewise expected to be slower over

the months ahead than in the first quarter, though the experience

of banks may continue to be somewhat better than at thrift

institutions. Commercial banks appear to be having greater success

than the specialized thrift institutions in attracting large time deposits

(those of $100,000 or more) that are not subject to Regulation Q ceilings.

Such deposits are reported as part of the other time and savings category

and, unlike large negotiable CD's, are included in the M2 measure.

(17) We would expect banks to offset some part of any loss in

other time and savings deposits through increased issuance of large CD's

or greater borrowing in theEuro-dollar market, depending on relative costs.

However, under any of the alternatives presented, the amount of borrowing

by banks through CD's and nondeposit sources is expected to be considerably

less than in recent weeks, partly because preparations for tax-date run-

offs will have been completed and partly because business loan demand on

banks is expected to moderate from the exceptionally rapid pace of March.

Moreover, it is probable that the spread between the bank lending rate

and the commercial paper rate will favor bank credit less than was the

case in March.



-10-

(18) In intermediate- and long-term debt markets, demands

are likely to remain strong over the weeks ahead. Corporate and State

and local government bond offerings remain quite high, despite recent

postponements. Also, the Treasury refunding will probably involve

marketing securities with mainly intermediate-term maturities. Given

the volume of private and governmental securities in prospect, bond yields

could rise considerably further under alternative C. High-grade corporate

issues, which are already above their summer highs, could approach their

1970 peaks, and Treasury notes and bonds could rise above them (the 20 year

Treasury bond is already above the earlier peak). Under alternative B,

further upward adjustments in bond yields are likely to be comparatively

modest, given the increases that already have occurred and the stabilizing

tendencies that we would expect in short-term markets.

(19) Under alternative A, savings inflows to thrift institutions

would be expected to recover to close to their first-quarter pace, as

receding market rates provide less competition for savings funds. At

banks, deposits inflows--both demand and consumer-type time and savings--

would probably be well sustained. As a result, credit demands could be

financed without banks adding to pressures on credit markets through

aggressive issuance of large CD's or reductions in portfolio liquidity.



-11-

Proposed directive language

(20) Presented below are three alternative formulations

for the operational paragraph of the directive, which are intended

to correspond to the similarly lettered policy alternatives dis-

cussed in the preceding section. For all three alternatives,

it is proposed to include a reference to Treasury financing because

the regular May refinancing will be announced on May 1.

Alternative A

To implement this policy, while taking account of THE

FORTHCOMING TREASURY FINANCING AND OF international and

domestic financial market developments, [DEL: including the

prospective Treasury financing] the Committee seeks to achieve

bank reserve and money market conditions [DEL: that would moderate

CONSISTENT WITH growth in monetary aggregates over the

months ahead SUFFICIENT TO ACCOMMODATE MODERATE EXPANSION

IN REAL GNP AT THE HIGHER DOLLAR VALUES NOW PREVAILING.

Alternative B

To implement this policy, while taking account of

THE FORTHCOMING TREASURY FINANCING AND OF international

and domestic financial market developments, [DEL: including

the prospective Treasury financing] the Committee seeks

to achieve bank reserve and money market conditions that

would moderate SOMEWHAT growth in monetary aggregates

over the months ahead.



-12-

Alternative C

To implement this policy, while taking account of

THE FORTHCOMING TREASURY FINANCING AND OF international and

domestic financial market developments, [DEL: including the

prospective Treasury financing] the Committee seeks to achieve

bank reserve and money market conditions that would moderate

growth in monetary aggregates over the months ahead.

(21) In the event that the Committee wishes to couch the

operational paragraph of the directive in terms of money market

conditions, the specifications of alternative B might be associated

with language indicating that "...the Committee seeks to maintain

about the prevailing money market conditions, provided that the

monetary aggregates appear to be growing at rates within the specified

ranges of tolerance."

ments maturing in 16 days or more, are indicators of dealer holdings available for sale over the near-tert. Other security dealer positions are debt
