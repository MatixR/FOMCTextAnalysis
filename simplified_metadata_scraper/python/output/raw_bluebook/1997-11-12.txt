Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain. 
 

Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These

MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Recent Developments

(1) Financial markets were turbulent at times in the second half of the intermeeting

period. Against a backdrop of mounting stresses in Asian financial markets, equity prices

dropped appreciably in the week ending October 24 and plunged worldwide the following

Monday (Chart 1). The sell-off was accompanied by a sharp decline in interest rates on U.S.

Treasury securities, as investors sought liquidity and safety, and by a substantial widening of

spreads over Treasuries on emerging-market and, to a much lesser extent, U.S. corporate debt.

Actual price volatility soared, as did implied volatility on bond and stock prices as inferred

from options markets. Over the following days, however, increased demand for equities in

the United States, including from individual investors, contributed to a rebound in U.S. and

foreign equity markets and an unwinding of some of the previous flight to safety. Adding to

the positive tone in financial markets, especially abroad, were international steps to stabilize

Indonesian financial markets (paragraph 3). However, financial markets remain skittish, and

U.S. equities sold off again today, sparked by renewed declines in Asian stock prices and

unanticipated strength in U.S. employment and wages.1 2

1. Trading volume was extremely heavy in U.S. bond and stock markets, with the
number of equity shares changing hands setting records well above previous peaks. In
general, U.S. trading, clearing, and settlement systems appear to have handled the surge in
volume smoothly, although NASDAQ experienced some delays in handling orders.

2. Despite the tumult in capital markets, implementation of U.S. monetary policy was
fairly routine over the intermeeting period. The Desk was particularly careful to ensure that
nonborrowed reserves were provided in sufficient volume through open market operations to

(2) On balance, financial market developments during the intermeeting period seem

to have left investors a little less confident about economic and financial prospects and with

expectations of lower inflation. U.S. equity price indexes fell 2-1/2 to 5-1/2 percent over the

intermeeting period, leaving major indexes 18 to 26 percent above their levels at the

beginning of the year. Yield spreads on private securities relative to Treasuries rose around

15 to 25 basis points, but these spreads remain near the low end of the range of the past

couple of years. Treasury coupon yields declined 10 to 25 basis points, with all of the

decline registered after stock prices began to drop sharply.3 With consumer inflation

continuing to run lower than investors had anticipated and international financial

developments reinforcing perceptions of continued disinflation--or even, to some, incipient

deflation--the spread between nominal and real yields at the ten-year maturity narrowed about

15 basis points. In view of continued good inflation performance in the United States and of

stresses in financial markets worldwide and their perceived feedback on the U.S. economy,

facilitate any unusual demands for excess reserves arising, for example, out of heavy clearing
and settlement activity. Its operations, however, were conducted in the usual manner and at
the usual time of day. In the event, while pressure on the funds rate has emerged in recent
days, it appears mostly to reflect more typical factors, such as month-end payment flows and
Treasury securities settlements. Borrowing at the discount window has remained light. For
the intermeeting period as a whole, the federal funds rate has averaged close to the FOMC's
intended level of 5-1/2 percent.

3. Bond yields had risen earlier in the intermeeting period on the heels of the Chairman's
October 8 testimony warning of inflation risks as well as publication of the PPI for
September; they drifted lower subsequently as consumer price data proved more encouraging.
Treasury bill rates rose 1/4 percentage point over the intermeeting period, boosted by a
resumption of net issuance by the Treasury in that sector.

investors evidently concluded that the possibility of any firming of U.S. monetary policy over

coming months, already low, had vanished.

(3) Amid spreading financial turmoil in developing countries, the dollar

appreciated significantly against the currencies of many emerging market countries during the

intermeeting period. In response to pressure on its currency, the Hong Kong Monetary

Authority drove its market interest rates up sharply in order to hold its peg to the dollar. In

response, stock prices in Hong Kong fell by a third, triggering the worldwide drop in equity

values in late October. The announcement on October 31 of an IMF-led support package for

Indonesia--which includes a possible short-term loan of up to $3 billion through the

Treasury's Exchange Stabilization Fund--as well as coordinated intervention in support of the

Indonesian rupiah by Japan, Singapore, and Indonesia contributed to partial recoveries of

beleaguered financial markets in emerging-market economies. In Asia, equity prices dropped

4 to 32 percent over the intermeeting period, and some currencies in that region depreciated

significantly against the dollar. For the first time this year, stresses in Asia spilled over to

financial markets in Latin America, and spreads on Brady bonds increased 2 to 3 percentage

points.4 As speculative pressure against Brazilian assets mounted, one-month domestic

interest rates rose 20 percentage points and share prices fell 27 percent. The Mexican peso

depreciated about 7-1/4 percent, on balance, and share prices dropped 13 percent.

(4) In contrast to its gains against currencies of developing nations, the dollar

slipped 2 percent on a G-10 weighted-average basis, muting its appreciation overall. The

portion of Brady bond cash flows and those on comparable Treasury payments.

dollar was little changed against the yen. Prospects for the Japanese economy appeared to

deteriorate over the intermeeting period; domestic demand evidently has not yet rebounded

from the depressing effects of the consumption tax increase in the spring, and the

intensification of financial turmoil in other Asian countries raised the prospect of further

negative shocks to Japanese exports. Over the intermeeting period, the Nikkei index fell 12

percent, and long-term rates in Japan declined 25 basis points to 1 5/8 percent, a historical low.

Virtually all of the dollar's decline occurred against European currencies. Short-term interest

rates in most continental European countries climbed 20 to 35 basis points over the period as

widespread expectations of a tightening of monetary policy in Germany were confirmed when

the Bundesbank raised the rate on its weekly repo tender on October 9. Long-term interest

rates in continental Europe rose in the first two weeks of October in line with the advance in

short-term rates, but they reversed course as prices in global equity markets declined in the

second half of the month. This week, the Bank of England raised its RP rate 25 basis points,

citing higher-than-expected inflation and persistent strength in domestic demand; financial

markets in the United Kingdom sold off moderately on the unexpected action. For the

intermeeting period as a whole, bond yields in most European countries were up 5 to 10 basis

points, and equity indexes generally fell 5 to 10 percent.

; the

Desk did not intervene.

(5) The broad monetary aggregates decelerated further in October. M2 grew at a

4 3/4 percent annual rate, in line with the projection in the previous bluebook, bringing its

advance from the fourth quarter of 1996 to 5 percent, the upper end of its 1 to 5 percent



-5-

annual range. 5 The slowing was attributable to money market mutual funds, whose growth

was off considerably from their strong summer pace. Preliminary data suggest that flows into

money market mutual funds and deposits did not benefit significantly from the volatility in

the capital markets in recent weeks. While mutual funds reported a substantial increase in

customer inquiries and activity, outflows from domestic equity funds proved small and

temporary; weakness in international funds, however, proved to be more lasting. With bank

credit growth moderating last month, growth of M3 also edged down in October, but by less

than the staff had envisioned in the last bluebook, to a still-strong 8 percent annual rate; from

the fourth quarter of last year, this aggregate has risen at an 8 percent annual rate, placing it

well above its 2 to 6 percent annual range.

(6) M2 velocity was about flat in the third quarter, with short-term opportunity

costs unchanged. Abstracting from movements in opportunity costs, V2 has trended higher

over the past few years (Chart 2), perhaps reflecting continued flows into long-term mutual

funds. Although it did not rise last quarter, the behavior of V2 remained broadly consistent

with a model that includes a stronger time trend than was present from the mid-1960s to the

late 1980s, but a similar long-run response to opportunity costs (lower panel of chart).

Nonetheless, considerable uncertainty continues to surround the prospective behavior of M2

demand.

5. The growth rates of M2 and M3 for the year to date, as well as for 1996, were revised
down 1/4 to 1/2 percentage point in response to the receipt of data on IRA/Keogh accounts at
money market mutual funds, which are excluded from the monetary aggregates and which had
expanded considerably more rapidly during 1996 than allowed for in previous estimates.

(7) Overall credit growth appears to have remained moderate in recent months. In

the household sector, increases in consumer credit have averaged somewhat under the growth

in nominal income, far below the rates earlier in the economic expansion. According to the

most recent Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey, banks continued to tighten terms and

standards on credit card loans, but fewer of them reported doing so than on previous surveys;

in contrast to previous surveys, few banks tightened on other consumer loans. Business

borrowing has remained rapid, propelled by a shortfall of internal funds relative to capital

expenditures as well as by brisk merger activity. Bond issuance dipped sharply late in the

month in response to volatility in the markets. In contrast, equity offerings have held up in

recent weeks, though buy-backs increased in the wake of equity price declines. Firms have

also relied on bank funding, which remains readily available on attractive terms to most firms.

The loan officer survey indicated that terms such as spreads of loan rates over funding costs

continue to be eased in reaction to continued intense competition from other bank and

nonbank lenders.6 With the federal deficit widening seasonally, the Treasury has resumed

net borrowing in the market, including in the bill sector, but its debt issuance remains modest

seasonally adjusted. Overall domestic nonfinancial sector debt appears to be continuing to

expand at an underlying rate of less than 5 percent, leaving this aggregate in the lower half of

its 3 to 7 percent annual range for the year.

6. The bulk of the responses to the loan officer survey likely reflected conditions before
the sharp declines in U.S. markets in late October.

Short-run Policy Alternatives

(8) The staffs forecast again calls for real GDP growth to remain faster than the

growth of potential for a while, reducing the unemployment rate to almost 4-1/2 percent by mid-

1998--noticeably below the rate thought to be consistent with inflation staying stable. The

staff has scaled back its projection of the underlying acceleration in core prices, owing to

surprisingly placid incoming price readings, continued robust gains in labor productivity, and

the likelihood of a lower trajectory for non-oil import prices as a consequence of the recent

financial disruptions in Asia. Still, with core inflation projected to be on an upward track,

especially abstracting from the technical adjustments to the CPI, the staff forecast assumes

that the FOMC will tighten its policy stance next year. The associated rise in bond yields

will accentuate the downward correction in equity prices foreseen as investors become

disappointed by earnings. As a consequence, real GDP growth in 1999 drops to a pace

slower than that of potential, pushing unemployment by the end of that year a bit above its

current rate.

(9) If the Committee shares the staffs assessment that the U.S. economy has

overshot its sustainable productive potential, it may be disposed to tighten its policy stance, as

in the 25 basis point rise in the funds rate in alternative C. With markets still somewhat

unsettled, the extent of their reactions to a policy tightening is especially difficult to gauge,

and the odds that those reactions, both in the United States and abroad, could be outsized are

probably higher than usual. Under these circumstances, if the Committee were inclined to

tighten, it might consider waiting until it had greater assurance that domestic and foreign

financial markets have quieted further. The Committee would be led to raise rates if it



-9-

judged the threat of an inflationary uptrend to be serious enough to justify a preemptive

policy initiative, even in the absence of any evidence in hand of actual acceleration in prices.

In light of the persistent strength of final demand to date, the likely effects of recent financial

market events on the U.S. inflation outlook could well be seen as too minor to assuage

Committee concerns about intensifying inflationary forces. The Committee may judge that

the impacts of weaker economies and currencies in Asia on U.S. export volume and import

prices will be relatively limited. Also, given the small net size of the stock market decline,

the cost of equity capital may be seen as remaining low enough, when combined with the still

accommodative credit conditions for businesses in securities markets and at financial

intermediaries, to undergird continued heavy investment spending. Similarly, household

financial wealth may be regarded as remaining elevated enough, when considered together

with likely persisting employment gains and still high consumer confidence, to keep

consumption spending on a strong path. A policy tightening--even if delayed until markets

stabilize--likely would induce further sizable downward adjustments to stock prices, and bond

prices as well, and bolster the exchange value of the dollar. However, these market responses

could be viewed as a necessary aspect of the transmission of monetary policy restraint. For

example, in the staff forecast, a decline of around 20 percent in stock prices over the next

year or so is a key element in limiting the rise in inflation.

(10) Alternative B, which would leave the intended federal funds rate at 5-1/2

percent, could be chosen at this meeting either merely as a deferral of a tighter stance until

financial markets have become more resilient, or, more positively, as a justifiable policy

posture, absent some change in the tenor of incoming information about inflation prospects.



- 10-

The continuing string of data suggesting stronger real activity and softer inflation than

expected has provided evidence that, at least in some respects, economic behavior is deviating

from historical patterns. In those circumstances, knowing at what point resource pressures

will induce cost and price acceleration--and hence when preemptive policy actions would

become warranted--is difficult, making a "wait-and-see" posture more attractive. Despite the

recent strength in aggregate demand, the current policy stance still could turn out to be

consistent with sustainable economic expansion and subdued inflation. Indeed, inflation

expectations probably have receded even further of late; certainly that would be consistent

with the narrowing spread between yields on the Treasury's nominal and inflation-protected

securities. By itself, this development should restrain the wage- and price-setting process.

Moreover, the fall in inflation expectations has further raised real short-term interest rates,

which should work to restrain spending over time, other things equal.

(11) Markets are unlikely to react immediately if the Committee again chooses to

maintain its current intended federal funds rate, because participants have incorporated an

unchanged policy stance into market prices. The market does not appear to share the staff

assessment that the economy has already overshot its capacity constraints, and that pressures

on resources are likely to intensify. Thus, data over coming months in line with the

Greenbook projection would seem likely to induce some increase in market yields. In

addition, if the perceived risk of volatility in prices of corporate equity and debt should

diminish somewhat further, it would erode even more the flight-to-quality incentive for

holding Treasuries and augment the upward pressure on yields on Treasury notes and bonds.

Banks and other intermediaries may stop easing the terms and conditions of their lending to



- 11 -

businesses, reflecting some of the heightened concerns about credit quality evident in

securities markets of late. In foreign exchange markets, the weighted-average value of the

dollar against other G-10 currencies probably will hold around its current level, but could

tend to appreciate as U.S. long-term rates edge higher and especially should speculative

pressures on Latin American markets subside.

(12) The staff anticipates that, under alternative B, M2 and M3 will grow at annual

rates of 4-1/2 and 6-1/4 percent, respectively, over the five months from October to March of next

year. Over the fourth and first quarters, quarterly average growth rates for the two aggregates

of 5-1/4 and 7-1/4 percent are anticipated, compared with a Greenbook forecast of 5-1/4 percent on

average for nominal GDP. The standard measure of the opportunity costs of holding

monetary assets is effectively unchanged over the next two quarters as the policy tightening

assumed by the staff starts toward the end of that interval. The updrift in M2 velocity

observed in the last few years should be muted in the period ahead, because some investors

will likely choose the safety of M2 assets over increased exposures in equity markets. The

sizable downtrend in M3 velocity is expected to persist. Bank credit is expected to expand at

around a 6 percent rate over the five months, supported in part by strong business lending to

help finance continued investment in plant and equipment, so M3 growth likely again will be

bolstered relative to that of M2 by still-rapid issuance of large time deposits as well as by

inflows into institution-only money funds. For this year as a whole, M2 is seen as growing at

the 5 percent upper end of its range, while M3 is expected to expand 2 percentage points

faster than the 6 percent upper bound of its range.



- 12-

(13) Over the fourth and first quarters, domestic nonfinancial debt is projected to

grow at a 5 percent average pace, near that of nominal spending. The expansion of federal

debt, however, will be held far below this rate by the modest borrowing needs of the

Treasury. Nonfederal debt growth, by contrast, is expected to pick up to a little more than a

6 percent annual rate over the two quarters, led by business borrowing. Business credit

demands should be boosted by the widening of the financing gap, restrained only minimally

by the edging up of financing costs. The household sector's acquisition of debt should be

well maintained through the first quarter of next year.
