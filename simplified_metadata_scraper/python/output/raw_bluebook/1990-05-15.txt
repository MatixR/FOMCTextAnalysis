The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain. 
 

Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These

MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Recent Developments

(1) Open market operations since the last Committee meeting have

continued to be directed toward maintaining unchanged pressures on reserve

positions, and the federal funds rate has remained in the area of 8-1/4

percent. Federal funds have tended to the soft side of this level since

late April, however, reflecting a more abundant supply of nonborrowed

reserves than expected, as shortfalls in tax receipts have shown through

to the Treasury's account at the Federal Reserve. Adjustment borrowing

has been around $100 million throughout the intermeeting period. Total

adjustment plus seasonal borrowing, which has trended up over the period

with the normal rise in seasonal borrowing, reached $257 million in the

most recently completed maintenance period. In the current period, ad-

justment plus seasonal borrowing is averaging $291 million. In recogni-

tion of rising seasonal credit needs, the borrowing allowance was raised

from $150 million immediately after the March meeting to $200 million in

late April and then to the current level of $300 million.

(2) Responding to shifting sentiment on the strength of the

economy, inflation prospects, and the likelihood of a near-term tightening

of monetary policy, other market interest rates first rose in the inter-

meeting period and then fell sharply. On balance, bond yields have risen

15 to 25 basis points, while short-term rates are down a like amount.

The largest decreases were registered by Treasury bills; despite this



-2-

widening, quality spreads remain low by historical standards. The struc-

ture of short-term rates had suggested strong expectations of a near-term

firming of monetary policy part way through the period, but these expecta-

tions dissipated after release of the April data on employment, retail

sales, and producer prices, and market yields now embody expectations of

an essentially unchanged policy in coming months.

(3) The dollar's weighted average exchange value has declined

about 3-1/2 percent since the last FOMC meeting, with much of the drop

occurring as interest rates in the United States began retracing earlier

increases following the release of April employment data. The dollar was

weak against the mark, which strengthened against most currencies follow-

ing publication of the plan for German monetary unification and prompt

conclusion of an important labor negotiation, both of which appeared to

relieve some concerns about the outlook for inflation. Very late in the

period the dollar dropped sharply against the yen as well. Foreign inter-

est rates showed mixed movements over the intermeeting period. Both

short- and long-term rates in EMS countries other than Germany moved

lower, prompted in some cases by cuts in central bank lending rates as

those countries reacted to the earlier weakness of the mark in the EMS.

The Japanese stock market rebounded substantially from its low in early

April.

The Desk sold $100 million against yen prior to and

immediately following the April G-7 meeting, with half for the System

account.

(4) M2 growth slowed to a 2 percent rate in April, well below

the 6 percent path set for the March-to-June period at the last FOMC meet-

ing. Part of this weakness owed to declines in the wholesale components

of M2: overnight RPs ran off, likely associated with a contraction in

government securities held in commercial banks' trading accounts last

month, and demand deposits declined at a 6-1/2 percent rate. Growth of

the retail components of M2 also slowed, dropping to a 3-1/2 percent rate

from around 6 percent over the first quarter. M2 has been restrained by

the rise in intermediate- and long-term rates since late last year, and by

the unusually slow adjustment of rates on retail deposits.2 The conser-

vative pricing stance at thrifts, which has accompanied a shrinkage of the

industry and supervisory constraints on brokered deposit rates, has tended

to deflect deposit flows toward banks. Banks also have held down deposit

rates, as retail deposit inflows at those lower rates have been more than

sufficient to fund credit growth. With their attractiveness diminished,

small time deposits continued to increase sluggishly in April while non-

competitive tenders at bill and note auctions surged. Slow credit expan-

sion at banks in April, along with an apparently steeper contraction of

the thrift industry, held down overall needs for funds at depository in-

stitutions, and M3 grew at only a 1-1/4 percent rate in April as large CDs

continued to decline.

1. M1 slowed to a 3-1/2 percent rate last month, despite continued strong
expansion in currency and other checkable deposits. Reflecting the con-
tinued strength in currency, the monetary base grew at a 7 percent pace in
April, a bit below the rate of the first quarter.
2. From late last year to the end of April, the 1-year Treasury bill rate

had risen about 3/4 percentage point; by contrast, over the same period, the
rate on 1-year small time deposits had risen only about 12 basis points at
banks and at thrifts had fallen slightly.



-4-

(5) The growth of private domestic nonfinancial debt has moder-

ated somewhat in recent months; the slowing appears to reflect a dropoff

in credit demands, though tightening supply conditions likely have

affected some specific credit categories. Most of the deceleration in

overall credit usage reflected reduced borrowing by the household sector.

Consumer credit expanded sluggishly in the first quarter and consumer

lending at commercial banks weakened in April. The growth of real estate

loans at banks also slowed in April; the higher cost of residential mort-

gage credit and softening real estate markets may be restraining demands,

but survey data suggest that banks are tightening the terms of lending on

many types of nonresidential loans. Reluctance of banks and other lenders

to provide merger-related financing has continued to discourage net equity

retirements. Abstracting from estimated merger financing, business lend-

ing at banks was weak in the first quarter, although it strengthened in

April. Results from a May survey suggest that the weak C&I loan growth

since the turn of the year primarily reflects reduced demand, particularly

from large and middle market firms, but middle market firms and small

businesses also faced tighter credit standards and more stringent loan

terms. However, commercial paper issuance has been strong and businesses

continue to find receptive markets for investment-grade bond issues,

sustaining overall expansion of business credit. Federal debt issuance

has been boosted by RTC-related borrowing. From the fourth quarter to

March, total domestic nonfinancial debt increased at nearly a 7 percent

pace.

Policy Alternatives

(6) Three alternatives--containing the standard differences in

associated federal funds rates--are presented below for consideration by

the Committee. Under alternative B, federal funds would be expected to

continue to trade around 8-1/4 percent, with an initial level of adjust-

ment plus seasonal borrowing of $350 million. The specifications of

alternative A call for federal funds trading around 7-3/4 percent and a

borrowing level of $300 million, while those of alternative C call for

federal funds in the 8-3/4 percent area, which is likely to involve $400

million of borrowing. Judging from the experience of recent years, it is

anticipated that seasonal borrowing will rise about $100 million over the

intermeeting period; the borrowing levels suggested above incorporate a

$50 million technical increase to take account of the expected rise in the

next few weeks, but an additional increase in the borrowing path may be

necessary under all three alternatives.

(7) Interest rates generally would be expected to show little

net change under alternative B. Market expectations now embody federal

funds continuing to trade around 8-1/4 percent, as under this alternative.

Similarly, incoming information on the economy consistent with the green-

book forecast would be roughly in line with the continued economic growth

and moderation in measured inflation--though with little improvement in

longer-term price trends--that market participants now seem to be antici-

pating. Rates on Treasury bills and notes, however, could be subject to

transitory supply pressures if RTC activity accelerates appreciably and

with it Treasury financing needs. A breakthrough in negotiations on the



-7-

budget between the Administration and the Congress in coming weeks would

be likely to spark a rally in capital markets, which after a time might

induce a downward adjustment in the foreign exchange value of the dollar.

Absent such a breakthrough, the dollar likely would remain around recent

levels on foreign exchange markets; with the dollar stable and German

reunification impending, a tightening of monetary policy in Germany and

Japan before the next FOMC meeting appears unlikely.

(8) Projected growth rates for the monetary aggregates from

March to June are given in the table below for all three alternatives.

(The table and charts on the following pages show more detailed data.)

Under alternative B, growth in both M2 and M3 would pick up over May and

June from the sluggish pace of April. This pickup results in part from a

cessation of the runoff of demand deposits and RPs. In addition, the

response of depositors to previous increases in opportunity costs would

begin to wane. Moreover, opportunity costs have already narrowed from

April and, with market interest rates stable, this narrowing could con-

tinue, buoying retail deposit inflows, as banks raise small time deposit

rates, albeit slowly, in adjustment to increases in market rates on bal-

ance this year. To an extent, the strengthening of M2 and M3 under this

alternative rests on a rebound in bank credit growth and associated fund-

ing needs in May and June--given the evidence that reductions in willing-

ness to lend are limited. Again, the behavior of the RTC constitutes a

major uncertainty in the outlook for money growth. To date in the second

quarter, RTC spending still has been fairly modest. We have assumed pro-

gressively more resolution activity over May and June, but well below



-8-

RTC's announced goal of 141 resolutions involving $50 billion of assets

for this quarter. A surge in RTC activity could damp M3 growth as thrift

assets end up on the government's balance sheet. And it could affect M2

as well, if large volumes of retail deposits are transferred to commercial

banks without accompanying loans and investments, reducing bank needs to

raise deposit offering rates. On balance, M2 growth is projected to

strengthen to a 5 percent pace on average in May and June, in line with

average growth over the first four months of the year. M3 growth would

remain quite sluggish as thrifts continued to shrink--through RTC resolu-

tions and through action to meet capital requirements--but would pick up a

little to about a 3-1/2 percent pace from growth of around 1 percent in

March and April.

(9) Even with the projected strengthening in money, growth of

both M2 and M3 over the March-to-June period would be noticeably below

expectations at the time of the last meeting. Moreover, growth of M2

would be appreciably below the 6 to 7 percent rate of expansion of the

previous several quarters, leaving this aggregate only a little above the

midpoint of its annual range at mid-year. As noted, the moderation in

both M2 and M3 has resulted in part from the weakness in credit growth

at banks as well as thrifts. To a considerable extent, this weakness

seems to represent a rechannelling of credit flows involving assets, such

as mortgages and consumer receivables, that are easily securitized and

absorbed by other lenders, without materially raising costs to borrowers.

The lack of serious disruptions from this process can be inferred from

continued narrow yield spreads between mortgages and Treasury securities.

In addition, weaker bank credit growth reflects some tightening of terms

and reduction in availability of loans--including those to small business

and for construction--that are not easily transferred to other lenders.

In the staff forecast, however, the "credit crunch" does not deepen and,

while important in certain locales and for selected uses, does not have a

major effect on aggregate borrowing and spending. In these circumstances,

the slower money growth now forecast for the second quarter would not

signal the approach of underlying weakness in the economy, since it would

be offset by an upward shift in velocity. M2 velocity in the staff fore-

cast is projected to increase at a 2-1/4 percent rate in the second quar-

ter, following a 1-1/2 percent rise in the first quarter.



- 11 -

(10) Consistent with the notion that credit remains generally

available, growth in the debt of private domestic nonfinancial sectors is

expected to continue close to the 6 percent average pace of recent months,

about in line with spending. While the less hospitable attitude of lend-

ers toward LBOs will continue to restrain corporate restructuring activity

and associated credit usage, credit availability difficulties elsewhere in

the business sector are expected to have only relatively modest effects,

and borrowing by nonfinancial businesses should continue around its recent

rate. Credit availability effects likely will continue to be more notice-

able in the construction and development area, and the rise in mortgage

rates that has occurred this year will continue to restrain household

mortgage borrowing as well. Consumer credit growth is expected to remain

subdued as spending on durables is-projected to be sluggish. Considerable

uncertainty surrounds the outlook for Treasury borrowing--both the amount

and timing--owing to RTC financing needs. While Treasury borrowing for

RTC working capital purposes would end up boosting the debt aggregate,

such borrowing would not be expected to put underlying pressure on the

general level of interest rates: federal government liabilities simply

would be replacing those of private intermediaries, which are not included

in the debt aggregate, leaving unaffected the volume of saving available

for investment. Assuming a substantial pickup in RTC-related borrowing in

the second quarter, federal government debt would increase at about an 8

percent pace over the March-to-June period. Total domestic nonfinancial

debt is projected to expand at a 7 percent rate over the three months and



- 12 -

by June would be 7 percent at an annual rate above its fourth-quarter 1989

base, at the midpoint of its 1990 monitoring range.

(11) The easing of reserve conditions under alternative A would

tend to strengthen money growth over May and June to something more in

line with rates incorporated in the Committee's expectations at the last

meeting. Opportunity costs would narrow even more, boosting M2 growth to

nearly a 6 percent rate over May and June, leaving this aggregate notice-

ably above the midpoint of its annual range. M3 growth would firm to a 4

percent annual rate, keeping this aggregate a little above the lower bound

of its range. The easing of policy under alternative A would come as

something of a surprise to most market participants, and money market

rates would decline by the full 50 basis point drop in the federal funds

rate. The dollar would come under downward pressure, and, absent incoming

information pointing to a weaker economy or a distinct improvement in

underlying cost or price trends, the decline in bond rates would be

limited, resulting in a steeper yield curve. If, however, evidence sug-

gested a softening in economic activity, perhaps reflecting more powerful

credit restraint than now seems apparent, the drop in short-term rates

would feed through to bond yields. The decline in market rates would tend

to buoy borrowing and spending by those with market access, helping to

offset the effects of tighter credit availability on spenders dependent on

depository intermediaries.

(12) The tighter reserve conditions under alternative C would be

expected to keep money growth damped. M2 would be at the middle of its

range by June and M3 just above the lower end of its range. Short-term



- 13 -

rates would increase by about the 1/2 percentage point rise in the federal

funds rate, and the dollar would tend to firm. Banks would raise the

prime rate, and could further tighten other credit terms. Bond yields

also would rise, at least initially, in response to the reversal of the

previous trend in Federal Reserve actions. However, in the context of

only moderate growth in the economy, the higher short-term interest rates

and slower money growth would be seen as a policy response to inflation

pressures, implying additional emphasis by the Federal Reserve on its

price stability objective. In this context, the credibility of that

objective could be enhanced, to the benefit of bond prices.

Directive Language

(14) Draft language for the operational paragraph, including the

usual options, is shown below.

OPERATIONAL PARAGRAPH

In the implementation of policy for the immediate

future, the Committee seeks to DECREASE SOMEWHAT/maintain/

INCREASE SOMEWHAT the existing degree of pressure on reserve

positions. Taking account of progress toward price stabil-

ity, the strength of the business expansion, the behavior of

the monetary aggregates, and developments in foreign ex-

change and domestic financial markets, slightly (SOMEWHAT)

greater reserve restraint (WOULD/MIGHT) or slightly (SOME-

WHAT) lesser reserve restraint would (MIGHT) be acceptable

in the intermeeting period. The contemplated reserve condi-

tions are expected to be consistent with growth of M2 and M3

over the period from March through June at annual rates of

about ____ AND ____ [DEL: 6 and 4] percent respectively. The Chairman

may call for Committee consultation if it appears to the

Manager for Domestic Operations that reserve conditions

during the period before the next meeting are likely to be

associated with a federal funds rate persistently outside a

range of ____ TO ____ [DEL: 6 to 10] percent.
