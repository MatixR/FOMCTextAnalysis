through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned 
versions text-searchable.2   Though a stringent quality assurance process was 
employed, some imperfections may remain.

Recent developments

(1) The money supply, both narrowly (M1) and broadly (M2 )

defined, grew more rapidly in March than targeted in the last bluebook,

as the table shows. Growth in the adjusted bank credit proxy, however,

fell somewhat short of its target rate. If these March figures are not

significantly revised, M1 will have grown at about an 8 per cent annual

rate over the first quarter and at around a 5-3/4 per cent annual rate

since September.

(2) Shortly after the last Committee meeting, deposit data

coming available for the first two weeks ending in March suggested that

levels of M1 and M2 were running well above their bluebook target paths.

As a result, annual growth rates for both money supply measures appeared

to be exceeding their bluebook targets by more than the 3 to 4 percentage

point deviation allowable under the directive proviso. In light of this

development, the Desk adjusted the sights of its open market operations

slightly, aiming at a Federal funds rate in a 3-1/2 to 3-3/4 per cent

range. Later in the month, the money supply remained above target levels,

sustained in part by a much sharper drop in U.S. Government deposits at

banks than had been projected at the time of the last meeting. The short-

fall in Government deposits occurred chiefly because the Treasury had to

delay planned new financing until Congress raised the Federal debt ceil-

ing. The greater than anticipated drop in Government deposits also

explains most of the shortfall in the bank credit proxy below target,

although the further run-off of Euro-dollar borrowings by major banks was

appreciably larger than assumed.

(3) Even though the Desk has been aiming over most of the inter-

meeting period at a Federal funds rate in the 3-1/2 to 3-3/4 per cent range,



unforeseen technical factors have continued to push the funds rate to or

above the high end of this range, despite very large System repurchase

agreements with dealers. In the tax date week, ending March 17, the

effective funds rate averaged over 3.90 per cent, and in the week ending

March 31, the average slightly exceeded 4.00 per cent. A succession of

large daily shortfalls in Desk estimates of reserve availability from

float and the Treasury balance intensified the money market tightness in

the tax date week. In the latest week, which included the publication

date for bank statements, normal pressures arising from bank desires to

avoid borrowing on the final day of the quarter were strongly accentuated

by heavy dealer demands for financing, including the need to pay for the

new tax bill noted below. In the week ending March 31, net free reserves

amounted to $163 million, as a number of major banks--uncertain about

their statement date positions--ran cumulative reserve surpluses in

excess of what could be carried over. In the tax date week, net borrowed

reserves averaged about $55 million, while in the statement week ending

March 24 they averaged $270 million. Member bank borrowings averaged

about $290 million over the three week period.

(4) Treasury bill yields, while fluctuating rather widely

since the last meeting of the Committee, show net advances for the period

of as much as 35 basis points. Most recently, the 3-month issue has been

quoted around 3.65 per cent. Other short-term interest rates have shown

less variability than Treasury bill rates, but have also tended to back

up somewhat in response to the changes in bill rates. A key factor in

the recent rise of short-term rates has been the heavy volume of Treasury



cash financing in the bill market. These operations involve a $2 billion

addition to the April tax bill (auctioned March 24 for payment March 30

without tax and loan credit); a $2.2 billion bill strip (auctioned March 31

for payment April 6); and $800 million of new 6-month bills (being

offered $200 million at a time in the four weekly auctions starting

March 22). Moreover, with the Federal funds rate tending to rise over

the period, and with no further Federal Reserve cut in the discount rate,

market participants began to ask whether the System might be moving toward

a somewhat tighter money market stance in view of large short-term

capital outflows from the U.S. and resultant uneasiness in foreign exchange

markets and in light of the recently more rapid growth of the monetary

aggregates. This tended to encourage the modest rise in short-term rates

and was also a factor in the recent hesitation in capital markets and the

partial reversal of long-term rate declines.

annual rates of change in major financial aggregates for selected periods.

Prospective developments

(6) The table on the next page shows three alternative monthly

paths for key monetary aggregates through the second quarter. Money

market conditions now estimated to be consistent with these paths are

noted below, using the annual rates of growth in M1 as an index of the

collection of aggregates.

Federal funds Member Bank Net M1
rate Borrowings Reserves

Alternative A 3-3/4 250-350 +50 to -150 9%

Alternative B 4 -- 4-3/4 400-500 -150 to -300 7%

Alternative C 4-3/4--5-1/2 500-600 -250 to -400 6%

(7) The money market specifications for alternative A include a

Federal funds rate around 3-3/4 per cent, the most recent Desk operating

target. The Federal funds rates assumed to be consistent with the various

monetary aggregate paths are all somewhat higher than specified at the

time of the last FOMC meeting for given second quarter growth rates in

M1 . This is partly because demand for M1 in March was stronger than

anticipated under prevailing money market conditions. The funds rates

have been moved up more for alternatives B and C, since these alternatives

involve a slowing in the M 1 growth rate over the second quarter from the

recent pace and since there is one month less than there was at the time

of the last meeting to affect public demand for cash balances in the

second quarter.

(8) Under all three alternatives, growth rates in M 2 are

expected to slow from the exceptionally rapid first quarter pace. Growth

in time and savings deposits other than large CD's has slowed somewhat

in recent weeks. It is expected to slow further as a result of spreading

downward adjustment by banks in rates offered on time deposits and as the

public's shift from market to deposit assets tends to lose force. Growth

in the bank credit proxy in the second quarter may also be slower than

in the first. With banks already quite liquid and loan demand expected

to be modest, large CD's are expected to grow relatively little over the

quarter, although banks may seek longer-term CD's more actively if

expectations of rising interest rates become prevalent. Liabilities to

foreign branches are assumed to decline more slowly--apart from an abrupt

adjustment related to financing of the recently announced offshore Treasury

issue--as the cost of holding the relatively small amount of such liabil-

ities remaining becomes less burdensome. After the new Treasury certificate

goes on the books, about half of the banks' remaining Euro-dollar base

would be in the form of high-yielding Ex-Im Bank and Treasury securities.

(9) Assuming a Federal funds rate trading around 3-3/4 per

cent growth in M 1 in April--at around 10 per cent--is expected to be

little changed from the March pace. In large part this growth rate

reflects the high level of demand deposits already reached by the end

of March; if there were no change from that level during April, M 1

would average 8 per cent higher than in March. Even at the higher funds

rates specified under alternatives B and C, the slowing in the growth rate



-9-

in April is likely to be modest, with more of an effect later in the

quarter. Weekly paths for the various monetary aggregates are shown

in the table on the next page.

(10) With money market conditions as specified for alterna-

tive A, the 3-month bill rate is likely to be in a 3-1/4--3-3/4 per cent

range between now and the next meeting of the Committee. Reinvestment

demand from the $4-1/4 billion maturing April tax bill, temporary

purchases from the proceeds of a large though diminishing volume of

capital market financing, temporary investment of State and local

tax receipts,and potentially large demands from foreign monetary authorities

may exert downward pressure on bill rates. However, higher Federal funds

rates--such as contemplated under alternatives B and C--would likely

raise bill rates significantly--with the 3-month bill perhaps up to

ranges of 3-3/4--4-1/2 per cent and 4-1/2--5-1/4 per cent, respectively--as

dealers attempt to get out from under sizable bill positions.

(11) The Treasury is expected to announce its mid-May refund-

ing on April 28. Nearly $6 billion of publicly held securities mature.

It is too early to tell whether an advance refunding will be undertaken

and/or whether some new cash will be raised in conjunction with the

refunding. The possibilities of an advance refunding will depend in part

on whether or not money market conditions tighten significantly between

now and then. The Treasury may, however, offer a coupon issue maturing

in more than seven years as a part of the mid-May financing.

(12) Long-term markets are likely to remain sensitive to money

market conditions as indicators of Federal Reserve policy. Thus, attain-

ment of the conditions specified in alternative A would be likely to re-

inforce other trends in capital markets now expected to contribute to

some further decline in long-term rates, as noted in the Greenbook. On

the other hand, if money market conditions are made firmer, as specified

under alternatives B and C, shifts in market expectations about the course

of short-term rates and monetary policy might tend to offset the under-

lying trends. A rise in long-term rates would seem likely if the Federal

funds rate were to trend convincingly above 4 per cent, with the rise in

long rates largest if money market conditions were to tighten as much as

specified under alternative C.



-12-

Possible directive language

(13) Alternative A. This language is proposed for possible

use if the Committee decides to retain the form of the present directive,

involving a primary instruction concerned with money market conditions

and long-term interest rates and a proviso clause relating to the aggre-

gates.

"To implement this policy, System open market

operations until the next meeting of the Committee shall

be conducted with a view to maintaining prevailing money

market conditions while accommodating any downward move-

ments in long-term rates; provided that money market con-

ditions shall be modified if it appears that the monetary

and credit aggregates are deviating significantly from

the growth paths expected, TAKING ACCOUNT OF THE FORTH-

COMING TREASURY FINANCING."

With respect to the proposed reference to the forthcoming Treasury financ-

ing (in this and the other alternatives) the Treasury's announcement is

expected on April 28, as indicated in paragraph (11) above. If the

Committee adopts this alternative, it may wish to consider the money market

conditions noted for alternative A in paragraph (6) as a description of

"prevailing" conditions, and for purposes of the proviso clause, to adopt

the aggregate growth paths discussed earlier in connection with alterna-

tive A as the "expected" paths. The Committee could also specify a slow-

er growth path for purposes of the proviso, the effect of which would be to



-13-

activate the proviso sooner if the staff projections prove to be correct.

Or, if the Committee so desires, it could use a directive with a structure

similar to alternative A but with the specifications for money market con-

ditions and aggregates given above in connection with alternative B or C.

In such a case, the language preceding the proviso clause might be modified

to call for "attaining firmer money market conditions;".

(14) Alternative B. This language is proposed for possible

use if the Committee decides (a) to formulate its primary instruction in

terms of desired growth rates for the aggregates, and (b) to adopt as

targets the growth rates (including a 7 per cent second-quarter rise in

M1) discussed earlier in connection with alternative B, which would be

somewhat more moderate than the rates experienced recently,

"To implement this policy, THE COMMITTEE SEEKS TO

PROMOTE SOMEWHAT MORE MODERATE GROWTH IN MONETARY AND

CREDIT AGGREGATES OVER THE MONTHS AHEAD, WHILE CONTINUING

TO MEET SOME PART OF RESERVE NEEDS THROUGH PURCHASES OF

COUPON ISSUES IN THE INTEREST OF PROMOTING ACCOMMODATIVE

CONDITIONS IN LONG-TERM CREDIT MARKETS. System open

market operations until the next meeting of the Committee

shall be conducted with a view to maintaining [DEL: prevailing

BANK RESERVES AND money market conditions CONSISTENT WITH

THOSE OBJECTIVES, TAKING ACCOUNT OF THE FORTHCOMING

TREASURY FINANCING [DEL: while accommodating any downward move-

ments in long term rates, provided that money market]



-14-

[DEL: conditions shall be modified if it appears that the

monetary and credit aggregates are deviating signifi-

cantly from the growth paths expected]."

Accommodation of declines in long rates is not listed as a specific

Committee objective under this (and the following) alternative because

of the likelihood that such rates would rise if the money market is

firmed to the degree that would appear to be necessary to achieve the

aggregate growth rates specified. However, a reference is suggested to

purchases of coupon issues "in the interest of promoting accommodative

conditions in long-term credit markets" on the assumption that even if

the Committee adopts this alternative it will want to index a concern

with conditions in capital markets.

(15) Alternative . This language is proposed for possible

use if the Committee decides to adopt as targets the growth rates for the

aggregates (including a 6 per cent second quarter rise in M1) discussed

earlier in connection with alternative C.

"To implement this policy, THE COMMITTEE SEEKS TO

PROMOTE MODERATE GROWTH IN MONETARY AND CREDIT AGGREGATES

OVER THE MONTHS AHEAD, WHILE CONTINUING TO MEET SOME PART

OF RESERVE NEEDS THROUGH PURCHASES OF COUPON ISSUES IN

THE INTEREST OF PROMOTING ACCOMMODATIVE CONDITIONS IN

LONG-TERM CREDIT MARKETS. System open market operations

ducted with a view to maintaining [DEL: prevailing] BANK

RESERVES AND money market conditions CONSISTENT WITH

THOSE OBJECTIVES, TAKING ACCOUNT OF THE FORTHCOMING

TREASURY FINANCING {DEL: while accommodating any downward

movements in long term rates, provided that money

market conditions shall be modified if it appears

that the monetary and credit aggregates are deviating

significantly from the growth paths expected]."

This language differs from alternative B only in the use of the term

"moderate" to describe the lower target growth rates for the aggregates.

That term is suggested because the second-quarter growth rates specified

are within the range the Committee recently has considered moderate in

an absolute sense.
