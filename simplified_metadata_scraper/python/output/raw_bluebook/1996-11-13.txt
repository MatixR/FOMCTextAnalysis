Prefatory Note 

 
 

The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain. 
 

Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a redaction process that removed information obtained on a 
confidential basis.  All redacted passages are exempt from disclosure under applicable 
provisions of the Freedom of Information Act.    

 

                                                 
1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked 
and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not 
reliably recognized by the OCR process and were not checked or corrected by staff.

MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Recent Developments

(1) With markets placing better than even odds on a 25 basis

point rise in the federal funds rate at the September 24 FOMC meeting,

the decision to keep the intended federal funds rate at 5-1/4 percent

precipitated interest-rate declines on that day across the term

structure, with the reaction most pronounced at shorter maturities

(chart). Over the balance of the intermeeting period, the incoming

data generally have pointed toward more subdued labor-cost and price

pressures than had been expected by most market participants. Against

this backdrop, the rate structure on federal funds futures contracts

has flattened enough to suggest that the market on average no longer

expects a System tightening over the next few months (chart).

Although further declines at the front end of the yield curve were

limited, intermediate- and long-term interest rates moved down

considerably further. Over the entire intermeeting period, yields on

Treasury bills have slipped off 15 basis points, while those on coupon

securities have fallen some 50 to 55 basis points to their lowest

levels since early March.1 Equity markets have reacted positively to

the drop in interest rates and to generally favorable earnings

reports, with broader indexes rising 5 percent over the intermeeting

period.

1. Federal funds generally traded near the intended level of
5-1/4 percent. Sweep activity intensified during the intermeeting
period, and required operating balances--the sum of required reserve
balances and required clearing balances--dipped as low as $18 billion.
Nevertheless, the federal funds rate was not unusually volatile.

(2) On average in major foreign industrial countries, long-term

interest rates have declined about 40 basis points since the last FOMC

meeting, while short-term rates have moved down 10 basis points. In

both cases, these rate declines were a little less than those in the

United States, and the dollar's weighted average exchange value edged

down slightly on balance over the intermeeting period. However,

bilateral dollar exchange rates showed unusually divergent movements,

in part reflecting specific factors applying to individual foreign

countries. Official interest rates were lowered 100 basis points in

Canada and 75 basis points in Italy, while rates in the United Kingdom

were raised 25 basis points.

The Desk did

not intervene.

(3) Available data suggest that private debt has continued to

expand at a moderate pace in recent months, with somewhat stronger

borrowing by businesses tending to offset a slowing in debt growth of

households. Although their commercial paper has been running off,

nonfinancial firms have borrowed heavily from banks and have tapped

stock and bond markets in volume since the latter part of September.

The stepup in business financing owes in part to unusually strong

merger activity and perhaps to a pickup in inventory investment.

Credit supply conditions for businesses have continued to be

favorable: Risk spreads in capital markets have remained narrow, and



- 3 -

banks have further eased standards and terms on business loans over

the last three months, according to the most recent survey of lending

officers. In the household sector, the recent moderate pace of growth

of residential mortgages likely has continued into the fourth quarter.

Consumer credit growth has been subdued on balance in recent months,

perhaps in part as a result of rising debt burdens and a more

restrictive posture at banks toward consumer lending. The runoff of

debt of states and municipalities has persisted on average over recent

months, as advance-refunded debt has continued to be paid down, while

federal borrowing has been light. Growth of the total debt of

domestic nonfinancial sectors for the year through September was at a

5 percent rate, at the middle of the Committee's annual range.

(4) M2 grew at a 3 percent rate in October, near its September

pace and somewhat slower than foreseen at the time of the last FOMC

meeting. The shortfall was mainly attributable to a surprisingly

large contraction in transaction deposits even after adjusting for new

sweeps into the savings deposit component of M2. 2 Through October, M2

has expanded at a 4 percent rate this year, placing it in the upper

half of its 1996 range. 3 M3, which grew at a 7 percent rate in

2. Total new sweeps were nearly $15 billion last month, a
record, causing reported M1 to contract at an 18 percent rate; sweep-
adjusted M1 dropped at a 1-3/4 percent rate in October. Partly
reflecting a large bank's new sweep program, reported demand deposits
declined at a 27 percent annual rate in October, with the sweep-
adjusted decline at a 14-1/4 percent rate. With currency expanding at
a brisk 8-3/4 percent rate, the reported monetary base was about
unchanged in October; on a sweep-adjusted basis, the monetary base
grew at a 3-3/4 percent rate.

3. Sizable, though slower, inflows into long-term mutual funds,
as well as substantial price appreciation, pushed the estimated growth
rate of M2 plus bond and stock mutual funds to around an 11 percent
rate in October.

September, picked up to a 10 percent pace last month. The

acceleration, which was unforeseen at the time of the September FOMC

meeting, owed mainly to a surge in managed liabilities in that

aggregate, especially large time deposits, that were issued to fund

strong bank credit expansion. The October advance brought M3 growth

so far this year to the 6 percent upper bound of its annual range.

Policy Alternatives

(5) Final sales weakened more in the third quarter than

estimated in the September Greenbook, and inventory accumulation was

greater. In the latest forecast, final demand is expected to rebound

promptly so that inventory imbalances are avoided. The expansion of

economic activity is projected to run in line with that of potential

output, assuming that the current federal funds rate is maintained

through the end of 1998. In light of recent statistical evidence on

compensation, the staff has made a more optimistic assessment of the

outlook for price pressures. Factoring in as well favorable prospects

for food and energy supplies, the forecast for the CPI has been

reduced--even against the backdrop of a lower path for the

unemployment rate. The CPI is now projected to increase less than 3

percent in 1997 and 1998. It remains the staff view, however, that

resource pressures are intense enough to foster an upward tilt to the

underlying trend of wage and price inflation. Indeed, the rise in the

core inflation rate from 2-3/4 percent this year to 3 percent in each

of the next two years would be larger still were it not for technical

changes in the index.

(6) If the Committee views the staff forecast as both likely and

acceptable, it presumably would favor standing pat--alternative B.

Even if the Committee found unacceptable the forecasted upcreep in

core inflation (abstracting from technical CPI adjustments), it might

want to wait for more evidence that such an outcome is in train before

taking action. The overutilization of resources may be seen as

staying modest in any event, and thus policy inaction at this meeting

would not seem to risk allowing inflation to rise so much that jarring



- 7 -

adjustments to employment and output would be required eventually.

(7) With market participants widely expecting policy to remain

on hold for some time, the Committee's selection of alternative B

should elicit little response in financial markets. Assuming that

developments over the intermeeting period play out in accord with the

staff projection, which appears aligned with most market forecasts,

there is no reason to anticipate that interest rates will break out of

their recent range. Similarly, the dollar should trade on foreign

exchange markets around its recent levels.

(8) A policy tightening, such as the 50 basis point firming of

the federal funds rate under alternative C, might be favored should

the Committee wish to move promptly to counter the updrift in

underlying inflation embedded in the staff outlook. Furthermore, the

Committee may be concerned about additional upside risks to the

inflation outlook: For example, recent wage data may be misleading

and the widely reported tightness of labor markets could be reflected

soon in much more sizable increases in labor costs. Or spending might

snap back more forcefully than envisioned by the staff--especially in

light of the recent rallies in bond and stock markets--and intensify

pressures on resource utilization.

(9) The choice of alternative C would come as a surprise to

market participants. Most likely, they would infer that the Committee

sees considerably more risk of greater inflation pressures than is

generally perceived. Interest rates could rise markedly across the

term structure--perhaps almost as much at short-term maturities as the

50 basis point increase in the federal funds rate. Higher real

interest rates would be likely to boost the dollar on foreign exchange



- 8 -

markets. Financial prices could be volatile for a time as market

participants reappraised the economic outlook and the likely path for

monetary policy, and appreciable declines in equity values cannot be

ruled out.

(10) A 50 basis point reduction in the federal funds rate, as

under alternative A, might be favored if the Committee viewed the

recent softness of final sales as likely to persist. Under those

circumstances, inventories may turn out higher than firms desire,

imparting an additional drag on production over the next couple of

quarters. But even if the staff forecast of spending is accepted, the

Committee may view the recent favorable performance of wages and

prices as suggesting that the natural rate of unemployment is still

lower than that implicit in the staff's inflation forecast. If so,

the economy may not have overshot its potential, and price pressures

may be weaker than in the staff forecast.

(11) While some talk has surfaced in the market that the next

policy move might be toward ease, participants do not foresee a

reduction in the intended federal funds rate at this meeting. A 50

basis point reduction in the funds rate, as under alternative A, would

most likely be read as evidence that the Committee has serious

reservations about the prospects for spending. In this event, sizable

reductions in nominal and real market yields would likely be induced

across the term structure. However, the easing might also be taken by

the market as revealing a greater willingness on the part of the

Committee to risk an uptick in inflation as it undertook to test the

upside of potential output. If doubts about the Committee's resolve

to contain inflation were to become prevalent in the market, which



- 9 -

might be especially likely should incoming data indicate buoyant

spending or increased inflation pressures, nominal intermediate- and

longer-term yields could begin to reverse their initial declines. In

any case, the dollar would most likely weaken on foreign exchange

markets.

(12) Under the staff forecast, the debt of domestic nonfinancial

sectors is anticipated to continue to expand at a moderate pace into

early 1997. Consumer credit picks up in coming months in keeping with

the projected near-term rebound in consumer spending, especially on

durable goods. In contrast, mortgage borrowing should slow a bit with

softening housing activity. In the staff projection, the pace of

business borrowing remains brisk, in keeping with somewhat enlarged

external financing needs. With growth of federal government debt

remaining sluggish, total domestic nonfinancial debt is expected to

expand at a 4-3/4 percent pace through next March. This implies

growth for 1996 at around the 5 percent midpoint of its annual range.

(13) In coming months, offering rates on M2 accounts are not

expected to change much under alternative B, maintaining opportunity

costs at around their recent levels. M2 growth over the October-to-

March period is expected to quicken to a 4-1/4 percent rate from the

unexpectedly weak advance in September and October, reflecting the

projected speedup in nominal spending in the staff forecast.4 This

4. The introduction of new retail sweeps is expected to continue
at a rapid pace in coming months. As a result, M1 is anticipated to
decline at a 9 percent rate over the October-to-March period under
alternative B; adjusted for sweeps, M1 would increase at a 3-3/4
percent rate over that span. From October to March, the monetary base
is projected to grow at a 1-1/2 percent annual rate, but abstracting
from sweeps, the growth rate would be 4-1/2 percent.



- 10 -

strengthening in M2 does not show through to M3, as banks lessen their

net issuance of managed liabilities, and the broader aggregate is seen

as expanding at a 6-1/4 percent pace over the next five months. The

implied growth of M2 for 1996 as a whole is 4 percent, in the upper

half of its range, compared with a 4-1/2 percent rate projected in the

September bluebook. The growth of M3 for the year is projected at 6

percent, at the upper bound of its range and slightly higher than the

5-3/4 percent rate forecast for this aggregate in the previous

bluebook.
