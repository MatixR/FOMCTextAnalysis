Prefatory Note 

 
 

The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain. 
 

Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a redaction process that removed information obtained on a 
confidential basis.  All redacted passages are exempt from disclosure under applicable 
provisions of the Freedom of Information Act.    

 

                                                 
1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked 
and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not 
reliably recognized by the OCR process and were not checked or corrected by staff.

Recent developments

(1) M-1 expanded at about a 1½ percent annual rate in January,

well below the lower end of the range of growth targeted by the FOMC for

the December to March period. Currency growth rebounded sharply in January,

but outstanding demand deposits declined slightly. Reflecting the weak

advance of M-1, M-2 increased at only about a 5¼ percent annual rate in

January, also well under the December to March growth rate targeted by the

FOMC. Deposit growth at thrift institutions dropped off a bit in January,

and M-3 increased at only about a 4½ percent annual rate.

(2) As can be seen in the lower panel of the table on the previous

page, M-1A is estimated to have increased at an annual rate of about 4¾

percent in January, considerably more rapidly than old M-1. This difference

is attributable in part to the use of revised seasonal adjustment factors

in the calculation of the new measures,1/ and in part to the exclusion of

deposits due to foreign commercial banks and official institutions from

M-1A (these deposits declined in January).

(3) Seasonally adjusted annual growth rates in the family of

reserve measures that originally appeared consistent with monetary targets

adopted by the FOMC at the January meeting are shown below for the December

to March period and for the month of January, along with actual results for

last month. As may be seen, growth in nonborrowed reserves--while rapid--

was considerably less than targeted. Banks' demand for borrowing turned

out to be much larger than the $1 billion initially assumed following the

January Committee meeting, and borrowing averaged $1.4 billion during the

three statement weeks ending January 30. As a result, the decline in

borrowing from December to January was less than anticipated. Growth in

total reserves and the monetary base was about on target. In late January

and early February, though, total reserves have tended to fall below target,

M-1A by about one percentage point. Impacts of the seasonal revision

despite a higher than anticipated level of excess reserves, reflecting

in part a weakening in required reserves (as a result of deposit weakness

two weeks earlier) and in part misses in projections of market factors

affecting reserves. Comparisons of reserve paths (seasonally unadjusted)

for the four-week interval covering the weeks ending January 16 to February 6

with actual developments are shown in appendices IIA and IIB.

(4) The federal funds rate has drifted downward since the

previous Committee meeting, from a weekly average of 13.94 percent in the

week of January 9 to an average of 13.55 percent in the most recent complete

statement week. On the other hand, with the Treasury continuing to issue

large amounts of bills for cash, Treasury bill rates advanced about ¼ to

percentage point since the last Committee meeting. Private short-term

rates were unchanged to a bit lower in the 3-month area, but rose 20 to 25

basis points in the 6-month area as market expectations of future declines

in interest rates weakened.

(5) In longer-term markets, yields on corporate and Treasury

bonds remained under upward pressure throughout January--after having

increased in December--and are presently about ¾ to 1 percentage point above

levels prevailing at the time of the January FOMC meeting. Inflationary

expectations have apparently intensified in response to international

tensions and the prospects of stronger defense spending. The residential

mortgage market remained quite tight in January, although there are a few

indications of easing from the exceptionally taut conditions in the latter

part of the fourth quarter. For example, reports from some sectors of the

country indicate that thrift institutions have liberalized commitment

policies.



(6) Foreign exchange markets have been quiet since the last

Committee meeting, and the dollar has been generally firm. The weighted-

average exchange value of the dollar rose a bit over 1 percent, reflecting

advances against all major currencies other than sterling and the Canadian

dollar.

. However, U.S. authorities purchased more

than $400 million of DM

and used these funds to repay swap drawings.

rates of change, in percent, for selected monetary and financial flows over

Proposed targets for the year 1980

(8) At the Committee's preliminary discussion in January of

targets for the monetary aggregates for the year 1980 (QIV '79 to QIV '80),

preferences generally appeared to be encompassed by a narrow range of 4½

to 5½ percent growth for M-1A. Against that background, the three alternative

1980 targets shown below for Committee decision at the February meeting are

indexed by M-1A growth rates in ranges centering on 5½ percent (alt. I),

5 percent (alt. II), and 4½ percent (alt. III).1/

Alt. I Alt. II Alt. III Growth in 1979

M-1A 4 to 7 3½ to 6½ 3 to 6 5.5 (6.8)2/

M-1B 4½ to 7½ 4 to 7 3½ to 6½ 8.0

M-2 6½ to 9½ 6 to 9 5½ to 8½ 8.8

M-3 7 to 10 6½ to 9½ 6 to 9 9.5

Bank Credit 6½ to 9½ 6 to 9 5½ to 8½ 12.2

(9) The table on p. 7 shows (in the first line of each panel)

key economic variables from the GNP projection in the green book, along

with expected changes in income velocity of M-1A and in the federal funds

rate, for 1980 and 1981. This projection assumes growth in M-1A at the

5 percent mid-point of the alternative II range. As may be seen, a

modest decline in the federal funds rate is expected in the course of

1980, while the velocity of M-1A is projected to increase by about 2

percent. Such an increase, while below the long-run trend, is still more

rapid than has generally occurred in past periods of declining interest

rates and weakening economic activity. Thus, the basic projection assumes

1/ For comparative purposes, and in final farewell to the old money measures,
the mid-point growth rates for Alt. II are reconciled with prospective
growth in the old definitions for 1980 in appendix III.

the amount of demand deposits estimated to have shifted to ATS and
New York State NOW accounts.

NOTE: The High Defense projection assumes that defense purchases (NIA

$10 billion in 1980 and $20 billion in 1981. The Tax Cut pro-
jection assumes a $10 billion cut in personal taxes in mid-1980;
$10 billion cut in corporate taxes in mid-1980; and a $13 billion
cut in social security taxes at the beginning of 1981, through
rollbacks of scheduled rate and base increases.



a greater than usual desire on the part of the public to economize on cash--

an assumption that seems reasonable in the current environment of strong

inflationary expectations, high nominal interest rates, and growing public

awareness of alternatives to cash.

(10) The table on the preceding page does not show differences

in economic projections resulting from ½ point changes in assumptions about

M-1A growth. These differences would be small--e.g. about ¼ percentage

point in the price level and just a shade more on the unemployment rate

by the end of 1981--and well within our range of projection error. The table

does show, however, impacts of alternative fiscal policies, given growth

in M-A of around 5 percent. These are summarized in the second and third

lines of each panel and will be described in the chart show at the February

meeting.

(11) All of the alternative monetary growth rates for 1980 would

involve a slowing from rates of growth in 1979. In the case of M-1A

measured growth in 1979 was 5 percent, but after adding back the estimated

amount of outstanding demand deposits transferred into ATS and New York

State NOW accounts, growth of M-1A in an economic sense was probably around

6¾ percent last year. Thus, as compared with the latter figure, even the

mid-point of the proposed M-1A range for alternative I (the easiest

alternative proposed) would involve a substantial decline in growth over

the year ahead, though the upper end of that range would be above last

year's growth.

(12) In this context, it should be noted that the proposed

targets assume that further shifts out of existing demand deposits into

ATS accounts and New York State NOW accounts will be negligible. Toward



the end of last year, such shifts appear to have faded to around .2 of a

percentage point (at an annual rate) per month. However, to the extent

that significant shifts do tend to occur this year, any growth rate for M-1A

adopted by the Committee would be less restraining than would otherwise

be the case.1 / The most likely occasion for large-scale shifts out of

existing demand deposits into interest-bearing transactions accounts in

the year ahead would be early enactment of legislation authorizing nation-

wide NOW accounts. In that case, M-1A growth would tend to decline as

demand deposits around the country shifted into NOW accounts, and M-1B growth

would accelerate as savings deposits (not included in M-1B) also shifted into

NOW accounts. In developing alternatives for the Committee, we have not

assumed nationwide NOW accounts.

(13) M-2 targets for 1980 assume the continued rapid expansion

of money market mutual funds and money market certificates and also that

the new 2 -year floating ceiling certificate captures some funds that would

otherwise have been lodged in instruments not included in the aggregate.

M-3 is projected to grow only slightly more rapidly than M-2 in 1980,

mainly because moderating credit demands are expected to hold down issuance

of large time deposits at banks and thrift institutions.

Shorter-run targets

(14) Shown below are three alternative targets for the monetary

aggregates over the December to March period, with suggested continuations

through the second quarter. Also shown are proposed intermeeting federal

funds rate ranges and implied growth rates for the aggregates in the two-

month January to March period that are consistent with the basic three-month

course, be captured in M-1B.



-10-

December to March objective. Alternative B is indexed by growth in M-A

of 4½ percent from December to March, and, for all practical purposes,

can be considered to be equivalent to the 4½ percent M-1 target for that

period adopted at the last meeting. (Similar data for M-3 are shown,

along with more detailed information on all the aggregates, in the tables

on pp. 11 and 12.)

(15) If the Committee chose to continue the policy adopted at

the previous meeting with respect to M-1, it would imply growth in M-1A

from January (as a base) to the end of the quarter of about 4¼ percent

at an annual rate--given the 4¾ percent annual rate of growth of M-1A in

January (which incorporates revised seasonal factors). The staff expects

that a consistent growth in M-1B and M-2 would be 5¼ and 6½ percent,

respectively, over the first quarter as a whole, and 4¾ and 5¾ percent

for the remaining two months of the quarter. This assumes: (a) that

interest-bearing checkable deposits expand at about the pace of the

previous three months; (b) that a substantial outflow of savings deposits

continues at banks and thrift institutions; (c) that growth in small

time deposits speeds up from the pace of recent weeks; and (d) that growth

in money market funds slows from the very rapid rate of January, reverting

to the pace of late last year. The monetary base might be expected to grow

at an annual rate of 5¾ from January to March, but total reserves may show

little change (assuming some decline in excess reserves and relatively

little expansion in member bank deposits).

(16) Given a GNP projection in which the economy is not as weak

as earlier anticipated, alternative B may be accompanied by little change

in the funds rate over the next few weeks. Under such circumstances, there

may be little if any reduction in the demand for borrowing under alternative

B from around the $1¼ billion average level of January. On that assumption,

nonborrowed reserves, like total reserves, would change little from

January to March.

(17) The easing of money and credit demands in the second

quarter, when the economy is projected to weaken more substantially than

in the first, enhances the probability of some decline of interest rates

at that time, particularly if the Committee were to opt for the slight

acceleration in M-1A growth over the March to June period to the 5½ percent

annual rate proposed in alternative B. Such growth would bring M-1A by

June to around the mid-point of a 3½ to 6½ percent target band for 1980.

The charts on the next two pages show actual growth rates in all of the

monetary aggregates through January, and projected growth rates based on

the proposed short-run alternatives, in relation to longer-run targets for

1980. These longer-run targets are taken for these purposes to be those

of longer-run alternative II.1/

(18) Unusually large personal income tax refunds projected

to begin late this winter may pose a special problem for setting monetary

2/
targets over the next few months. In the past, these refunds have often

added temporarily to growth in monetary aggregates, and to the volatility

of transactions balances. Impacts are quite uncertain, however, depending

on how quickly returns are filed and processed and also on the nature of

the public's response to receipt of the funds. If the flow of refunds

turns out as projected, it is possible that growth of M-1A in the months

from February to April could be 1 to 3 percentage points higher, with

offsetting effects in the ensuing three months. But given the uncertainty

of impacts on the aggregates, no special adjustment was made to the money

supply objectives presented in this blue book. However, in framing its

policy and in guiding the Manager, the Committee may wish to recognize that

M-1A and other aggregates might tend to expand more than targeted over the

next few months because of a transitory factor whose impact cannot be

readily quantified in advance.

(19) Alternative A would call for a more rapid increase in money

targets for the current and next quarter, implying a step-up in M-1A growth

from January to March to about a 5½ percent rate, with more rapid expansion

in the second quarter. The monetary base and total reserves over the next

two months might be expected to grow at annual rates of 6 and 1 percent

1/ The longer-run targets are shown in the usual cone shape and also as
channels of constant width equal to the dollar range in the fourth
quarter of 1980.

2/ Such refunds expanded by about $2 billion per year during the previous
four years, but are expected to rise by as much as $12 billion more
in 1980 as compared with the previous year.



-15-

respectively under such a policy. This somewhat greater reserve supply

would tend to be associated with some downward pressure on money market

rates, with the federal funds rate possibly declining to the 13 percent

area over the next few weeks. With an unchanged discount rate, the lower

funds rate might be consistent with member bank borrowing of around

$1 billion. On that assumption nonborrowed reserves would expand at

about a 2 percent annual rate over the last two months of the current

quarter.

(20) The more rapid rate of growth in money of alternative A

would, as shown in the charts following page 13, cause aggregates growth

to rise by March to levels above the mid-point paths of alternative II;

by June the aggregates would be further above mid-point paths. Thus, if

monetary growth over 1980 is to be kept around the mid-point of the

alternative II range, reserve supply would have to be more restrained

in the second half of the year--with the federal funds rate probably rising

at a time when the economy is projected to be weakening even further.

(21) Alternative C contemplates a reduction in money targets

for the current quarter to a 4 percent annual rate, as indexed by M-1A.

This would probably lead to some rise in the funds rate over the next

few weeks unless the economy weakens more than projected. Growth of the

monetary base would probably be at an annual rate of 5 percent, while

total reserves are likely to decline slightly. Initially assuming a level

of borrowing of about $1.5 billion, nonborrowed reserves would decline at

about a 6 percent annual rate over the January to March period. As shown

in the charts, alternative C implies that the money stock will be below

mid-point paths in March and further below them in June. Consequently,



-16-

in order to achieve longer-run targets, policy would have to be more

expansive in the second half of the year, leading to more substantial

downward pressures on short rates at that time than under alternative B.

(22) A rise or fall in short-term rates could prompt some

sympathetic movement in bond yields, but developments in the bond market

are likely to be more influenced by incoming evidence on inflation prospects

and by international events. Even if bond yields were to move somewhat

higher, mortgage rates would be unlikely to rise significantly, given the

already slack demand for residential mortgage loans at current rate levels;

a retracing of recent bond rate increases would reinforce the tendency

apparent in the mortgage market of late toward some easing of lending

terms.

(23) Under any of the alternatives, bank credit growth is likely

to be stronger over the first quarter than the unusually low 3 percent

rate of the final quarter of 1979. Business loan growth appears to

have picked up recently at large banks. And over the first quarter as

a whole, the external needs for funds by businesses are expected to rise,

including the need to finance enlarged tax payments. Thus, banks over

the next few months may become more active in issuing managed liabilities

than they were in the fourth quarter.

(24) Given below are suggested operational paragraphs for

the directive consistent with the form of the directive adopted at

recent meetings. It calls for expansion of reserve aggregates at a pace

consistent with the desired rates of growth in M-1A and M-1B over the first

quarter of 1980, provided that the federal funds rate on a weekly average

basis remains within a specified range. The specifications adopted at

the last meeting are shown in strike-through form.

In the short run, the Committee seeks expansion of reserve

aggregates consistent with growth over the first quarter of 1980 at

an annual rate OF ABOUT ____ [DEL: between 4 and 5] percent for [DEL: M-1] M-1A

and [DEL: on-the-order of 7] ____ percent for [DEL: M-2,] M-1B, provided that in

the period before the next regular meeting the weekly average federal

funds rate remains within a range of [DEL: 11½ to 15½] ____ TO ____ percent.

If it appears during the period before the next meeting

that the constraint on the federal funds rate is inconsistent

with the objective for the expansion of reserves, the Manager for

Domestic Operations is promptly to notify the Chairman who will

then decide whether the situation calls for supplementary instruc-

tions from the Committee.
