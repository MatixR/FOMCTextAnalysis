Prefatory Note 

 
 

The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain. 
 

Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a redaction process that removed information obtained on a 
confidential basis.  All redacted passages are exempt from disclosure under applicable

scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked

MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Recent Developments

(1) Growth of the monetary aggregates picked up substantially in

April. A surge in transactions balances around mid-month, which pushed M1 to

an 18 percent rate of growth, likely was related to a huge volume of tax

payments. Nonwithheld tax payments by individuals processed by the Treasury

in April and early May were nearly $25 billion higher than last year, ap-

parently owing to the unusually sizable realization of capital gains late

last year in advance of less favorable treatment under the new tax law.

Partly reflecting these tax effects, and possibly the redemptions reported

at mutual funds as rates rose in early April, M2 accelerated to around a 6

percent annual rate; M3 growth also rose to nearly 6 percent last month

accompanying a pickup in bank credit expansion. These growth rates were in

line with the Committee's specifications for the March-to-June period of

around 6 percent or less, and left the broad aggregates in April just below

the lower ends of their annual cones. Liquid deposits ran off at the end of

April and in early May as tax payments cleared, reversing much of the previous

bulge in M1, and probably also contributing to the sluggish behavior of M2

that appears in train early this month.

(2) The nontransactions component of M2 remained weak in April and

early May. Some of this may be tax related, reflecting transfers into M1

around mid-April from other accounts in M2 as well as the clearing of tax

checks drawn on MMDAs and money market funds. More generally, widening

opportunity costs as market interest rates have increased likely have been

reducing incentives to hold M2 balances. Growth in the non-M2 portion of

M3 was held down by weakness in institution-only money funds as market

Control Act and other regulatory changes to reserve requirements.

rates rose. However, commercial banks stepped up their issuance of large CDs

in April, as the rise in long-term interest rates shifted some credit demands

from capital markets to banks and churning in securities markets apparently

generated demands for security loans.

(3) Growth of the debt of domestic nonfinancial sectors in April

is estimated at a 9-1/2 percent rate, a little above the reduced pace of the

previous two months. Given its ample cash position, the Treasury continued

to pay down bills in regular weekly auctions last month, but with coupon

offerings maintained, on a seasonally adjusted basis Treasury borrowing

strengthened last month. Meanwhile, the upsurge in interest rates prompted

state and local governments to cancel or defer many refunding issues, which

had accounted for a sizable portion of their debt issuance this year. Business

credit growth in the aggregate probably tapered off somewhat, as borrowing

was postponed with the rise in bond yields, but in the household sector, debt

growth appears to have picked up a little. Bank data suggest that consumer

credit strengthened a bit in April, perhaps partly for tax purposes, and

mortgage debt growth likely was sustained by previous commitments and by

continued takedowns under home equity lines.

(4) In light of downward pressures on the dollar, the provision of

reserves through open market operations was cautious at times through the

period, and during the reserve maintenance period ending May 6 the allowance

for adjustment and seasonal borrowing used to construct the reserve path was

raised from $300 to $400 million. Demands for reserves strengthened in April

reflecting increases in required reserves associated with the steep rise in

transaction accounts near mid-month. In the second half of the month, as

the large volume of tax payments cleared, Treasury balances at Reserve Banks

rose precipitously, absorbing reserves. Unusual uncertainties in the



projections of required reserves and Treasury balances, as well as occasional

shortages of RP collateral, ccmplicated the management of reserves over the

intermeeting period. In these circumstances, the federal funds rate spiked

to well over 7 percent late in April, before dropping back to around 6-3/4

percent. The reserve shortages and higher funds rate prompted a considerable

rise in discount window borrowing to $689 million in the period ended April

22 and $1,111 million in the following period. Thus far in the current

period, borrowing has averaged $490 million.

(5) Most other interest rates also have risen, with long-term

rates climbing particularly steeply. International developments--the

escalation of trade tensions between the United States and Japan and the

downward pressure on the dollar--raised questions about continuing private

demands for dollar assets, the prospects for U.S. inflation, and the

response of monetary policy. Bond markets stabilized for a time following

announcement of the slight firming in policy and reports of reasonably

active foreign participation at the Treasury's mid-quarter auctions. How-

ever, market sentiment remained uneasy, and worsened in response to rising

commodity prices and the sizable increase in the Producer Price Index.

Bond yields generally have risen a little over a percentage point since the

last FOMC meeting. Commitment rates for fixed-rate mortgages have risen

somewhat more--nearly 1-1/2 percentage points-reflecting increased lender

caution in a volatile rate environment. Short-term rates are up three-

eighths to three-quarters of a percentage point-including three one-quarter

percentage point increases in the prime rate.

(6) The dollar was under substantial selling pressure in foreign

exchange markets for most of the intermeeting period amid continuing tensions

in the trade area and persisting doubts as to whether countries would take



-5-

steps to correct underlying domestic and international imbalances. The

dollar has tended to stabilize recently, in part reflecting actions to firm

monetary conditions in the United States and in to ease conditions in

Japan, Germany, and the United Kingdom. The differential between rates on

3-month bank liabilities in the United States and in these three countries

rose by about 120 basis points in favor of the dollar, while the diffe-

rential in longer-term instruments rose by more than 160 basis points.

. The Desk

purchased $1.4 billion against yen and $240 million against marks, split

about equally between the System and the Treasury.



Policy alternatives

(7) Three alternative specifications for money growth from March

to June appear in the table below, along with associated federal funds rate

ranges. (More detailed data, including growth rates implied by each alter-

native from April to June and from the fourth-quarter base of the long-run

ranges through June, are presented in the table and charts on the following

pages.) Under all the alternatives, M2 is expected to grow sluggishly on

average in May and June, reflecting at least in part the reversal of the

tax-related buildup and the effects of the recent increases in market rates,

leaving this aggregate in June noticeably below the lower bound of its long-

run range. M3 expansion through June would be supported by issuance of

managed liabilities needed to finance expected bank credit expansion, and

this measure would be around the lower bound of its annual range in June. M1

growth, though slowing considerably from the tax-induced surge in April, still

would average nearly 10 percent over the first half of the year.

partly reflected market perceptions that the System is, or soon would be,

seeking firmer reserve conditions than those assumed in this alternative.

Under normal circumstances, attainment of the alternative B borrowing path

and its broad perception as the System's operating objective might be as-

sociated with the federal funds rate dropping to appreciably below 6-1/2

percent. However, continuation of concerns about the dollar and infla-

tion and related uncertainties about the stance of monetary policy might

prevent the funds rate from falling below the 6-1/2 percent area. If the

funds rate were to settle around 6-1/2 percent, Treasury bills probably would

trade in a 5-3/4 to 6 percent range. The lower level of the funds rate could

encourage a decline in rates on other private short-term instruments.

(9) The slight drop in money market rates expected under this

alternative may not be accompanied by an improvement in bond yields. Longer-

term markets are likely to remain highly sensitive to the behavior of the

dollar on foreign exchange markets and indications of emerging price pressures

in the United States. While increases in some price measures should moderate

a bit from the elevated rate of earlier months, they are expected to remain

considerably in excess of the pace of last year. Moreover, the staff expects

the dollar to remain under downward pressure with alternative B, in light of

slow progress in the adjustment of nominal external imbalances, arising in

part from weak growth in our major trading partners. Under these conditions,

markets are likely to continue to anticipate a firming in monetary policy

before very long.

(10) Under alternative B, M2 growth is expected to be held down

in May, in part by the unwinding of tax payment effects. Expansion of this

aggregate is projected to rebound in June to a 5-3/4 percent rate--roughly

in line with the pace that might be expected based on interest rate movements



-9-

and projected income growth. But this would still mean rather slow growth

over the second quarter and by June this aggregate would have grown

a full percentage point below its lower bound. Balances depleted by April

tax payments are not likely to be replenished quickly. Rates paid on M2

assets should continue to lag behind recent increases in market rates,

although small time deposit rates in some areas of the country are moving

up quickly. The velocity of M2 implied by the staff's GNP forecast would

rise at a 3 percent annual rate this quarter, compared with a gain less

than half that size in the first quarter. While an increase in velocity

would be expected with the further rise in the average opportunity cost on

M2, under alternative B this increase would be somewhat greater than predicted

by most available models of M2 demand. M2 growth in the second quarter

apparently is being depressed by special factors, perhaps related to a draw-

down of balances accumulated late in 1986 when capital gains were realized,

and to shifting preferences for financing consumer purchases out of liquid

assets rather than with credit.

(11) M3 growth is expected to average around 6 percent in May and

June under alternative B, keeping this aggregate near the lower end of its

long-run range. Expansion of M3 should be sustained by an anticipated pickup

in net issuance of large time deposits and other managed liabilities to

support asset growth at depository institutions. However, M3 growth may be

held down by increased borrowing by banks from their foreign branches, espe-

cially if foreign central banks continue to intervene heavily and place the

proceeds in the Euromarkets. Business borrowing at commercial banks, which

already has accelerated so far this quarter in response to higher costs of

longer-term corporate financing, is expected to continue strong. Some

bounce-back of thrift asset expansion from the depressed first-quarter pace



-10-

is anticipated in the second quarter, in part as higher mortgage rates boost

originations of ARMs, which are much less likely than fixed rate mortgages

to be sold into pools. Expansion of all credit to nonfinancial sectors, in

markets as well as through depositories, is expected to continue at around

a 10 percent rate over May and June, placing the debt aggregate just below

the upper end of its monitoring range.

(12) Owing to the clearing of tax payments in late April and early

May, M1 likely will be flat in May on a monthly average basis before rebound-

ing in June to around an 8 percent annual rate under alternative B. June

growth would represent a moderation from the average pace since the fourth

quarter of last year, in response to the upward movement of market interest

rates. There is some chance that the deceleration could be even more marked,

should depositors be particularly sensitive to widening spreads between rates

on small time deposits and OCDs. Under alternative B, quarterly average growth

for M1, at 7-1/2 percent, still would slightly exceed projected GNP expansion,

implying a decline in M1 velocity for the tenth straight quarter.

(13) Alternative C assumes either a $200 million increase, to

$600 million, in the borrowing allowance used to construct reserve paths,

or a rise in the discount rate of one-half percentage point. With the

market already anticipating some firming of policy, any increase in the

federal funds and other market rates under this alternative might be rela-

tively muted, although a discount rate increase could have a more sizable,

temporary impact on very short-term rates. Federal funds might settle into

a 6-3/4 to 7 percent range, and bill rates might rise to around 6-1/4 percent

or a little higher. Any upward adjustment of Treasury bond yields probably

also would be comparatively small, as this policy action would tend to temper

bearishness about the dollar in exchange markets, especially if it were



-11-

accompanied by further easing moves abroad, and relieve some anxieties about

the outlook for U.S. inflation. Quality spreads could widen some, however,

if the higher rates were seen as raising the odds on a weak economic perform-

ance, or were to intensify concerns about the international debt situation.

An additional increase in the prime rate seems likely under this alternative.

(14) The continued widening of opportunity costs of monetary

assets implied by alternative C would further depress demands for core

deposits, with M2 growth from April to June likely slowing to a 2-1/4 percent

pace. Growth at this rate would leave M2 at the lower end of the parallel

band associated with its longer-run range. The implied expansion--of around

7 percent--in the second half of the year needed to attain the lower end of

the long-run range would seem to require a considerable easing of policy later

in the year. Transactions deposits would be especially affected by an upward

movement of market rates, which would substantially boost opportunity costs

on NOW accounts and constrain demand deposit growth partly because compensat-

ing balance requirements were reduced. M3 growth would be expected to remain

at about its April pace as bank credit growth stayed strong, placing this

aggregate at the lower bound of its long-run range in June.

(15) Alternative A, which assumes a reduction of borrowing at the

discount window to $200 million, would induce the federal funds rate to drop

back over time, probably to below 6 percent. The easing of reserve pressures

would tend to boost M2 growth in June to a 7 percent annual rate, thereby

limiting, though not preventing, a widening by June of the shortfall of M2

relative to the 5-1/2 percent lower bound of its annual range. Lower interest

rates and stronger nominal income growth than in the staff greenbook forecast

would be expected to boost M2 demand in the second half of the year, providing

greater assurance that this aggregate would grow within its range for the



-12-

year. The specified growth of M3 over these two months, at 6-1/4 percent,

would move this aggregate in June to just above the lower bound of its

range. M1 under this policy alternative would be expected to grow at only

a 4-3/4 percent average rate over the last two months of this quarter, but

its June pace of 10 percent would be more suggestive of its underlying momentum

entering the remainder of the year.

(16) Under alternative A, short-term interest rates would retrace

their recent increases. Unless it were accompanied by substantial easing

moves abroad, the exchange value of the dollar would move sharply downward,

heightening inflation concerns. Under these conditions bond yields would be

unlikely to decline much, if at all.



-13-

Directive language

(17) Two variants of draft language for the operational paragraph

are shown below. In both variants, alternative language shown in brackets

at the end of the first sentence would take account of the difference between

the actual reserve pressures in recent weeks and those specified in the

reserve paths. The first variant then follows the format of the March 31

directive which placed particular emphasis on the behavior of the dollar in

foreign exchange markets in guiding any intermeeting reserve adjustments.

The language in the second set of brackets would allow for easing as well as

firming over the intermeeting period should the Committee not want to rule

out this possibility. Given the recent behavior of prices, the Committee

may wish to consider whether to substitute wording like "indications of

inflationary pressures", shown in the third set of brackets, for the

current "progress against inflation."

Variant II returns to a structure more like that used prior to

March 31, placing greater emphasis on monetary growth in guiding possible

intermeeting reserve adjustments. However, this variant also would retain

"developments in foreign exchange markets" as a key factor that could call

for an adjustment in reserve pressures during the intermeeting period.

This approach is expected to be consistent with growth in M2

and M3 over the period from March through June at annual rates

of around [DEL:6] ____ AND ____ percent [DEL: or less], RESPECTIVELY. Growth

in M1 is expected to [DEL: remain] SLOW substantially OVER THE BALANCE

OF THE SECOND QUARTER [DEL: below its pace in 1986]. The Chairman
