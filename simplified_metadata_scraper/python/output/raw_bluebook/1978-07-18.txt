text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain. 
 

Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These

Recent developments

(1) Growth in M-1 slowed to an annual rate of about 6

per cent in June, but appears to be accelerating again in July.

For June-July, M-1 is expected to expand at about a 7½ per cent

annual rate, just above the mid-point of the Committee's range,

and M-2 is projected to increase at about a 9 per cent rate, in the

upper half of its range. Growth in the interest-bearing component

of M-2 in June was bolstered by the rapid expansion of large-denomina-

tion time deposits and the introduction of the new six-month "money

market" certificate. Banks are estimated to have issued $2 billion of

the latter instruments during the month, resulting in a strengthen-

ing of the growth of small-denomination time deposits that about

offset a decline in savings deposits of individuals. At thrift

institutions, growth of the six-month certificate contributed to

a strengthening of total deposit inflows in June. By the end

of the month, an estimated $6 billion of the new certificates

were outstanding at thrifts.

(2) Following the June meeting the Account Management,

in accordance with the Committee's instructions, adopted operating

policies to raise the Federal funds rate by a ¼ of a percentage

point to 7¾ per cent. This target has been maintained in subsequent

weeks as incoming data have suggested that growth in the monetary

aggregates in the June-July period would be well within the Committee's

ranges. The rise in the Federal funds rate contributed to a marked

increase in member bank borrowing at Federal Reserve Banks in late

June. However, the level of borrowing then declined following the

mid-year increase in the discount rate to 7-1/4 per cent. Reflecting

in part the decrease in member bank borrowing and a rise in reserves

required to support Government deposits after the mid-June tax date,

growth in nonborrowed reserves is expected to accelerate to around a

20 per cent annual rate over the June-July period.

(3) Both long- and short-term interest rates generally

have risen 1/8 to 3/8 of a percentage point since the June FOMC

meeting, reflecting for the most part the somewhat tighter monetary

policy stance. During June, demands in credit markets from a number

of nonfinancial sectors appear to have moderated. Public bond

offerings by corporations picked up somewhat and commercial paper

issuance increased sharply, but borrowing by businesses from banks

slowed markedly from the extraordinarily rapid pace in May. In addi-

tion, a fall-off in advance refunding operations led to a decline in



long-term borrowing by State and local governments. As expected,

the Treasury redeemed $6 billion of short-dated cash management

bills in late June, but it has since raised $3.5 billion through

sales of 1-year bills, 2-year notes and 15-year bonds. Conditions

in primary mortgage markets appear to have stabilized somewhat in

recent weeks, perhaps reflecting improved funds availability at

thrift institutions. Both interest rates on commitments to make

new mortgages and the percentage of associations reporting funds

in short supply have changed little since mid-June.

(4) Bank credit growth slowed markedly in June, following

unusually rapid increases in the preceding two months. Not only

was the increase in business loans much smaller than in any previous

month this year, but the increase in other lending also moderated

somewhat. Given the reduced pace of loan growth, banks augmented

portfolios of investment securities and reduced outstanding negotiable

CDs, while only moderately increasing their use of nondeposit funds.

(5) The table on the next page shows percentage annual

rates of change in related monetary and financial flows over various

time periods.

Prospective developments

(6) Alternative longer-run growth ranges for the monetary

aggregates over the QII '78 to QII '79 period are shown below for

Committee consideration. Alternative B continues the ranges for

M-1, M-2, and M-3 adopted by the Committee in April for the QI '78-

QI '79 period, but specifies a somewhat higher range for bank

credit. Alternatives A and C represent, respectively, more and

less expansive policies.

Current
Alt. A Alt. B Alt. C Ranges

M-1 5 to 7½ 4 to 6½ 3 to 5½ 4 to 6½

M-2 7 to 9½ 6½ to 9 6 to 8½ 6½ to 9

M-3 8 to 10½ 7½ to 10 7 to 9½ 7½ to 10

Bank Credit 9 to 12 8½ to 11½ 8 to 11 7½ to 10½

(7) All alternatives assume a shift in the relationship

among the monetary and credit aggregates, as follows: (a) In

view of the strength in demand for M-1 in recent quarters, growth

of M-1 is expected to be near the upper end of the ranges shown--

i.e., 7¼, 6¼, and 5¼ per cent for alternatives A, B, and C,

respectively. (b) However, if the regulation authorizing automatic

transfers from savings to demand deposits becomes effective

November 1, M-1 growth would probably fall into the lower half of

the ranges shown as the public shifts demand balances to savings

accounts. (c) Growth in M-2 and M-3 in any event is expected

to be near the mid-points of the respective ranges. (d) Given



-6-

aggregate credit demands associated with the staff's GNP projection,

growth in bank credit is likely to be near the upper end of the

revised ranges shown for this aggregate.

(8) The demand for M-1 is expected to remain quite strong

over the new QII '78 to QII '79 policy period, when nominal GNP is

projected to rise about 11 per cent. Thus, over the next several

months a further substantial rise in short-term rates appears needed

to restrain M-1 growth even to the high end of the ranges shown.

As indicated in Appendix I, the staff anticipates that the Federal

funds rate would have to rise to the 8¾ to 9¾ per cent range by

fall under alternative B. Interest rates in the fourth quarter would

be about one percentage point lower under alternative A and three-

quarters of a percentage point higher under alternative C.

(9) Even with the assumption that M-1 grows near the

upper end of its ranges, the GNP projection implies relatively

rapid increases in the velocity of M-1. Under alternative B, V-1

is projected to rise by 4½ per cent over the QII '78-QII '79 period,1/

as compared with an increase of 3¼ per cent over the preceding four

quarters. Efforts by the public to economize on cash as interest

rates rise would contribute to an increase in velocity, but--given

the interest rates assumed--the 4 per cent rise that is projected

also presupposes a further modest downward shift in the demand

for money. Such a shift could develop as higher interest rates

1/ Projected velocity changes are shown in Appendix II.



-7-

induce more intensive marketing of earlier innovations and cash

management services. Over recent quarters, however, the demand

for money has been about as strong as would be expected from historical

relationships. If that tendency continues, efforts to constrain

M-1 to the upper end of the ranges presented will require higher

interest rates and/or lower GNP growth than projected.

(10) While growth in M-1 is anticipated to be in the

upper end of its ranges, growth in M-2 and M-3 over the QII '78 to

QII '79 period is expected to be near the mid-points of their

respective ranges. The initial success of both banks and thrifts

with the new six-month certificate suggests that these institutions

may be better able to maintain interest-bearing deposit inflows

than the staff previously assumed. However, as interest rates rise,

depository institutions may become less aggressive in their offerings

of the new certificate. In addition, the projected rise in rates

can be expected to slow growth of interest-bearing deposits subject

to a fixed rate ceiling. As in other recent Bluebooks, the projected

high level of interest rates has led the staff to assume another

increase in deposit rate ceilings this fall;1/ without such an

increase, M-2 growth would be near the low end of its longer-run

range.

(11) In view of the persistent tendency for M-1 to

grow above its longer-run ranges over the past several quarters on

1/ We have assumed a 25 basis point increase in ceiling rates on
all deposits with maturities of four years or more.



-8-

average, a considerable moderation of M-1 growth over the next year

would be required to compensate for such overshoots and bring

M-1 growth to within a 4 to 6¼ per cent range over periods longer

than one year ending in QII '79. As can be seen from the lower

panel of appendix table III-1, the 6¼ per cent M-1 growth contemplated

under alternative B implies annual rates of expansion of about 7 per

cent for periods beginning as far back as the fourth quarter of 1975.

However, constraining M-1 growth over QII '78 to QII '79 to a 5¼

per cent rate, as under alternative C, would produce M-1 growth

close to the 6½ per cent upper end of April longer-run range for

periods beginning with the second quarter of 1977. As shown in the

lower panels of appendix tables III-2 and III-3, under all alternatives

M-2 and M-3 would grow within their current 6½ to 9 and 7½ to 10 per

cent longer-run ranges for periods starting with the fourth quarter of

1976 and ending in QII '79.

(12) If the regulation authorizing automatic transfers

from savings to demand deposits for commercial banks becomes

effective as scheduled on November 1, measured M-1 growth may be

reduced by 1 to 3 percentage points over the QII '78 to QII '79

period.1/ However, there is great uncertainty about such estimates

since we do not know the pricing policies that commercial banks will

decision is likely before October.



-9-

adopt; these policies, of course, will affect the attractiveness

of the service to households and the willingness of individuals

to transfer demand balances to savings accounts. A lower growth of

M-1 resulting solely from such shifts to savings accounts would

have the same policy implications as a higher growth before automatic

transfers. Although M-2 might expand a bit more rapidly with

automatic transfers if the new service attracted savings deposits

from thrift institutions, staff believes such shifts would probably

be relatively modest. In any event, M-3 growth would be virtually

unchanged since that aggregate would be unaffected by shifts of

funds between commercial banks and thrift institutions. Appendix IV

discusses automatic transfers, and their possible affect on the

monetary aggregates, in more detail.

(13) Shorter-term specifications for the monetary

aggregates and the Federal funds rate believed to be generally

consistent with the longer-run alternatives are summarized below

for Committee consideration. Two short-run alternatives are

shown, one calling for no change in the funds rate over the inter-

meeting period--which might be associated with either long-run

alternatives A or B--and the other contemplating a ¼ point rise

in the rate. An easing alternative for the short-run is not presented

since all proposed longer-run ranges involve either stable or

rising rates over the next several months. (More detailed and longer-

term data are shown in the tables on pp. 10 and 11.)

(14) Alternative B contemplates a Federal funds rate

centered on the prevailing 7¾ per cent level between now and the

next FOMC meeting. Growth of M-1 in the July-August period is

expected to be in a 5 to 9 per cent annual rate range under this

alternative, largely in consequence of the step-up in M-1 growth

that appears in train for July. With growth at the mid-point of

that range, the level of M-1 will remain well above that implied

by the upper end of the FOMC's current longer-run range, as indicated

in Chart 1 on the following page. And for the third quarter as a

whole M-1 growth may be around a 7-1/4 to 7-1/2 per cent annual rate--

high relative to the longer-run range but slower than in the second

quarter, mainly reflecting the current deceleration in economic

activity and a lagged response to the appreciable increase in short-

term rates this spring.

(15) Expansion in M-2 under alternative B is likely to be

in a 7 to 11 per cent annual rate range over the July-August period.

Growth at the mid-point of this range would maintain M-2 in the

upper half of its longer-run range, as shown in Chart 2.

-13-

(16) The strength of M-2 relative to M-1 over July-August

reflects the expectation of both continued large inflows from the

new six-month money market certificate and rapid growth in large

denomination time deposits included in M-2. With strong business

loan growth anticipated to resume this summer, it is likely that banks

will return to the negotiable CD market and aggressively offer other

large denomination time deposits. In addition, while savings

deposits can be expected to decline, as they did in June, further

success of commercial banks in marketing the new six-month certificate

is likely to enable them to sustain net inflows of interest-bearing

deposits subject to regulatory ceilings at near recent rates.

(17) Inflows of deposits to thrift institutions this

summer are also likely to be maintained at near the increased June

pace, as these institutions continue aggressively to offer six-month

certificates at rates 25 basis points above what banks can pay.

Savings deposits are expected to contract as depositors shift to

the new instrument, but the ceiling rate advantage at thrifts is

likely to permit these institutions to continue to attract more new

money than commercial banks.

(18) If the Federal funds rate were maintained at the

currently prevailing 7% per cent level, as envisioned under alter-

native B, most other short-term rates would likely show little net

change over the intermeeting period. The recent rise in short-term

rates as a whole has brought them roughly into line with the

prevailing funds rate. Moreover, short-term credit demands are not



-14-

likely to add significantly to market rate pressures in the weeks

immediately ahead. While the short-term credit demands of financial

and nonfinancial businesses and of Federal agencies are likely to be

strong over this period, the Treasury is not expected to add

substantially to the net supply of bills.

(19) Interest rates on longer term securities are also

likely to be little changed under alternative B. Corporate

bond offerings are expected to increase in July, but the forward

calendar for August is seasonally light. In the municipal sector,

new bond issuance is anticipated to fall further over the summer,

as the normal seasonal lull is reinforced by a continued lack of

advance refunding operations, recently discouraged by changes in

IRS regulations and the previous rise in bond yields. Over the

intermeeting period, the Treasury is likely to obtain a sizable

amount of new cash in conjunction with a regular issue of two-year

notes and with its mid-August refunding.- The market is in a good

technical position, however, with security dealers carrying large

net short positions in coupon issues. As bond yields remain little

changed, while thrift deposit flows are sustained at around current

levels, mortgage rates are also likely to stay fairly stable.

I/ The terms of this refunding are to be announced in late July.
The staff expects the Treasury to sell $6 to $6 billion of new
securities in this operation, rolling over $4k billion of
publicly-held debt issues maturing on August 15, and raising
about $14 to $2 billion of new money.



-15-

(20) Alternative C involves an increase in the Federal

funds rate to around the mid-point of a 7% to 8k per cent range by

mid-August. M-l growth would likely be in a 4 to 8 per cent

annual rate range over July-August and M-2 growth in a 6k to 10k

per cent range. Some additional upward pressure on short-term

interest rates in general likely would be associated with such an

upward adjustment in the Federal funds rate. With business loan

demands strong, the prime rate would likely rise further, and banks

and other lenders would be expected to continue to firm non-rate

terms of lending. The current level of borrowing from the Federal

Reserve discount window would probably increase back to the $14

billion area, intensifying pressures for another adjustment in the

discount rate. At the same time, the higher short-term rates would

tend to provide support for the dollar in international exchange

markets.

(21) Only a small part of an increase in money market

rates is likely to be transmitted to the bond market, since the

current level of long-term market yields already anticipates a

further tightening of monetary policy. However, further upward

rate pressures could be expected to occur in mortgage markets, as

rising short-term rates slow thrift deposit flows and increase the

cost of funds to thrift institutions.

(22) Under either alternative, both short- and long-term

interest rates are likely to be under considerable upward



-16-

pressure from late surmer into 1979 if longer-run growth in the monetary

aggregates is to be contained within the proposed ranges, given the

staff's GNP projection. High private credit demands and agency borrow-

ing to support housing, as well as rising interest rates, will be

accompanied by further erosion in liquidity positions and balance sheet

distortions associated with short-term borrowing by banks, thrift insti-

tutions, and businesses. Banks and thrifts can be expected, therefore,

to become less willing lenders, while nonfinancial businesses reassess

their expenditure programs.

Directive language

(23) Given below are suggested operational paragraphs for

the directive. Alternative language consistent with the short-run

specifications discussed in the preceding section is shown for the

Committee's initial Federal funds rate objective. At a later point

in the operational paragraph, alternative language is also provided

that enables the Committee to place main emphasis on monetary aggre-

gates or on money market conditions. The specifications adopted at

the last meeting are shown in strike-through form.

In the short run, the Committee seeks to achieve bank

reserve and money market conditions that are broadly consistent

with the longer-run ranges for monetary aggregates cited

above, while giving due regard to developing conditions in

financial markets more generally. During the period until

the next regular meeting, System open market operations shall

be directed initially at attaining a weekly-average Federal

funds rate

(A) or (B) AT ABOUT the current level.

(C) slightly (OR SOMEWHAT) above the current level.

Subsequently, operations shall be directed at maintinaing the

weekly-average Federal funds rate within the range of 7 -ee-8

TO per cent. In deciding on the specific objective

for the Federal funds rate the Manager shall be guided mainly



-18-

by the relationship between the latest estimates of annual rates

of growth in the June-Javy JULY-AUGUST period of M-l and M-2

and the following ranges of tolerance: 5-te-l9 TO

per cent for M-l and 6-ee-19 TO per cent for M-2.

If, giving approximately equal weight to M-l and M-2, their

rates of growth appear to be

shall be raised or lowered in an orderly fashion within its

range.

If the rates of growth in the aggregates appear to be

above the upper limit or below the lower limit of the indicated

ranges at a time when the objective for the funds rate has

already been moved to the corresponding limit of its range,

the Manager is promptly to notify the Chairman who will then

decide whether the situation calls for supplementary instruc-

tions from the Committee.

APPENDIX IV

Effects of Automatic Transfers from Savings Accounts
on the Rates of Growth of the Monetary Aggregates

If the Federal Reserve-FDIC regulations permitting household

depositors to make automatic transfers from savings to demand accounts

become effective November 1, M-1 growth is likely to be depressed

as depositors shift balances from demand to savings accounts. On the

other hand, M-2 growth may be augmented slightly as savings accounts

at commercial banks become somewhat more attractive relative to

accounts at thrifts. Since funds shifting into bank savings

accounts will be primarily from bank demand deposits and thrift sav-
2/

ings accounts, the effect on M-3 growth should be negligible.

The impact of automatic transfers on the quarterly growth

pattern of the monetary aggregates depends importantly on the pricing

and promotion strategies adopted by banks as they offer this new

service to depositors. If banks choose to offer automatic transfers

with minimal service charges, then the characteristic of such accounts

will resemble those of NOW accounts in their introductory stage, so

that the NOW account experience in New England can be used to infer

1/ FDIC regulations also will permit insured mutual savings banks
(MSBs) with third party payment powers to offer automatic transfer
services. Such MSBs may then be able to attract some additional
transactions balances from commercial banks because they can offer
a 1/4 percentage point greater return on savings accounts. How-
ever, the total number of MSBs offering checking accounts or NOW
accounts is relatively small, and this effect on the aggregates
has been ignored.

2/ It is conceivable that funds could flow into commercial bank
savings accounts from other sources--say, Treasury securities or
money market mutual funds--and therefore boost M-2 and M-3 growth.
However, such flows are likely to be too small to significantly
alter the anticipated growth of these aggregates.



IV-2

reasonable limits on the timing and magnitude of the shift of deposits.

Based on this experience, as much as $1.4 billion per month could be

converted from demand to savings accounts in the first year the automatic

transfer service is offered. High service charges, on the other hand,

could reduce such conversion sharply, perhaps to a rate of $450 million

1/
per month.- In addition, Board staff estimates suggest that shifts

from thrift accounts to commercial bank savings accounts may average

around $250 million per month in the first year.

Based on these rough estimates of the deposit'shifts among

accounts, projected levels and rates of growth of the monetary aggregates

with and without automatic transfers are shown in Table IV-1. It is

apparent that the potential impact on the quarterly rates of growth of

M-1 could be substantial. Over the QII '78 to QII '78 period, M-1

growth may be reduced by around 1 to 3 percentage points, while the

rate of expansion of M-2 is projected to be little changed. However,

it should be emphasized that there is considerable uncertainty surround-

ing the projections of M-E growth during the initial period after

introduction of automatic transfers.

1/ In the four New England states where NOWs were offered by both
commercial banks and thrift beginning in February 1976, an esti-
mated 17 per cent of household demand deposits shifted to NOWs
in the first year, or about 1-1/2 per cent per month. With
automatic transfers, competitive pressures in some areas likely
will be less intense because only banks will be offering this
service in conjunction with checking accounts. In these areas
banks may charge more for such services and discourage some
depositors from utilizing this service.

NOTE: Government security dealer trading positions are on a commitment basis. Trading positions, which exclude Treasury securities financed
by repurchase agreements maturing in 16 days or more, are indicators of dealer holdings available for sale over the near-term. Underwriting
syndicate positions consist of issues still in syndicate, excluding trading positions. The basic reserve deficit is excess reserves less
borrowing at Federal Reserve less net Federal funds purchases. Weekly data are daily averages for statement weeks, except for corporate and
municipal issues in syndicate which are Friday figures.

* Strictly confidential
** Monthly averages for excess reserves and borrowings are weighted averages of statement week figures.

NOTE: Weekly data for columns 1, 2, 3, 6, and 7 are statement week averages of daily data. Weekly data in column 4 are average rates set in the auctions of

6-month bills that will be issued on the Thursday following the end of the statement week. Data in column 5 are 1-day Wednesday quotes. For columns 8 through

11, the weekly date is the mid-point of the calendar week over which data are averaged. Columns 12 and 13 are 1-day quotes for Friday and Thursday, respec-

tively, following the end of the statement week. Column 14 is an average of contract interest rates on commitments for conventional first mortgages with 80

per cent loan-to-value ratios made by a sample of insured savings and loan associations on the Friday following the end of the statement week. Column 15 gives

FNMA auction data for Monday preceding the end of the statement week. Column 16 is a 1-day quote for Monday preceding the end of the statement week. The FNMA
auction yield is the average yield in bi-weekly auction for short-term forward commitments for Government underwritten mortgages. GNMA yields are average net

yields to investors on mortgage-backed securities for immediate delivery, assuming prepayment in 12 years on pools of 30-year FHA/VA mortgages carrying the
coupon rate 50 basis points below the current FHA/VA ceiling.
