Prefatory Note 

 
 

The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain. 
 

Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a redaction process that removed information obtained on a 
confidential basis.  All redacted passages are exempt from disclosure under applicable 
provisions of the Freedom of Information Act.    

 

                                                 
1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked 
and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not 
reliably recognized by the OCR process and were not checked or corrected by staff.

MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Recent developments

(1) Growth in the broader monetary aggregates slowed in August.

However, with expansion at annual rates of around 10-3/4 percent for M2 and

8-1/2 percent for M3 last month, both aggregates grew more rapidly over

July and August than their 7 to 9 percent paths for the June-to-September

period. In August M2 and M3 were close to the upper limits of their respec-

tive longer-run ranges. Data for early September suggest a further slowing

of M2, while M3 seems to be expanding at around its August pace. In contrast

to the broader aggregates, M1 accelerated in August, to a 20-3/4 percent

annual rate, and growth over July and August was at about the advanced pace

recorded over the second quarter. M1 growth appears to have slackened

considerably in the early weeks of September.

(2) The slowing of M2 in August mainly reflected smaller in-

flows into money market funds and less rapid issuance of overnight RPs by

commercial banks--the latter associated with reduced purchases of government

securities. Growth of deposits in M2 remained near the robust pace that

has prevailed throughout the summer, as reductions in average deposit

offering rates have continued to lag declines in market yields, especially

for the most liquid components of M2. Although more institutions have

reduced offering rates on NOW and savings deposits below their former

regulatory ceilings, most still appear to be reluctant to do so. The

overall flow into OCDs, savings deposits, and MMDAs strengthened in August,

while runoffs from small time deposits accelerated. Expansion in other

checkable deposits, at nearly a 40 percent annual rate, was especially

robust, as their opportunity costs reached unprecedented lows. Expansion in

demand deposits also remained brisk in August, and currency growth strengthened.

Commercial banks supplemented strong inflows to core deposits with increased

issuance of managed liabilities. Bank CDs expanded for the first time in

six months, helping to fund sizable acquisitions of tax-exempt securities

and a pickup in loan growth.

(3) The debt of domestic nonfinancial sectors accelerated to

nearly a 14 percent annual rate in August, bringing growth since the fourth

quarter of 1985 to 13 percent, well above the 8 to 11 percent range for

1986. Issuance of tax-exempt debt was especially heavy as state and local

units rushed to market in advance of restrictions included in proposed

tax-reform legislation, which would take effect September 1; subsequently,

tax-exempt borrowing has dropped off sharply. Business borrowing in shorter-

term markets picked up appreciably in August, while corporate bond issuance

remained fairly strong; borrowing in long-term markets has decreased markedly

in September, however, following a back up in bond yields. A robust pace

of equity retirements has continued to boost overall business borrowing.

And household debt appears to be expanding at a strong clip, with net

mortgage formation proceeding rapidly and consumer credit receiving a boost

from the latest round of low-rate automobile finance programs.

(4) Growth of nonborrowed and total reserves in August continued

at annual rates approaching 20 percent, reflecting the strength in trans-

actions deposits. Reserve paths were constructed throughout the intermeet-

ing period assuming $300 million of adjustment plus seasonal borrowing.

Borrowing (after allowance for special situation credit) was close to

this level in the maintenance period ending in the week following the last

Committee meeting. However, such borrowing averaged $519 million in the



-4-

subsequent maintenance period. There was a substantial upward revision

in estimates of required reserves on the final day of that period, but

with the money market suggesting ample reserve availability, the Desk

met only a portion of the projected need; the reserve shortfall did not

show through until late in the day. In the first eight days of the

current period, borrowing has dropped back to around $380 million.

(5) Federal funds generally have traded around or a little

below 5-7/8 percent since the one-half percentage point reduction in the

discount rate that took effect shortly after the August 19 FOMC meeting.

Shorter-term interest rates declined 30 basis points or so following the

discount rate cut, and the prime rate was reduced one-half percentage

point. In bond markets, rates were little changed immediately after the

discount rate action, but subsequently have backed up by as much as 65

basis points. Concerns about inflation apparently began to emerge among

market participants, associated in part with signs that OPEC was succeeding

in restraining output. At the same time, evidence of greater economic

strength and rapid money growth both domestically and abroad, along with

various statements by foreign authorities, seemed to make near-term

monetary easing in the United States and other major industrial countries

unlikely. In recent days, further increases in bond yields have accompanied

an appreciable decline in the foreign exchange value of the dollar, which

raised market concerns about demands for dollar assets. Spurred in part

by the rise in bond yields, major stock price indexes fell 4 to 8 percent

over the intermeeting period.

(6) The dollar fell 1-3/4 percent on balance against major foreign

currencies since the last Committee meeting. The dollar remained steady

after the August discount rate cut and even firmed in early September.



-5-

The significant decline in the past week followed strong statements by

German and Japanese officials ruling out further monetary easing in their

countries as well as statements here and abroad recognizing the potential

for a weaker dollar under these circumstances.

. Precious metals prices continued to

rise over the intermeeting period, bringing their total increases since late

July to 15 to 30 percent. Political developments relating to South Africa

and threatening supply disruptions apparently accounted for a significant

portion of these price rises, but the decline in the dollar and emerging

inflation concerns in the U.S. seem to have contributed as well.



Policy alternatives

(7) The table below presents three alternative specifications

for growth of the monetary aggregates from August to December together with

associated federal funds rate ranges. 1  (More detailed data, including im-

plied growth for each alternative from last year's fourth-quarter base of

the annual ranges to the fourth quarter of this year, and from September to

December, are shown on the table and charts on the following pages.)

M3 8-1/2 8 7-1/2
M1 14 12 10

Associated federal funds
rate range 3 to 7 4 to 8 5 to 9

(8) Under Alternative B, which assumes continuation of the cur-

rent degree of pressure on reserve positions, growth in M2 and M3 expected

over the next four months would leave these aggregates at the 9 percent

upper ends of their annual ranges. With the moderate easing or tightening

of reserve pressures assumed for alternatives A and C, respectively, the

broader aggregates would be expected to move above or below the upper bounds

of their annual ranges, with the gap widening as the year comes to a close.

However, even under these alternatives, given the lateness in the year,

annual growth of the broad aggregates on a fourth-quarter average basis

1. August rather than September is used as the base month for the money
growth specifications because at this point the levels of the monetary
aggregates in September shown in the detailed table are largely projected.

would not be anticipated to diverge greatly from the upper limits of their

long-run annual ranges. M1 growth for the year under all the alternatives

is projected to be not far from the 14-1/2 pace registered so far this year.

(9) Under alternative B, reserve paths would continue to be

constructed assuming $300 million of adjustment plus seasonal borrowing at

the discount window. Federal funds would be expected to continue to trade

around 5-7/8 percent, confirming expectations of no near-term policy change,

and the Treasury bill rate would remain near 5-1/4 percent. Bond yields

should fluctuate around recent higher levels, with financial markets continuing

to be unusually sensitive to developments affecting the economic and policy

outlook. While forthcoming inflation indicators may suggest only a moderate

uptick in price pressures, as in the staff forecast, strength in near-term

data on economic activity, expansion of broad money measures along the upper

bounds of their ranges, and the continued downtrend in the dollar in foreign

exchange markets expected under this alternative would tend to limit the

potential for retracing the recent climb in bond yields.

(10) M2 growth under alternative B is expected to average around

8-1/2 percent at an annual rate over the remainder of the year, appreciably

below its average pace in July and August, but still well in excess of in-

come growth. Based on the staff greenbook forecast, M2 velocity would

decline further--at a 3 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter. With

money market rates staying around current levels under alternative B, in-

flows from market instruments to liquid retail accounts should continue to

be stimulated by their relatively attractive returns, though flows would

tend to be somewhat smaller than in recent months, reflecting the diminishing

impacts of earlier declines in market rates. In addition, opportunity costs

may widen a bit as offering rates adjust down a little more. The expectation



-9-

of a moderate slowing of inflows to retail M2 accounts is based on an

assessment that rates on savings and regular NOW accounts will continue to

be reduced very sluggishly over the balance of the year, despite unusually

low spreads to market rates; should depository institutions show more

willingness to cut offering rates, M2 growth could slow somewhat more.

Growth in M2 also may be restrained by further ebbing in the expansion in

overnight RPs as net purchases of Treasury securities by banks continue to

abate as interest rates stabilize.

(11) M3 also is expected to decelerate from August to December

in the specifications of alternative B--to an 8 percent annual rate. This

slowing would be accounted for entirely by the reduced growth in M2; the

non-M2 component of M3 is projected to continue expanding at the average

pace of recent months. Bank credit growth should slow substantially over

the balance of the year as loan demand remains moderate and acquisitions

of tax-exempt as well as Treasury securities drop off. Thrifts' asset

expansion, meanwhile, is expected to pick up only marginally in coming

months.

(12) M1 growth, though expected to moderate somewhat from its

July-August pace, is still likely to be quite rapid over the rest of the

year under alternative B. With offering rates on NOW accounts adjusting

only slowly, inflows to other checkable deposits would continue to be

boosted by funds shifting from small time deposits as well as from market

instruments, though abating from their recent extraordinary pace. Growth

in demand deposits should taper off, as holdings become more fully adjusted

to the earlier declines in short-term market rates. Based on the staff's

GNP projection, transactions needs are likely to increase in the fourth

quarter at around the third-quarter pace. Reflecting the influence of the



-10-

previous narrowing in opportunity costs of M1 balances, M1 velocity is

expected to contract at a 7 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter,

after a 12 percent decline in the current quarter.

(13) Debt growth also may moderate in coming months, though re-

maining much faster than GNP through the fourth quarter. A marked slowdown

from the elevated August pace already is in process, concentrated in state

and local government borrowing. In addition, once current rate concessions

expire, the decline anticipated in car sales in the fourth quarter is likely

to be associated with reduced consumer installment borrowing. Household

mortgage borrowing should be well maintained over the rest of the year with

continued strong single-family housing activity. Federal credit demands

will remain heavy in coming months, especially in the coupon area, once the

debt ceiling is raised. Nonfinancial business borrowing could pick up with

some widening of the financing gap and possibly an increase in corporate

financial restructuring activity in advance of tax reform. Overall, debt

of domestic nonfinancial sectors is projected to expand at a 12 percent

rate from August through year end, implying growth for the year on a fourth-

quarter average basis of 13 percent, cmpared with the 11 percent upper

bound of the Committee's monitoring range.

(14) Alternative A assumes either a reduction in discount borrow-

ings to a near-frictional level of $150 million or a one-half percentage

point cut in the discount rate with borrowings kept at $300 million. In

either case, the funds rate would gravitate into the 5-1/4 to 5-1/2 percent

area. Short-term market rates would adjust downwards, with the 3-month bill

rate likely moving below 5 percent. While bond yields might come down

initially, they would probably remain above the low points reached in

the spring; indeed, recent experience suggests some risk that long-term



-11-

yields could even back up in the face of a decline in short-term rates if

the easing in policy taken together with signs of strength in the economy

and prices exacerbated fears of inflation. Absent monetary easing abroad,

lower short-term rates would tend to lessen the attractiveness of dollar

assets, and any heightening of inflationary concerns in this environment

could place the foreign exchange value of the dollar under considerable down-

ward pressure.

(15) Under alternative A, growth in M2 and M3 of around 9-1/2

and 8-1/2 percent, respectively, would be anticipated from August through

December. Such growth would leave these aggregates a little above the upper

band of their annual ranges. Offering rates on retail deposits and money

market mutual funds would become even more favorable, at least for a while,

fostering heavy inflows into these instruments. Absent a policy reversal

in coming months, deposit flows are likely to remain strong into early 1987

supported in part by the emergence of somewhat more robust economic activity

than in the staff projection. M1 growth from August to December would be

expected to continue near its rapid pace for the year to date, bringing

growth for the year to 14-3/4 percent.

(16) Alternative C assumes an increase in discount borrowing to

$500 million. Federal funds might return to the 6-1/4 to 6-1/2 percent area.

This tightening of reserve conditions would enhance the odds that M2 and M3

would come in within their ranges for this year. Growth in these aggregates

would be expected to slow to a 7-1/2 percent rate over the rest of the year.

M1 might decelerate significantly, as rates on small time deposits rose

relative to those on NOW accounts. Even so, with the opportunity costs of

holding NOW accounts remaining quite low, growth of M1 over the August-to-



-12-

December period might still average around 10 percent at an annual rate,

resulting in growth for the year of nearly 14 percent.

(17) Since a near-term tightening action is not currently built

into money market rates, 3-month bills could back up to around 5-3/4 percent.

Private short-term rates could rise by more than Treasuries if concerns in-

tensify about the prospects of certain borrowers and lending institutions.

Bond rates also would tend to back up, though the reaction in long-term

markets might tend to be muted to the extent that concerns about inflationary

Orospects were eased. The dollar could tend to strengthen, at least for a

time, on foreign exchange markets.



-13-

Directive language

(18) Draft language for the operational paragraph, with the

usual alternatives, is shown below. The draft follows the format used at

the July and August meetings in specifying numerical growth rates for M2

and M3 but not for Ml. As noted on page 6, August is suggested as the base

for the money growth specifications. With regard to the issue of inter-

meeting adjustments in the degree of reserve pressure, the draft retains

the symmetrical language of the last directive but could be adapted to an

asymmetrical approach (with the appropriate use of "might" and "would") as

in a number of earlier directives.

OPERATIONAL PARAGRAPH

In the implementation of policy for the immediate future, the

Committee seeks to decrease slightly (SOMEWHAT) (Alt. A)/MAINTAIN

(Alt. B)/INCREASE SOMEWHAT (Alt. C) the existing degree of pressure

on reserve positions, [DEL: taking account of the possiblity of a

change in the discount rate.] This action is expected to be consistent

with growth in M2 and M3 over the period from [DEL: June to September]

AUGUST TO DECEMBER at annual rates of about ____ AND ____ [DEL: 7 to 9]

percent, RESPECTIVELY. While growth in M1 is expected to moderate

from the exceptionally large increase during the [DEL: second quarter]

PAST SEVERAL MONTHS, that growth will continue to be judged in the

light of the behavior of M2 and M3 and other factors. Somewhat

greater or lesser reserve restraint might/(WOULD) be acceptable

depending on the behavior of the aggregates, the strength of the

business expansion, developments in foreign exchange markets,

progress against inflation, and conditions in domestic and



-14-

international credit markets. The Chairman may call for Committee

consultation if it appears to the Manager for Domestic Operations

that reserve conditions during the period before the next meeting

are likely to be associated with a federal funds rate persistently

outside a range of ____ TO ____ [DEL: 4 to 8] percent.
