Prefatory Note 

 
 

The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain. 
 

Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a redaction process that removed information obtained on a 
confidential basis.  All redacted passages are exempt from disclosure under applicable 
provisions of the Freedom of Information Act.    

 

                                                 
1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked 
and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not 
reliably recognized by the OCR process and were not checked or corrected by staff.

MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Recent Developments

(1) M1 accelerated in August to a 20-1/2 percent annual rate and,

based on preliminary data, growth appears to have remained rapid in September

at around an 11 percent rate. Expansion from June to September has been

well above the Committee's current 8 to 9 percent short-run path for M1.

From its second-quarter base, M1 has increased at about a 15 percent pace,

leaving it well in excess of its longer-run range. Based on the staff esti-

mate for nominal GNP in the third quarter, it appears that M1 velocity

declined at around an 8-1/2 percent annual rate--the sharpest drop since the

fourth quarter of 1982. The strength in M1 has been widespread by component.

Currency growth has averaged more than 8 percent since June, while demand

deposits have increased at a 7-1/2 percent rate after two months of double-

digit growth in late spring. Other checkable deposits grew most rapidly,

accelerating in August for the fourth consecutive month before slowing

appreciably in September.

(2) Normal lagged responses to declining interest rates explain

some of the strength in M1, but by no means all. The rapid increase of M1

in the third quarter particularly has been well in excess of model predic-

tions--by about 8 to 11 percentage points at an annual rate. The model

misses have been spread across all of the components of M1. While the

public appears to have increased its preference for M1-type assets

relative to income and interest rates, it has been difficult to identify

specific factors--such as heightened uncertainties or more cautious cash

management practices--that would lead to such a large shift in attitudes.

4. Averages through September 25.



(3) Developments within M2 tend to confirm an enlarged demand for

liquidity in recent months. The savings component of M2 continued to expand

unusually rapidly in August and early September, and growth in MMDAs also has

remained robust. At the same time, the runoff in small time deposits that

began at midyear has persisted into September. However, as the month pro-

gressed, there were indications that these trends could be diminishing.

Growth of M2 in the aggregate has been nearer the Committee's range than in

the case of M1. Between June and September, M2 grew at around a 9 percent

annual rate, somewhat above the Committee's short-run target path of 8-1/2

percent; the aggregate currently stands just above the parallel band

associated with its long-run range.

(4) M3 growth averaged more than 7 percent over the June-to-

September period, above its 6-1/2 percent short-run path. M3 was near the

middle of its long-run range in September. Growth picked up in August and

September, as commercial banks stepped up their use of managed liabilities,

including RPs, Eurodollars, and large CDs, in part to fund a runoff in

government deposits. Thrift institutions were net issuers of large time

deposits in September for the first time since late spring.

(5) Growth in domestic nonfinancial sector debt remained generally

brisk in August at about an 11-1/4 percent annual rate; debt expanded at

a 12-3/4 percent annual rate from the fourth quarter through August, above

its 9 to 12 percent annual growth range. Business borrowing was substantial

in August, concentrated in longer-term debt markets, but appears less heavy

in September. Tax-exempt financing has been quite strong, owing in part to

anticipated changes in tax law. The moderating trend in consumer credit

growth may have been interrupted in late August and September by special

financing programs by captive auto finance companies. Treasury debt



issuance has been constrained in late September by the lack of Congressional

action to raise the debt limit; the end-of-quarter financing auctions were

postponed and the size of weekly bill auctions has been cut back.

(6) Total reserves expanded at an 11-1/2 percent annual rate on

average in August and September, with a deceleration in the latter month

reflecting some slowing in M1 growth and a drop in the average level of

excess reserves. Nonborrowed reserves (including extended credit) followed

a similar pattern. The nonborrowed reserve path for the intermeeting period

was initially constructed allowing for $425 million of adjustment plus

seasonal borrowing at the discount window, at the center of the $350 to $500

million range indicated as the Committee's preference at the August meeting.

With M1 diverging further from the FOMC's path, and M2 and M3 also strong

relative to objectives, the allowance was raised to $500 million in early

September. Actual borrowing, after being boosted substantially by a wire

transfer problem in early September, averaged $515 million in the most recent

maintenance period.

(7) The federal funds rate averaged close to 7-7/8 percent in

each week since the August FOMC meeting, little changed from its level prior

to the meeting. The funds rate was expected to average around 8 percent

following the minor adjustment in borrowing in early September. Reserve

pressures did not show through until late on the settlement day of the most

recent reserve period, as money market trading was dominated by market

expectations that underlying restraint on bank reserve positions would be

unchanged. Such attitudes in recent days were perhaps reinforced by inter-

pretations reported in the press of the significance for monetary policy

of the G-5 announcement last weekend that implied concerted action con-

sistent with a decline in the exchange value of the dollar. Treasury bill



-5-

rates have declined about 10 to 35 basis points since the last FOMC meeting,

influenced in part by the large paydown of bills occasioned by debt ceiling

problems. Interest rates on Treasury bonds, meanwhile, have shown little net

changes, while yields on federal agency securities have advanced rather

sharply in the wake of the reports that the Farm Credit System might need

substantial financial assistance. Spreads of Farm Credit securities over

comparable Treasury issues are averaging about 60 to 100 basis points, com-

pared with more normal levels of 5 to 25 basis points.

(8) The weighted average foreign exchange value of the dollar has

declined on balance about 4 percent since the last meeting. In the first

three weeks of the intermeeting period the dollar rose by more than 5 per-

cent in reaction to apparently more favorable data on economic activity,

particularly August employment figures. Subsequent economic indicators

looked less buoyant, however, and the dollar began to retreat. Then, on

September 23, following the G-5 announcement, the dollar dropped more than

4 percent, with somewhat larger declines against the mark and the yen. Over

the next four days, the dollar declined a little further on average, reflect-

ing in particular weakness against the yen.

. The Desk has sold (for Treasury and System account) a

total of $310 million-$214 million against yen and the remainder against

marks.

Policy Alternatives

(9) The table below provides three alternative specifications

for growth of the monetary aggregates from September to December along

with associated federal funds rate ranges. (More detailed data, including

growth implied for each alternative from the base periods for the long-

run ranges to the fourth quarter, are presented in the table and charts

on the following pages.)

M2 7-1/2 6-3/4 6

M3 7 6-1/2 6

Associated federal
funds rate range 5 to 9 6 to 10 7 to 11

(10) Each alternative involves a marked slowing in M1 growth,

but at the same time all would lead to growth over the second half of the

year well above the FOMC's target range for that period. For M1 to reach

the top of its cone by December would require a decline at a one percent

annual rate from September, and a much sharper drop of about 5-1/2 percent

at an annual rate would be necessary to produce a fourth-quarter average

consistent with the upper bound of the Committee's range. Although M1

demand can be expected to abate following its extraordinary surge since

late spring, a decline in outstanding M1 over a three-month period seems

unlikely, given the upward tilt provided by inflows of savings funds into

NOW accounts at around current or even somewhat higher interest rates.

Thus, a very sharp tightening of reserve pressures would appear necessary

to bring M1 within the current longer-run range by year-end. On the other

hand, M2 and M3 are likely to be near or within their respective ranges for

the year without so substantial a tightening.

(11) Alternative B assumes unchanged pressures on reserve positions,

with adjustment plus seasonal borrowing at the discount window between $450

and $550 million and federal funds trading around 8 percent, or a bit higher.

Ml growth would be anticipated to slow to a 6-1/2 percent annual rate from

September to December. Available data for September suggest that some abate-

ment of the pronounced shifting to highly liquid monetary assets, including

transactions deposits, already is in train. This process would be further

encouraged if public expectations of higher interest rates on market instru-

ments and small time deposits, which seemed to contribute in a degree to the

earlier liquification, began to give way in the face of essentially stable

short-term interest rates through year-end. In addition, M1 could be rela-

tively weak in October if its unusual contraction in October 1984 indicated

the emergence of a new seasonal pattern (not yet reflected in seasonal

factors). Even with the slowing of M1 in caning months anticipated by

this alternative, growth on a quarterly average basis, at about 8-3/4

percent for the fourth quarter, implies a further decline in velocity on

the order of 3 percent, given the staff GNP forecast. Such a decrease

would bring the drop for the year to around 5-1/2 percent, about matching

the decline over 1982 that was unprecedented over a four-quarter period

in the postwar years.

(12) Growth of M2 and M3 is also expected to slow in the

September-to-December period under alternative B, owing primarily to the

deceleration of their M1 component. This slowing would bring M2 to the



-9-

upper bound of its annual range by the fourth quarter, implying average

growth in the fall quarter more in line with, though still above, the

projected expansion of nominal GNP. M3 should remain around the middle

of its long-run range. Issuance of managed liabilities is anticipated

to pick up as core deposit growth slows. Banks may more actively offer

such liabilities, however, should they decide to enlarge their securities

portfolios greatly given the unusually heavy fourth-quarter issuance of

Treasury debt and tax-exempt securities.

(13) The debt of domestic nonfinancial sectors is projected

to grow faster over the final three months of the year as Treasury bor-

rowing surges far above the third-quarter pace to finance an enlarged

deficit and to make up for postponements related to debt ceiling problems.

Heavier issuance of debt by the business sector also is expected, re-

flecting a resumption of inventory accumulation and a bit weaker cash

flow, while net equity issuance is assumed to remain deeply negative as

the pace of merger and other financial restructuring activities continues

substantial. Slower growth of consumer credit over the quarter as a

whole, related to a weakening in household spending on durable goods, is

likely to more than offset an edging up of mortgage borrowing. Overall,

growth of domestic nonfinancial debt for the year is projected at more

than 12-1/2 percent, compared with the 12 percent upper bound of the

FOMC's monitoring range. Roughly one percentage point of the growth

reflects unusual merger and financial restructuring activity and another

small amount (perhaps 1/4 percentage point or so) represents acceleration

of tax-exempt borrowing in anticipation of possible tax law changes.



-10-

(14) Both total and nonborrowed reserves are likely to grow at

around a 7 percent annual rate over the final three months of the year,

given reserve pressures assumed under alternative B. With federal funds

trading persistently around 8 percent, other private short-term rates

would rise from current levels. A relatively larger upward adjustment of

bill yields could occur once the debt ceiling is raised and net issuance

of bills is resumed. The 3-month bill rate might increase to the 7-1/4

percent area. Bond yields would also rise, at least temporarily, as the

Treasury, partly because of debt ceiling problems, markets about $47

billion of notes and bonds ($26 billion for new cash) within a short

period in the latter part of October and early November. The firming of

interest rates that appears possible under this alternative could exert

sane upward pressure on the dollar in foreign exchange markets. Under

those conditions, a continued decline in the dollar would depend in part

on the timing and extent of exchange market intervention activity. The

interaction between the dollar and interest rates is, of course, two-way.

As the dollar declines, interest rates could come under further upward

pressure, reflecting market concerns that more attractive returns would

be required on U.S. securities at a time when external financing needs

remained large and foreign investors may come to expect further exchange

losses.

(15) Alternative A assumes a reduction of adjustment plus sea-

sonal borrowings to a $250 to $350 million range, or a cut in the discount

rate. The federal funds rate would drop to around 7-1/2 percent. The

3-month Treasury bill rate would probably move down to the 6-1/2 to 6-3/4

percent range, around the low reached briefly in mid-June. Private short-

term rates would also decline. Quality spreads, which have tended to



-11-

widen in recent months, would probably narrow somewhat as debt servicing

burdens are lessened by lower market rates and in reflection of more

favorable odds of a strengthening in real economic growth. Market edginess

about Farm Credit System and FHLB securities is likely to persist, however,

until resolution of the problems of these agencies seem more clearly in

prospect. The international value of the dollar could be expected to move

lower, perhaps substantially given the context of the recent G-5 announce-

ment and intervention policy. In that case bond yields might not decline

in sympathy with short-term rates, partly for reasons noted in paragraph

(14) but also partly because of possible concerns about inflationary impli-

cations of a rapid drop in the dollar occurring in tandem with an easing of

money markets and relatively rapid M1 growth.

(16) An easing of reserve pressures would be expected to keep M1

farther above its upper bound than under alternative B and increase the

likelihood that M2 would remain slightly above the upper end of its range

through December. The fall in market rates under alternative A could retard

a movement by the public away from highly liquid monetary assets. Deposits

subject to interest prohibitions or ceilings would become relatively more

attractive, while because of adjustment lags on offering rates, spreads for

super NOWs, MMDAs, and money funds relative to market instruments would

temporarily improve. In contrast, M3 would very likely stay well within its

annual range, moving only slightly more above its midpoint by December, as

reduced reliance by depository institutions on issuance of managed liabilities

partly offsets the greater influx of core deposits.

(17) Alternative C assumes some tightening of reserve conditions

consistent with a marked slowing of M1 growth over the next three months

to around a 5-1/2 percent annual rate and with enough moderation of M2 growth



-12-

possibly to move just within the target range for the year. Borrowing is

assumed to average $650 to $750 million, with federal funds moving up to

around 8-1/2 percent. Such a firming of policy would tend to surprise

markets. The 3-month bill rate might rise to around 7-3/4 percent, and

bond yields would also show a substantial increase, particularly during

the Treasury financing periods. Private interest rates may rise somewhat

more than comparable Treasury yields because of market concerns about the

health of certain sectors and financial institutions. Some upward pressure

on the exchange value of the dollar may also be expected, partly as the

efficacy of intervention operations in that context is brought into

question. However, more favorable investor attitudes toward the dollar

would be tempered if expectations about U.S. economic activity worsened

in the wake of higher interest rates.



-13-

Directive language

(18) Proposed language is shown below not only for the

operational paragraph of the directive but also for a paragraph dealing

with the long-run ranges for the monetary aggregates for 1985, should

the Committee wish to reconsider them at this time. Such a re-evaluation

may be needed in particular because of developments affecting M1. The

proposed paragraph on the long-run ranges, shown immediately below, could

be placed in the directive just before the operational paragraph.

PROPOSED ADDITIONAL PARAGRAPH ON 1985 RANGES

At its October meeting the Committee reviewed the long-run

ranges for the monetary aggregates for 1985, particularly the range

for M1 established in July. Taking account of the further sharp drop

in M1 velocity in the third quarter, and evidence of a shift in pre-

ferences by the public toward highly liquid assets, the Committee

agreed that growth of M1 above the 3 to 8 percent range covering

the period from the second quarter to the fourth quarter of 1985

would be appropriate [acceptable]. The Committee reaffirmed its

earlier views with respect to the other aggregates.

(19) With regard to the operational paragraph, two variants

are presented. The first closely follows the format of the previous

directive, and includes suggested deletions from the current directive

and proposed additions indicated in the usual manner. A proposed option

in this variant (shown in brackets) would explicitly indicate accepta-

bility of a shortfall in the rate of M1 growth from expectations.

The second variant is presented for consideration should the

Committee wish to restructure the directive to reflect the more coordinate

treatment of money and the other financial and economic variables in the



-14-

inplementation of policy that has characterized recent Committee practice.

The word "possibly" shown in the bracketed section is intended to provide

an option for asymmetric intermeeting reserve adjustments--an option

that has been indicated in past directives by the use of "might" or

"would" in the sentences pertaining to unexpected growth in the aggre-

gates that have been superseded by the proposed wording in variant II.

The last sentence of the variant has been adjusted to conform with

the more coordinate treatment of the aggregates and other variables.

OPERATIONAL PARAGRAPH

Variant I

In the implementation of policy for the immediate future, the

Committee seeks to DECREASE SOMEWHAT (Alt. A)/ maintain (Alt. B)/

INCREASE SOMEWHAT (Alt. C) the EXISTING degree of pressure on

reserve positions [DEL: sought in recent weeks]. This action is expected

to be consistent with growth in M2 and M3 at annual rates of

around [DEL: 8-1/2 and 6-1/2] ____ AND ____ percent, respectively, during

the period from [DEL: June to] September TO DECEMBER. M1 growth is

expected to slow from its [DEL: recent] THIRD-QUARTER pace, TO AN ANNUAL

RATE OF AROUND ____ PERCENT [DEL: but given the rapid growth in

recent weeks, expansion over the June to] September TO DECEMBER

period; [EVEN SLOWER GROWTH OVER THE NEXT THREE MONTHS WOULD BE

APPROPRIATE IN THE CONTEXT OF SATISFACTORY ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE

AND GIVEN RECENT VERY RAPID GROWTH IN M1] [DEL: may be at an 8 to 9

percent annual rate.] Somewhat greater restraint would be

acceptable in the event of substantially higher growth in the

monetary aggregates. Somewhat lesser restraint would be

acceptable in the event of substantially slower growth. In



-15-

either case such a change would be considered in the context

of appraisals of the strength of the business expansion,

developments in foreign exchange markets, progress against

inflation, and conditions in domestic and international credit

markets. The Chairman may call for Committee consultation if

if appears to the Manager for Domestic Operations that pursuit

of the monetary objectives and related reserve paths during

the period before the next meeting is likely to be associated

with a federal funds rate persistently outside a range of

[DEL: 6-to-10] ____ TO ____ percent.

Variant II

In the implementation of policy for the immediate future, the

Ccmmittee seeks to decrease somewhat/ maintain/ increase somewhat

the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions. This action

is expected to be consistent with growth in M2 and M3 over the

period from September to December at annual rates of ____ and ____

percent, respectively. A marked slowing of M1 growth over the

period to a ____ percent annual rate is also anticipated. Some-

what greater or lesser reserve restraint [somewhat greater or

possibly somewhat lesser/ somewhat lesser or possibly somewhat

greater] would be acceptable depending on behavior of the aggre-

gates, appraisals of the strength of the business expansion, develop-

ments in foreign exchange markets, progress against inflation, and

conditions in domestic and international credit markets. The Chair-

man may call for Committee consultation if it appears to the Manager

for Domestic Operations that reserve conditions during the period

before the next meeting are likely to be associated with a federal

funds rate persistently outside a range of ____ to ____ percent.
