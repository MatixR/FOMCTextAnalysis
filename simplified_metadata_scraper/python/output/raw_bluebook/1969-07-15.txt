Prefatory Note 
 
 
The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version available 
based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the Board 
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was created 
through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned 
versions text-searchable.2   Though a stringent quality assurance process was 
employed, some imperfections may remain. 
 
Please note that some material may have been redacted from this document if that 
material was received on a confidential basis.  Redacted material is indicated by 
occasional gaps in the text or by gray boxes around non-text content.  All redacted

1  In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic 
format.  All scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced 
tilting) and lightly cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other 
blemishes caused after initial printing). 
 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optical character recognition computer program (OCR) 
first created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, 
staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.  Please note that the numbers and text in charts and 
tables were not reliably recognized by the OCR process and were not checked or corrected by staff.

MONEY MARKET AND RESERVE RELATIONSHIPS

Recent Developments

(1) Short-term market interest rates rose further on balance

in the latter part of June and early July, as the squeeze on bank

liquidity continued, as sizable Government and corporate demands on

short-term credit markets loomed, and as final Congressional action on

the surtax extension was delayed. Long-term corporate and municipal yields

edged temporarily lower in the latter half of June as some investor interest

in corporates developed and as the volume of tax-exempt issues slackened.

But the yield declines in the corporate market were erased in large part

in early July, reflecting the large corporate issue calendar in coming

weeks. In general upward rate pressure was more pronounced in short-term

than in long-term markets, possibly indicating some abatement in expecta-

tions of further sizable future interest rate increases. In this connection

it might be noted that stock prices have dropped considerably further in

recent days. And a vigorous rally developed in U.S. Government bond

markets just before the week-end.

(2) With dealers reluctant to maintain more than minimal

positions, Treasury bill rates fluctuated widely in response to seasonal

bill demands and to prospects for increased supplies of bills and Agency

issues. The Treasury auctioned $3-1/2 billion of tax bills on July 9

and 11. And the Federal Home Loan Bank Board announced that on July 15

it would offer $900 million of new issues to raise $500 million of new

cash. The 3-month Treasury bill rate fluctuated in a range of 6.07



-2-

to 7.04 per cent since the last Committee meeting, and was most recently

bid at around 6.90 per cent, 40 basis points above its level at the time

of the meeting. With respect to private short-term interest rates, yields

on 4 - 6 month commercial paper rose by about 25 basis points over the

period to 8-3/4 per cent, or a cost of 8-7/8 per cent to the issuer.

(3) Although the wide range of variation in day-to-day money

rates in recent weeks makes generalization difficult, it would appear

that conditions were little changed from those prevailing in late May

and the first three weeks of June. Federal funds traded mostly in an

8-1/2 -- 9-1/4 per cent range over the past three statement weeks, a

range of fluctuation similar to that of the weeks just preceding. And

for all member banks, average borrowings from the Federal Reserve were

$1.3 billion, also little changed from the preceding few weeks. Net

borrowed reserves fluctuated in a $1 --$1.2 billion range.

(4) Total member bank deposits declined at about a 13 per

cent annual rate on average in June. Private demand deposits, and the

money supply, were weaker than expected earlier, in part reflecting

the absence of any growth in business loans over the month. Total time

and savings deposits are estimated to have declined on average at a

5-1/2 per cent annual rate, paced by a further $1-3/4 billion drop in

CD's. But banks did increase their Euro-dollar borrowings sharply over

the month, and the bank credit proxy adjusted to include such borrowings

declined on average at a 3.2 per cent annual rate, in line with staff

expectations. Weekly reports on other nondeposit sources of funds

indicate a rise of about $925 million from the last Wednesday of May



-3-

to the last Wednesday of June. In the absence of such data for the earlier

weeks in May, it obviously is impossible to calculate the rise in terms

equivalent to the proxy series. However, it probably would not be

unreasonable to guess that the average June level exceeded an average

May level by an amount equivalent to about 3 - 4 percentage points in

the proxy series.

and reserve aggregates for the last half of 1968 and the first two

Prospective Developments

(6) Maintenance of prevailing money market conditions would

appear to encompass a Federal funds rate averaging around 8-3/4 -- 9 per

cent, member bank borrowings in a $1 -- $1-1/2 billion range, and net

borrowed reserves of around $1 billion or a little more. The 3-month

bill rate is likely to continue to gyrate--but in a higher 6-3/4 -- 7-1/2

per cent range. The cost of carrying bills may tend to maintain the rate

generally above 7 per cent, given slack seasonal demands and a rising

supply of bills and competing instruments. Expectations, as they in-

fluence dealer willingness to take positions, will be an important

factor affecting bill rate movements, with current very low positions

providing scope for dealers to accumulate bills. Long-term rates, too,

will be strongly influenced by expectations; while near-term demands on

the capital market appear relatively strong, their upward impact on

interest rates could be moderated, and perhaps reversed, by a bearish

stock market and economic outlook or by hopeful peace developments.

(7) On balance, the System will probably absorb reserves

during the last half of July and provide reserves in the first half of

August. The reserve projections do not include allowance for any reserves

that may be required if the regulation eliminating from cash items amounts

generated by Euro-dollar transactions is implemented. Presumably, these

reserves would be supplied through additional open market operations

unless the intention in issuing the regulation were to tighten domestic

monetary conditions further. But individual bank adjustments might still

result in some temporary money market churning.



-5-

(8) With the 3-month bill rate so high, there is little

prospect for any let-up in CD attrition over the next few eeks. It is

now expected that outstanding CD's in July will decline by about

$1-1/2 -- $1-3/4 billion, which, after allowing for seasonals, would

be a larger run-off than in June. With respect to other time and

savings deposits, banks (as well as thrift institutions) apparently

experienced substantial net outflows around the interest-crediting period.

And while these outflows should abate after the first several days of

July, at current market yield levels no sizable inflow of other time

and savings deposits is expected through mid-August. Thus, total time

and savings deposits in July are expected to decline more rapidly then

in June--in a 12 - 15 per cent, annual rate, range.

(9) The money supply in July may rise in a 3 - 6 per cent,

annual rate, range. U.S. Government deposits are projected to decline

sharply, but private demand deposits are not expected to show a

commensurate rise, as corporations and others quickly economize on cash

balances, given the tight position of banks and of corporations themselves.

(10) With banks stiffening loan terms and lending standards,

and also unable to provide any significant support to securities markets,

outstanding bank credit is expected to drop, on average, in July. Total

reserves and member bank deposits are likely to decline sharply--in a

12 - 15 per cent, annual rate, range for the latter--but in order to

accommodate some domestic customers banks will probably rely on the

Euro-dollar market, even given the marginal reserve requirement proposal,



-6-

and other nondeposit sources. Assuming some further growth in Euro-

dollars from current advanced levels, the bank credit proxy adjusted to

include Euro-dollars is expected to decline in a 5 - 8 per cent, annual

rate, range. There is little reason to believe that nondeposit sources

of funds will rise less rapidly than in June, given the continuing

pressure on bank deposits; on the other hand, the incoming data are

not suggestive of an accelerating trend.

(11) In August, total member bank deposits may decline only

slightly further. Pressure may be eased by a little pick-up in consumer-

type time deposits and by a noticeably smaller amount of maturing CD's.

Credit demands on banks in August may also be affected by dealer and bank

support of the Treasury mid-August refunding. This refunding will be

announced in late July, and will involve at least $3.2 billion of

publicly-held issues. In addition, the Treasury is expected to raise

$1-1/2 billion of new cash in late August.

Explanation of Projections in Table 6

1. Changes in Federal Reserve credit indicate reserves needed to offset projected changes in
required reserves and factors affecting the supply of reserves.

2. Projected changes in currency outside banks reflect seasonal movements plus an allowance for
growth of about $50 million per week.

3. Projected effects of Treasury operations, included in "technical factors," reflect scheduled
and assumed calls in current two weeks and maintenance of Treasury balances with Federal Reserve
at $1.0 billion, thereafter.

4. Projected changes in required reserves assume the existing net reserve position of banks and
the structure of interest rates in the market, as well as the current economic outlook. On
the basis of these assumptions, projections reflect expected movements in bank credit and
money in the period ahead, including the effects of such elements as the public's loan demand,
repayments of previous loans, banks' investment preferences and willingness to supply loans,
banks' desires and abilities to obtain time and savings deposits, and the Government's financing
needs. The projections thus encompass normal seasonal developments, temporary bursts of
loans demand and expected associated repayments not currently reflected by the seasonals, and
whatever cyclical and growth demands for money and credit are expected in the projection period.
Assumed Treasury financing operations include: $+3.5 billion, July 18; $-0.7 billion, August 1.
