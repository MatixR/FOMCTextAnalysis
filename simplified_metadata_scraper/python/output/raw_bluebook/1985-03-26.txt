Prefatory Note 

 
 

The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain. 
 

Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a redaction process that removed information obtained on a 
confidential basis.  All redacted passages are exempt from disclosure under applicable 
provisions of the Freedom of Information Act.    

 

                                                 
1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked 
and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not 
reliably recognized by the OCR process and were not checked or corrected by staff.

MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Recent Developments

(1) M1 expanded during January and February at an 11-1/2 percent

average annual rate, but partial data suggest that growth in that aggregate

is moderating in March to about a 3 to 4 percent pace. Growth of M1 over the

December-to-March period is currently estimated at around 9 percent, com-

pared with the 8 percent rate specified by the FOMC. All components of M1

contributed to strength in January and February. Demand deposits were parti-

cularly robust in February, but such deposits began to contract in early

March. Inflows to Super NOW accounts have slowed following a pick-up in

January when their minimum balance requirement was reduced; M1 as a whole

does not appear to have been affected by this change.

(2) As with M1, M2 and M3 are apparently decelerating markedly in

March. For the three months, expansion of these two aggregates is estimated

at 9-1/2 and 7-1/2 percent, respectively, compared with the 10 to 11 percent

rates of growth set by the Committee. Over the course of the quarter,

interest rate relationships became less favorable for retail deposits and

money market funds. In addition, there was a considerable weakening in large

CDs at thrifts in February and early March.

(3) The debt of domestic nonfinancial sectors is estimated to

have expanded at about a 12 percent annual rate on average during the first

quarter, based on partial data. About 1-1/2 percentage points reflects

substitution of debt for equity in mergers and corporate restructuring,

assuming that the debt for equity swap of Phillips takes place by the end of

March. Federal sector debt has continued to expand rapidly this quarter,

Note: Monthly reserve measures, including excess reserves and borrowing, are
calculated by prorating averages for two-week reserve maintenance periods that
overlap months.

1. Based on available data through March 18; the M1 estimate assumes increases
in the March 25 and April 1 weeks.

2. Growth rates of reserve measures are adjusted to remove the effects of
discontinuities resulting from phased changes in reserve ratios under the
Monetary Control Act.

3. Includes "other extended credit" from the Federal Reserve.

although at a pace somewhat below that of the fourth quarter. Bond offerings

by nonfinancial corporations in January and February were held substantially

below the pace of the fourth quarter, while business borrowing from banks and

in the commercial paper market picked up last month after showing little

growth in January; business loans at large banks remained strong in early

March. Expansion of household sector debt is estimated to have slowed

slightly in the first two months of the year.

(4) Reflecting the rapid growth of transactions deposits, total

reserves are estimated to have expanded at a 17-1/2 percent annual rate

from December to March, though growth decelerated month by month over the

period. With borrowing at the discount window little changed, nonborrowed

reserves increased at about the same pace. The nonborrowed reserves path for

the intermeeting period was constructed on the assumption of $350 million of

borrowing; as M1 strengthened relative to path, the Desk conducted its

operations with a view to tilting the odds somewhat toward borrowing

coming in above rather than below this level. Nonborrowed reserves generally

have been close to target, but with the demand for excess reserves unex-

pectedly high, borrowed reserves have averaged around $600 million in the

two complete maintenance periods since the last FOMC meeting; thus far in

the current statement period borrowing has averaged around $500 million.

(5) Federal funds traded mainly between 8-3/8 and 8-3/4 percent

during most of the intermeeting period, averaging close to 8-1/2 percent,

about the same level as in the first half of February. Other short-term

rates have risen from 25 to 60 basis points, however, and bond yields are

as much as 60 basis points higher. Lack of progress in deficit reduction

efforts contributed to market expectations that credit markets would be

tightening as the year progressed. In addition, continued strength in



-4-

money growth over the first two months of the year led many to anticipate

that monetary policy might soon have to tighten, if it was not already

in process of doing so. The closing of non-federally insured Ohio thrift

institutions had relatively little impact on domestic credit markets-

or so far on the national pattern of deposit and currrency flows. Treasury

bill rates dropped some 30 to 40 basis points relative to yields on private

instruments immediately following the Governor's announcement in Ohio,

but quality spreads subsequently moved back to around previously prevailing

levels.

(6) Since the last FOMC meeting, the weighted-average value of

the dollar has declined, net, by 1-1/2 percent. Fluctuations have been

wide in often volatile market conditions. The dollar rose sharply early

in the intermeeting period when U.S. economic and monetary data proved

stronger than anticipated.

. The dollar subsequently retraced most of its earlier

decline, but again depreciated very sharply in mid-March largely in response

to concerns stemming from difficulties at Ohio thrift institutions and less

favorable economic indicators.

. The United States sold around $323 million of which $306 million

was against marks and the remainder against sterling.



Prospective developments

(7) The table below provides three alternative specifications

for growth in the monetary aggregates from March to June, along with

associated ranges for the federal funds rate. (More detailed data, in-

cluding implied growth from the fourth quarter to June, can be found on

the table and charts on the following pages.) Alternative B, which appears

consistent with roughly unchanged pressures on reserve positions, calls

for money growth that would keep M1 in June around the upper limit of the

parallel band that extends back from the endpoints of the longer-run

range for the aggregate. A more marked slowing of money growth is

specified in alternative C, keeping M1 within the band though still above

the upper limit of the cone; alternative A contemplates somewhat more

rapid money growth than B that would pull M1 above the upper limit of

the band.

(8) M1 growth at around a 6-1/2 percent annual rate from

March to June under alternative B represents a fairly considerable modera-

tion from the average pace of the past three months. Growth on a quarterly

average basis would probably be around 6-3/4 percent, slightly higher than

projected expansion in nominal GNP, reflecting some remaining lagged

effects on money demand of earlier interest rate declines. The pattern of

M1 growth over the quarter could be affected by the timing of tax refunds.

The amount of such refunds to date has lagged considerably behind disburse-

ments in comparable periods during the past two years. Refunds are

expected to run 10 percent less in total this year, but payments thus far

have been well below that pace. That may have been a marginal factor

restraining M1 growth in recent weeks, and as the Treasury catches up

could boost growth a bit.

(9) The specified growth of M1 for the March-to-June period

would imply expansion from QIV to June at an 8-1/4 percent annual rate

(assuming growth in March in fact turns out to be at the 3-1/2 percent

rate currently estimated). For M1 growth for the year to be just below

the upper limit of the FOMC's longer-run range--for example, to be around

6-1/2 percent (OIV to QIV basis)-its growth would have to slow further

over the June-to-December period, to about a 3-3/4 percent annual rate.

Such a slowing would imply a return to rising velocity on the order of

2 to 2-1/2 percent at an annual rate, given the staff's GNP projection-

a velocity rise that suggests the possibility of some little increase

in interest rates as the second half progresses.

(10) Growth in M2 and M3 is expected to be subdued over the

second quarter, reflecting the anticipated slowdown in M1 and relatively

moderate expansion in their nontransactions components. Nontransactions

components have recently grown quite modestly, and little further change

is expected, except for greater CD expansion in the spring to compensate

in part for slower growth in core deposits. M2 would move close to the



-8-

upper limit of its long-run cone by June under such conditions, and M3

would be within its cone.

(11) Growth in the debt of nonfinancial sectors in the second

quarter is projected to remain close to the pace of the first quarter.

With expansion at around an 11-1/2 percent annual rate, the increase in

nonfinancial debt would continue to outstrip growth in GNP, and for the

first half of the year would be just below the 12 percent upper limit

of the Committee's monitoring range. We have assumed that equity retire-

ments related to mergers and corporate financial restructuring will

account for approximately 3/4 of a percentage point of debt growth over

the March-to-June period, somewhat less than in the first quarter.

Underlying business needs for funds, however, may edge higher as capital

expenditures increase moderately while internally generated funds show

little change. For households, mortgage borrowing may rise, reflecting

the pick-up in expenditures following the decline in mortgage rates late

last year, but consumer installment credit should slow somewhat, although

remaining quite rapid. Federal government borrowing is projected to

increase (after seasonal adjustment), mirroring to some extent swings in

its cash balance over the first two quarters rather than a fundamental

shift in credit market pressures.

(12) The money growth objectives of alternative B are expected

to involve continuation of about the existing degree of pressure on

reserve positions, with reserve paths based on adjustment plus seasonal

borrowing at the discount window averaging around $350 million and

federal funds expected to trade around 8-1/2 percent. Seasonal borrowing

has averaged around $80 million in recent weeks, and with the spread of

the federal funds rate over the discount rate likely to remain fairly



-9-

narrow under this alternative, seasonal borrowing would ordinarily be

expected to increase only moderately further over the intermeeting period.

If availability of the temporary simplified seasonal borrowing program or

liquidity pressures at some agricultural banks were to result in an

unusual rise in seasonal borrowing over the intermeeting period, or if

adjustment borrowing rose substantially for special reasons, such as the

situation in Ohio, such borrowing increases above normal could be treated

as in effect "nonborrowed" reserves in the conduct of open market opera-

tions. Nonborrowed reserves are anticipated to expand at about a 10

percent annual rate over the next three months, and total reserves by

about 9 percent, to meet the money objectives of this alternative and if

demands for excess reserves are in the $600 to $700 million range.

(13) Interest rates could fall a little on balance over the

intermeeting period under this alternative, although some near-term

pressures could be evident at month end, owing to statement-date

pressures and the process of distributing the Treasury's current end-of-

quarter financing that raises about $12-3/4 billion of new cash in coupon

issues. The 3-month Treasury bill rate might decline toward 8-1/4 percent,

as continued moderate growth in money and discount window borrowing

around the $350 million level further allayed concerns about a tightening

of monetary policy. Significant downward movements in long-term rates

are unlikely in the absence of any substantial progress on deficit reduc-

tion measures or a noticeable weakening of economic activity. In general,

domestic credit, as well as foreign exchange, markets are likely to

remain unusually skittish over the weeks ahead, having been sensitized by

recent problems in the government securities market and with thrift

institutions. Thus, interest rates and foreign exchange rates may be



-10-

prone to particularly sharp day-to-day movements. In foreign exchange

markets the dollar might decline a little further, on balance, if interest

rates tend a bit lower or if uncertainties about the strength of the U.S.

economy or the stability of financial markets become more prevalent.

(14) Alternative A contemplates some easing of pressures on

reserve positions, with borrowing dropping to around $200 million and the

federal funds rate declining to close to the 8 percent discount rate.

Total and nonborrowed reserves might increase at rates of 10 and 13 per-

cent, respectively, over the next three months. Other short-term interest

rates might fall sharply under this alternative, with the 3-month Treasury

bill rate dropping below 8 percent. The easing of money markets would

also tend to relieve the sensitivity of markets to the condition of

financial institutions. Bond yields, too, would drop, and in foreign

exchange markets, the dollar would fall substantially further.

(15) M1 growth would slow relatively little from the December-

to-March pace under this alternative and would move above the upper limit

of the band. M2 and M3 growth rates are expected to be relatively moder-

ate, though M2 is expected to remain above the long-run cone in June

under this approach. Moreover, there is potential for quite rapid growth

for a while in the broad aggregates, particularly if market rates were to

decline abruptly in face of lagging institutional rates.

(16) From the fourth quarter to June, M1 would increase at an

8-3/4 percent annual rate under alternative A. Growth would have to slow

to about a 3-1/4 percent annual rate over the last six months of the

year, if growth for the year (QIV-to-QIV basis) were to be just below the

upper limit of the long-run range. This would increase the odds that

interest rates will rise in the second half of the year.



-11-

(17) Under alternative C, the 5 percent pace of M1 growth from

March to June would keep this aggregate below the upper limit of the

band. And the slower growth specified for M2 and M3 would place both of

these aggregates within their respective long-run cones in June. Such a

deceleration of money growth would likely involve a significant tighten-

ing of reserve conditions. Borrowing might increase to around $750 mil-

lion, and the federal funds rate would probably rise to around 9-1/2

percent. Nonborrowed and total reserves would increase at 4-1/2 and 7

percent annual rates, respectively.

(18) Other short-term interest rates also would rise under

this alternative, although the extent of the increase might be damped

a bit given existing expectations for some tightening in policy. The

Treasury bill rate might rise to around 9 percent or higher, with private

rates increasing a little more as the tightening of money markets accentu-

ated concerns about credit quality. The rise in bond rates might be

relatively small on balance, as slower money growth and the potential for

less robust economic activity lay the groundwork for a possible decline

in rates in the second half of the year. The dollar would probably

regain some of its recent loss in exchange markets.

Directive language

(19) Proposed language for the operational paragraph is shown

below, with alternatives for describing the degree of pressure on reserve

positions. The bracketed phrase in the first sentence, which is drawn

from the previous directive, seems more appropriate if the Committee opts

for alternatives A or B rather than the tightening of alternative C.

Also, if the Committee were to adopt something like the proposed language

in caps in the body of the paragraph beginning with the phrase "IN EITHER

CASE ... ", that might address the issues implicit in the bracketed

language.

OPERATIONAL PARAGRAPH

In the implementation of policy for the immediate future,

taking account of the progress against inflation, [DEL: remaining]

uncertainties in the business outlook, and the EXCHANGE VALUE

[DEL: strength] of the dollar [DEL: in the exchange markets,] the Committee

seeks to REDUCE SOMEWHAT (Alt. A)/maintain (Alt. B)/INCREASE

SOMEWHAT (Alt. C) THE EXISTING DEGREE OF PRESSURE ON reserve

POSITIONS. [DEL: conditions characteristic of recent weeks. Should]

THIS ACTION IS EXPECTED TO BE CONSISTENT WITH growth in M1,

[DEL: appear to be exceeding an annual rate of around 8 percent and]

M2, and M3 AT ANNUAL RATES [DEL: a rate] of around [DEL: 10 to 11] ____, ____,

AND ____ percent RESPECTIVELY during the period from [FRL: December to

March TO JUNE, [DEL: mondest increases in reserve pressures would be

sought, particulary if business activity is rising at a satis-

factory rate and exchange market pressures diminish.] SOMEWHAT

GREATER RESERVE RESTRAINT WOULD (MIGHT) BE ACCEPTABLE IN THE

EVENT OF MORE SUBSTANTIAL GROWTH OF THE MONETARY AGGREGATES WHILE



-13-

SOMEWHAT lesser restraint [DEL: on reserve positions] would (MIGHT) be

acceptable in the event of substantially slower growth [DEL: in the

monetary aggregates, particularly.] IN EITHER CASE SUCH A CHANGE

WOULD BE CONSIDERED ONLY in the context of APPRAISALS OF THE

STRENGTH OF THE BUSINESS EXPANSION, PROGRESS AGAINST INFLATION,

AND CONDITIONS IN DOMESTIC CREDIT AND [DEL: sluggish growth in economic

activity and continued strenght of the dollar in] foreign exchange

markets. The Chairman may call for Committee consultation if it

appears to the Manager for Domestic Operations that pursuit of the

monetary objectives and related reserve paths during the period

before the next meeting is likely to be associated with a federal

funds rate persistently outside a range of [DEL: 6-to-10]____ TO ____ percent.
