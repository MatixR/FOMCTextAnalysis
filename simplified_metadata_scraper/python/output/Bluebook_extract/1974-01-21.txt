The money market specifications for alternative C indicate that continuation of the path for the aggregates adopted at the last meeting would likely be associated with some upward movement in the 4 per cent.

Alternative A includes moderately higher growth rates for the monetary aggregates and a consequent easing in money market conditions.

For example, under alternative B, the annual rate of M1 growth over the first quarter is indicated to be around 5-1/4 per cent--and in a 3-1/2 to 5-1/2 per cent range for January-February-- but to rise to 7 per cent in the second quarter.

Thus, the refunding may be a relatively uncomplicated operation, although somewhat larger in size than the mid-November refunding. (14) Net inflows of consumer-type time and savings deposits are expected to continue at about the November-December pace at banks and thrift institutions under alternative B, which does not contemplate significant changes in market rates.

Somewhat greater growth would be likely to evolve under alternative A. There is risk of an appreciable reduction in savings flows under alternative C if the money market does .

As will be noted, the three alternatives refer to growth rates in the aggregates "over the past 12 months." For the 12 months through December 1973, these are as follows in terms of the revised series: M1, 5.9 per cent; M2, 8.6 per cent; and the bank credit proxy, 10.7 per cent.
