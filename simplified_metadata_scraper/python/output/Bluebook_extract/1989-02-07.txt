This currency growth would support expansion in the monetary base over 1989 of 4-1/2 percent, 2-1/2 percentage points slower than last year. Short-run policy alternatives (20) The two near-term policy alternatives presented involve adjustment plus seasonal discount borrowing of $600 million for alterna- tive B with funds trading at around 9 percent or a bit above, and borrow- 800 million for alternative C with funds 1 higher.

With funds continuing to trade at or a little above 9 percent, as expected under alternative B, some of the rate increases registered most recently may unwind, with Treasury bill rates 8 percent or a little below.

As maintaining the reserve pressures of alternative B causes international investors to begin recon- sidering the likelihood of an imminent U.

Some rebound from a weak January seems in store in February and March, but M2 growth is expected to reach only about 3 percent over the next two months, given the glacial adjustment speed of offering rates recently, especially for liquid accounts.

The 2 percent M2 growth of alternative B from December to March implies quarterly average growth of only 3 percent for this aggregate.

Consistent with the GNP outlook in the greenbook, the income velocity of M2 would increase this quarter at a 5-3/4 percent annual rate, nearly twice its rate of change over the second half of 1988.  M3 growth under alternative B should strengthen from its January lull to a 4-1/2 percent annual rate over February and March, 2 percent annual rate.
