Under Alternative A, the Committee would increase its purchases of agency 1.

Alternative B would maintain essentially the current stance of monetary policy.

Under Alternative C, the amount of agency MBS purchases would be reduced 1.

Alternatives A and B maintain the forward guidance from September, but specify the economic conditions under which the Committee anticipates maintaining exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period.

These conditions include low rates of resource utilization and subdued   Alternative B adds stable inflation expectations to the list.

Alternative C changes the forward guidance by indicating that the Committee anticipates “low levels of the federal funds rate for some time.

Alternative A states that economic activity “has turned up” but notes that the economic recovery could be relatively weak.  Alternative B says that economic activity has “continued to pick up,” while Alternative C states that a “recovery in economic activity is under way.

Like the  September statement, Alternatives A and B reiterate the Committee’s expectation that inflation “will remain subdued for some time.

Alternative A adds that “inflation has fallen considerably over the past year.   Alternative C also characterizes longer-term inflation expectations as stable and says that the Committee expects inflation to “remain at levels consistent with price stability,” basing this expectation on appropriate adjustments to monetary policy rather than slack in resource utilization.

THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE B  If policymakers believe that the policy stimulus already in train is likely to  foster the most satisfactory economic outcomes that are feasible given current  economic circumstances, the Committee could continue implementing its  previously announced LSAPs and reaffirm its forward guidance regarding the  funds rate, as in Alternative B.  Maintaining the current stance of monetary policy might appeal to the Committee if it shares the staff’s assessment that incoming economic and financial news is consistent with inflation remaining subdued and economic growth picking up to an acceptable pace in coming quarters.

Alternative B indicates that the economic conditions on which the Committee’s anticipation of extraordinarily low interest rates is based are the low rates of resource utilization, subdued inflation, and stable inflation expectations that are expected to prevail over an extended period.

On the current trajectory, agency debt  purchases will not reach the previously stated maximum, and the Committee  may want to indicate that these purchases are likely to total $175 billion, as in  Alternative B.  The Committee may judge that agency debt purchases are providing relatively little macroeconomic support and so there would be little cost in establishing a target for the program that is lower than its current maximum, especially since some market participants already expect the Federal 200 billion.

These factors could include the level of resource utilization, inflation,  and inflation expectations, as in Alternative B. A statement such as that suggested for Alternative B would be close to market expectations in terms of the LSAPs and federal funds rate target, but the change in forward guidance suggesting that resource utilization will be a factor in the Committee’s decisions regarding the stance of policy might be viewed as suggesting a longer period of very low interest rates than currently anticipated.

On average, agency debt traders now expect  purchases of agency debt to reach a level near their previously stated maximum  175 billion in Alternative B.  All in all, it seems likely that a statement along the lines of Alternative B would have only muted effects on most interest rates, equity prices, and the foreign exchange value of the dollar, 6 A possible subsequent step in preparing the public and markets for the normalization of policy would be to include in the statement a description of the tools that would be used to drain excess reserves or neutralize their effects on broader measures of money and credit, and thereby on economic growth and inflation.

THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE C  If policymakers view the continued accumulation of positive data on  spending as pointing to more underlying momentum in the recovery than they  previously anticipated and are more concerned than the staff about the  inflation outlook, they might choose to trim the size of the LSAPs and to  adjust the language regarding the anticipated period over which the funds rate  is likely to remain low, as in Alternative C.  Under this alternative, the Committee would announce both lower amounts of planned purchases of agency MBS and agency debt compared with the current amounts and a faster end to these programs.

Given the amounts purchased to date, the smaller  quantities specified in Alternative C would allow for an earlier conclusion of the program—the end of January 2010 instead of the end of the first quarter— while still permitting the purchases to be tapered.

This statement would also  begin to prepare the public and the markets for the withdrawal of policy  accommodation by indicating that the Committee now anticipates maintaining  “low levels” of the federal funds rate for “some time” rather than  “exceptionally low levels” of the federal funds rate for an “extended period.”6  Participants might prefer Alternative C if they viewed the improvement in financial market conditions and economic activity in recent months as suggesting that less monetary policy support from the Federal Reserve is required and, given the increase in activity in the housing sector in recent months, that a reduction in the maximum amount of purchases of mortgage- related assets, in particular, could be appropriate.

Indeed, Alternative C omits reference to resource utilization.

Alternative C would certainly surprise market participants.

The release of a statement  along the lines of Alternative C would likely cause short- and intermediate-term interest rates to rise sharply, and equity prices to drop, while the foreign exchange value of the dollar would probably rise.

The Committee might  conclude that an effective way to provide such stimulus would be to expand  the amount of agency MBS purchases and to extend the timeframe for  conducting agency MBS and agency debt transactions (thereby allowing a  higher amount of agency debt to be bought without causing market disruption),  as in Alternative A.  Although the staff’s output growth forecast is largely unchanged since September, recent weaker-than-expected employment growth has led the staff to mark up its forecast for the unemployment rate.

Expanding the amount of purchases of agency debt beyond $200 billion could  generate significant distortions in the market for those securities, so this is not  proposed in Alternative A. To the degree that the policy path currently expected by market participants is steeper than policymakers see as likely to be optimal in current circumstances, the Committee might deem it appropriate to change its forward guidance.

An announcement along the lines of Alternative A would come as a considerable surprise to market participants.

The second entry includes  key language from the draft statements for Alternatives A, B, and C in this Bluebook.  As noted above, Alternatives A and B change the forward guidance by being more specific about the economic conditions that the Committee anticipates will warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period.

This is done in Alternative C, as discussed above, and also in the third entry in Table 2, which might be the next stage in the sequence should the Committee opt at this meeting to maintain the current stance of policy as in Alternative B.

Language from the November 2009 statement   Alternative A.  The Committee will maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent and continues to anticipate that low rates of resource utilization and subdued inflation are likely to warrant this exceptionally low range for the federal funds rate for an extended period.

Alternative B.  In these circumstances, the Federal Reserve will continue to employ a wide range of tools to promote economic recovery and to preserve price stability.

Alternative C.  At this meeting, the Committee maintained the target range for the federal funds rate at its exceptionally low level of 0 to ¼ percent, and it anticipates that economic conditions are likely to warrant low levels of the federal funds rate for some time.

The baseline scenario corresponds to Alternative B in the Policy Alternatives section.

The second scenario corresponds to Alternative A, in which agency 1.

The third scenario corresponds to  Alternative C, in which the quantity of agency MBS purchases is reduced by 1.

This latter development occurs under the   Alternative C scenarios.

For the baseline  and Alternative C scenarios, the balance sheet reaches a peak of 10 The composition of Federal Reserve assets in all three of these projections differs notably from historical patterns.

Under Alternative C, reserve balances peak earlier than in the baseline scenario, because asset purchases are completed earlier.

In  contrast, under Alternative A, reserve balances peak in the third quarter of 2010, because a greater quantity of assets is purchased and the purchases last well into next year.

In the scenario corresponding to Alternative A, purchases of agency MBS are increased by 1.

Purchases are assumed to be completed by the end of the second quarter of 2010  In the scenario corresponding to Alternative C, purchases of agency MBS are decreased by 1.

 By the end of the projection period under the scenarios corresponding to the baseline and  Alternative C, the expansion of currency and capital combined with a runoff of other assets necessitates the resumption of Treasury security purchases to maintain reserve balances at a 25 billion.
