Of the alternatives, B and C are most consistent with moving near to or somewhat below the upper end of the FOMC's 3 to 8 percent long-run range for M1 by the fourth quarter, although  alternative C would provide more assurance.

Such a development would imply growth in M1 from QII '85 to QIV '85 at about an 8-1/2 percent annual rate, a little above the upper limit of the FOMC's range for the second half of the year.  Under alternative B, both M2 and M3 would be expected to diverge somewhat from the Committee's June-to-September specification 2 percent annual rate set at the July meeting.

Bond markets are likely to be sensitive to Congressional actions to implement the budget resolution in September after the recess, and to also significant changes in the foreign exchange value of the dollar.  Alternative C assumes a tightening of reserve positions, 850 million area.

It is probable that bank issuance of CDs and other managed liabilities would pick up as credit market demands shift toward banks, and also the commercial paper market, in a rising rate environment.  Alternative A involves an easing of pressures on bank reserve positions, either through a reduction in borrowings to the $100 to $200 million area or by a drop in the discount rate of, say, 1/2 percentage point with a smaller or no accompanying decline in borrowing.
