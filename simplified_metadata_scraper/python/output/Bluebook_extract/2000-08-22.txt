Nonetheless, with the staff now also forecasting faster growth of potential output, its projections of the unemployment rate and total PCE inflation for next year remain consistent with the Committee members' central tendencies. (7) Recent data on spending, productivity, and labor costs could well be seen by the Committee as on balance supporting a decision to leave the federal funds rate target 2 percent, as in alternative B. Signs of an appreciable moderation in aggregate demand growth no longer seem to be just "tentative and preliminary," and unit labor costs point toward little near-term pressure on inflation.

The choice of alternative B, accompanied by a sentence conveying a balance of risks weighted in an inflationary direction, would accord with the expectations of market participants.

No significant immediate response would be forthcoming in financial markets Under the staff forecast, economic data over the intermeeting period are likely to continue to indicate moderate demand growth and contained inflation and thus should have little net effect on market prices.  The 25 basis point increase in the targeted funds rate of alternative C would seem appropriate if the inflation forecasted by the staff were seen as likely and unacceptable.

In addition, the restraint on aggregate demand put in place by the Committee's prior tightenings has been offset to some extent by the recent rally in capital markets, and prospective increases in productivity growth may boost wealth and expected earnings even more than they have already, especially if real interest rates lie below the higher marginal product of capital.  The choice of alternative C would surprise market participants, raising questions about the path for monetary policy going forward.
