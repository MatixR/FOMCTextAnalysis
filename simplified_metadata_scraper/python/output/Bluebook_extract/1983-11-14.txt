The specifications of alternative B are expected to be consistent with little change in bank reserve positions and money market conditions from those recently prevailing.

De- spite a pickup in growth of transactions deposits, nonborrowed reserves would probably change little under this alternative over the two-month November-December period, owing primarily to the impact of lagged reserve accounting and changes in the deposit mix. (11) M2 growth is expected to slow a little in November and December under alternative B from its rate in October, when its nontrans- actions component was probably boosted slightly by the October 1 deregula- tion.

In the absence of any further such unwinding, however, continuation of money market rates around current levels could be associated with a tendency for M1 in the first quarter to be in the upper part of the FOMC's tenta- tive longer-term range for 1984. (14) Market interest rates might tend to rise a bit under alternative B, although the likelihood or extent of any such upward pressure would depend in part on whether reserve paths led to federal funds trading more consistently near 9-1/2 percent than has been the case recently.

At the current level of bond rates, much of business borrowing would probably continue to fall on banks and the commercial paper market.  Alternative A involves an easing in bank reserve positions and money market conditions over the next few weeks--with borrowing from the discount window falling into the $350-450 million range and the federal 4 to 9 percent.

However, much of the impact on money growth of easier bank reserve positions late in the fourth quarter would be felt beginning early next year, through the impact on money demand both of lower interest rates and the transactions needs associated with stronger GNP growth. (18) The extent of easing in money market conditions contem- plated under alternative A would probably result in a sizable decline in other short-term interest rates, with the 3-month Treasury bill falling into the 8 to 8-1/2 percent area, and a decline in the dollar on foreign exchange markets.

The reaction of bond yields may be more muted, espe- cially if incoming data indicated not only continued strength in economic activity but also a very substantial pickup in money stock growth. (19) Somewhat tighter reserve conditions are contemplated under alternative C, with discount window borrowing in the neighborhood of 900 million and the federal funds rate rising to around 10 percent.
