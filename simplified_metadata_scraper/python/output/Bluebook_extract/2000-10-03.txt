The higher track for energy prices boosts slightly the forecast for total PCE inflation in 2000 relative to the August Greenbook, bringing the increase to 2-1/2 percent; the rate falls back to 2 percent later in the projection as energy prices decline. (7) While the Committee may find the pickup in core inflation in the staff forecast to be worrisome, it may still favor keeping the stance of monetary policy unchanged at this meeting, as under alternative B. The uptrend to core inflation in that outlook is gradual and far from certain to come to pass.

Consequently, implementation of alternative B, along with the retention of the statement that the Committee regarded the balance of risks as weighted toward increased inflationary pressures, should have little effect on financial markets.

In this case, bond and equity markets would likely rally, as investors marked up the odds on an easing trend in monetary policy over coming months, and the value of the dollar on foreign exchange markets would probably edge lower. (9) The FOMC instead might choose the 25 basis point increase in the federal funds rate of alternative C. Core inflation has risen and may already be above rates that Committee members find acceptable over the long run.

In simulations of staff econometric models, such as that shown in the international section of Part I of the Greenbook, holding the nominal funds rate along the baseline path in the face of an upward shock to oil prices sets in motion a process of ever- rising core inflation relative to the baseline outcome as lower real interest rates boost output relative to potential.  alternative C would likely be sharp.
