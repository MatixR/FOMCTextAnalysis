Alternatives A and C represent, respectively, somewhat more and somewhat less expansive policy alternatives.

Since around year end, net inflows of deposits to thrift institutions have persisted at a rate considerably lower than previously anticipated, and, as a result, the staff has reduced its projections of such inflows over the year ahead. (9) Each of the alternatives presupposes an upward adjustment in deposit ceiling rates at banks and thrift institutions of 50 basis points on small-denomination time deposits; the adjustments in ceiling rates are assumed to occur in April under alternative C, in May under B, and in June under A.

It shows, for instance, that growth in M-1 at around the 5¼ per cent mid-point of the proposed alternative B range would lead to a 5.

M-1 growth at around the 5 per cent mid-point of the proposed alternative C range would nearly compensate for the slight fourth quarter overshoot but not for the larger third quarter overshoot.

Even assuming some further moderate downward shift in money demand relative to income, the Federal funds rate would probably have to begin rising again in April and reach 8 per cent by fall in order to constrain M-1 growth for the QIV '77-QIV '78 period to the mid-point  alternative B range.

Even assuming some further moderate downward shift in money demand relative to income, the Federal funds rate would probably have to begin rising again in April and reach 8 per cent by fall in order to constrain M-1 growth for the QIV '77-QIV '78 period to the mid-point of the 4 to 6-1/2 per cent alternative B range.1/ (14) Growth in M-2 over the February-March period is likely 2 per cent annual rate range under alternative B. With market yields above the ceiling rates on savings deposits and all maturities of small denomination time deposits at commercial banks, inflows of such deposits are likely to remain modest in February-March.

Although thrift deposit inflows are expected to rise from their depressed first quarter pace if ceiling rates are raised in the spring (as we are assuming), inflows will probably remain considerably below the strong pace of expansion of 1977. (16) With the Federal funds rate remaining near its present 4 per cent level, as envisioned under alternative B, interest rates generally are likely to fluctuate within a relatively narrow range over the intermeeting period.

However, as in 1977, such increases will be limited by the continued high cash flows of insurance companies and pension funds.  Under alternative C the Federal funds rate would rise over the intermeeting period to the mid-point of a 7 to 7-1/2 per cent range, and the February-March annual rate of growth of M-1 and M-2 would likely be in 1/2 to 5-1/2 and 4 to 8 per cent annual rate ranges, respec- tively.

At the same time, the rise in short-term interest rates associated with this alternative would tend to strengthen the dollar on international exchange markets. (19) The tightening of money market conditions contemplated under alternative C would further slow the net inflow of deposits sub- ject to rate ceilings in the weeks immediately ahead and thus would increase the need for an adjustment in deposit ceiling rates.

However, given the projected strength of money demand, a further increase in interest rates would be required in order to limit M-1 expansion to the mid-point of the 4 to 6 per cent alternative C range over the QIV '77-QIV '78 period.

The staff would expect the funds rate under this alternative to average 7-3/4 per cent in the second quarter and to rise to 8-1/4 per cent by fall.  Alternative A involves a reduction in the Federal funds rate over the intermeeting period to the 6-1/2 per cent mid-point of a 2 per cent range.

Long- term rates, on the other hand, might not retrace all of their recent increases if, as appears likely at the moment, market participants con- cluded that the decline in short-term rates was likely to be temporary. Meanwhile, the dollar would probably tend to soften in international exchange markets.  The approach of alternative A appears most consistent with a monetary policy that encourages more rapid growth in the monetary aggregates over the longer-run than under either alternatives B or C.

(22) The approach of alternative A appears most consistent with a monetary policy that encourages more rapid growth in the monetary aggregates over the longer-run than under either alternatives B or C. Nevertheless, given the strength projected for economic activity, the near-term decline in the funds rate under A would probably soon have to be reversed to restrain growth in the aggregates to rates consistent with the mid-points of longer-run ranges for alternative A. The funds rate would have to begin rising again in the second quarter and might 4 per cent by fall.

As suggested below, the particular language needed in the opening lines of the money market formulation would depend on the specific conditions sought; the three alternatives shown--calling, respectively, for somewhat easier, prevailing, and somewhat firmer money market condi- tions--are intended to be associated with the specifications discussed  alternatives A, B, and C.
