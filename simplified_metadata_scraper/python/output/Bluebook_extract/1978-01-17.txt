It shows, for instance, that growth in M-1 at around the 5-1/4 per cent mid-point of the pro-  alternative B range would lead to a 5.

M-1 3 to 9 2½ to 8½ 2 to 8 M-2 5½ to 9 5 to 9 4½ to 8½ Federal funds rate (Intermeeting period) 6 to 6½ 6½ to 7 7 to 7½ (10) A Federal funds rate centered on the recently prevailing 6¾ per cent, as encompassed under alternative B, is likely to be associated with M-1 growth over January-February in a 2½ to 8½ per cent annual rate range.

However, the staff expects that further increases in market interest rates will be required relatively soon in order to limit growth in this aggregate over the QIV '77 to QIV '78 period to the mid-point of the longer-run 4 to 6½ per cent range associated with alternative B. Money demand can be expected to be relatively strong over the year.

Consequently, growth in deposits at these institutions can be expected to slow further in January-February. With outstanding commitments at record levels, it seems likely that S&L's will not only be forced to reduce their liquidity and to maintain a high rate of borrowing from the FHLBanks, but also to slow their new commit- ment activity in early 1978. 1/ The implied increases in the velocity of M-1 and M-2 over 1978 are displayed in Appendix II. (13) If the Federal Funds rate remains near its present 6¾ per cent level over the intermeeting period, as envisioned under alternative B, short-term market interest rates will probably remain near current higher levels.

However, on January 25, the Treasury will announce terms for refunding more than $5 billion of publicly-held issues maturing in mid-February; the Treasury may also take the occasion to raise $1 to $2½ billion of new money. (14) Beyond the intermeeting period, short-term interest rates are expected to be under renewed upward pressure as efforts are made to limit M-1 expansion to the 5¼ per cent mid-point of the alternative B longer-run range.

Such increases, however, will be limited by the continued high cash flows of insurance companies and pension funds.  Alternative C contemplates an increase in the Federal funds rate over the next few weeks to the mid-point of a 7 to 7-1/2 per cent range.

However, further interest rate increases appear necessary as the year progresses, given the underlying strength of money demand. The staff would expect the funds rate under this alternative to average 7-3/4 per cent by the second quarter of 1978 and 8-1/4 per cent in the fourth. (18) An easing in money market conditions over the next few weeks under alternative A, which calls for a Federal funds rate of about 6-1/4 per cent, would come as a considerable surprise so soon after the Board's recent discount rate action.

The decline in short-term rates, however, would tend to soften the dollar in inter- national exchange markets. (19) Even though this alternative is consistent with a shift to higher long-term growth ranges for the aggregates, the decline in the funds rate would soon have to be reversed in order to keep the aggre- gates within the longer-run ranges of alternative A. The funds rate would probably have to begin rising late in the first quarter and 4 per cent by fall.

As suggested below, the particular language needed in the opening lines of the money market formulation would depend on the specific conditions sought; the three alternatives shown--calling, respectively, for somewhat easier, prevailing, and somewhat firmer money market conditions--are intended to be associated with the specifications discussed in the preceding section under alternatives A, B, and C.
