Alternative B would keep the intended 2 percent.

Alternative C entails a 50 basis point rise in the federal funds rate, to 6 percent, achieved either through an equivalent increase in the discount rate with the same path for the borrowing allowance or an increase in the initial borrowing allowance to $175 million, with the same seasonal reductions thereafter.

In these circumstances, and given the seemingly greater confidence of late in financial markets that the System will act as appropriate to counter a buildup in inflationary pressures, interest rates and the foreign exchange value of the dollar are unlikely to change very much in the immediate aftermath of a deci- sion to leave policy unchanged, as under Alternative B. Movements in financial markets subsequently will depend, of course, on the nature of incoming data.

Continued strength in employment or final demand, especially if accompanied by adverse wage and price developments, would firm market expectations of System action early next year. Inaction in the face of such data could risk the re-emergence of con- cerns that the Federal Reserve was falling behind in its efforts to contain inflation, raising long-term interest rates and weakening the foreign exchange value of the dollar. (11) The 1/2 percentage point rise in the federal funds rate under alternative C might be favored if the Committee viewed the recent string of surprisingly strong economic data as clearly indicat- ing that the risks are still tilted in the direction of sustained faster inflation.

The inclination to adopt alternative C would be bolstered by a belief that financial markets have largely absorbed the Orange County shock and the risks of further disruptions are de minimus.

The inclination to adopt alternative C would be bolstered by a belief that financial markets have largely absorbed the Orange County shock and the risks of further disruptions are de minimus.  Under alternative C, money market interest rates would firm somewhat, especially those at the shortest end, as the tightening would come somewhat sooner than now expected.

Under alternative C, opportunity costs would tend to increase as the rise in money market rates outpaced those on M2 com- ponents.

M2 would expand at only a 1 ber-to-March period, restrained by faster runoffs of M1 and savings  than under alternative B. By March, M2 would stand about 1/2 percent above its fourth-quarter 1994 base, a little below the bottom of its provisional growth range for 1995.
