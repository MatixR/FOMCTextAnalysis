Under  Alternative A, the Committee would increase its purchases of Treasury securities and potentially extend the period of time over which it expects to hold the funds rate at a very low rate.  Alternative B would essentially maintain the current stance of monetary policy while specifying a phase-out strategy for the purchases of Treasury securities.

Under Alternative C, the Committee would trim the size of the LSAPs and shorten the anticipated period of time over which its target range for the funds rate would be likely to remain extraordinarily low.

Alternative A states that “the pace of economic contraction has abated significantly,” whereas Alternatives B and C adopt a somewhat more optimistic tone and note that “economic activity is leveling out.   Alternative C also indicates that “downside risks are diminishing.

In characterizing the LSAP program, Alternatives B and C note that the Federal Reserve is currently in the process of buying the previously announced maximum 13 At the point when the Committee considers the strategy for completing its purchases of agency MBS and agency debt, it could adjust this language to indicate that these transactions would likely taper off into early 2010, as recommended by the Desk.

Alternative B' preserves the same language regarding the phase-out strategy for the current program of purchases of Treasury securities but indicates that the Committee is “prepared to consider resuming” its purchases of Treasury securities.  In contrast, Alternative A raises the amount of purchases of Treasury securities by $150 billion and indicates that the “full amount” of $450 billion will be purchased by year-end; this alternative does not mention a phase-out strategy for these transactions.

Under Alternatives A and B, the overall size of the Federal Reserve’s purchases of agency MBS and agency debt would remain at the previously announced levels of 1.  However, Alternative A would indicate that the Committee anticipates completing the “full amount” of agency MBS purchases, whereas Alternative B leaves open the possibility that total purchases will not reach the maximum amount; moreover, by not specifying a phase-out strategy, this alternative preserves more scope for the Committee to choose to expand these purchases at a later date.  Alternative C states that the Committee has decided to “gradually slow the pace” of its purchases of agency MBS and agency debt and now anticipates that these purchases will only cumulate to about $1 trillion and $150 billion, respectively.

Alternative B' 1.

THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE B  If policymakers believe that the policy stimulus already in train will likely be  sufficient to foster a satisfactory economic recovery, the Committee could decide to  reaffirm its forward guidance regarding the funds rate, continue implementing its  previously announced LSAPs, and provide additional information about its plan for  winding down purchases of Treasury securities, as in Alternative B.  Maintaining the current stance of monetary policy might be particularly appealing if the Committee shares the staff’s assessment that economic growth will gradually pick up in coming quarters as the financial system continues to heal and the housing sector shows further signs of improvement.

Alternative B indicates that the Committee will continue to evaluate the timing and overall amounts of the Federal Reserve’s purchases of agency debt and agency MBS but does not mention further adjustments to the purchases of Treasury securities; the absence of any such reference might well be seen by market analysts as suggesting that the Committee would not be inclined to resume large-scale purchases of Treasury securities even if financial or economic conditions deteriorated.

However, if  policymakers perceive an appreciable probability that additional purchases of Treasury  securities could become warranted in coming months, they might prefer language like  that of Alternative B', which states that the Committee is “prepared to consider resuming its purchases of Treasury securities in light of the evolving economic outlook and conditions in financial markets.

The release of a statement such as that suggested for Alternative B should have muted effects on financial markets.

THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE A  If policymakers are concerned that the economic outlook is unacceptably weak  and judge that additional monetary stimulus would be appropriate, the Committee  could decide to expand the total amount of purchases of Treasury securities and to  extend the timeframe for conducting those purchases, as in Alternative A.  Although the staff has marked up slightly its forecast for economic growth, the output gap in the Greenbook remains in excess of 7 percent over the next two years, the unemployment rate declines only slowly from its projected 10 percent peak, and core inflation hovers around 1 percent.

An announcement along the lines of Alternative A is not expected by market participants and predicting the effects of such a statement is difficult.

THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE C  If policymakers are substantially more optimistic than the staff regarding the  economic outlook, the Committee might choose to trim the size of the LSAPs and to  adjust its language regarding the anticipated period over which the funds rate would  be likely to remain extraordinarily low, as in Alternative C.  Under this alternative, the Committee would begin a gradual withdrawal of monetary stimulus by announcing a tapering off of the LSAP program.

The publication of Alternative C would come as quite a surprise to market participants.

Thus, the release  of a statement along the lines of Alternative C would likely cause short- and longer- term interest rates to rise sharply, and equity prices to drop, while the exchange value of the dollar would probably appreciate.

This baseline scenario corresponds to Alternative B in the Policy Alternatives section of this Bluebook.

The second scenario corresponds to  Alternative A in the Policy Alternatives section, in which purchases of Treasury securities are increased by $150 billion to $450 billion, and the purchases continue through the end of this year.  The third scenario corresponds to Alternative C in the Policy Alternatives section, in which the total quantity of agency MBS purchases is 1 trillion.

Purchases of agency MBS are scheduled to be completed by  the end of this year; however, due to expected settlement lags and prepayments,  agency MBS holdings under Alternatives A and B peak at a slightly lower level than the total amount purchased and a few months after purchases have ceased.  For the Alternative C scenario, although total purchases are 960 billion.

In the baseline  scenario and Alternative A, reserve balances decline through the end of the forecast period, while in Alternative C, a resumption of open market purchases is required in 25 billion.

Even under Alternative A, Treasury securities account for only about one-third of assets at the end of 2009.

For Alternative A, the peak occurs on the same 2.

For Alternative C, the balance sheet peaks at 1.

In the scenario corresponding to Alternative A, purchases of Treasury securities are 450 billion by the end of the year.

In the scenario corresponding to Alternative C, purchases of agency MBS are decreased by 1.
