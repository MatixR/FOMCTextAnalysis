The Federal funds rate specifications of alternative B are centered on the currently prevailing 10½ to 10¾ percent range. Alternatives A and C would ease or tighten, respectively, money market conditions in coming weeks.

A Alt Ranges for August-September M-1 5½ to 9½ 5 to 9 4½ to 8½ M-2 8½ to 12½ 8 to 12 7½ to 11½ Federal funds rate 9¾ to 10½ 10¼ to 11 10 to 11½ (intermeeting period)  Under alternative B, M-1 would be expected to expand in a 5 to 9 percent annual rate range over the August-September period.

Such a pattern would not be expected to persist for an extended period, and the staff anticipates a return to somewhat weaker demands for M-1 over the remainder of the year--although not to the marked weakness observed in the past fall and winter.  Under alternative B, M-2 growth is projected to expand at about a 10 percent annual rate during the August-September period, a some- what slower growth rate than in June and July.

Nonetheless, growth in small time deposits should remain brisk, with banks continuing to attract a substantial amount of MMC deposits in the absence of an inter-institutional ceiling rate differential. under alternative B M-1 in September would be above the level implied by the upper end of the Committee's 1½ to 4½ percent growth range for the QIV '78 to QIV '79 period. This would also be true under alternatives A and C.

This would also be true under alternatives A and C However, as is indicated in the lower panel of the chart, if the longer-run range is adjusted to reflect the downward revision in the staff's estimate of the ATS/NOW effect from the original 3 percent to the current 1 percent, under alternative B) is within, though in the upper half, of the adjusted 3 to 6 percent range.

For M-2, growth indicated by the alternative B range would place the aggregate in September well into the upper half of the 5 to 8 percent range established by the Committee for the period QIV '78 to QIV '79.

Growth in M-2 would have to be at a 5.3 percent annual rate over the same period to achieve the midpoint of its longer-run range. (13) With Federal funds continuing to trade around 10½ to 10¾ percent, the midpoint of alternative B, other interest rates would likely change little in the near term.

At thrift institutions, growth of deposits subject to rate ceilings likely will remain sluggish, leading to continued borrowing from Home Loan Banks and market sources. Growth Rates from July Levels Required to Achieve Levels Implied by FOMC Longer-run Ranges for M-1 and M-2 (Seasonally adjusted annual rates) Low End of Range Midpoint of Range High End of Range Achieve level by: September 1979 (in 2 months) QIV '79 (end of longer-run period) Achieve level by: September 1979 (in 2 months) QIV '79 (end of longer-run period) September 1979 (in 2 months) QIV '79 (end of longer-run period) (3 percent ATS/NOW impact on M-1) -10.6 -3.4 3.9 -4.6 -0.2 4.1 (1½ percent ATS/NOW impact on M-1) -3.4 3.9 11.3 -0.2 4.1 8.5 -2.9 11.4 5.3 9.6  Alternative A involves a decline in the Federal funds rate 2 percent range.

Thrift deposit flows would benefit from the decline in market rates, especially if bill yields fell enough to reopen a ceiling rate differential, and mortgage rates might edge downward.  Alternative C calls for an increase in the Federal funds 2 percent range.

Given the out- look for nominal GNP, and assuming that the Committee adopts short-run alternative B, the projected behavior of money demand would permit a decline in the Federal funds rate to around 9-1/2 percent by year-end with M-1 growth for the QIV '78 to QIV '79 period ending up close to the mid- point of the longer-run range (of 3 to 6 percent, assuming 1-1/2 percent .
