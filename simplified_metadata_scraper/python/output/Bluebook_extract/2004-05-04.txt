Alternatives A and B assume that the federal funds rate holds at 1 percent but differ as to the Committee’s characterization of the strength of the economy and its willingness to be patient in removing policy accommodation.  Alternative C contemplates a quarter-point firming and aligns the wording of the statement accordingly.

In these circumstances, the Committee might want to adopt language that would provide more flexibility about future action so that it has scope to begin unwinding its current policy accommodation if circumstances soon warrant, as in Alternative B.  Even if such action were not viewed as imminent, the Committee might favor a change in the wording if members put some weight on the possibility of tightening in the next few months as more information bearing on the strength of the labor market and inflation Table 1: FOMC Statement Alternatives for the May Bluebook March FOMC Alternative A Alternative B Alternative C Policy Decision 1.

(10) The Committee has multiple opportunities in its statement to indicate that the odds of policy firming in the near future are higher than at the March  Alternative B in Table 1.

(11) If Committee members were sufficiently confident that the expansion was now self-sustaining or saw the recent increase in core inflation as signaling an upturn in underlying inflation, then they might find an increase of ¼ percentage point  Alternative C, to be appropriate.

If the Committee believed that the case for tighter policy would likely require at least several more months of evidence, it might choose a statement fairly close to the one released following the March meeting, as in Alternative A.  With investment spending still reported to be primarily for replacement rather than for expansion and with only one month of reasonably strong employment data in hand, the Committee may not yet be confident that business gloom has really lifted all that much.

If the Committee finds sufficient merit in the selection of Alternative A, it could issue a statement like that shown in the corresponding column of Table 1.
