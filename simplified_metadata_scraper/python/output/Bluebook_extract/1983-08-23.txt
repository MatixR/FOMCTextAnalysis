Because the bulk of the third quarter is now behind, specified money growth rates over the June-to-September period do not differ greatly from alternative B, but the emerging differ- ence in money market conditions would more significantly affect develop- ments in the fourth quarter.

M1, on the other hand, is expected to grow more slowly in August and September than in July as the rise in market interest rates that has already occurred contributes to moderation in demands for this aggregate.  Under alternative B, the federal funds rate would be expected to trade around 9-1/2 per cent (the 6 to 10 per cent funds rate range shown for that alternative retains the specification of the current .

Growth rates in M2 and M3 over the year 1983 are expected to be around the midpoint, and in the upper half, of their longer-run ranges respectively, assuming as noted above some slight further tightening of money markets in the fourth quarter and also a moderation of loan demands at banks and thrifts.  Alternative A contemplates some easing in money market conditions, with federal funds in an 8-1/2 to 9 per cent area and borrow- 600 million range.

With bond rates falling, business issuance of long-term obligations would burgeon once again, while borrowing from banks and in the commercial paper market receded. In foreign exchange markets, the dollar would tend to weaken, probably falling below levels prevailing around the time of the July FOMC meeting. (16) While growth in the monetary aggregates in the June-to- September period may be only a little stronger under alternative A than alternative B, the easing in bank reserve positions, if sustained through the fourth quarter, would involve a greater chance as the year progresses that M1 growth would accelerate, at least a bit, from what is currently expected to be a moderate August pace and tend to stay above its longer-run range.

Growth in M2 and M3 would tend to be somewhat higher for the year as money market conditions remain easier than under alter- native B, but they are likely to remain within their longer-run ranges.  Alternative C contemplates a near-term tightening in money market conditions with a view to gaining greater assurance that all of the aggregates, including Ml, would end 1983 within their longer- run ranges. The federal funds rate under alternative C might trade in 2 per cent range through the end of the quarter.

Assuming no discount rate change, nonborrowed reserves might decline at about a 6 per cent annual rate from July to September. (18) The size and speed of the tightening in money market conditions contemplated under alternative C is probably not currently anticipated in the market.

In the mortgage market rates on conventional fixed rate mortgages would climb above 14 per cent, with pressure on these rates accentuated by effects of rising MMDA costs on the willingness of thrifts to extend mortgage loans. The dollar would come under considerable upward pressure on foreign ex- change markets, especially if foreign central banks continued to demonstrate a reluctance to raise their domestic interest rates.  Under alternative C, M2 and M3 growth over the June-to- September period might be somewhat below objectives specified at the last Committee meeting, though M1 growth may be close to its 7 per cent third-quarter objective.

The probable dampening effect of these higher interest rates on growth in money and income as the year progresses suggests the likelihood that attaining longer-run money and credit targets for 1984 would involve a substantial easing of interest rates later this year or  alternative C levels.
