M2 under alternative A would be just a bit above the upper end of the range by June, and would be down within the range under alternatives B and C, as shown in Chart 1.

With the shift to MMDAs largely completed, the bank and thrift share of lending to nonfinancial sectors is expected to decline from the extraordinary level of the first quarter, but to remain above the average of the last few years.  Alternative B contemplates a federal funds rate fluctuating around the current 8-1/2 percent discount rate, assuming adjustment (includ- 200 million.

Treasury coupon offerings are expected to remain about as large as in the first three months of 1983, and businesses also can be expected to offer a fairly large volume of inter- mediate- and long-term securities in an ongoing effort to improve balance sheet structures.  Alternative A, which calls for 10 percent M2 growth from March to June, would probably be associated with a drop in the federal funds rate to the 7 to 8 percent area.

Or such a funds rate might emerge, or be approached, if borrowing were dropped to the $50-100 million range at the current discount rate. (17) Short-term interest rates may decline considerably under alternative A, as market fears of any near-term tightening are allayed and current dealer financing costs drop along with the funds rate.

The 3-month bill rates might trade around 7½ percent, and the generally lower short-term rates would lead to a further decline in the bank prime rate. Longer-term rates may also decline, but the declines may be limited by a resultant step-up in corporate bond offerings.  Alternative C is assumed to involve a rise in the federal funds rate to the 9 to 9½ percent area, and an increase in the level of 700 million range.
