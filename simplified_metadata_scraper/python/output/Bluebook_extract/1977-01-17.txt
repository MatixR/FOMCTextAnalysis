Alternative B continues the same ranges currently in place except for the bank credit proxy for which the range is higher than the present 5-8 per cent.

This represents a slightly higher 2-month range than has been presented in recent blue books, and reflects the pick-up in M1 growth that has occurred during the past few weeks as well as the stronger demand for money expected to be associated with the projected acceleration in growth of nominal GNP in the first quarter. (9) Growth in M2 over the January-February period may be in a 7 -11 per cent annual rate range under alternative B. The time and savings deposit component of M2 is expected to grow less than in the fourth quarter, largely because banks have become less aggressive in seeking out time deposit funds.

Perhaps the chief factor that could cause market rates to rise somewhat over the next few weeks, however, would be the effect on market expectations of any further evidence of a strengthening in the economy, monetary aggregates, and fiscal stimulus. (11) To maintain growth in monetary aggregates over the QIV '76-QIV '77 period within the longer-run ranges proposed under alternative B, the staff expects that the Federal funds rate would have to begin rising by early spring, and would reach a 1977 peak of around 6½ per cent in the fourth quarter of the year.

Tax refunds in late winter and early spring are expected to be larger than last year and could also have a transitory impact on M1.  Alternative A encompasses a reduction in the Federal funds rate to the mid-point of a 3-4 per cent range over the next few weeks.

Expectations that interest rates would soon rise might develop as the market observes faster growth in the aggregates and as the pace of economic expansion picks up.  Over the longer-run, under alternative A, we would not expect a very substantial rise in interest rates to develop, however, since the higher longer-run growth in the monetary aggregates embodied in that alternative would be more accommodative of money and credit demands.

The funds rate would probably have to rise under this alterna- tive, given the projected strength of the economy, but perhaps to no more than an average level of around 5¼ per cent by the fourth quarter of the year.  Alternative C involves a tightening of the Federal funds rate over the next few weeks to the mid-point of a 4 ¾-5½ per cent range.

The staff would expect that further pressures would have to be applied to the money market as the year progresses if growth in M1 over the QIV '76-QIV '77 period is to be constrained to around the mid-point of the 3½-5½ per  alternative C range.

Because of the more rapid growth in M1 now expected in the first half of 1977, the third quarter 1977 level under alternative B is slightly higher (.3 of a per cent), but the fourth quarter level is virtually the same. For M2, however, the proposed alternative B implies substantially higher levels in the latter half of 1977 than are implied by the mid-point Terminal Quarters QIII '77 QIV '77 QIII '77 QIV '77 of the current growth range based on QIII '76.

By the third quarter, M 2 would be about 1½ per cent, and by the fourth quarter about 1 per cent, higher under proposed alternative B. The levels of alternative C are considerably closer to the previously implied mid-point levels.
