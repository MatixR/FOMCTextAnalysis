Given the Federal funds rate assump- tions of alternative B--where the rate is centered at the prevailing level of 6-1/2 per cent--M-1 growth over this period is likely to be Alternative Levels and Growth Rates for Key Monetary Aggregates Alt.

For the year 1977  would grow at around a 7-1/4 per cent rate. (12) Growth in M-2 over the December-January period is likely to be in a 6-10 per cent annual rate range under alternative B. Commercial bank savings deposits, after contracting in November, are likely to resume modest growth over the period, even though market yields will remain above rate ceilings on such deposits, as the most interest sensitive holders have probably shifted to other instruments.

As in October-November, however, most of the expansion in the interest bearing component of M-2 is likely to occur in large denomination time deposits not subject to interest rate ceilings. (13) At thrift institutions, inflows over the months ahead are likely to remain well below the unusually rapid pace of July- October, when these institutions were apparently successful in capturing a substantial volume of maturing wild card deposits from commercial banks. Saving deposits at S&L's and MSB's have already slowed considerably in reflection of the higher level of market yields, but longer-term deposits at these institutions, where offering rates remain above market yields, can be expected to grow at a relatively rapid pace in December-January. While thrift institutions have only limited ability to supplement deposit flows with ceiling-free large denomination deposits, they appear to be in a position to fulfill their record level of mortgage commitments by reducing liquid asset holdings and continuing to draw on FHLB advances. (14) If the Federal funds rate remains near its present 6 per cent level over the inter-meeting period, as envisioned under alternative B, short-term rates probably will remain fairly near their current levels.

Mortgage rates may rise somewhat less, given prospective Federal support programs.  Alternative C contemplates an increase in the Federal funds rate to the mid-point of a 6¾-7¼ per cent range between now and mid-January.

With additional monetary restraint in place sooner, the staff would expect growth in the monetary aggregates to be some- what slower over the next few months than under alternative B. Con- sequently, interest rates would have to rise somewhat less next year in order to achieve the mid-points of the Committee's longer-run ranges for the QIII '77-QIII '78 period.

Con- sequently, interest rates would have to rise somewhat less next year in order to achieve the mid-points of the Committee's longer-run ranges for the QIII '77-QIII '78 period. (17) In light of the recent moderation in the growth of the monetary aggregates, an increase in the Federal funds rate to the 7 per cent mid-point of the alternative C range over the next few weeks would probably surprise market participants and involve a substantial upward adjustment in short rates--with the 3-month bill rate, for example, rising to about 6½ per cent.

Member bank borrowing from the discount window would rise substantially, and pressure for another increase in the discount rate would develop. (18) An easing in the Federal funds rate to 6 per cent, as envisioned under alternative A, could stimulate a substantial downward adjustment in short-term market rates.

Thus, interest rates would soon need to begin rising, and would reach levels  alternatives B and C.

Thus, interest rates would soon need to begin rising, and would reach levels next year higher than those necessary under alternatives B and C. Under alternative A, M-1 is likely to expand at a 6¼ per cent average rate of growth over the fourth quarter of 1977 and the first quarter of 1978, requiring interest rate increases sufficient to hold M-1 growth in the second and third quarters of 1978 to about a 4 per cent annual rate.

As suggested below, the particular language needed in the opening lines of the money market formulation would depend on the specific conditions sought; the three alternatives shown--calling, respectively, for some- what easier, prevailing, and somewhat firmer money market conditions-- are intended to be associated with the specifications discussed in  alternatives A, B, and C.

On the other hand, recent growth in nonborrowed reserves has been below the longer-run growth thought consistent with Alternative A, but above the growth rates shown for Alternatives B and C.

Increases in the discount rate would, of course, shift the composition of total reserves more toward nonborrowed than borrowed reserves.
