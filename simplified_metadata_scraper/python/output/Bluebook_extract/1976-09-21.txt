Under alternative B, given prevailing money market conditions--as indexed by a Federal funds rate around 5¼ per cent-- M1 will probably grow in a 4-8 per cent annual rate range.

Under alternative B, given prevailing money market conditions--as indexed by a Federal funds rate around 5¼ per cent-- M1 will probably grow in a 4-8 per cent annual rate range. (8) M2 may rise in a 9-13 per cent annual rate range under alternative B over the September-October period.

Treasury credit needs are likely to be relatively moderate in the early fall, given the large end-of- September cash balance now in prospect, but such needs will probably pick up as the quarter progresses.  Alternative A involves an easing of the money market, with the funds rate range centered on 4¾ per cent.

Banks would probably continue to run-off large money market CD's, while at the same time taking advantage of the lower level of market rates to lengthen maturities on those new CD's that they do issue. (13) The tightening of money market conditions contemplated under alternative C--with the funds rate range centered on 5¾ per cent-- might well lead to fairly sharp upward adjustments in market rates over the next few weeks.

Holdings of coupon issues are also fairly sizable, and strong efforts to secure the paper profits on such positions could lead to an appreciable rise in longer-term Treasury yields, with spill-over effects on other longer-term markets. (14) A little slower growth in the monetary aggregates would, of course, be likely to develop over the September-October period under alternative C than under either of the other two alternatives.
