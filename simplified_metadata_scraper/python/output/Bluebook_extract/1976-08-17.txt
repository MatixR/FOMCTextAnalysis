Alternative A--which involves an easing of the money market over the next few weeks--encompasses more monetary ease in the second half of this year than the other two alterna- tives, and more monetary restraint in the first half of next year.

At the other end of the spectrum, alternative C--which assumes a tightening of the 1/ Nonborrowed reserves and other reserve aggregates thought to be con- sistent with these ranges are shown in Appendix table I.

Alternative B lies in between.

A Alt M1 growth 2nd half '76 5¾ 5¾ 5¼ 1st half '77 5½ 5¾ 6 Average level of funds rate 2nd half '76 5-3/8 5½ 6-1/8 1st half '77 7¼ 6-7/8 6¾ (9) The intermeeting range for the Federal funds rate under alternative B is centered on 5¾ per cent, the rate recently prevailing.

By the second quarter of 1977, we would expect the funds rate to average around 7¼ per cent.  Under alternative B, M1 is expected to expand in a 4-8 per cent, annual rate, range over the August-September period and M2 in a 7½-11½ per cent range.

Government and Federal agency issues, including  of the new 10- and 25-year Treasury issues.  Alternative C involves a tighter monetary policy over the next few weeks and assumes that the Federal funds rate rises to the mid- 4 per cent range.

The 3-month bill rate might rise 40 to 60 basis points to the 5-1/2 to 5-3/4 per cent area, and Trea- sury note and bond yields could increase 20 to 30 basis points.  While alternative C involves more near-term restraint than B, the early move toward tightening would work to limit interest rate increases needed over the longer run to maintain M1 growth over the QII 4 per cent.

The staff believes that the funds rate could peak out at around 6-3/4 per cent during the fall under  alternative C approach.

At such a rate level, it appears that an upward adjustment in Regulation Q may not be needed to enable the Com- mittee to attain its longer-run M2 and M3 objectives.  Alternative A assumes an easing of money market conditions between now and the next meeting--with the funds rate dropping to the mid- 4 per cent range.

If the reversal were begun in early fall, the funds rate might peak out at around 7-1/2 per cent by the second quarter of 1977, a somewhat higher rate than under alternative B. An upward adjustment in Regulation Q ceiling rates might be required somewhat earlier than under B, perhaps in the winter of next year.
