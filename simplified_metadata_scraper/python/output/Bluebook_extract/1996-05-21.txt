In these circumstances, the Committee may prefer to adopt alternative B, 3.

Alternative C embodies a 50 basis point increase in the federal funds rate to 5-3/4 percent in order to counter the incipient increase in price pressures.

The Federal Reserve is not expected by market participants to tighten for several months, and hence, investors would be caught off guard by the FOMC's  alternative C at this meeting.

The value of the dollar would probably ratchet higher on exchange markets.  The interest rates of alternative B and associated staff forecast for the economy are thought to be consistent with a slight moderation in the growth of money and credit over coming months relative to their pace of expansion so far in 1996.
