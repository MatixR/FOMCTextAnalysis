As a consequence, inflation on an underlying basis will pick up, though the rise in published inflation will be muted by technical adjustments.  The choice of the unchanged policy stance of alternative B would seem to follow if the Committee found the Greenbook forecast both probable and--despite the projected upcreep in underlying inflation--acceptable.

This downward pressure on yields, however, may be offset somewhat to the extent that the situation in emerging markets does show signs of stabilizing as in the forecast, perhaps unwinding some of the flight-to-quality effects that Treasury yields now reflect.  The Committee might favor the quarter-point tightening of alternative C if it viewed the updrift in underlying inflation in the staff forecast as unacceptable.

Given the current high levels of resource utilization, the Committee might believe that delay would only raise the odds that greater, probably more wrenching, policy tightening will be required later. (25) Tighter policy at this meeting, perhaps involving a move in the federal funds 4 percent as under alternative C, would catch domestic and international markets unawares.

The staff outlook, which assumes the maintenance of the unchanged federal funds rate of alternative B, projects that M2 and M3 will grow at rates of about 4-1/4 percent and 7 percent respectively over the third and fourth quarters, considerably below their pace so far this year, and that the growth of domestic nonfinancial debt will edge down a notch.

Maintenance of the slightly higher short-term interest rates of alternative C would lower these growth rates only slightly over this year and still leave both M2 and M3 above their annual ranges.
