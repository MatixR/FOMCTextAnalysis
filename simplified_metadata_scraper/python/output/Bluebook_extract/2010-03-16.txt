Alternative A notes that the deterioration in the labor market is abating but points to prospects for a subpar recovery in the absence of further monetary stimulus.

Alternative B suggests that the labor market is stabilizing and states that the pace of recovery is likely to be moderate.  Alternative C indicates that the economy is expanding and that the labor market is beginning to stabilize and concludes that a sustainable recovery is now under way.

Alternatives A and B each indicate that substantial resource slack continues to restrain cost pressures, that longer-term inflation expectations remain stable, and that as a consequence inflation is likely to be subdued for some time.  Alternative B could include an additional sentence—shown in brackets—stating the Committee’s expectation that “over time and with appropriate monetary policy, inflation will run at rates consistent with price stability.   Alternative C points out the recent modest pickup in headline inflation due to energy prices, while noting that underlying inflation pressures remain muted; this alternative also states that the Committee “will adjust the stance of monetary policy as necessary over time to ensure that 12 All three alternatives note that the TALF is scheduled to close on June 30 for loans backed by new-issue CMBS and on March 31 for loans backed by all other types of collateral.

Alternatives A and B indicate—as in recent FOMC statements—that the Committee expects the funds rate to remain exceptionally low “for an extended period.   Alternative C modifies that forward guidance by substituting the phrase “for some time” and could also include the modifier “at least through the end of the second quarter.

Alternative A announces that an additional purchased during the second quarter—roughly the same pace of purchases as in the first quarter—and indicates that the Committee will be continuing to evaluate its purchases of securities, thereby leaving the door open to further purchases should circumstances warrant.  Alternatives B and C do not make reference to the possibility of further purchases of securities but instead indicate that the Committee will employ its policy tools “as necessary to promote economic recovery and price stability.

Alternatives A and B do not refer to the Federal Reserve’s exit strategy, whereas provide overviews of key elements of that strategy.

Both versions of Alternative C put additional emphasis on the prospects for policy tightening by stating that the Committee will monitor the economic outlook and financial developments “in determining the timing and sequence of its measures for policy firming.

THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE B  If policymakers expect the pace of economic recovery to be moderate and  inflation to be subdued for some time, and if they judge that the potential benefits of  further large-scale asset purchases would not outweigh the costs, then the Committee  might choose to finish its securities purchases while reiterating that the federal funds  rate is likely to remain exceptionally low for an extended period, as in Alternative B. Committee participants may see data releases and financial market developments over the intermeeting period as broadly consistent with the outlook embedded in their January projections; that is, like the staff, they may have made only modest revisions to their forecasts for economic activity and inflation.

The financial market reaction to a statement like that of Alternative B would likely be muted.

Thus, the  adoption of a statement along the lines of that proposed in Alternative B would likely result in little change in bond yields, equity prices, or the foreign exchange value of the dollar.

THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE C  If policymakers are confident that a sustainable economic recovery is now   under way and see substantial upside risks to the medium-term inflation outlook in  the absence of appropriate monetary policy adjustments, then the Committee might  choose to issue a statement suggesting a somewhat shorter period over which  monetary conditions are likely to remain extraordinarily accommodative, as in  Alternative C.  In particular, if members anticipate that policy tightening is not likely to be necessary this spring but might well be appropriate over the summer, they could modify the forward guidance given in recent statements by indicating that exceptionally low levels of the funds rate are likely to be warranted “for some time, at least through the end of the second quarter.

The draft  statement for Alternative C does not announce any changes in the Federal Reserve’s management of its securities holdings and indicates an expectation that asset sales will be gradual and will not be initiated until after policy firming has begun.

In contrast,  Alternative C´ states that the Federal Reserve will be redeeming all maturing Treasury securities and points to the possibility that gradual asset sales could commence fairly soon.

By contrast, the phrase “at least until the end of the second quarter” in Alternative C may be seen as indicating that the Committee’s expectation of exceptionally low rates extends only a few more months while at the same time suggesting that the Committee sees the likelihood of policy firming within that interval as quite low.

The adoption of a statement like that of Alternative C would surprise financial market participants.

Longer-term yields would likely rise even further in response to a statement like   Alternative C´.

THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE A   If meeting participants are concerned about prospects for a subpar economic  recovery and judge that additional monetary stimulus would help improve the outlook  for economic activity and inflation, then they might wish to extend the Federal  Reserve’s agency MBS purchase program and reiterate that the federal funds rate is  likely to remain exceptionally low for an extended period, as in Alternative A.  This alternative would entail an additional $150 billion of agency MBS purchases during the second quarter, implying a purchase rate of around $10 billion per week—roughly equal to the average pace of purchases over the past several months.

A statement like Alternative A would come as a surprise to financial market participants, who appear to anticipate that the Federal Reserve’s LSAP program will be completed on schedule at the end of this month.

The baseline scenario corresponds to Alternative B in this Bluebook.

We also present a  projection for Alternative A, in which agency MBS purchases are increased by 1.

We do not present balance sheet projections for Alternative C in this Bluebook, because the Committee is continuing to evaluate its strategy for asset sales and the use of other reserve draining tools.

The announced LSAP purchases in  Alternative B and Alternative C are the same, so the baseline projections for assets and reserve balances can serve as a reference for Alternative C.

ASSETS  Asset Purchases   The baseline scenario, corresponding to Alternative B, incorporates large-scale asset roughly in line with those that have been announced.

In the scenario corresponding to Alternative A, the Committee increases its purchases of 1.

Projections for Alternative C are not presented in this Bluebook, because the Committee has not yet specified a detailed strategy for asset sales or the use of other reserve draining tools.

The announced LSAP purchases in Alternative B and Alternative C are the same, so the baseline projections for assets and reserves can serve as a reference for Alternative C.

Reserve balances peaked in February 2010 rapidly in the baseline scenario than in Alternative A, reserve balances fall back to by the end of the forecast horizon in both scenarios.
