The expected deceleration reflects the lagged effects of the tightening of money market conditions this summer and the reduction in transactions demand for money associated with the projected slowing of nominal GNP growth in the months ahead.  Under alternative B, M-1 in October would be considerably above the level implied by the upper end of the Committee's stated 1½ to 4½ percent growth range for the QIV '78 to QIV '79 period, as shown in the upper Alternative Levels and Growth Rates for Key Monetary Aggregates M-1 1/ Alt.

With the Federal funds rate unchanged and no significant decline expected in other money market rates, adoption of Alternative B should in itself have no substantial impact on the value of the dollar in exchange markets.

With the Federal funds rate unchanged and no significant decline expected in other money market rates, adoption of Alternative B should in itself have no substantial impact on the value of the dollar in exchange markets.  Alternative A calls for a decline in the Federal funds rate to the midpoint of a 10 to 11 percent range, and would be associated with ranges for M-1 and M-2 of 5 to 9 and 8 to 12 percent, respectively.

The anticipated decline in interest rates under alternative A is likely to be associated with only a slight easing of mortgage markets, especially since short-term interest rates would not be expected to decline sufficiently to restore the differential on MMC's favoring thrift institutions.  Alternative C involves an increase in the Federal funds rate to the midpoint of an 11½ to 12¼ percent range and would tend to exert more restraint on the monetary aggregates over the months ahead than alternative B.

While some tightening in the System's funds rate objective may still be built into the current level of rates, a rise in the funds rate of the dimensions contemplated by alternative C would be expected to trigger further increasesin market rates.
