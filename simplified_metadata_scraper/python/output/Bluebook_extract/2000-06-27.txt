The persistence of these labor market pressures, along with the pass through of the recent surge in the price of oil and further increases in non-oil import prices, is expected to push core PCE inflation from 1-1/2 percent over the last four quarters to 2-1/4 percent in 2001 and higher thereafter. (18) If the Committee is not sure that inflation pressures will intensify going forward, then it might want to consider leaving the stance of monetary policy unchanged at this meeting, as under alternative B. Economic growth in the second quarter appears to have slowed to a rate roughly consistent with its potential even though the full effects of the earlier rise in interest rates and flattening of equity prices have not yet worked their way through the pipeline.

Bond and equity prices would be expected to fall as investors came to anticipate additional Federal Reserve tightening. (20) If the Committee is instead concerned that the odds of rising inflation are still elevated, as in the staff forecast, a further firming of policy of 25 basis points at this meeting could be warranted, as under alternative C. Indications of slower expansion are still tentative, the level of resource utilization remains quite high, and some of the earlier financial restraint has been unwound by the recent rally in bond and equity markets.

If so, the unemployment rate consistent with stable inflation would be rising, even if productivity is continuing to accelerate. (21) Market participants would be surprised by the 25 basis point tightening of alternative C. Short-term interest rates would rise immediately by almost 1 point.
