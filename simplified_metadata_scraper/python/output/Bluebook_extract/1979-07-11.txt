The midpoint of the 3 to 6 percent proposed alternative B range plus the revised, lower ATS effect also is equal to an M-1 growth adjusted for ATS effects of about 6 percent.

On the other hand, it can be argued that the considerable uncertainties about the current money-income relationship suggest the desirability of maintaining the existing width of the ranges.  Alternatives A and C, respectively, represent somewhat easier and tighter policies with regard to the aggregates.

Alternative A is indexed by measured M-1 growth centered around 5 percent (6-1/2 per-  and alternative C by measured .

For alternatives A and B, the M-2 ranges are the same because the lower interest rates under alternative A more promptly open the ceiling rate differential on MMCs favoring thrift institutions, thereby diverting funds from commercial bank time deposits to thrift deposits.

Thus, alternative B' essentially repre- sents continuation of growth in M-1 at about 6 percent: the midpoint of the alternative B' range is 5 per cent, and we have assumed that ATS effects retard M-1 growth by only about 1 percent.

Alternatives A' and C' are indexed by measured M-1 growth of 6 percent and 4 percent, respectively, or 7 and 5 percent after adjusting for assumed ATS effects.

Thus, they assume that alternative B for 1979 is followed by 1/ If the court decision does become effective, measured M-1 growth in the QIV '79 to QIV '80 period could be increased by 1 to 2 percentage points, depending on how much of the funds shifted from demand deposits to ATS accounts returned to demand deposits.

On the other hand, if the Congress authorizes nationwide NOW accounts, the staff estimates that measured M-1 growth in the QIV '79 to QIV '80 period could be retarded by as much as 3 to 4 percentage points rather than the 1 percentage point if ATS accounts are extended. alternative B' for 1980, A by A', and C by C', Under alternative B/B'--an unchanged policy with respect to the aggregates--the Federal funds rate is expected to decline somewhat by early 1980 (to a level of around 9-1/2 percent), assuming economic activity weakens about as projected.

The dotted line in the chart also shows annual growth rates needed from the actual June level to reach targeted midpoint levels by the fourth quarter of 1979 under the current longer-run range and proposed alternative B; these growth rates 2 percent, respectively.

Growth at the midpoint of the alternative II range would bring M-2 to about the mid- and also proposed alternative B) longer-run growth range by August.

As in other recent months, large- denomination time deposits are not expected to contribute to growth in M-2 as banks continue to supplement their demand and small denomination time deposits growth with Eurodollars and RPs.

Such an approach to policy appears most consistent with a reduction in the longer-run growth range for the aggregates, as  alternative C/C'.

Such a move appears most consistent with the higher longer-run growth rates for the  alternative A/A'.

It would not necessarily be inconsistent with longer-run alternative B, under which interest rates are expected to begin declining later in the summer or in early fall.
