Alternatives A and B note that economic activity has continued to pick up, while Alternative C states that a recovery is under way.

Alternatives A and B, however, note that household spending continues to be constrained by a variety of factors.  Alternatives B and C point to financial market conditions that have become more supportive of economic growth.

In contrast,  Alternative A indicates that the recovery will be sluggish and slack in resource utilization will decline quite slowly absent further policy action.

As in the November  statement, Alternatives A and B note that the Committee expects that inflation will remain subdued for some time because resource slack is likely to dampen cost pressures and because longer-term inflation expectations remain stable.

Under Alternative A, the Committee would increase its purchases of 1.

Under Alternative B, the statement would be very similar to that for the November meeting.

Alternatives A and B maintain the forward guidance from November that the Committee anticipates maintaining exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period, with this expectation explicitly conditioned on low rates of resource utilization, subdued inflation trends, and stable inflation expectations.  Alternative A specifies that the exceptionally low level of the federal funds rate anticipated is the current 0 to ¼ percent target range.

Under Alternative C, the amount of agency MBS purchases would be reduced to 1.

Alternative C changes the forward guidance by indicating that the Committee anticipates “low” levels of the federal funds rate “for some time.

Alternative A indicates that the Committee will continue to employ a wide range of policy tools to promote economic recovery and price stability.  Alternatives B and C remove the reference to the use of a wide range of policy tools and note that the Committee and the Board of Governors anticipate that a number of liquidity programs will expire on February 1 and that amounts auctioned through the Term Auction Facility will be scaled back further over the first quarter of 2010.

THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE B  If policymakers believe that completion of the Committee’s large-scale asset  purchase programs as previously announced as well as the maintenance of  exceptionally low levels of the funds rate for an extended period is a reasonable  course of action given current economic circumstances, the Committee might adopt  the policy actions and language of Alternative B.  Such a choice might be appealing if the Committee shares the staff’s assessment that incoming economic data and recent financial market developments are consistent with sustained but moderate growth in output and subdued inflation over coming quarters.

The proposed statement in  Alternative B provides language to describe that development.

Market participants generally appear to expect a statement along the lines of  Alternative B, so the announcement of this action would likely elicit only modest reaction in financial markets.

THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE C  If policymakers viewed the incoming data as indicating that the recovery is gaining  strength and that inflation pressures could begin to mount before long, they might  wish to trim the size of the LSAPs and suggest in the policy statement that the  Committee may need to raise the federal funds rate target in the not-too-distant  future, as in Alternative C.  Under this alternative, the Committee would reduce its total purchases of agency MBS and agency debt compared with the previously announced amounts and bring the LSAPs to a more rapid close.

The  statement for Alternative C would use the same language as proposed for Alternative B regarding the likely expiration of most of the liquidity facilities.

Participants might be particularly attracted to Alternative C if they saw greater upside risks to inflation and inflation expectations than does the staff.

As in Alternative B, the Committee may also view it as appropriate to affirm that the various liquidity facilities will be winding down.

The adoption of Alternative C would greatly surprise market participants and lead them to reevaluate, perhaps significantly, their beliefs regarding the Committee’s intentions.

Importantly, MBS and primary mortgage rates could well move  sharply higher; Federal Reserve MBS purchases currently exceed the pace of new  issues significantly, and the adoption of Alternative C would imply a dramatic scaling back of those purchases.

Given the strong reaction that curtailing the purchases of securities might  provoke, the Committee might prefer to consider combining the forward guidance on  the federal funds rate path in Alternative C with the LSAP purchases proposed in Alternative B.

Another possible combination is to  reduce the LSAPs as in Alternative C and maintain the forward guidance language from Alternative B.

An announcement such as that in Alternative A would come as a surprise to market participants.

Alternative A does not explicitly mention the expiration of the various liquidity facilities as do the other alternatives.

While this omission would in no way preclude policymakers from letting  the facilities expire in February, participants may prefer to explicitly signal that the  Federal Reserve’s support for financial markets is winding down by including in  Alternative A the paragraph proposed on the facilities’ expiration proposed for Alternatives B and C.

The baseline scenario corresponds to  Alternative B in which agency MBS purchases of securities purchases of $175 billion are executed by the end of the first quarter of 2010.  Under Alternative A, the agency MBS purchases are increased by 1.

Under Alternative C, the 1.

For the baseline and  Alternative A scenarios, the balance sheet reaches a peak of trillion, respectively, with the peak occurring a quarter after the agency MBS LSAPs are assumed to be completed.  In Alternative C, the size of the balance sheet peaks at 2.

By the end of 2016, the size of the balance sheet  under each scenario declines to roughly $1.5 trillion.12  With respect to the level of reserve balances, the peak occurs at the end of 2009  under the baseline and Alternative C scenarios at respectively.

In contrast, under Alternative A, reserve balances do not peak until the 1.
