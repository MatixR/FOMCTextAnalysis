As noted below, the language of alternative A is quite similar to that adopted by the Committee on December 14. Alternative B, on the other hand, places primary stress on bank reserves as the operating target variable, with a money market conditions constraint in a proviso clause.

The choice of operating procedure depends in part on the Committee's relative confidence in reserves or money market conditions as bearing a more dependable relationship to bank deposit behavior.  The language proposed for alternative A is as follows: "To implement this policy, the Committee seeks to promote the degree of ease in bank reserve and money market conditions essential to greater growth in monetary aggregates [DEL: over the months ahead, while taking account of international develop- .

If such an approach were successful in moving M1 onto the path specified by the Committee as desired, the staff believes that the odds are that the funds rate would need to be raised in the ensuing weeks in order to keep growth in M1 around the target rate, particularly if a 6 per cent target path for M1 is adopted but also perhaps under an 8 per cent target.  The proposed language for alternative B follows: "To implement this policy, [DEL: the Committee seeks to promote the degree of ease in bank reserve and money market conditions essential to] SYSTEM OPEN MARKET OPERATIONS UNTIL THE NEXT MEETING OF THE COMMITTEE SHALL BE CONDUCTED WITH A VIEW TO SUPPLYING THE BANK RESERVES NEEDED TO SUPPORT greater growth in monetary aggregates; [DEL: over the months ahead, while taking account of international developments] PROVIDED THAT MONEY MARKET CONDITIONS DO NOT FLUCTUATE OVER AN UNDULY WIDE RANGE.

Since it will take time for the market and banks to adjust to the new procedures, with transitional uncertainties reflected in, for example, greater bank demand for excess reserves, reserve targets for the period immediately ahead would have to be flexible enough to allow for a potential enlargement of excess reserves. (11) Since effects on money market conditions would be a secondary consideration in the Manager's operations under alternative B, the Committee need not prejudge the direction of the funds rate, as would be the case under alternative A.
