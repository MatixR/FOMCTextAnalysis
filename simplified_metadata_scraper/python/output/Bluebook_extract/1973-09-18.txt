The fact that RPD's are growing around the mid-point of their range of tolerance, even though the money supply aggregates are low, stems from the Committee's decision to reduce (by two per centage points) the whole range of tolerance for RPD's relative to that shown in the Bluebook for alternative B, while dropping only the low ends of the ranges for M1 and M2 .

This path, extended to March 1974, is shown in the chart on the following page. (8) The assumption of unchanged money market conditions is incorporated in the specifications presented here as alternative C. This alternative includes a growth rate for M1 over the fourth and first quarters combined of about 3 per cent.

C 4-1/4 14-1/2--16-1/2 -1/2--1-1/2 4-1/2--6-1/2 10--/ I  Alternative A specifications include a 6-month growth rate for M I of 6 per cent, the rate required to reach the longer-run 5-1/4 per cent path by March.

d 31,967 32,371 33,219 33,671 34,024 that a return to the 5-1/4 per cent path by the end of the first quarter would require easing to a degree that might lead to a subsequent unduly sharp expansion in money.  Alternative B falls in between A and C in terms of growth in the aggregates.

It also implies a smaller drop in interest rates than does alternative A. The 6-month growth rate for M1 under this alternative is 2 per cent at an annual rate.

Long-term rates would probably also regain part of their recent declines.  Given the money market conditions of alternative C--indicated by a Federal funds rate in a 10 to 11 per cent range--growth in consumer-type time and savings deposits at banks would be expected to slow noticeably as the realignment of consumer financial asset holdings to the new rate structure tapers. M2 under alternative C may be expected to rise at about a 5-1 cent annual rate in the September-October period.

The market interest rates decline envisaged under alternative A and B would lead to greater growth in consumer-type time deposits than under C and hence to somewhat greater growth in M2 .

The position of thrift institutions would ease, of course,  alternatives A and B.

As will be noted, alternatives A and C refer to growth rates in the thus far this year.
