Last day of month not available Prospective developments (8) If the Committee wishes to continue with a policy that encompasses financial flows and credit conditions consistent with a 5 per cent trend rate of growth for the money supply, the following language for alternative A): To implement this policy, [DEL: while taking account of persisting market uncertainties; liquidity strains; and the forthcoming Treasury financing;] the Committee seeks to promote moderate growth in money and bank credit over the months ahead, WHILE TAKING ACCOUNT OF PERSISTING LIQUIDITY PROBLEMS AND allowing [DEL: for a possible] BANK CREDIT GROWTH TO REFLECT A continued shift of credit flows from market to banking channels.

Nevertheless, with market rates reduced, total time deposits would be expected to grow somewhat more rapidly than under alternative A. As a result of lower domestic interest rates and strong inflows of funds, banks would probably reduce Euro-dollar borrowings further, although whether individual banks will permit such borrowings to fall below their reserve-free base is not at all clear.
