Under alternative B, federal funds would continue to trade around 8 percent in association with an initial specification for adjustment plus 500 million.

Under alterna- tive A, the drop in the federal funds rate to 7-1/2 percent would accom- pany a reduction in borrowed reserves to roughly $450 million, while the 2 percent federal funds rate under alternative C would correspond to 550 million in borrowing.

A Alt Growth from June to September M2 4-1/2 4 3-1/2 M3 2-3/4 2-1/2 2-1/4 M1 4-1/2 4 3-1/2 Growth from Q4'89 to September M2 4-1/4 4 4 M3 2 1-3/4 1-3/4 M1 4-1/4 4 4 Associated federal 5-1/2 to 6-1/2 to funds rate ranges 9-1/2 6 to 10 10-1/2 (11) Market participants no longer seem to be expecting a near- term easing in policy, and short-term rates would be unlikely to move substantially on balance with federal funds remaining near 8 percent under alternative B. Absent a significant change in oil prices, long-term interest rates may stay around recent elevated levels.

Later in the quarter, the RTC is expected to undertake a spate of resolutions, and the renewal of transfers of deposits to banks should result in additional abrogations of brokered deposit contracts and more downward pressure on offering rates. Quarterly average growth of M2 would be held to only 2-1/2 percent, and M2 velocity this quarter would increase at a 3 percent rate, the same as in the second quarter; the increases in velocity in both quarters are about 2-1/2 percentage points larger than projected by M2 demand models.4  Under alternative B, M3 over August and September is pro- jected to expand at a 3-1/2 percent average rate, implying growth of 2-1/2 percent from June to September.

M2, and to a lesser extent M3, would be a bit stronger under alternative A than with an unchanged funds rate; the staff projects growth rates from June to September of 4-1/2 percent for M2 and 2-3/4 percent for M3.

Under alternative C, a considerable backup in short-term rates would appear likely, as a monetary policy tightening would fly in the face of market expectations.
