Alternative A assumes that such a 4½ percent growth line is reached relatively soon-by September; it therefore would also assume a slowdown in M-1A growth to 4½ percent after September.

It assumes an 8¼ percent M-1A growth rate for June-September which, if continued through December, will yield growth of 4½ percent over the year. Alternative C is based on a slower long-run growth of M-A of 3 percent from QIV '79 to QIV '80, which would be more consistent with longer-run Alternative Levels and Growth Rates for Key Monetary Aggregates M-1A M-1B Alt.

Under alternative C, M-1A growth would be 6 percent from June to September, and growth would need to continue at that rate in the fourth quarter.

Under alternative C, M-1A growth would be 6 percent from June to September, and growth would need to continue at that rate in the fourth quarter.  Of the three short-run alternatives, alternative B would probably have the least effect on market rates of interest over the forth- coming intermeeting period.

If, however, the public's transactions demand for money remains on the low side relative to GNP, upward interest rate pressures could be quite minimal.  The specifications of alternative B call for a considerable slowing in M-2 from its May-June pace.

banks to their foreign branches in response to relatively strong credit demands in Eurodollar markets. (19) To achieve the growth in the aggregates specified under alternative B, total reserves would have to expand at about an 8¼ percent annual rate from June to September.

Assuming a level of member bank borrowings (excluding special borrowings) of about $50 to $100 million, nonborrowed reserves would expand at about an 8 percent.annual rate.  Alternative A, which is designed to hit the 4½ percent path for M-1A by September, calls for a 10 percent rate of growth of that aggregate from June to September, followed by a sharp slowing to 4½ percent in the September to December period.

Staff projections suggest that short-term rates would have to rise sharply by late summer or early fall to lower growth in the aggregates if the midpoints of the longer-run targets for the year are to be achieved.  Alternative C contemplates a 6 percent rate of growth in M-1A from June to September and continuation of that rate for the balance of the year in order to achieve a 3 percent growth in that aggregate from QIV '79 to QIV '80.

The policy stance of alternative C would intensify the recent weakness in money and capital markets, and interest rates would be expected to rise throughout the maturity spectrum.
