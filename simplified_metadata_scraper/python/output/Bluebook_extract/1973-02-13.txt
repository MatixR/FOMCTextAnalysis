Moving down into a 4--5 per cent growth rate range for M1 would likely involve a tightening of the money market over the next few alternative C), and moving up to a 6--7 per cent rate would probably .

The range for alternative C is meant to indicate, however, that the staff would expect the funds rate to move up from prevailing levels to close to the top of the range shown between now and the next Committee meeting, as reserve growth is constrained. Consequently, in alternative A, a movement of the funds rate down through the range shown would be anticipated.

If the recent improved market atmosphere continues, distribution of the long note may be readily accomplished. (15) A tightening of the money market, such as might accompany alternative C, would probably lead to substantial upward adjustments in both short- and long-term interest rates.

Retention of the reference to credit market developments is proposed only for alternative C, the only alternative that contemplates a significant tightening of the money market.
