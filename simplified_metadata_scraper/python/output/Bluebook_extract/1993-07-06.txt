Under alternative B, federal funds would remain in a trading range around 3 percent, in association with an initial allowance for adjustment plus seasonal borrowing of $250 million, an increase of $50 million from the current allowance to accommodate the normal pattern in seasonal borrowing at this time of the year. Under alternative A, the funds rate would be reduced to the area of 2-1/2 percent, either by choosing a $225 million borrowing allowance or by cutting the discount rate 1/2 percentage point, to 2-1/2 percent, while retaining a $250 million borrowing allowance. Under alternative C, which could be imple- mented through a $275 million borrowing allowance, the funds rate would 2 percent.

Consequently, market interest rates would not respond initially to the implementation of alternative B. Rates would tend to remain near current levels or edge lower over subsequent weeks should data on economic activity and prices prove to be about in line with the staff projection and should the Congress continue to make progress on passage of a deficit reduction package.

The exchange value of the dollar is expected to fluctuate around recently established levels; staff forecasts for continued monetary policy easing abroad are broadly consistent with expectations already embedded in interest and exchange rates. (26) The immediate tightening of reserve market conditions under alternative C is not built into financial market quotes and would induce a rise in short-term market interest rates that about matched the 2 percentage point increase in the federal funds rate.

Given this damped interest rate response, even if the money market conditions of alternative A continued through year- end, M2 growth over the year would still be only 1-1/4 percent, notice- ably below the 2 percent lower bound of the Committee's current annual range.
