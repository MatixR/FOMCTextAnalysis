Short-term rates under alterna- tive B would be expected to change little between now and the next Committee meeting, although they could rise a bit toward the end of the period, reflecting mid-April tax date pressures. (9) The staff continues to believe that interest rates will have to rise later in the year--perhaps beginning in late spring--if a 6 per cent rate of growth in M1 from QIV '75 to QIV '76 is to be achieved. Under alternative B, we have assumed that the Federal funds rate will average about 6½ per cent in the fourth quarter of 1976 .

Under these assumptions, M2 growth over the period from QIV '75 to QIV '76 would be about 9¾ per cent--somewhat above the mid-point of the Committee's one-year range.  Alternatives A and C call for an easing and tightening of the money market, respectively, in the period before the next 1/ See appendix table IV for long-run projections of the Federal funds rate.

Through the summer months, alternative A would encourage somewhat more growth in M1 and M2, and alternative C less.

Through the summer months, alternative A would encourage somewhat more growth in M1 and M2, and alternative C less.than  alternative B. But if M1 and M2 are to grow over the year.

But if M1 and M2 are to grow over the year QIV '75 to QIV '76 at rates near the mid-points of their respective one- year ranges, the near-term declines in interest rates anticipated under alternative A would be short-lived, and rates would begin rising, perhaps by late spring. We have assumed that under alternative A the funds rate would average about 6¾ per cent in the fourth quarter of 1976.

On the other hand, the greater near-term restraint of alternative C would mean that more monetary expansion would be required later in 1976 to achieve the Committee's longer-run targets.

Nevertheless, if the money market remains stable--as is assumed under alternative B--long-term interest rates are likely to remain around current levels in view of the strong institutional investor interest in bonds that has developed since the beginning of the year.
