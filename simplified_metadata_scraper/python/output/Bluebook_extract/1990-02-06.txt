Alternative B involves federal funds continuing to trade in the 8-1/4 percent vicinity, in association with adjustment plus sea- 150 million.

The 7-3 ternative A appears roughly consistent with $100 million of borrowing, 4 percent funds rate of alternative C would be accompanied 200 million of borrowing.

Under alternative B, adjustment credit may average only $75 million, not far above the frictional amount, as the reluctance of depositories to tap the window for such credit is rein- forced by questions about the general health of the banking industry that are raised by developments in the real estate and LBO lending areas and by the problems of the Bank of New England.

Under alternative B, the continuation of the federal funds rate around 8-1/4 percent would accord with current market expectations for the near term.

However, without a surprise in macroeconomic fundamentals or monetary policy, only limited scope for a flattening of the Treasury yield curve seems in prospect. Increases in bond yields since the last FOMC meeting have restored the more typical upward-sloping term structure, apparently on the basis of expectations that federal funds trading not far from current levels will be consistent with continued economic expansion and underlying inflation persisting at its recent pace.  Growth in M2 under alternative B is expected to strengthen in February and March from its January pace, owing largely to a rebound in transaction deposits.

M2 would continue to outpace nominal GNP in the first quarter, implying a contraction of its velocity at a 1-1/2 percent rate.  Under alternative B, M3 would grow at a 3-1 from December to March.

In the federal sector, borrowing quickens over the balance of the quarter, while the average growth of the overall debt of the other sectors should about maintain the estimated January pace.  The policy easing embodied in alternative A, with the funds rate moving to 7-3/4 percent, would induce a nearly comparable decline in other short-term interest rates.

M3 would rise at a 4 percent rate over the two months, rapidly enough to engender a December-to-March growth rate of 3-3/4 per- cent and place this aggregate a little above its 3-1/2 percent tentative lower bound. (26) By contrast, the 1/2 percentage point increase in the funds rate under alternative C would restrain December-to-March growth of M2 and M3 to 6-1/2 and 3-1/4 percent, respectively, positioning them just below the upper bound and at the lower bound of their respective tentative ranges by March.
