Non- borrowed reserves would decline at about a 30 percent annual rate, if borrowing were set at around $3 billion on the ground that a rise in the funds rate of around 3 percentage points is likely to develop. 1/ Not-shift adjusted M1-B declined at a 6¾ percent annual rate in May- June following a 25 percent rise in April. (12) Continuation of the short-run policy toward M1 adopted  alternative A in the table below.

This option would bring M1 into the upper half of the 2½ to 5½ percent longer- run range by March, assuming this long-run range is based, as has been the case in the past, on the actual average level of M1 in the fourth quarter of the previous year.1/ The risk of sharp interest rate fluctua- tions that might be associated with alternative A, accompanied by potentially adverse implications for economic activity and financial markets, might be reduced by extending beyond the first quarter the horizon over which the Committee targets the return of M1 to within the tentative 2½ to 5½ percent longer-run range--as is contemplated by the three other alternatives in the table.

This approach, like alternative A, would be consistent with growth for 1982 at around the midpoint of the longer-run range. Alternative C, which involves about a 2½ percent annual rate of growth over the last two months of the current quarter, is designed to reach the upper end of the M1 range by September.

Alternative C, which involves about a 2½ percent annual rate of growth over the last two months of the current quarter, is designed to reach the upper end of the M1 range by September. Such an approach would be more consistent with growth for the year in the upper half of the longer-run range.  Alternative D specifies a 4 percent annual rate of growth for February and March.

With such a rebasing of the 2½ to 5½ percent longer-run range for 1982, the specifications of alternative D if extended for the year would bring M1 into the upper half of the rebased range by the fourth quarter of this year. If alternative C were adopted in conjunction with a rebasing of the long-run range, growth by the fourth quarter would be around the midpoint of the range.

Given the slowing in M1 growth that is targeted for the balance of the year, the staff expects that M2 growth over the year as a whole will fall within its longer-run range for alternatives A, B, and C, and will be at the top of the range under the more expansive alternative D.

Such behavior would be consistent with the unchanged income-velocity of M2 over the past two years.  Alternative B calls for growth in Ml at about a 1 percent annual rate over the two months January to March, a considerable decelera- tion from the rapid pace of the previous three months.

Indeed, even with virtually no money growth over the balance of the quarter, the velocity of M1 would decline in the quarter at a postwar record annual rate of about 9 percent.  The alternative B specifications would entail little change in total reserves over the period from January to March.

Residential mortgage rates are likely to remain near their current advanced levels, and this may work to restrain demand for mortgage commitments--the supply of which might also be constrained by cautious behavior of thrifts in face of continued operating losses.  Alternative C, which calls for growth of M1 at about a 2½ percent annual rate from January to March, would involve an increase in total reserves over the balance of the quarter at about a 2 percent 1/ Such an interest rate is consistent with the near-term financial condi- tions assumed in the Greenbook GNP projection.

The 3-month bill rate would likely decline from present levels to around 12 percent or a bit lower as expectations of further monetary ease tend to develop. Bond yields may edge down from current levels, inducing a pick-up in bond issuance from recent depressed levels.  Alternative D, involving a 4 percent rate of growth of M1 on average in February and March, would require a growth in total reserves at about a 4 percent annual rate.

The move ment in implied borrowing represents deviations in total reserves from target as well as any compensation for misses in nonborrowed reserves from target in earlier weeks of the intermeeting period. 2/ Total and nonborrowed reserves paths adjusted downward by $111 million due to change affecting the reserves multiplier. 3/ Nonborrowed reserves path adjusted downward an additional $89 million to offset the unusually large borrowing in the January 6 holiday week. 4/ Total and nonborrowed reserves paths adjusted downward by $37 million due to changes affecting the reserves multiplier. 5/ Total and nonborrowed reserves paths adjusted downward by $2 million due to changes affecting the reserves multiplier. 6/ Nonborrowed reserves multiplier adjusted downward by an additional $187 million due to strength in total reserves. 7/ Total and nonborrowed reserves paths adjusted downward by $75 million due to changes affecting the reserves multiplier. 8/ Total and nonborrowed reserves paths adjusted downward by $108 million due to changes affecting the reserves multiplier. 9/ Total and nonborrowed reserves paths adjusted downward by $28 million to smooth the transition to the forthcoming reserve period. NOTE: The intermeeting period consisted of the 6 weeks from the statement week ended December 30 to the statement week ended February 3.
