Alternative C would set an RPD growth path designed to slow 2 per cent annual rate by the fourth quarter.

Alternative B would move less aggressively to slow growth in the aggregates--moderating the ex- pansion of M1 to an annual rate of 7-1/2 per cent in the fourth quarter and 6 per cent in the first.

Under this approach, the response of interest rates would be less marked than under Alternative C; the Federal funds rate would be expected to fluctuate 4 per cent, about 50 basis points above its recent level.

Under this approach, the response of interest rates would be less marked than under Alternative C; the Federal funds rate would be expected to fluctuate around 5-1/4 per cent, about 50 basis points above its recent level. Alternative A would achieve the least moderation in M1 growth, and would be associated with little change in money market conditions.

Under this alternative, M 1 would be expected to grow over the fourth and first quarters combined at about a 7-1/2 per cent rate, the same rate as had been specified for the third quarter under alternative A in the last bluebook.

until October, but some financing may be needed in September, possibly close to the time when the System will also be selling Treasury issues to absorb the excess reserves released by the combined effects of changes in Regulation D  Even under alternative A, although little change would be anticipated in the Federal funds rate, the 3-month Treasury bill rate might rise from its recently depressed rate by 50 basis points or so during the fourth quarter, and very likely will advance further in early 1973.

Upward pressure on short-term rates, of course, would be considerably greater under alternative B-- and more so under C.

Even under alternative A a moderate slowing of inflows to accounts is expected to occur; under alternative B the higher level of short-term market rates would have a more noticeable effect.

The money market rates associated with alternative C would reduce inflows still further, and given present rate ceilings, they could also make all but the highest yielding longer- term accounts non-competitive with market instruments by the time of growth in M2 over the fourth quarter is expected to slow progressively more than M1 under alternatives B and C.

As shown in the table on page 8, growth in M2 over the fourth quarter is expected to slow progressively more than M1 under alternatives B and C.  Under alternatives B or C, banks could be expected to take a more aggressive stance in the CD market, as inflows of other time deposits decelerate and as business loan demands rise.

The latitude for bank issuance of CD's should be a major factor tending to sustain the rate of growth of the credit proxy even under the firmer money market conditions associated with alternatives B or C.

The latitude for bank issuance of CD's should be a major factor tending to sustain the rate of growth of the credit proxy even under the firmer money market conditions associated with alternatives B or C.  Under alternative A, interest rates in longer-term markets would probably remain relatively stable until late in the year.

However, the increases in money market rates associated with alternative B could produce an earlier advance in long-term rates, and under alternative C the upward movement in long rates would undoubtedly be both large and prompt.

They might be associated with the correspondingly lettered patterns of growth in the aggregates described in the preceding section.  Alternative A.

Retention of this reference is proposed only in alternative A, since that is the only policy course herein described under which there is believed to be any significant possibility for short-term rate declines.

It is proposed to delete the reference to capital market developments in alternative A, since generally stable long-term rates are foreseen under that alternative.

It is proposed to delete the reference to capital market developments in alternative A, since generally stable long-term rates are foreseen under that alternative. Retention of this reference in alternative B could be construed, as in past directives, to call for the types of operations best calculated to minimize upward pressure on long-term rates. In alternative C the same language could be interpreted as calling for adopting Desk operations as necessary to facilitate orderly market adjustments to the higher long-term rate levels foreseen.
