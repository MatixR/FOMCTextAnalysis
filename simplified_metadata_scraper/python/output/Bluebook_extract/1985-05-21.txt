B 6-1/2 5-1/4 6-3/4 6-1/2 7-1/2 5-1/2 to 9-1/2  The specifications of alternative B involve slightly faster M1 growth over the three-month March-to-June period than adopted at the last Cmmittee meeting, but much slower growth in the broader 1/ Average growth in May and June, given actual growth in April, needed to hit March FOMC paths.

Total reserves might increase at a 6 percent annual rate over May and June under alternative B, with nonborrowed reserves increasing at 8 percent rate.

By June, M1 under alternative B would be about or 0.

By June, M1 under alternative B would be about $1-3/4 billion (or 0.3 percent) above the upper parallel line of the band drawn from the fourth quarter end points of the 4 to 7 percent range for 1985, with growth from QIV '84 to June at around an 8-1/2 percent annual rate.  Growth of M2 and M3 under alternative B would be expected to pick up in May and June to a 6-1/2 to 7-1/2 percent annual rate on average.

Mortgage borrowing is expected to continue at about the first-quarter pace, but consumer credit growth likely will moderate somewhat as spending on consumer durables increases more slowly.  As compared with alternative B, alternative C involves tighter reserve conditions thought more likely to be consistent with constraining M1 growth to the 6 percent path for March to June chosen by the Comittee at its last meeting.

The dollar would probably rise on foreign exchange markets.  Alternative A contemplates lesser restraint on reserve conditions than B.

On that basis, alternative B is suggested as consistent with maintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions, although the associated funds rate is likely to be lower than during the past several weeks owing to the cut in the discount rate.
