Under alternative B, the Federal funds rate would be expected to remain unchanged over the inter- meeting period and then begin rising thereafter, reaching about 8 per cent by fall.

Under alternative C, restraint would begin earlier; thus the required upward adjustments in the funds rate over 1978 would be somewhat less.

Given the Federal funds rate assump- tion of alternative B--with the rate centered at the 6¾ per cent 1/ See Appendix I for projected Federal funds rate under each alternative.

Appendix II displays the implied velocities of M-1 and M-2 associated with each alternative. level prevailing since early January--M-1 growth over March-April is likely to be in a 4 to 9 per cent annual rate range. (10) Growth in M-2 over this period is expected to be in a 6 to 10 per cent annual rate range under alternative B. As has been the case since last fall, savings deposits at commercial banks are projected to remain essentially unchanged.

Consequently the interest- bearing component of this aggregate is projected to continue to expand at an 8 to 9 per cent seasonally adjusted annual rate. (11) The modest pace of inflows to thrift institutions can be expected to persist in March-April under alternative B. Growth of deposits at mutual savings banks and savings and loan associations, combined, may be around a 6 to 7 per cent annual rate.

Moreover, further reductions in new commitment activity and in spot purchases of mortgages from mortgage bankers and others can be expected. (12) If the Federal funds rate remains at the 6¾ per cent level contemplated under alternative B, short- and intermediate- term interest rates over the intermeeting period are likely to remain near their current levels.

Some upward rate pressures might develop as accelerating economic activity bolsters financing demands of businesses at banks and in the commercial paper market. In addition, Treasury borrowing in short- and intermediate-term markets between now and mid-April will be relatively heavy. Potential upward rate pressures in the short-term sector will tend to be offset, however, by market anticipation of the substantial pay-down of Treasury bills following the mid-April tax date. Moreover, rates on shorter-term Treasury securities could remain low relative to other market rates, should foreign central banks continue to acquire large amounts of such securities as a result of their intervention activities in foreign exchange markets.  Under alternative B, mortgage rates might rise somewhat further in the intermeeting period as thrifts adjust lending policies in response to sustained weak deposit inflows.

Furthermore, the forward calendar for tax-exempt offerings continues below the exceptional 1977 level and interest in such issues by fire and casualty insurance companies, commercial banks, and individuals are projected to remain sizable.  Alternative C contemplates an increase in the Federal funds rate to the mid-point of a 7 to 7-1/2 per cent range between now and mid-April.

Although the market is expecting some tightening of policy later this spring, an increase in the Federal funds rate over the near-term apparently is not being anticipated by market participants, given the recent moderation of growth in the monetary aggregates. The 3-month bill might move into a 6-5/8--6-3/4 per cent area, and there would be commensurate adjustment in other short-term rates. Member bank borrowing from the discount window would rise substantially, producing expectations of an upward adjustment in the discount rate. Such borrowing has been relatively low recently, and no banks are under administrative pressure at the window. (15) The sizable increase in short-term rates likely to develop under alternative C would probably be accompanied by only modest upward pressure on bond yields in the intermeeting period.

By contributing to slower deposit inflows, however, alternative C would add to near-term upward pressure on mortgage rates and increase the need for an adjustment in deposit ceiling rates.

By contributing to slower deposit inflows, however, alternative C would add to near-term upward pressure on mortgage rates and increase the need for an adjustment in deposit ceiling rates. (16) An easing of the Federal funds rate to around 6¼ per cent, as contemplated under alternative A, would be very surprising to the market in light of the weakness of the dollar in foreign exchange markets and recent indications of acceleration in the rise of wholesale and retail prices.

As suggested below, the particular language needed in the opening lines of the money market formulation would depend on the specific condi- tions sought; the three alternatives shown--calling, respectively, for somewhat easier, prevailing, and somewhat firmer money market conditions--are intended to be associated with the specifications  alternatives A, B, and C.
