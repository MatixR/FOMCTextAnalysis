A Alt Ranges for May-June M-1 4½ to 8½ 4 to 8 M-2 5 to 9 4½ to 8½ Federal funds rate 7 to 7¾ 7½ to 8¼ (Intermeeting period) (8) Growth in M-1 is expected to slow considerably over the two-month May-June period from the extraordinary April rate, partly because the temporary impact of tax-related factors should be unwinding. Under alternative A--which encompasses a range for the Federal funds rate centered on its recently prevailing level of around 7-3/8 per cent--M-1 is expected to expand in a 4 to 8 per cent annual rate range over the May-June period.

Unlike levels of M-l, the implied levels of M-2 would be generally within the longer-run ranges adopted by the Committee for this aggregate, as shown in Chart 2 on the following page.

Finally, if the dollar continues to strengthen on exchange markets, foreign official accounts might become significant net sellers of bills. (12) Long-term rates are expected to show relatively little change under the conditions of alternative A. Public offerings of corporate bonds are projected to remain moderate over the coming weeks, and State and local bond issuance should drop off markedly in late May after the effective date of the new IRS ruling with regard to sinking fund provisions of tax-exempt bond offerings.

Receptions for these offerings could be quite good, however, since dealers have distri- buted the bulk of their awards of the Treasury refunding issues and have reestablished a short position in coupon issues.  Alternative B calls for an increase in the Federal funds rate to the mid-point of a 7½ to 8¼ per cent range between now and mid-June.

Under alternative A the Federal funds rate might need to rise by fall into a range of 9 to 10 per cent--about one percentage point higher than projected last month.

It should be noted, though, that the relationship between money demand, income, and interest rates in the Board's econometric model has not generated any evidence of a further downward shift over the past five quarters.  Under either alternative A or B, growth over the quarters ahead of interest-bearing deposits subject to rate ceilings will slow more than projected last month.

Not only are market interest rates now expected to be higher, but the upward adjustment in deposit rate ceilings announced by the regulatory agencies is less  Under alternative B, restraint would be introduced earlier and, as a result, the level of the funds rate required at the end of the longer-run policy period would be somewhat less--possibly in an 8¾ to 9¾ per cent range.

The second formulation places main emphasis on money market conditions. In both formulations, variants are shown for particular phrases that are intended to be associated with the specifications discussed in  alternatives A and B.
