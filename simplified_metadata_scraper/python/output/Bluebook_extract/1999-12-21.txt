The Committee might see the heightened potential for financial dislocation at this time as sufficient reason to keep policy on hold at this meeting, choosing alternative B. Although financial markets have been much more liquid in recent weeks than many participants had anticipated earlier in the year, various indicators still suggest that trading is likely to be thin and investors unusually risk averse around year-end.

Nonetheless, the Committee might wish to contemplate the 25 basis point tightening of policy at this meeting under alternative C-- perhaps as background for selection of an asymmetric directive or even for consideration of an intermeeting move once risks associated with the century date change have faded.

As noted above, a tightening at this meeting would pose some risk of prompting financial market disruptions.  Assuming the selection of alternative B and no significantly untoward developments over year-end, some further abatement of the unusual risk aversion and demand for liquidity currently evident in markets should be apparent over the first few weeks of 2000.

From December to March, M2 and M3 are projected to grow at 4 and 3-3/4 percent annual rates, respectively under alternative B. Measured over the October-to-March period to abstract from most Y2K influences, M2 is forecast to expand at a 5-1/2 percent rate under that alternative.
