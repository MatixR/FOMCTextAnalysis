Money market conditions now estimated to be consistent with these paths are noted below, using the annual rates of growth in M1 as an index of the collection of aggregates. Federal funds Member Bank Net M1 rate Borrowings Reserves Alternative A 3-3 Alternative B 4 -- 4-3/4 400-500 -150 to -300 7% Alternative C 4-3/4--5-1/2 500-600 -250 to -400 6% (7) The money market specifications for alternative A include a Federal funds rate around 3-3/4 per cent, the most recent Desk operating target.

The funds rates have been moved up more for alternatives B and C, since these alternatives involve a slowing in the M 1 growth rate over the second quarter from the recent pace and since there is one month less than there was at the time of the last meeting to affect public demand for cash balances in the second quarter.

Even at the higher funds rates specified under alternatives B and C, the slowing in the growth rate in April is likely to be modest, with more of an effect later in the quarter.

However, higher Federal funds rates--such as contemplated under alternatives B and C--would likely raise bill rates significantly--with the 3-month bill perhaps up to ranges of 3-3/4--4-1/2 per cent and 4-1/2--5-1/4 per cent, respectively--as dealers attempt to get out from under sizable bill positions.

Thus, attain- ment of the conditions specified in alternative A would be likely to re- inforce other trends in capital markets now expected to contribute to some further decline in long-term rates, as noted in the Greenbook.

On the other hand, if money market conditions are made firmer, as specified under alternatives B and C, shifts in market expectations about the course of short-term rates and monetary policy might tend to offset the under- lying trends.

A rise in long-term rates would seem likely if the Federal funds rate were to trend convincingly above 4 per cent, with the rise in long rates largest if money market conditions were to tighten as much as specified under alternative C. Possible directive language Alternative A.

If the Committee adopts this alternative, it may wish to consider the money market conditions noted for alternative A in paragraph "prevailing" conditions, and for purposes of the proviso clause, to adopt the aggregate growth paths discussed earlier in connection with alterna- paths.

The Committee could also specify a slow- er growth path for purposes of the proviso, the effect of which would be to activate the proviso sooner if the staff projections prove to be correct. Or, if the Committee so desires, it could use a directive with a structure similar to alternative A but with the specifications for money market con- ditions and aggregates given above in connection with alternative B or C.

Or, if the Committee so desires, it could use a directive with a structure similar to alternative A but with the specifications for money market con- ditions and aggregates given above in connection with alternative B or C. In such a case, the language preceding the proviso clause might be modified to call for "attaining firmer money market conditions;".  Alternative B. This language is proposed for possible use if the Committee decides (a) to formulate its primary instruction in terms of desired growth rates for the aggregates, and (b) to adopt as targets the growth rates (including a 7 per cent second-quarter rise in M1) discussed earlier in connection with alternative B, which would be somewhat more moderate than the rates experienced recently, "To implement this policy, THE COMMITTEE SEEKS TO PROMOTE SOMEWHAT MORE MODERATE GROWTH IN MONETARY AND CREDIT AGGREGATES OVER THE MONTHS AHEAD, WHILE CONTINUING TO MEET SOME PART OF RESERVE NEEDS THROUGH PURCHASES OF COUPON ISSUES IN THE INTEREST OF PROMOTING ACCOMMODATIVE CONDITIONS IN LONG-TERM CREDIT MARKETS.

This language is proposed for possible use if the Committee decides to adopt as targets the growth rates for the aggregates (including a 6 per cent second quarter rise in M1) discussed earlier in connection with alternative C. "To implement this policy, THE COMMITTEE SEEKS TO PROMOTE MODERATE GROWTH IN MONETARY AND CREDIT AGGREGATES OVER THE MONTHS AHEAD, WHILE CONTINUING TO MEET SOME PART OF RESERVE NEEDS THROUGH PURCHASES OF COUPON ISSUES IN THE INTEREST OF PROMOTING ACCOMMODATIVE CONDITIONS IN LONG-TERM CREDIT MARKETS.

System open market operations until the next meeting of the Committee shall be con- ducted with a view to maintaining [DEL: prevailing] BANK RESERVES AND money market conditions CONSISTENT WITH THOSE OBJECTIVES, TAKING ACCOUNT OF THE FORTHCOMING TREASURY FINANCING {DEL: while accommodating any downward movements in long term rates, provided that money market conditions shall be modified if it appears that the monetary and credit aggregates are deviating significantly from the growth paths expected]." This language differs from alternative B only in the use of the term to describe the lower target growth rates for the aggregates.
