C 392.6 399.8 403.0 4th Q. 1st Q. 14.0 13.0 that the alternative B aggregate objectives could be attained with little change in money market conditions, while the objectives of alternative A would entail easing and those of C tightening.

period in the table in paragraph  the staff's best judgment with respect to a path for attaining longer-run objectives while keeping money market conditions from fluctuating unduly. (10) The specifications for the various alternatives, including accompanying interest rate movements, assume: (a) continued strong business loan demands; (b) fairly aggressive bank efforts to seek funds through CD's, but a slower rate of growth in the outstanding volume of such instruments following the unusually rapid growth of the second and third quarters; and (c) slight further slowing in the rate of growth of time and savings deposits other than CD's in the fourth and first quarters under prevailing money market conditions (although toward the end of the first quarter some of the tax refund money could begin to show up in time deposits).  As noted above, the alternative B targets appear to be con- sistent with about prevailing money market conditions.

The Treasury may take the opportunity presented by favorable markets to undertake some further debt extension around the end of the year.  Under alternative A, the staff would anticipate a decline in the funds rate, and an accompanying reduction in member bank borrowing, between now and the next meeting of the Committee.

This would very likely lead to reductions in the bill rate, despite the increase in Treasury borrowing, and to further declines in long-term rates.  Under alternative C, the funds rate might be expected to rise in a 5 to 6 per cent range over the next few weeks.
