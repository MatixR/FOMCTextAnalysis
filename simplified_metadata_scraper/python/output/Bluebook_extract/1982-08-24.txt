More detailed data for the alternatives are shown in the table and charts on the next few pages, and the quarterly interest rate path underlying the staff's GNP projection is contained in Appendix II. Alternative A Alternative B Growth from June to September M1 5 4 M2 10 9-1/2 Implied growth from July to September M1 7-3/4 6-1/4 M2 10-1/4 9-1/2 Federal funds rate range 7 to 12 8 to 13 (10) Alternative A represents the Committee's current third- quarter M1 target of 5 percent, but with an upward revision of the M2 target from 9 to 10 percent in reflection of the strength of this aggregate currently.

A Alt 1982--April August September Growth Rates Monthly 1982--April August September June-September July-September Growth Rates Quarterly Average 1982--Q1 Memo: Growth Q4 1981 to September 1982 452.4 451.5 451.4 451.2 454.0 457.0 452.4 451.5 451.4 451.2 453.9 455.9 1880.7 1897.5 1907.9 1922.9 1944.0 1955.6 1880.7 1897.5 1907.9 1922.9 1943.7 1953.3 2258.1 2278.9 2295.8 2319.8 2353.0 2367.9 2258.1 2278.9 2295.8 2319.8 2352.5 2364.8 5.6 5.3 9.8 9.7 10.9 10.7 as compared with the 7-1/2 percent annual rate of expansion in nominal GNP projected for this quarter by the staff.  Total reserves under alternative A would expand at about 4 percent annual rate over the balance of the quarter.

Short-term U levels would give foreign authorities greater scope to ease their interest rates further, which would probably forestall any appreciable weakening of the dollar on exchange markets over the near-term.  Alternative B, which calls for 4 percent growth in M1 over the third quarter, likely would be consistent with a federal funds rate in 2 percent discount rate.

Because money market fund yields would more quickly come into alignment with market rates, M2 and especially M3 growth would probably be a bit slower than under alternative A. The very recent downward pressures on the dollar in exchange markets probably would abate, and may be reversed.

The strength of federal government borrowing, reflecting in part a marked shift toward greater fiscal stimulus as evidenced by a larger high employment deficit, is working to hold up in- come and interest rates. (17) In the fourth quarter of the year, interest rates may be under upward pressure as compared with levels anticipated between now and  alternative A or B.

And in the degree that the quantity of money demanded is also increased from the lagged effects of recent short- term rate declines there will be a greater likelihood that a rebound in short-term rates would result from efforts to constrain money growth to the upper end of the longer-run M1 range, with the odds on a rebound  alternative A than alternative B.

In any event growth in M2 and M3 for the year seems likely to be fractionally above the Committee's ranges.
