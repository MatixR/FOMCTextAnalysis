Given that assumption, alternative B proposes a 1-1 range for M-1; this range assumes--unlike recent M-1 ranges--that the more likely growth of M-1 is at the mid-point rather than near 1/ Including a small allowance for introduction of POA accounts L's this spring.

Alternatives A and C are more and less expansive, respectively.

Proposed ranges for the broader aggregates have been lowered, for reasons discussed in paragraphs (13) and (14) below. (11) Expansion of nominal GNP over the longer-run policy period, while projected to moderate, is still expected to be around 10 per cent, and M-1 growth is likely to resume as the public brings its cash balances back into line with growing transactions needs. However, the staff expects that the demand for M-1 will not be so strong over the year, on average, as to require a significant change in the prevailing Federal funds rate if M-1 growth at the midpoint of  alternative B range is to be achieved over the year 1979.

Alternative C, on the other hand, would probably involve an increase in the funds rate from current levels to nearly 11 per cent in the course of the year.

By contrast, alternative A would imply a reduction in the funds rate, reaching year-end levels about ¾ of a percentage point below the current level.

The shift is projected to reduce M-1 growth (and thus increase V-l) by about 2 percentage points over the longer-run policy period.  Under alternative B, M-2 growth for the year ahead is expected to be in a 4½ to 7 per cent range and M-3 growth in a 6 to 8½ per cent range, 2½ percentage points lower, respectively, than their current longer-run ranges for the QIII '78 to QIII '79 period.

Growth of the broader monetary aggregates is, of course, slower under alternative C and more rapid under alternative A. (14) The range for bank credit growth for alternative B has been reduced to 7½ to 10 per cent--1 percentage point lower than its current range, reflecting the slowing of economic activity, the sustained higher level of interest rates, and the cumulative reduction in bank liquidity.

Alternative I calls for a reduction in the Federal funds rate by ½ percentage point from the current level; such a decline over the intermeeting period would be most  alternative A longer-run range.

This alternative would be consistent with both the alternative B and C longer-run ranges.

Alternative III, which calls for increases in the funds rate to around the midpoint of a 10¼ to 11 per cent range, is most consistent with longer-run alternative C. .

Growth for M-1 would have to be about 3 percentage points lower to reach the low end of the alternative B range of growth, and 3 points higher to reach the upper end.

Over the five months from January to June, M-1 would have to expand at a 5 per cent annual rate and M-2 at a 7 per cent annual rate to reach midpoint paths. 1/ Ranges for the forthcoming short-run policy period expressed as three-month growth ranges are shown in Appendix V for comparison purposes.  Similar information for alternatives A and C are shown in Appendix Alternative Levels and Growth Rates for Key Monetary Aggregates M-11 /  M-2 Alt.

Under alternative II, M-1 is projected to increase in a range centered on a 7 per cent annual rate, which would put M-1  alternative B long-run path by March.

Under alternative II, M-1 is projected to increase in a range centered on a 7 per cent annual rate, which would put M-1 just below the midpoint of the alternative B long-run path by March. Even such a resurgence in growth would bring the growth rate of M-1 for the first quarter (quarterly average basis) to only a 3/4 per cent annual rate, and would imply another substantial increase in V-1, at about a 12 per cent annual rate, as shown in Appendix II. (18) Under alternative II, M-2 is expected to expand at a 5 to 9 per cent annual rate range in February-March, considerably 1/ This, of course, represents the end-point of the long-run policy period. 2/ Adjusted for the retarding effects of ATS on M-1, the velocity increase would be 8 per cent annual rate. more rapidly than in the previous three months, but growth at the 7 per cent midpoint would be a little less than needed to bring M-2 up to the low end of the range specified under alternative B. The acceleration of this aggregate reflects the expected strengthening of both M-1 and the interest-bearing component of M-2, with much of the strength in the latter likely to result from a slowing of re- cent unusually rapid savings account withdrawals.
