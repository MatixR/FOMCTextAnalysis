In this forecast, upward pressure on inflation associated with a tight labor market is offset by downward pressures emanating importantly from the rise in the dollar and decline in oil prices in 1997 and early 1998 and from declining capacity utilization. The staff forecast is built on an unchanged federal funds rate, and if the Committee agrees that this is both a reasonable and desirable outcome under those conditions, retaining the  alternative B would be appropriate.

Worries about corporate earnings should mount, though not enough to boost quality spreads appreciably in corporate bond markets or put much downward pressure on equity prices, which would be bolstered by any downward drift in bond yields. The dollar would be expected to trade around its levels of late, off some from its recent peak (23) The Committee may see sufficient chances of a shortfall in activity from the staff forecast to suggest a small easing at this time--as in the 25 basis point decline in the federal funds rate under alternative A. The Committee has held the nominal federal funds rate constant since March, even as inflation and inflation expectations have fallen, raising the real funds rate to a high level.

The drop in yields would tend to boost equity prices and depress the dollar.  Alternative C might be favored if the Committee saw the economy as continuing to operate beyond its potential, with the risk that sustained pressures on labor markets might show through more forcefully than in the staff forecast to higher labor costs and prices, perhaps hinted at in the recent employment cost report.
