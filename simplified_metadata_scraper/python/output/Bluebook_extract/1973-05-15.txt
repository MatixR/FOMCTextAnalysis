A Alt Longer-run targets (represented by growth rates for 2nd and 3rd quarters of 1973) Credit proxy Associated ranges for May-June Federal funds rate range (inter-meeting period) 6--6-1/2 7--7-1/2 9-1/2--10 8-1/2--9 10--12 6-1/2--8-1/2 6-3/4--7-1/2 5--5-1/2 6--6-1/2 9--9-1/2 7-1/2--8 9--11 5-1/2--7-1/2 7-1/4--8 4--4-1/2 4-1/2--5 8--8-1/2 6-1/2--7 7-1/2--9-1/2 3-1/2--5-1/2 4-1/2--6-1/2 7-1/2--8-1/2  Alternative B is consistent with the long run path for the aggregates (as indexed by M1 growth of 5--5-1/2 per cent) adopted by the Committee at recent meetings.

This might be accomplished without any additional tightening in money market conditions beyond the 7-1/4--8 per cent funds rate range, particularly if, as projected, the rate of growth in GNP moderates. (10) Between now and the next Committee meeting the 3-month Treasury bill rate is likely to move back up into a 6-1/4--6-5/8 per cent range under alternative B. The recent rise in the discount rate and the somewhat tauter money market conditions anticipated will put pressure on dealer financing costs and will also give banks a further incentive to sell or liquidate bills as compared with other forms of adjustment.

Given this assumption, a more marked slowing of consumer- type time deposit flows is anticipated around the mid-year interest crediting period and continuing into the third quarter, when Treasury bill rates are expected to rise further. (14) Long-term interest rates seem likely to rise somewhat under the conditions of alternative B partly as restraint on bank credit availa- bility leads banks to participate relatively little as suppliers of funds in securities markets.

But expectations are very important in the determination of long rates, and should monetary actions be interpreted as implying that credit will tighten substantially further, or remain tight for a more extended period than expected, long rates could well come under more upward pressure.  Alternative A indicates specifications that appear consis- tent with a policy move toward a higher growth rate for the aggregates than encompassed in alternative B.

This alternative implies some easing of money market conditions in the weeks ahead.  Under alternative C, which moves toward a lower long-run growth rate for the aggregates, it would appear that the Federal funds rate would probably have to rise above 8 per cent over the period imme- diately ahead.

The diverse behavior of the various monetary aggregates, however, creates difficulties in characterizing future targets in the same way relative to past performance for all aggregates. (18) The 6 month comparison works quite well for M1, since the long-term target range specified under alternative B cent) and the short-run range of tolerance encompass the 5-1/4 per cent growth rate experience in the past 6 months; the ranges specified under A and C are, respectively, somewhat above and somewhat below the 6-month pace.

For RPD and M2 , the situation is a little more compli- cated, but for the most part the previous 6-month rates of expansion are above specifications in the three alternatives (with some exceptions in alternative A).

As will be noted, an instruction to take account of credit market developments is included in alternative C since the relatively sharp tightening of money market conditions contemplated could lead to undesirably rapid adjustments in credit markets generally.
