Alternative A refers to the recent pickup in economic activity but points to the sluggishness of housing activity, the weak labor market, and the prospects for a subpar recovery in the absence of further monetary stimulus.  Alternative B notes the continued strengthening of economic activity, the abatement of deterioration in the labor market, and the likelihood of a moderate pace of recovery.

Alternatives A and B each indicate that substantial resource slack continues to restrain cost pressures and that longer-term inflation expectations remain stable, making it likely that inflation will be subdued for some time.

Alternative C refers to appropriate monetary policy adjustments and stable longer- term inflation expectations—but not to resource slack—in projecting that inflation will return to levels consistent with price stability.

As in recent statements,  Alternatives A and B indicate that the Committee expects the funds rate to remain “exceptionally low.   Alternative C modifies the forward guidance by using the phrase “low.

Alternative A expands the amount of agency MBS purchases by indicates that these transactions will continue through the end of the third quarter.

Alternatives B and C do not make any changes to the amounts or timing of the Federal Reserve’s previously announced securities purchases.  Alternative B states that the Committee will continue to evaluate its purchases of securities based on the economic outlook and financial conditions, leaving the door open to adjusting its purchases should circumstances warrant.  Alternative C indicates that the Committee will be evaluating the size and composition of its holdings of securities, thereby signaling that asset sales could be used to manage the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet.

The reference to the Federal Reserve’s “holdings”—rather than “purchases”—is    Alternative B, as denoted by the square brackets.

THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE B  If policymakers judge that the pace of economic recovery is likely to be moderate,  that inflation is likely be subdued for some time, and that these outcomes are the best  that can be achieved under current circumstances, then the Committee could choose  to reiterate its forward policy guidance and to carry out the remainder of its previously  announced securities purchases, as in Alternative B.  Members may anticipate that aggregate demand will continue to be damped over coming quarters by a variety of factors, including weak labor market conditions, tight credit conditions for households and small businesses, and the waning effects of fiscal stimulus.

The financial market reaction to a statement like that of Alternative B would likely be muted.

Policymakers might also wish to consider a variant of Alternative B that refers to the Committee’s evaluation of its securities “holdings” instead of its “purchases”.

A statement like this variant of Alternative B would probably cause a substantial shift in investors’ expectations about the anticipated trajectory of the Federal Reserve’s securities holdings.

THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE C  If policymakers are confident that a sustainable economic recovery is now   under way and see substantial upside risks to the inflation outlook in the absence of  appropriate near-term monetary policy adjustments, then the Committee might wish  to issue a statement that shortens the horizon over which the funds rate is likely to  remain low and that raises the possibility of active unwinding of the Federal Reserve’s  securities holdings, as in Alternative C.  To the extent that inflation outcomes are seen as linked mainly to expected inflation rather than to resource slack, members may view the level of forward inflation compensation and the degree of dispersion in professional forecasters’ longer-run inflation projections as worrisome indicators that inflation expectations may not be anchored very firmly.

The adoption of a statement like that of Alternative C would greatly surprise financial market participants.

Moreover, Alternative C uses the phrase “for some time” to refer to the duration over which the funds rate target would remain at low levels—not the time horizon preceding the onset of funds rate firming.

Thus, investors would be likely to interpret a statement like that of  Alternative C as conveying the Committee’s intention to commence tightening quite soon—perhaps as early as March—and to move fairly quickly to raise the funds rate target to a level of around 1 or 2 percent.

THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE A  If meeting participants are concerned about prospects for a subpar recovery   and believe that further monetary stimulus would help improve the outlook for  economic activity and inflation, then they might wish to expand the amount of the  Federal Reserve’s agency MBS purchases by $250 billion and extend the horizon   of those purchases through the third quarter of this year, as in Alternative A.  With these adjustments, agency MBS purchases could continue over coming months at an average rate of around $10 billion per week, about the same as the volume of the Desk’s purchases over recent weeks.

An announcement like that of Alternative A would come as a surprise to market participants, since they do not appear to be anticipating any changes in the overall size or composition of the Federal Reserve’s LSAPs.

The baseline scenario corresponds to Alternative B in this Bluebook.

We also present a projection for Alternative A, where the agency MBS 1.

We do not present balance sheet projections for Alternative C in this Bluebook because the Committee has not yet specified any strategy for asset sales or the use of other reserve draining tools.

The  announced LSAP purchases in Alternative B and Alternative C are the same, so the baseline projections for assets and reserves can serve as a reference for Alternative C.

Alternative A projects a higher contour of total assets because of the assumed larger purchases of agency MBS.

Balance Sheet Projections Summary  Alternative A Baseline Agency Debt Securities Total purchased $175 billion $175 billion December 2016 $19 billion $19 billion Agency MBS 1.

In Alternative A, the size of the balance sheet peaks at occurring a few months before all MBS purchases settle because of the runoff of other assets.

Alternative B) Source.

The staff recommends that the directive issued at   this meeting under Alternative B or Alternative C include the following sentence: “The Committee directs the Desk to engage in dollar roll transactions as necessary to facilitate settlement of the Federal Reserve's agency MBS purchases that are to be conducted through the end of March 31, 2010, as directed above.

The additional  sentence would seem not to be needed under Alternative A, as the directive under that alternative would instruct the Desk to continue to purchase MBS through the time as they are at present.

ASSETS  Asset Purchases   The baseline scenario, corresponding to Alternative B, incorporates large-scale asset roughly in line with those that have been announced.

In the scenario corresponding to Alternative A, the Committee increases its purchases of 1.

Projections for Alternative C are not presented in this Bluebook because the Committee has not yet specified any strategy for asset sales or the use of other reserve draining tools.

The  announced LSAP purchases in Alternative B and Alternative C are the same, so the baseline projections for assets and reserves can serve as a reference for Alternative C.

By the end of the projection period in Alternative B, the expansion of Federal Reserve notes in circulation and capital, combined with a runoff of assets, necessitates not only the reduction of the U.

Reserve balances in the baseline scenario peak earlier and at a lower level than in   Alternative A scenario.
