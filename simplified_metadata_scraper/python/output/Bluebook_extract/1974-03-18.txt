Alternative B aims at a return of M1 to the path by September, whereas alternative C moves it back more quickly by June (though it then falls . Alternative A, which is judged to be consistent with little change in money market conditions, includes a growth rate for M1 over the next six months that remains above the 5¾ per cent growth path.

This would be a somewhat better performance than in the summer of 1973, and appears possible because of the large amount of interest-sensitive money already drained from these institutions and because the institutions last summer had not fully adjusted their advertising and rate policies to the new rate ceilings that became effective at the beginning of July.  Under alternative C, the expected rise of interest rates would be much sharper--with the funds rate moving up into the 10¼--11 per cent area--in order to bring the money supply back to the long run path by mid-year.

There could well be significant feedback effects on GNP of such developments by late summer, though more particularly by the fourth quarter.  Under alternative A--which encompasses a 6½ per cent growth rate for M1 over the next six months--the staff would expect that the Federal funds rate would not rise from current levels and might, over time, drop back somewhat.

market yield adjustments in bond markets might develop under current money market conditions, while yield adjustments are likely to be considerable under alternative B and very marked under alternative C.

As will be noted, alternatives A and C refer to growth over the past 3 months.

As will be noted, alternatives A and C refer to growth rates in the aggregates "over the past 3 months." For the 3 months through February, these are as follows: M1, 5.7 per cent; M2, 9.5 per cent; and the bank credit proxy, 6.3 per cent.  Alternatives B and C include a reference to the prospective Treasury financing to be announced early in the week of the FOMC meeting.
