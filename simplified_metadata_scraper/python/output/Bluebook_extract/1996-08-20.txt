As a result, the staff envisions that an uptrend in core CPI inflation will become apparent over the coming year, even after methodological improvements in that price measure. The increase in the CPI for 1997 in the staff forecast would be a little above the central tendency range of FOMC members in the Humphrey-Hawkins' report, even though the real growth and unemployment outcomes for 1997 would be consistent with the central tendencies for these measures. (8) Nonetheless, the Committee may well feel that it can afford to wait, as in alternative B, for additional data to accumulate to allow a more confident judgment concerning whether an underlying process of rising inflation seems to be taking hold.

In light of these revisions and their implications for the longer-term outlook, an immediate 25 basis point tightening, or perhaps one of 50 basis points, would be even more warranted if the Committee were seek- ing to move policy over time to a stance restrictive enough to put a downward tilt to the inflation rate in 1997 and beyond. (11) Given the recent adjustment to their expectations for monetary policy, market participants would be somewhat surprised by a Committee decision to raise its intended federal funds rate by 25 basis points, as under alternative C. Other short-term market rates would immediately adjust upward by a like amount.
