Alternative C would compensate for the second-quarter overshoot in M 1 , in that M1 would be expected to reach roughly the same level in the first quarter of 1977 as that implied by a 5¾ per cent growth rate measured from the first quarter of 1976.

A Alt Ranges for July-August M1  5 to 9 4½ to 8½ 4 to 8 M2  9 to 13 8 to 12 7½ to 11½ Federal funds rate 4¼ to 5¼ 4¾ to 5¾ 5¼ to 6¼ (intermeeting period)  Alternative B assumes a Federal funds rate range over the next four weeks centered on 5¼ per cent, the Desk's most recent objective; alternatives A and C assume some easing and some tightening, respectively.

Also, a draw-down in the first half of July of the Treasury's unusually high end-of-June cash balance may add, at least temporarily, to private demand balances.  Under alternative B, the annual rate of growth of M1 in the July-August period is expected to be in a 4½ to 8½ range.

the second to the third quarter, M 1 is expected to grow at only a 4¾ per cent annual rate for arithmetic reasons--specifically, because the second quarter average is high relative to the June level.) Given the projection for nominal GNP, if growth in M1 over the QII '76-QII '77 period is to be constrained to 5¾ per cent--the mid-point of the alternative B longer-run growth range--it is likely that short-term interest rates would have to begin moving up later in the summer.

The alternative B projection assumes an upward adjustment in Regulation Q ceilings in early 1977.

The alternative B projection assumes an upward adjustment in Regulation Q ceilings in early 1977.  Alternative C contemplates a modest tightening of the money market over the next few weeks, with the Federal funds rate moving to the 4 per cent mid-point of the funds rate range.

Under these circumstances, inflows of funds into small-denomination deposits at banks and thrift institutions in the first half of 1977 would be depressed by the greater relative attrac- tiveness of rates on market instruments, even though under this alternative Regulation Q ceilings are assumed to be relaxed in the fourth quarter of 1976.  Alternative A contemplates more rapid growth in the monetary aggregates over QII '76-QII '77--including a 6-3/4 per cent growth rate for M1 --and some near-term easing of money market conditions, with the funds 4 per cent.

Business and other credit demands on banks can be expected to strengthen somewhat over the second half as inven- tory and fixed capital expenditures increase and long-term borrowing slows. Under alternative B, and especially under C, banks would be likely to reduce their acquisitions of Treasury securities and to borrow in CD and Eurodollar markets. Under alternative A, inflows of other deposits should reduce the need for banks to rely on such sources of funds over the balance of the year.
