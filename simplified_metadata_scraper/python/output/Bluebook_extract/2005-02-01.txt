food and energy                 (Four-quarter percent change) Table 1: Alternative Language for the January FOMC Announcement  December FOMC Alternative A Alternative B Alternative C Policy Decision 1.

Alternative A presents a stance of policy that is easier in multiple dimensions, in that the federal funds rate is held at its current level, the assessment of the current degree of accommodation is softened, and language that could be associated with a pause is offered.

In stark contrast,  Alternative C envisions a half-point rate hike accompanied by a darker assessment of inflation risks and the removal of the “measured pace” language.

No doubt, the  extremes are extreme, but they contain elements of statement language that the  Committee might find more appealing than the wording of Alternative B.  In addition, these alternatives may be helpful in informing potential changes in the policy announcement over the next few meetings.

(15) If the Committee believes that continued policy firming will likely prove  sufficient to check inflationary pressures while allowing economic slack to be worked  down in an acceptable manner, it might be inclined to raise the target funds rate  another 25 basis points at this meeting, as in Alternative B.  Such an increase would further unwind the unusual degree of policy accommodation prevailing over the past several years, seen in Chart 8 as the movement of the real funds rate closer to estimates of its equilibrium, which themselves moved back to a more typical range in the last year or so.

The draft statement offered in Alternative B is quite similar to that released following the December meeting in its evaluation of recent economic conditions, assessment of balanced risks to the goals of stable prices and sustainable growth, and retention of the familiar “measured pace” language.

(17) If the Committee believes that a more rapid return to a neutral policy stance  is needed to prevent output overshooting its potential and putting upward pressures  on inflation down the road, it may choose one or all of the components included in  the statement under Alternative C.  A 50 basis point increase in the target funds rate at this meeting might be selected if members believe that a more gradual tightening, along the lines of the Greenbook assumption or the expectations of market participants, could promote excessive risk-taking, unsustainable spending, and an increase in inflation.

Similarly, a less  optimistic outlook for aggregate supply and the attendant consequences for inflation  might incline the Committee to pick up the pace of policy firming.7  (18) Even if the Committee prefers a 25 basis point tightening at this meeting, it  may wish to couple such a move with some of the changes in the announcement   Alternative C in Table 1.

(19) A 50 basis point policy firming and an announcement like that indicated  under Alternative C would lead to a sharp rise in short-term interest rates and a decline in bond and stock prices.

attenuated, if the Committee married a quarter-point rate firming with some of the  drafting language of Alternative C. (20) If the Committee wanted to pause in the process of removing policy accommodation at this meeting, it might adopt Alternative A.

Adoption of all aspects of Alternative A—that is, keeping the funds rate unchanged and softening the cast of the statement language—would come as a considerable surprise to market participants, especially after the release of the minutes of the December meeting.
