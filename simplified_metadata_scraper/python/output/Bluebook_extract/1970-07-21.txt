Thus, it would appear reasonable for the FOMC to con- tinue to show some concern for the possible emergence of undue pressures on financial markets, although conditions at the moment do not seem to necessitate the degree of concern shown in the last two FOMC directives. In general, during the past few weeks, credit market conditions appear to have improved enough for the FOMC, if it wishes, to return to the type of emphasis on monetary aggregates that was contained in the directives issued in March and April. (7) Of the two alternatives shown below for the second paragraph, alternative A calls for continuing the same degree of con- cern with financial markets as the previous two directives.

This set can be considered as consistent with either alternative A or B since, so far as the staff can judge now, money market conditions similar to those recently pre- vailing might be accompanied by a moderate growth in the money supply and no strong upward pressure on interest rates.

Under alternative B, the Desk would be freer to react--though equally subject to "even-keel" considerations as in alternative A--should the aggregates be deviating from the indicated path, or from whatever modification of it the Committee may wish to make.
