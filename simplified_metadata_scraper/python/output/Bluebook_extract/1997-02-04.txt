Under alternative C, the federal funds rate would be raised by 1/2 percentage point to 5-3/4 percent, either through a less generous provision of nonborrowed reserves or a hike in the discount rate.

In these circumstances, the costs of continuing the "wait and see" stance for a while longer may not be large even if the staff is right about the underlying pressures in the economy, and the Committee would have more information to assess whether additional price pressures are, indeed, likely to develop. (22) Financial markets currently are not anticipating a change in policy at the February meeting, and thus the choice of alternative B should initially have little impact on interest rates or the foreign exchange value of the dollar.

While inflation does not deteriorate appreciably in the near term, given the lags in the effect of policy, the sooner the Committee begins to tighten--as under alternative C--the lower the odds that higher inflation will become embedded in price and wage setting.

The discussion in the long-run strategies section suggested that a rise in the funds rate of 125 basis points by late 1998 would be needed to keep inflation from moving permanently higher.  The tightening of policy under alternative C would surprise market participants, and short-term interest rates, including the prime rate, would rise by the half-point hike in the federal funds rate.
