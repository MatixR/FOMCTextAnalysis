Alternative B maintains the current degree of reserve market pres- sure, with federal funds trading around 9-3/4 percent or slightly higher 500 million.

Alternative B maintains the current degree of reserve market pres- sure, with federal funds trading around 9-3/4 percent or slightly higher in association with adjustment plus seasonal borrowing of $500 million. Alternative A entails federal funds around 9-1 $300 million, and alternative C involves funds around 10-1/4 percent and 700 million.

The funds rate range suggested for alternatives B and C is a per- centage point above the 7 to 11 percent range now in the directive, better centering the range on current (alternative B) or somewhat higher expected funds rates.

A Alt Growth from March to June M2 4 3 2 M3 5-1/2 5 4-1/2 M1 1 -1/2 -2 Growth from QIV'88 to June M2 3-1/4 2-3/4 2-1/4 M3 4-3/4 4-1/2 4-1/4 Ml 1/2 -1/4 -1 Associated federal funds rate ranges 7 to 11 8 to 12 8 to 12 (10) The existing structure of interest rates appears to incor- porate some expectation that monetary policy may be a little firmer in the near term than is assumed under alternative B. As a consequence, with federal funds continuing around 9-3/4 percent or even a little above under alternative B, money market rates might tend to decline a bit.

Should the incoming data point more clearly to continued strength in the economy and prices, consistent with the greenbook forecast, bond yields would be unlikely to fall with an unchanged System policy stance and could even move higher.  Growth in M2 under alternative B, at 3 percent from March to June, would be stronger on average than over the first three months of this year.

Even so, the lagged effects of earlier substantial increases in opportunity costs would continue to restrain M2 growth and result in a 4-1/2 percent increase in its velocity in the second quarter, somewhat faster than in the second half of 1988. M1 would continue about flat over the March-to-June period as outflows of transactions deposits about match growth in currency; consequently, its velocity would increase at around the projected 7-3/4 percent increase in nominal GNP. (12)- M3 is projected to grow at a 5 percent annual rate over the March-to-June period under alternative B, somewhat faster than from December to March.

With the further rise in market rates, M2 would expand at a 2 percent annual rate over the March-to-June period under alternative C, only a bit faster than the December-to-March pace.

M3 expansion, at 4-1/2 percent over the March-to-June period, while picking up some from the sluggish rate of recent months, would remain in the lower portion of its long-run range.  With the lower money market rates of alternative A, M2 growth would strengthen to a 4 percent pace, lifting it above the lower bound of its growth cone by June.
