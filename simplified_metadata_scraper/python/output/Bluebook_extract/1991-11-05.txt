Under alternative B, federal funds would continue to trade around 5 percent in combination with adjustment plus seasonal 175 million.   Under alternative A, the federal funds rate would move down to 4-1/2 percent, achieved either through a 1/2 percentage point cut in the discount rate with the same level of bor- rowing as under alternative B or through open market operations that 125 million.

Growth of demand deposits, however, is expected to fall back from October's atypical surge and show through to a slowing in M1 growth to a 7-1/4 percent pace over November and December.4  In the fourth quarter of this year, M2 expansion at a 2 percent rate on a quarterly average basis would imply a rise in its velocity of 1-1/2 percent at an annual rate, down markedly from the 4-1/2 percent pace of the third quarter. Under this policy alternative, M2 would be on a trajectory to enter 1992 only a bit above the lower end of its tentative 1992 growth range of 2-1/2 to 6-1/2 percent.  M3 under alternative B is seen as continuing to grow at a 1 percent annual rate over November and December, which would mean this aggregate would be entering next year around the bottom of its tentative 1992 range of 1 to 5 percent.

Overall debt of domestic nonfinancial sectors is expected to register a 5 percent rate of expansion over the September-to-December period, placing growth for the year about 1/2 percentage point above the bottom of the FOMC's 4-1/2 to 8-1/2 percent monitoring range for this aggregate.  The easing contemplated in alternative A exceeds that now envisioned by the markets and thus money market interest rates 4 percentage point.

The dollar likely would fall somewhat on foreign exchange markets. (13) M2 is projected to strengthen to a 4 percent rate by December under alternative A and would be entering the new year well into its tentative range.

Tending to limit the pickup in M2, though, would be declines in rates on retail CDs and money funds in relation to expected returns on capital market instruments; also, cost pressures might induce more banks to overcome their hesitancy to lower rates on passbook and NOW accounts, which could prompt established customers to reconsider investment options and move account balances to market instruments.  Under alternative A, M3 would expand at a 1-1 rate in November and December, on a trajectory to begin the new year within its tentative range.
