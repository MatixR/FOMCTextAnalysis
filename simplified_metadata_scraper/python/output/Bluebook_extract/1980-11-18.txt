Moreover, the choice among these policy options could have a significant effect on inflationary expectations and real economic activity over the months ahead, and thus on the pattern of economic and financial developments associated with achieving next year's monetary targets.  Alternative B continues the Committee's current targets for the fourth quarter, as indexed by M-1A and M-1B.

However, achieving the negative growth in M-1A over the balance of the year implied by alternative B would probably require further near-term increases in short-term interest rates.

However, achieving the negative growth in M-1A over the balance of the year implied by alternative B would probably require further near-term increases in short-term interest rates.  To achieve the specifications of alternative B, total reserves would have to increase at about a 6 percent annal rate over the October to December period.

Thus, there is more than usual uncertainty about the demand for borrowing, and therefore about the level of the nonborrowed reserve path consistent with money supply and total reserve targets of alternative B. (11) Under alternative B, a funds rate in the 15 to 16 percent range is likely to emerge over the weeks immediately ahead, and possibly higher before the year is out.

Finally, continued intervention by the U to slow the appreciation in the foreign exchange value of the dollar--which is likely to continue rising under alternative B--could generate additional pressure on Treasury yields as the Federal Reserve or Treasury offers securities to the market to finance foreign currency purchases.

With mortgage rates already at levels that have begun to choke off demand, new commitment activity for longer-term residential mortgages at thrift institutions would probably become quite depressed.  The further rise in interest rates under alternative B--the underlying assumption for the Greenbook projection-is an element in the staff's anticipation that real GNP will decline in early 1981.

The dampening of the transactions demand for money in lagged response to the run-up in interest rates and to the projected weakening in economic activity suggest that interest rates could temporarily ease in early 1981, assuming 1981 monetary targets as reported to the Congress in July.1 / However, for all of next year, the effects of inflation on the transactions demand for money are expected to require historically high interest rates in order to restrain growth in the monetary aggregates to the preliminary FOMC targets.  Alternative A encompasses somewhat higher money targets for the fourth quarter than alternative B--targets that are thought to be achievable with little change in interest rates from current levels.

However, some short-term rates might adjust up slightly 1/ See Appendix II for the projected quarterly pattern of interest rates under alternative B. further due to the strength in short-term credit demands and, in the case of the prime and mortgage rates, to lagged adjustments to the tightening that has already occurred.

With interest rates lower over the balance of the year than under alternative B, money growth and economic activity would be expected to be less weak in early 1981.

With interest rates lower over the balance of the year than under alternative B, money growth and economic activity would be expected to be less weak in early 1981.  Alternative C contemplates a reduction in the Committee's current fourth quarter money growth target, and implies a substantial reduction in money growth over the balance of the year that brings the level of M-1B into the FOMC's target zone by December.

In addition, the nonborrowed reserves path was adjusted downward by $50 million to adjust for strength in total reserves.
