Alternatives A and C encompass, respectively, slightly higher and slightly lower longer-run growth ranges for the aggregates. Alternative D reflects a larger downward adjustment in growth ranges, including a reduction in the M-1 range sufficient to compensate for the third-quarter overshoot in M-1 growth.

Alternative D reflects a larger downward adjustment in growth ranges, including a reduction in the M-1 range sufficient to compensate for the third-quarter overshoot in M-1 growth. (7) The implications of mid-points in the proposed growth ranges for M-1 and M-2 for growth rates in these aggregates over 15-month and 18-month periods beginning in QII '77 and QI '77, respectively, and ending in QIII '78 are shown in the table below.1/ Growth Rates in Monetary Aggregates Assuming Growth over QIII '77-QIII '78 Period at near Mid-Points of Alternative Ranges (Annual rates, compounded quarterly) Period A B C D QIII '77-QIII '78 5.6 5.3 5.0 4.2 QII '77-QIII '78 6.4 6.1 5.9 5.3 QI '77-QIII '78 6.8 6.6 6.4 5.8 Memo: QII '77-QII '78 6.6 6.4 6.2 5.6 QIII '77-QIII '78 7.9 7.5 7.0 6.4 QII '77-QIII '78 8.5 8.1 7.8 7.3 QI '77-QIII '78 8.6 8.3 8.0 7.6 Memo: QII '77-QII '78 8.6 8.3 8.0 7.5  It may be seen that under alternative D growth in M-1 at around a 4¼ per cent rate over the QIII '77-QIII '78 period would lead to expansion in the QII '77-QIII '78 period at a 5¼ per cent annual rate --the mid-point of the current longer-run range.

Growth would be somewhat higher if measured from QI '77 since there was also an overshoot in the  alternative D does not compensate.

Growth of 1/ Implications for growth over longer time periods are shown in appendix  alternatives B and D.

These tables show base periods for each quarter from QIV '74 to QII '77 and terminal periods from QI '75 to QIII '77. M-1 of around 5¼ per cent in the QIII '77-QIII '78 period, as called for under alternative B, would be associated with expansion over the 15-month QII '77-QIII '78 period at an annual rate of close to 6 per cent, in the upper part of the FOMC's current longer-run range.

A Alt Ranges for October-November M-1 3½-8½ 3-8 2½-7½ M-2 6-10 5½-9½ 5-9 Federal funds rate (intermeeting period) 5¾-6¼ 6¼-6¾ 6¾-7¼  Alternative B includes a Federal funds rate centered on the recently prevailing level of about 6½ per cent.

Such a moderation in M-1 growth from the advanced rates of the past two quarters is likely as a result of the lagged effect on money demand of the rise of about 1¼ percentage points in short-term rates that has occurred since mid-year. (11) The staff expects, however, that even further increases in interest rates would be required as time goes on if growth in M-1 over the QIII '77-QIII '78 period is to be held to the mid-point of the longer-run 4-6 per cent range associated with alternative B. This would entail M-1 growth in the area of 4 -5 per cent, annual rate,during the first three quarters of 1978.

On the other hand, a rebound in economic confidence could well be accompanied by an increased willingness to spend out of existing cash balances by businesses and consumers, as appears to have occurred in earlier stages of the current economic expansion; if this takes place, a rebound in velocity need not entail significant interest rate pressures. (13) Growth in M-2 over the October-November period is likely to be in a 5 -9 per cent annual rate range under alternative B. The time and savings deposit component of M-2 is expected to expand by only slightly more than its reduced August-September pace.

Recent upward adjustments in intermediate- and longer-term rates may have been sufficient to accomodate this enlarged volume of bond offerings, but some further rise cannot be ruled out. (15) A tightening of the funds market to the mid-point of a 6¾-7¼ per cent range over the next few weeks is contemplated under alternatives C or D--alternatives that over the longer-run involve lower growth ranges for the monetary aggregates than alternative B.

Such a rise in the funds rate in the weeks immediately ahead would probably be associated with a 2½-7½ per cent annual rate range for M-1 and a 5-9 per cent range for M-2.  Under both alternatives C and D, interest rates would probably have to rise further in late 1977 and in 1978 to achieve the mid-points of their respective longer-run ranges for the monetary aggre- gates. Rate increases would, of course, be larger under alternative D, which involves M-1 growth over the QIII '77-QIII '78 period at a mid- point rate of 4¼ per cent.

The funds rate under this alternative would be expected to reach around 8¼ per cent by the third quarter of 8 per cent under alternative C. Under alternative D, we have assumed an upward adjustment in Regulation Q ceilings on time deposits of ¼ percentage point across the board in the second quarter of next year.

Still, upward pressures on longer- term market rates would be moderated by the sizable cash flow to insur- ance companies and pension funds. (18) The easing in money market conditions over the next few weeks under alternative A would be consistent with a shift to somewhat higher longer-run growth ranges than those of alternative B.

As suggested below, the particular language needed in the opening lines of the money market formulation would depend on the specific conditions sought; the three alternatives shown--calling, respectively, for somewhat easier, prevailing, and somewhat firmer money market conditions--are intended to be associated with the specifications  alternatives A, B, and C.
