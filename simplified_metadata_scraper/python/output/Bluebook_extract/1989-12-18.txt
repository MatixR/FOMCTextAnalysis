The specifications of alternative B involve federal funds continuing to trade in the 8-1/2 percent area in association with adjust- 150 million. Under alternative A, the federal funds rate would decline to the 8 percent area accompanying a 100 million.

Federal funds would return to the 9 percent area under alternative C, associated 200 million.

With policy unchanged, the dollar might show little further depreciation, unless key foreign central banks tighten policies further.  Under alternative B, M2 would expand at an 8 percent annual rate over the November-to-March period, near the pace of recent months.

By March, M2 would have grown 8 percent at an annual rate from its fourth-quarter base; but absent any significant changes in the funds rate, M2 subsequently would be expected to moderate to within its tentative annual target cone in the third quarter. (13) M3 is expected to grow at a 5-1/2 percent annual rate under alternative B, in line with its faster pace of October and November.

Over the November-to-March period, growth of domestic nonfinancial debt is expected to be around 7 percent, placing the debt aggregate in the lower portion of its tentative 6-1/2 to 10-1/2 percent monitoring range for 1990.  The easing of policy under alternative A would be a little more than now seems to be anticipated by market participants over coming weeks.

The dollar could weaken significantly further (16) With the further drop in interest rates, growth in M2 would strengthen under alternative A to a 9 percent annual rate over the Novem- ber-to-March period, placing this aggregate noticeably above the upper end of its tentative growth cone.

Under alternative A, growth in M3 would firm to a 6 percent rate over the November-to-March period, a bit above the midpoint of its tentative 1990 range.

A decline in market rates might not boost M3 in line with previous experience, since higher prices on mortgages and mortgage-backed securities could encourage the sale of assets by thrifts.  Alternative C would restrain M2 growth to around the upper bound of its 1990 growth cone by March, putting it on a track toward the middle of its tentative range; such a move would seem to increase the odds on more noticeable progress toward price stability, with assistance from a stronger dollar, albeit with greater risk of an economic downturn.
