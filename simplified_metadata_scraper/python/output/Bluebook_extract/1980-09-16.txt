Under these circumstances, to restrain money growth between now and year-end to the pace specified by either alternative A or B would appear to imply a further rise of interest rates--with the rise under alternative B larger and occurring sooner.

Only minor variations in growth rates would be expected under alternative B. Chart 1 Actual and Targeted M-1A and M-1B - Longer-Run Range .

- 1780 -- - 1760 _ I I I I I I I I I 1740  Under alternative A, the expansion in M-A over the balance of the year at a 5-1/4 percent annual rate would produce growth over the one-year QIV '79 to QIV '80 policy period of 4-1/2 percent, 2 to 6 percent range.

From August to December, M-1B under alternative A is expected to expand at a 7-1 annual rate, leading to growth for the year at the upper limit of its range.

From August to December, M-1B under alternative A is expected to expand at a 7-1/2 percent annual rate, leading to growth for the year at the upper limit of its range.  Growth in M-2 under alternative A is projected to slow to a 9 percent annual rate over the balance of the year, a rate that would keep growth for the year above the upper end of the Committee's longer-run range.

The latter are expected to resume growing over the months ahead, as recent increases in market interest rates augment the average yield on their portfolio, but not at the very rapid pace of late spring and early summer. (12) To achieve the growth in the aggregates specified under alternative A, total reserves would have to expand at about a 6 percent annual rate from August to December, and, given the near-term pattern of growth, by about a 7 percent annual rate from August to October.

Assuming adjustment borrowing of around $600 million--close to the average of recent weeks but below the level expected for the current statement week--the nonborrowed reserve path would call for growth at little over a 4 percent annual rate from August to October, with the federal funds rate probably around 10-1/2--10-3/4 percent. (13) Short-term interest rates are not expected to rise significantly further over the next few weeks under alternative A. Indeed, some temporary drop in short rates could occur as bank reserve positions under this alternative may be less taut than market participants currently expect.

With short- rates remaining relatively high and the economy apparently strengthening, there appears to be little scope for declines in bond or mortgage rates. Indeed, mortgage rates could drift up a bit more under alternative A, in part reflecting the recent run-up in the cost of deposits.

With short- rates remaining relatively high and the economy apparently strengthening, there appears to be little scope for declines in bond or mortgage rates. Indeed, mortgage rates could drift up a bit more under alternative A, in part reflecting the recent run-up in the cost of deposits.  Alternative B calls for about 2 percentage points less growth in M-1A and M-1B than alternative A over the last four months of the year.

Over the QIV '79-QIV '80 period, M-2 growth would remain above the Committee's upper limit under this alternative.  The specifications for alternative B would require total reserve growth from August to October at a little more than a 6 percent annual rate.
