If the Committee shares that assessment, it may see financial conditions as probably already tight enough, at least for a time, to limit any further step-up in  alternative B, which keeps the federal funds rate unchanged.

Thus, their reaction to the choice of alternative B will depend largely on that balance assessment.

But prices would likely be bid up somewhat if balanced risks were chosen because participants would see this choice as raising the possibility of a near-term reduction in the target funds rate. (10) If the Committee judges that core inflation probably will trend higher, as in the staff forecast, and finds the likely degree of economic weakness to be less of a concern, then it might want to act promptly to resist the acceleration in prices by tightening policy 25 basis points, as in alternative C. The need for action might seem particularly pressing if core inflation were viewed as having already moved above the range consistent with effective price stability in the long run.

These financial market effects would be tempered if the Committee were to adopt a statement that risks were now balanced, which would presumably be interpreted as indicating that further tightening was not likely any time soon. (12) If the Committee believes that economic growth likely will remain below that of its potential at the current funds rate, along the lines of the staff forecast, but thinks that the existing level of resource use may be sustainable, then it might choose the 25 basis point  alternative A in order to forestall an unnecessary rise in the unemployment rate.

Adoption of alternative A, therefore, would trigger a rally in bond and stock markets, though the extent would depend on the accompanying statement of the balance of risks.
