economy has overshot its sustainable productive potential, it may be disposed to tighten its policy stance, as in the 25 basis point rise in the funds rate in alternative C. With markets still somewhat unsettled, the extent of their reactions to a policy tightening is especially difficult to gauge, and the odds that those reactions, both in the United States and abroad, could be outsized are probably higher than usual.

For example, in the staff forecast, a decline of around 20 percent in stock prices over the next year or so is a key element in limiting the rise in inflation.  Alternative B, which would leave the intended federal funds rate at 5-1 percent, could be chosen at this meeting either merely as a deferral of a tighter stance until financial markets have become more resilient, or, more positively, as a justifiable policy posture, absent some change in the tenor of incoming information about inflation prospects.

long-term rates edge higher and especially should speculative pressures on Latin American markets subside.  The staff anticipates that, under alternative B, M2 and M3 will grow at annual rates of 4-1/2 and 6-1/4 percent, respectively, over the five months from October to March of next year.
