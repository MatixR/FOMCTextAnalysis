Only minor variations in growth rates would be expected under alternative B. Chart 1 Actual and Targeted M-1A and M-1B - Longer-Run Range - ****Short-Run Alternatives 0 N 0 J - Longer-Run Range .

The slower savings deposit and MMMF growth is expected to be partly offset by a pick-up in small time deposit expansion as MMC yields rise and as growth in the 30-month SSCs continues strong. These projections imply that the gaps between the growth rates of M-1A and M-1B, on the one hand, and M-1B and M-2, on the other, will narrow sub- stantially from what has occurred in the past two months.  Under alternative A, given the demand for transactions balances implied by the staff's stronger economic projection for the current quarter, money market interest rates are likely to remain at the higher levels attained recently.

In the business sector, although total borrowing probably will rise in coming weeks, a significant portion of the increase will reflect a rebuilding of liquidity positions. (13) To achieve the growth in the aggregates specified under alternative A, total reserves would have to expand at about a 5 percent annual rate from July to September.

With member bank borrowings at such minimal levels, the federal funds rate would be expected to fluctuate around the current 10 percent discount rate.  Alternative B calls for a slower expansion in the aggregates-- with growth of M-1A below the minimum targets adopted by the Committee last month--in order to counter the tendency for M-2 growth to exceed the Committee's longer-run range. To achieve the alternative B targets, growth in total reserves at about a 5 percent annual rate would be required.

official purchases of foreign currencies to repay swap debt. (15) A simple extrapolation of the June to September target for M-1A under alternative A would yield a 4 percent growth of this aggregate for the QIV '79 to QIV '80 period. Alternative B could be viewed as consistent with M-1A growth over the longer period of 3 percent-- the lower bound of the Committee's long-run range.
