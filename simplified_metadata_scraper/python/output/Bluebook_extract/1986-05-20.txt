Alterna- tive B assumes maintenance of about current pressures on reserve positions, while alternative A and alternative C contemplate a moderate easing and tightening of reserve pressures, respectively.

The funds rate range of 5 to 9 percent suggested for alternative B- one percentage point lower than the range now in the directive-is about centered on the area of federal funds trading that has prevailed under existing reserve conditions since the discount rate was cut to 6-1/2 percent.

Over the last two quarters of the year, M1 growth would have to slow to a 5 percent annual rate to hit the upper end of its annual range. This could entail some rise in interest rates over the second half, especially if economic activity strengthens as expected.  M2 growth under alternative B also would slow over the rest of the second quarter--though still recording a much faster advance than during the first three months of the year.

As growth of core deposits ebbs, banks should resume issuance of large CDs to help finance some pickup in bank credit growth from its recent depressed pace, and thus M3 is expected to slow relatively little in June.  Under alternative B market interest rates are likely to fluctuate near recent levels in coming weeks, with the 3-month Treasury 4 percent.

This growth would leave the debt aggregate in June well above its long-run range.  Under alternative A, which entails discount window borrowing falling to frictional levels of $100 to $150 million, the funds rate would 2 percent discount rate.

Concerns about the future attractiveness of dollar assets could possibly intensify under these cir- cumstances, tempering declines in long-term interest rates.  The specifications of alternative A contemplate a less marked deceleration of M over the rest of the quarter, with growth in June close to 9 percent.

With the strength in core deposits holding down needs for managed liabilities, M3 would be expected to grow around 7-1/2 percent over the last two months of the quarter, remaining a bit above the midpoint of its range.  Alternative C encopasses an increase in discount window 550 million.
