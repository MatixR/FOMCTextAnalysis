Prospective developments (8) If the Committee wishes to continue with a policy that encompasses financial flows and credit conditions consistent with a 5 per cent rate of growth for the money supply, the following language for the alternative A): To implement this policy, the Committee seeks to promote [DEL:some easing of conditions in credit markets and somewhat greater MODERATE growth in money over the months ahead than occurred in the second quarter, while taking account of possible liquidity problems and allowing bank credit growth to reflect BANK EFFORTS TO REBUILD LIQUIDITY AND any continued shift of credit flows from market to banking channels.

Alternative B (14) Should the Committee desire to seek a 6 per cent growth rate for the money supply over the fourth quarter and a significant easing in credit market conditions, it may wish to consider the following alternative B): To implement this policy, the Committee seeks to promote some FURTHER easing of conditions in credit markets and somewhat greater growth in money over the months ahead than occurred in the first half of the year, while taking account of possible liquidity problems and allowing bank credit growth to reflect BANK EFFORTS TO REBUILD LIQUIDITY AND any continued shift of credit flows from market to banking channels.

(17) Attainment of the more rapid growth in the money supply indicated in the above tables would require a more pronounced easing of money market conditions than under Alternative A. These easier conditions might include a Federal funds rate fluctuating in a 5-3/4--6-1/4 per cent range, member bank borrowings around $300-$400 million and net borrowed 250 million range.

On the other hand, some partly offsetting upward interest rate pressure, chiefly in longer maturity ranges, might develop if there were a heightening of expectations that signifi- cantly easier credit availability would lead to intensification of inflationary conditions later on. (18) The adjusted credit proxy is expected to grow some- what more rapidly, along with the more rapid growth in money supply, as compared with alternative A. Money supply growth is not expected to become more rapid until October, although the exact lags over the near- term in public and bank responses to monetary policy changes are con- jectural.

Thus, the upward effect on the adjusted bank credit proxy of the rather marked lowering of market interest rates expected under this alterna- tive might not be extremely sharp, and will likely depend in part on the extent to which businesses switch from open market to bank borrowing and on the extent to which banks and dealers take speculative positions in securities. (19) Weekly figures for monetary aggregates over the period between now and the next meeting are shown in the table below (with the money supply figures linked to the published series as under alternative A).
