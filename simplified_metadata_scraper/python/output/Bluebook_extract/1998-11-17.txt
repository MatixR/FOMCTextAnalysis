A slight additional easing at this meeting, as in the 25 basis point reduction in the federal funds rate of alternative A, could be considered broadly in line with the policy assumption underlying the staff forecast.

Finally, an easing would help to offset some of the effects of both the tightening in lending terms and standards at commercial banks that has been under way and the softness in global economic activity that has been exacerbated by further weakness in Japan.  The 25 basis point easing of policy under alternative A would tend to boost most financial markets, given that the federal funds futures market evidently now has built in only about even odds of such an action at this meeting.

Consequently, rates on short-term private market instruments, such as commercial paper, likely would move a little lower following implementation of alternative A. With the easing perhaps fostering additional attenuation of concerns about private credit risks, the unusual recent safe-harbor demands for Treasuries would 2 Alternative A could be implemented either through a 1/4 percentage point reduction in the discount rate to 4-1/2 percent, or through a slightly more generous provision of nonborrowed reserves, with no discount rate change, that eliminates the spread between the two rates.

Leaving policy unchanged at this meeting, as under alternative B, would seem even more advisable if the Committee were skeptical that aggregate demand will slow to the extent forecast by the staff.

Changes to date in private financing rates may not have - 11 - imposed strong restraint on planned investment spending and, although the increased cost of raising funds in private securities markets has shifted borrowing toward commercial banks, the growth of aggregate debt in nonfederal sectors appears to have been well maintained. (11) With many market participants likely to be disappointed by policy inaction, yields on private securities could well back up some under alternative B. The increase in rates on Treasury securities likely would be somewhat less, and spreads on private securities over Treasuries probably would widen.

M3 is forecast to outpace M2 as banks seek funding through instruments included in the broader aggregate to finance bank credit 3 The projections of money growth under alternative B assume, consistent with the Greenbook forecast, that the stance of policy is left unchanged at the November meeting and eased 25 basis points at the December meeting.

Under alternative B, M2 and M3 are projected to expand over the October-to-March period at annual rates of 8 and 9-1/2 percent, respectively, leaving both aggregates by March well above the ranges established provisionally for 1999.
