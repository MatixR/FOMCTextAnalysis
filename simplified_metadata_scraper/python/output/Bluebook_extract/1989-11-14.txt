In alternative B, federal funds would continue to trade around 8-1/2 percent, a level expected to be associated with adjustment plus 200 million. In alternative A, a federal funds rate around 8 percent would be accompanied by a borrowing assumption of 100 million.

The exchange value of the dollar could exhibit little net change over the intermeeting period under alternative B, though any policy tightening abroad may tend to exert downward pressure on the dollar.

The exchange value of the dollar could exhibit little net change over the intermeeting period under alternative B, though any policy tightening abroad may tend to exert downward pressure on the dollar. (10) The 1/2 percentage point reduction in the federal funds rate under alternative A would come sooner and be larger than market partici- pants are now expecting.

Bond yields probably would decline noticeably under alternative A; market participants may interpret an immediate further easing as suggesting a more aggressive policy posture by the Federal Reserve, and perhaps an assessment of sub- stantial underlying weakening in the economy.

However, should incoming data show the economy continuing to advance at its recent pace over coming months, in the context of a weaker dollar, the cumulative effect of past easing measures and alternative A over a short time might be viewed as setting the stage for a subsequent strengthening of the economy, raising questions about prospects for prices.

Growth of domestic nonfinancial debt is expected to moderate to around 7 percent over the rest of the year, owing mainly to a slowing of federal government debt. This would leave the debt aggregate in the fourth quarter 8-1/4 percent above its year-earlier level, close to the midpoint of its monitoring range.  Under alternative A, growth of M2 and M3 through December would be boosted slightly by the associated decline in market interest rates and easing of lending conditions.

September-to-December M2 and M3 growth would rise to 8 and 4-3/4 percent rates, respectively. (15) The recent easing, which would be maintained under alterna- tive B, and any additional easing under alternative A, would have impor- tant effects on money growth in the first quarter of next year.

Under alternative B, M2 would expand around the 7 percent upper limit of its tentative range in the early months of 1990. Alternative A likely would yield M2 growth noticeably above the upper end of the tentative growth cone, though well within the parallel lines.
