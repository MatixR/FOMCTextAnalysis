1 strength of recent net inflows of consumer-type time deposits at banks and the lower average level of market interest rates that has already developed and is assumed to continue into the months ahead under this alternative. Alternatives A and C contemplate faster and slower rates of monetary growth, respectively.

Thus, little or no further decline would be expected under alternative B. The Federal funds rate range for that alternative is indicated at 8¼--9½ per cent, centering close to the recently prevailing level.

In the February-March period, M1 growth in a 7½--9½ per cent annual rate range is indicated under alternative B. Because of the sizable shortfall of M 1 in January, such a rate of in- crease is needed to restore M1 to the desired longer-run growth path.

Under alternative A, growth in consumer- type time deposits would probably be even more rapid for a while--at least until further declines in market rates lead banks to begin reducing offering rates for consumer-type deposits.

The expected rise of interest rates under alternative C would reduce the relative attractiveness of consumer-type time deposits, though, judging from recent experience, the effect of higher market rates might be more marked on the specialized thrift institutions than on commercial banks.
