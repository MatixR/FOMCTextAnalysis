Under alternative B, federal funds would continue to trade around 3 percent, in association with the allowance for adjustment and seasonal borrowing initially being maintained at its 100 million.  Under alternative A, the federal 2 percent.

Federal funds would 2 percent under alternative C, in 125 million.

Thus, market interest rates are unlikely to react to the implementation of alternative B. The odds are that bond yields will retrace at least some of their recent back-up if--as anticipated in the greenbook forecast--the news on inflationary pressures proves more favorable.

Further increases in the allowance for borrowing likely will be needed over the intermeeting period to account for expected growth in the demand for seasonal credit during the late spring. exchange markets probably would remain around current levels under alternative B. (10) The 1/2 percentage point reduction in the federal funds rate under alternative A would surprise market participants and should show through almost completely to other short-term interest rates.

Absent corresponding actions abroad to ease monetary policy, downward pressure on the foreign exchange value of the dollar would resume. (11) Market participants also would be surprised by the policy  alternative C at this FOMC meeting.

If the money market condi- tions of this alternative were maintained over the summer, M2 growth would be expected to move up still nearer to that of nominal GDP in the third quarter.  M3 under alternative B is seen as accelerating to about a 4 percent rate over May and June.

Looking further ahead, moderate average growth of M3 during the third quarter would be expected to accompany retention of the specifications of alternative B over that period.

Given still-favorable conditions in longer-term markets under alternative B, issuance of corporate bonds and stocks should remain relatively heavy.

Domestic nonfinancial debt would be expected to move further above the lower edge of its 4-1/2 to 8-1/2 percent monitoring range through June.  The lower interest rates of alternative A would be ex- pected to provide some added lift to growth of the monetary aggregates.

Even with the lower interest rates and consequent economic stimulus of this alternative later in the year, M2 would be unlikely to reach the lower end of its annual range by the fourth quarter.  Under alternative C, the higher money market interest rates and opportunity costs would restrain the monetary aggregates.
