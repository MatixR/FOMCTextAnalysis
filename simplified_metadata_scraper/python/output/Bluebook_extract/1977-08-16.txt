Under alternative B, M-1 is expected to expand in a 2-6 per cent, annual rate, range.

Such an expansion would produce an 8¾ per cent annual rate of growth from the second to the third quarter, as compared with a 12 per cent annual rate of growth in nominal GNP projected for that period. (10) Growth in M-2 over the August-September period under alternative B is expected to be in a 4 -8 per cent annual rate range.

These financial adjustments, as they develop, may entail a 3-month bill rate in the 7 per cent area in the first half of 1978, a commercial paper rate in the order of 7¼ per cent, and minor upward adjustments in long-term rates, including a rise in the high- grade corporate bond rate to around 8 per cent and primary mortgage market rates to a little over 9 per cent.  Alternative C involves a rise in the Federal funds rate to the mid-point of a 6¼-6¾ per cent range between now and the next Committee meeting.

And only a very minor further rise in the funds rate might be required in achieving the Committee's current longer-run ranges for the monetary aggregates. (16) The further rise in the funds rate of ½ percentage point over the next few weeks contemplated under alternative C would likely lead to increases of comparable magnitude in short-term rates generally.

As suggested below, the particular language needed in the opening lines of the money market formulation would depend on the specific conditions sought; the three alternatives shown--calling, respectively, for somewhat easier, prevailing, and somewhat firmer money market conditions--are intended to be associated with the specifications  alternatives A, B, and C.
