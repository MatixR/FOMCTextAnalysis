Of the alternatives shown below for Committee consideration, alternative B involves a November-December growth rate for M-1 that achieves a 4½ percent rate of expansion from September to December, but with an accompanying M-2 growth above the Committee's earlier target. Alternative C is based on a lower M-1 growth rate, and includes an M-2 growth closer to, though still above, the Committee's earlier objective. Alternative A involves more rapid growth in the aggregates.

This would probably be reflected mainly in a rapid December growth rate. (13) The staff would expect that expansion in the aggregates as specified under alternative B could be attained by growth rates) in the family of reserve measures over November and December as follows: monetary base, 7 percent; total reserves,7 percent; and non- borrowed reserves, 15 percent.

Bank acquisitions of securities could pick up, however, especially if the market becomes even more convinced that the peak in interest rates for this cycle has been reached. (16) Pressures on thrift institutions are unlikely to ease over the next few weeks under alternative B. However, if the funds rate drops a little, and corporate bond yields do decline, mortgage rates could edge off.

It is not likely, though, that mortgage market conditions will improve markedly unless short-term market rates drop significantly and/or adjustments favorable to thrift institutions are made in deposit ceiling rates.  The specifications of alternative C involve slower growth in the monetary aggregates than alternative B, as indicated in the table .

On the assumption that adoption of this alternative would mean that the Committee desires greater assurance that growth rates for the aggregates will not be excessive, the upper limit of the proposed funds rate range has been raised slightly from that of alternative B. Consistent with such an approach, the nonborrowed reserve path for this alternative has been constructed on the assumption that borrowings average a shade under $2 billion, implying growth in nonborrowed reserves of around 8¾ percent over November and December--considerably less than the alternative B pace.

If the discount rate were raised, in light of a continuing relatively wide gap between the discount and federal funds rates, additional nonborrowed reserves would have to be provided unless the Committee wished to tolerate further upward pressures on market rates--a decision that might depend in part on the behavior at the time of monetary aggregates, total reserves, and the monetary base.  Adoption of alternative C would probably lead to some rebound in market interest rates, as expectations that interest rates had already peaked were disappointed.

Pressures on thrift institutions would be somewhat more intense than under alternative B, mortgage rates would probably rise a little further, and the bank prime rate would also be under further upward pressure.

Any increase of interest rates might be quite modest in magnitude and short-lived, however, if business news were adverse. Nevertheless, the higher rate levels than under alternative B would tend to hold down money demanded in early 1980, implying a decline of interest rates early in the new year if the Committee wishes to provide the reserves needed to keep M-1 in the first quarter of next year on the midpoint of its longer-run growth path--assumed for these purposes to be a 6 percent rate of growth.

The growth in the monetary base and total reserves over November and December implied by that alternative--at 7¾ and 7½ percent, annual rates, respectively--are only slightly more rapid than under alternative B. However, growth in nonborrowed reserves, at over a 20 percent annual rate, would be con- siderably more rapid.

Such growth is consistent with an initial decline in the funds rate to around 12 percent and a drop in member bank borrowing to around $1 billion or so, given the prevailing 12 percent discount rate. The funds rate range proposed for this alternative is 10½ to 15½ percent, involving a reduction in the lower limit as compared with alternative B. (20) The approach to open market operations of alternative A would exert considerably downward pressure on market interest rates generally as more and more participants came to believe rates had peaked.

This decline of interest rates would ease cost pressures on banks and thrift institutions, but would not, given present ceiling rates, substantially increase deposit flows to thrifts, relative to alternative B, even if the funds rate began to approach its 10½ percent alternative A lower limit.

It now appears that ATS effects will be negligible in 1980, implying a 4½ to 7½ percent M-1 range, centering on 6 percent. (21) The monetary aggregates targeted over the last two months of the year under alternative A would not lead to growth in the monetary aggregates for the year 1979 very much different from that of alternative B, but the lower interest rates associated with this alternative might tend to moderate the expected recession in economic activity and tend to increase the quantity of money demanded in early 1980.
