Under alternative B, federal funds trading would be expected to average around 6-1/4 percent, with the assumption for ad- 100 million.

Under alter- native A, the funds rate would decline to the area of 5-3/4 percent. Alternative A could be implemented by a reduction of the borrowing assump- 75 million.

Because of the low levels of borrowing at present, the difference  alternatives A and B remains unusually small.

Consequently, maintenance of current reserve market conditions under alternative B likely would have relatively little impact on interest rates.

Over a more extended period, however, long- term interest rates could back up a bit if information suggesting some revitalization of the economy, as in the staff forecast, led market par- ticipants to conclude that the easing of monetary policy had run its course for the current business cycle. (22) With little market anticipation of an immediate further easing, money market rates under alternative A are likely to fall roughly in line with the decline of the federal funds rate.

Some hints of a pickup of M2 were already in evidence in January, and an acceleration to an average pace of about 4-1/2 percent over February and March would be expected under alternative B. Under the lower money market rates of al- ternative A, the acceleration would be even greater, to 5-1/2 percent over the two months.

Alternative B would leave Alternative Levels and Growth Rates for Key Monetary Aggregates M2 M3 M1 Alt.

Under alternative A, M2 still would be in the lower portion of its range by March, but would be on a trajectory to move around the midpoint by June.

Under alternative A, M2 still would be in the lower portion of its range by March, but would be on a trajectory to move around the midpoint by June. (25) M3 would be expected to expand at a 3-3/4 percent pace over the December-to-March period under alternative B and a little more under alternative A.
