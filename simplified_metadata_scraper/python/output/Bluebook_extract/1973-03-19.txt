Prospective developments (6) Presented below in summary form (with figures for aggregates representing seasonally adjusted annual rates of change) are March-April ranges for monetary aggregates and money market con- ditions associated with three alternative longer-run targets.1/ The longer-run targets are indexed by growth rates for M 1 of 7, 5-1/2, and 4 per cent over the next two quarters for alternatives A B, and C, respectively.

A Alt Longer-run targets (represented by growth rates for 2nd and 3rd quarters of 1973) M1 7 5-1/2 4 M2  9 6 4 Credit Proxy 10-1/2 9 8 RPD 9-1/2 8 6-1/2 Associated ranges for March-April 1973 Nonborrowed RPD 23-25 12-14 4-6 RPD 15-1/2-17-1/2 14-1/2--16-1/2 13-1/2-15-1/2 M1  6-8 5-1/2-7-1/2 5-7 M2  8-10 7-9 6-8 Federal funds rate 5-3/4--7 6-1/2--7-1/2 7--8-1/4 1/ More detailed monthly and quarterly figures are shown in the table (7) Given the cumulative impact of monetary restraint, the staff believes that growth in the monetary aggregates at the rates shown for alternative B would involve little further change in money market conditions.

RPD growth in the March-April period consistent with these aggregates is projected to be relatively large, however, partly because it reflects a further sharp increase in large CD's, and also because of the effects of lagged reserve accounting. (8) Assuming adoption of the somewhat larger growth rates for the aggregates as a longer-run target under alternative A, money market conditions would be likely to ease down through the range shown for that option over the next few weeks.

On the other hand, an effort to secure a slowing in rates of growth in the monetary aggregates of the dimensions shown under alternative C would be likely to entail a further rise in the Federal funds rate from current levels.

Such a slowing would be expected under alter- native B, and would be even more marked under alternative C; however, this does not allow for any change in Regulation Q ceilings on consumer-type time and savings deposits.

The reference to credit markets is pro- posed for elimination only in alternative A, the only alternative that contemplates a significant easing of the money market.
