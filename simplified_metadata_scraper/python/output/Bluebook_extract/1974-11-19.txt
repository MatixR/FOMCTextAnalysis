'74-Mar M1 6½ 5¾ 5 M2  9 8  Credit proxy 5½ 5 4 Associated ranges of tolerance for Nov.-Dec. M1  7¾-9¾ 7-9 6½-8½ M2  9-11 8¼-10¼ 7½-9½ RPD 4½-6½ 3-5 2½-4½ Federal funds rate 7½-9½ 8¼-10¼ 9-11 (inter-meeting range)  Alternative B continues the 5¾ per cent annual growth rate for M1 previously adopted by the Committee.

Government deposits are projected to decline substantially (after seasonal adjustment).  Alternative A provides for the greater easing in money market conditions over the near term that would be needed if the Committee were to adopt higher longer-run targets for the monetary aggregates, indexed by a 6½ per cent growth rate for M1 .

Alternative C provides for the tightening of money market conditions that would be required if the Committee were to lower its longer-run target for M 1 to 5 per cent.

The volume of new offerings is expected to remain strong and the recent surge of investor interest is likely to moderate at current yield levels, given continuing inflationary expectations.  Under alternative B, net inflows at banks of time and savings deposits other than money market CD's would probably remain fairly substantial.

Mortgage markets would ease at a more rapid pace under alternative A, since there would be a more substantial rebound in deposit inflows at thrift institutions as market interest rates dropped further.

In view of concerns about liquidity and capital, banks have become quite cautious in their lending and investment policies. While the prime loan rate could be expected to decline further under either alternative A or B, it would still probably remain high relative to market rates in the weeks ahead.

Banks may, however, show more interest in security acquisitions in the period ahead than they have most recently, particularly under alternative A but also to some extent under alternative B, to take advantage of the apparent opportunity for capital gains.
