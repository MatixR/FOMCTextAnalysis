Alternative B calls for a growth rate of 3 percent over the two months, which would bring the level of M-1B well into the lower half of its range by June.

Alternative B calls for a growth rate of 3 percent over the two months, which would bring the level of M-1B well into the lower half of its range by June. (10) All of the alternatives contemplate slower growth in M-2 than expected at the time of the Committee's previous meeting, when a March to June M-2 target of 10 percent was considered acceptable. We would now expect growth of M-2 at about a 7 to 8 percent annual rate over the March-June period for alternative C. Somewhat higher growth rates would be expected under alternatives A and B.

As shown in chart 2, the level of M-2 in June would be at the upper bound of its longer-run range for the year under alternative C, while it would remain somewhat above the range under the other two alternatives.

Even under alternative A--which involves growth in total reserves from April to June at an 8 percent annual rate-- the federal funds rate seems likely to remain in a 17 to 20 percent range over the balance of the quarter.

Even under alternative A--which involves growth in total reserves from April to June at an 8 percent annual rate-- the federal funds rate seems likely to remain in a 17 to 20 percent range over the balance of the quarter.1/ Assuming the present discount rate structure, adjustment borrowing would probably be around $1 to $2 billion. Continued high long-term rates may tend to induce firms to focus their growing credit demands on banks and other sources of short-term credit over the near term--although the limited flexibility of many borrowers and a desire to stem the deterioration of balance sheets likely will maintain bond issuance at a high level.  Alternatives B and C would call for a growth in total reserves over the April to June period at annual rates of 6 and 4 percent, respectively.

A federal funds rate around 20 percent or a bit higher is 1/ Projections of federal funds rates for the year 1981 under all three alternatives are shown in appendix II. likely to emerge over the next few weeks under alternative B, while the funds rate under C could rise further.

Given current discount rates, borrowing at the discount window might rise to around the $2 billion area under alternative B and to around Of course, any increase in the present discount rate level and structure would work to reduce the demand for borrowing.

Other short-term rates would probably rise substantially further under these alternatives, with upward pressures particularly intense under alternative C. Long-term interest rates would also rise further over the weeks ahead, probably inducing a large volume of postponements and cancellations of bond financings.

Long-term interest rates would also rise further over the weeks ahead, probably inducing a large volume of postponements and cancellations of bond financings. (14) The outlook for interest rates under all three alternatives suggests continued weakness in mortgage demands and also intense earnings pressures on thrift institutions, with alternative C implying a higher probability of a number of failures this summer.

If it appears during the period before the next meeting that fluctuations in the federal funds rate, taken over a period of time, within a range of [DEL: 13] ____ to [DEL: 18] ____ percent are likely to be inconsistent with the monetary and related reserve paths, the Manager for Domestic Operations is promptly to notify the Chairman, who will then decide whether the situation calls for supplementary instructions from the Committee.
