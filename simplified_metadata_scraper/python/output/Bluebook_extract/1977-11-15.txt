A Alt Ranges for Nov.-Dec. M-1 2½ to 7 2 to 7 1½ to 6½ M-2 5½ to 9½ 5 to 9 4½ to 8½ Federal funds rate (Intermeeting period) 5¾ to 6¼ 6¼ to 6¾ 6¾ to 7¼  Under alternative B, the Federal funds rate would be expected to remain near the mid-point of the 6¼ to 6¾ per cent rate range specified by the Committee at its last meeting.

The increases in money market rates would, of course, be accompanied by a return to higher rates of velocity growth, as shown in Appendix II. (10) Growth in M-2 over the November-December period is likely to be in a 5 to 9 per cent annual rate range under Alternative B. The time and savings deposit component of M-2 under this alternative is expected to continue to expand at near its recent pace.

Such inflows may moderate somewhat further over the next few weeks under alternative B, and can be expected to decelerate markedly in 1978 if the projected rise of interest rates materializes.

Under these circumstances, it appears likely that yields on long-term bonds will be relatively stable over the near term and could even edge down a bit.  Alternative C contemplates an increase in the Federal funds rate to the mid-point of a 6¾ to 7¼ per cent range between now and the next Committee meeting.

With additional monetary restraint in place some- what sooner, the staff would expect growth in the monetary aggregates to be somewhat slower over the next few months than under Alternative B. Con- sequently, somewhat less monetary restraint would be needed later in 1978, and interest rates would rise a little less next year under alternative C than under B.

Long-term rates would probably rise considerably less, on balance, than short-term market rates, particularly in view of the large volume of investable funds available from insurance companies and pension funds. (16) An easing in the funds rate to the mid-point of a 5¾ to 6¾ per cent range, as envisioned under Alternative A, could stimulate sub- stantial downward adjustments in interest rates.

As suggested below, the particular language needed in the opening lines of the money market formulation would depend on the specific conditions sought; the three alternatives shown--calling, respec- tively, for somewhat easier, prevailing, and somewhat firmer money market conditions--are intended to be associated with the specifications discussed  alternatives A, B, and C.

Increases in the discount rate would, of course, shift the composition of total reserves more toward nonborrowed than borrowed reserves).
