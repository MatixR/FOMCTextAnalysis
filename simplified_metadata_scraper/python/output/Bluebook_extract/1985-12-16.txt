Alternative A conteplates a decline in borrowing to a range of $200 to $250 million and an associated drop in the 2 percent discount rate.

A slight firming of money market conditions is assumed under alternative C, involving an increase in discount window borrowing to around $550 to $600 million, with federal funds likely to trade in the neighborhood of 8-1/8 percent.

Relationships in the first quarter among M1, interest rates, and income are more than usually difficult to predict, however, largely because of uncer- tainties about when the unusual weakness of M1 velocity in recent quarters will wane or be reversed.

Specifically, under alternative B, M1 growth from the fourth- quarter 1985 base to March would be around 8-1/2 percent at an annual rate--above the upper end but within the parallel band associated with its tentative 1986 range.

The modest firming of money market conditions associated with alternative C would be expected to bring M1 closer to the upper end of the tentative long-run range, while the easier reserve conditions of alternative A are likely to put M1 near the upper edge of its band.

The rate of increase of mortgage indebtedness is anticipated to continue relatively strong, as the recent drop in mortgage rates works to sustain homebuilding. (13) Assuming little change in reserve market conditions as under alternative B, long-term interest rates are likely to stabilize around their recently reduced levels, or perhaps back up somewhat.

Short-term rates under alternative B could reverse much of their very recent declines, which appear to have been influenced by anticipation of some easing in monetary policy by early next year.

Should reserve conditions ease, as contemplated under alternative A, long-term interest rates would probably continue to drop, though probably not as rapidly as in recent weeks because further rate declines may begin to foster an actual or anticipated increase in longer-term borrowing.

The firming of reserve conditions contemplated under alternative C, although slight, would be quite unexpected and would prompt a substantial back up in short-term and long-term rates, at least for a time.
