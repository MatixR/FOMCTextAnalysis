Of the alternatives shown, alternative B--which is indexed by a long-run growth rate of 5-1/4 per cent for M 1--represents essentially a continuation of longer-run monetary targets adopted by the Committee at its last meeting (stipulated at the time as 5--5-1/2 . Alternative A represents an easing of policy, and alternative C a tightening.

C 29,614 29,756 30,118 30,182 30,907 30,638  The staff expects that the alternative B path for the aggregates would be achieved with little change from recently prevailing money market conditions.

Banks are expected to con- tinue adding substantially to CD's outstanding, although the rate of growth should decrease somewhat as businesses shift more of their borrowing to the open narket.  Under alternative A, the staff would expect a decline in the Federal funds rate to accompany an effort to encourage more rapid growth in the aggregates, and vice-versa for alternative C.

However, even-keel may constrain the Committee's willingness to adopt reserve objectives that lead to changes in money narket conditions of the  alternatives A and C.

If the Committee were to choose alternative A or C, but limit the downward or upward movement of the funds rate to smaller dimensions than indicated, it would, of course, extend the period needed to achieve the aggregate objectives of either alternative.
