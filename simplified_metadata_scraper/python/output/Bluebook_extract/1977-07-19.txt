Growth rates for reserve measures in this and subsequent tables are adjusted to remove the effect of discontinuities from breaks in the series when reserve requirements are changed. Prospective developments (8) Shown below for the Committee's consideration are four alternative sets of longer-run ranges for the monetary aggregates-- alternatives A through D--that pertain to the one year period, QII '77- QII '78.

A Alt M1 4½-7 4½-6½ 4-6½ 3½-6 4½-6½ M2  7-10 7-9½ 6½-9½ 6-9 7-9½ M3  8-11 8-10½ 7½-10½ 7-10 8½-11 Bank credit 7½-10½ 7½-10½ 7-10 6½-9½ 7-10  Under alternative B, the one year growth ranges for M-1 and M-2 are the same as those adopted by the Committee in April.

Alternative A encompasses a little more 1/ Growth in the bank credit proxy--the sum of all deposits and certain borrowings of member banks--has been consistently below the targets adopted by the Committee, and has in the past year diverged increasingly from bank credit, as may be seen from the table on p.

The specifi- cations of alternative D, however, involve a larger adjustment in the ranges, with the midpoint of the growth range for M-1 reduced to 4¾ per cent over the QII '77-QII '78 period.

A Alt 826.7 832.7 838.6 820.6 840.0 859.2 826.7 832.7 838.5 820.6 839.4 857.8 826.7 832.7 838.4 820.6 839.2 857.1 877.3 875.3 874.1 895.2 893.4 892.0 Growth Rates Monthly: 1977 July August Quarterly Average: 1977 QII 1978 QI Semi-annual: QII '77-QIV '77 QIV '77-QII '78 Annual: QI '77-QI '78 QI '77-QII '78 QII '77-QII '78 826.7 832.7 838.4 820.6 839.2 856.0 872.0 887.2  Under alternative B, the proposed Federal funds rate range is the same as that adopted by the Committee at its previous meeting.

However, in the late summer and early fall, with Treasury borrowing expanding considerably further and demands for money and liquidity pressing against the available supply, upward pressures on interest rates are likely to develop. (13) Further increases in interest rates are likely to develop late this year and in the first half of next year if the midpoints of the longer-run growth ranges contemplated under alternative B are to be achieved.

Federal funds rate projections four quarters ahead are shown in Appendix II).  As noted earlier, both alternatives C and D contemplate lower longer-run growth ranges for the monetary aggregates than alternative B. While the reduction is substantially larger in the case of alternative D, in either case the Committee may wish to consider a rise in the funds rate between now and the next meeting to around 5-7/8 per cent, the midpoint of a 5½-6¼ per cent range.

Even under the short-run specifications of alternative C, there would appear to be sufficient leeway between ceiling rates in time certificates maturing in four years or more and yields on market instruments to enable banks to retain the certificates.

They could, however, lose some funds to thrift institutions, which can offer somewhat higher rates. (16) The rise in market rates of interest over the next few weeks accompanying short-run alternative C Treasury bill rate above the 5¼ per cent ceiling rate on thrift institution savings deposits.

Under alternative C we would expect that thrifts would become less willing to commit funds to the mortgage market at near the recent pace.

In any event, upward pressures on corporate and tax exempt bond yields are likely to be relatively modest, given the substantial supply of investible funds at insurance companies and other institutional investors. (17) If the Committee wishes to achieve the midpoints of the longer-run growth ranges for alternative C--indexed by an M-1 range of 4-6 per cent--the staff expects that the funds rate would need to rise only a little further and would top out at around 6¼ per cent in the first quarter of 1978.

The greater restraint on growth of the monetary aggregates over the longer-run under alternative D would require a larger rise of interest rates to levels closer to those projected at the previous FOMC meeting.

The greater restraint on growth of the monetary aggregates over the longer-run under alternative D would require a larger rise of interest rates to levels closer to those projected at the previous FOMC meeting. The funds rate may rise to around 6½ per cent in the first quarter of next year and probably further to a level of 6¾ per cent by the second quarter.  Alternative A contemplates an easing of money market conditions between now and the next Committee meeting.

But assuming that incoming economic news does not cast doubt on the fundamental strength of the economy, interest rate declines may be limited over the next month or so as corporations and State and local governments increase market borrowing in anticipation of higher interest rates later on and as the market focuses on the Treasury's large fall cash need. (19) We would expect the funds rate to begin rising in the fall under alternative A if growth in the aggregates is to remain around the midpoints of the longer-run ranges for this alternative.

Given the degree of near-term ease assumed, the funds rate by spring may have to be at or slightly above the level assumed at that time under alternative B in order to constrain monetary growth in the first half of next year to the indicated rate.

Meanwhile, however, for most of the one-year period ahead, short- term rates would have been lower than under alternative B, with consequent relatively easier credit and liquidity conditions at banks and other institutions.

As suggested below, the particular language needed in the opening lines of the money market formulation would depend on the specific conditions sought; the three alternatives shown--calling, respectively, for somewhat easier, prevailing, and somewhat firmer money market conditions-- are intended to be associated with the specifications discussed in the pre-  alternatives A, B, and C.

The second column shows the levels of M1 and M2 in the first and second quarters of 1978 implied by midpoint I - 2 growth rates of current longer-run paths (which take QI '77 as the base). The last four columns show levels of M1 and M2 for the first and second quarters of 1978 implied by the alternatives presented in this blue book (which take QII '77 as the base). As may be seen, alternatives A through C imply higher midpoint levels for both M and M2 in QI '78 and QII '78 than would be implicit in extension of Committee ranges based on QI '77 or QIV '76.

For example, under alternative B, M1 in QII '78 would be cent) above the implied level for that quarter derived by extending the midpoint of the current M1 growth range to the second quarter of 1978 . M2 in QII '78 under alternative B would be .

M2 in QII '78 under alternative B would be .3 of a per cent above such an implied level. Alternative D would achieve the implied QII '78 level based on 5 per cent growth from QI '77, but it would fall slightly short of achieving the QII '78 level that would be implied if the base were carried back to QIV '76. Alternative D would also fall short of achieving the implied QII '78 levels for M2 based on the earlier paths.
