(2) The actual course of the monetary aggregates in recent weeks is compared with the alternative B paths of the previous bluebook in-the following rable.

Excess reserves have been volatile over the past three weeks, and net borrowed reserves of member banks have ranged from $350 to $950 million, with the average level considerably deeper than in June.

Alternative B. (5) Although M1 in July has turned out to be somewhat stronger than previously projected, the need for reserves in the first three weeks of the month was considerably less than expected (as shown by the .

Thus, with the need for reserves reduced, growth of member bank total reserves in July is falling substantially short of what was implied by the alternative B path at the time of the last Committee meeting, as shown in the table above, despite the sharp rise in member bank borrowings.

1 Alternative A Alternative B Federal funds rate 5-1/2% 5-1/2--6% .

1 Alternative A Alternative B Federal funds rate 5-1/2% 5-1/2--6% Member bank borrowings $.8--$1 billion $.9--$1.2 billion 3-month bill rate 5-3/8--5-5/8% 5-1/2--6-1/8% Growth in M1 (SAAR) August 6% 5-1/2% September 8-1/2% 8% 3rd Quarter 9% 8-1/2% 4th Quarter 4% 2-1/2%  The money market specifications for alternative A represent a continuation of conditions recently prevailing, as would be consistent with .

Specifications for alternative B, on the other hand, would envisage a gradual firming of the money market, to the extent permitted by the Treasury financing, to a Federal funds rate of 6 per cent by late in the inter-meeting period; a funds rate fluctuating around 6 per cent has been assumed for the alternative B paths for the monetary aggregates.

Under alternative B, growth is expected to be only about 1/2 percentage point lower than under alternative A in the 2 percentage points lower in the fourth quarter.

Thus, under alternative A, growth in M2 is expected to drop to a 6-1/2 per cent annual rate in August, and to 8 per cent in the third quarter; growth would be a little slower under alternative B.

Reserve growth would be somewhat less under alternative B, particularly for nonborrowed reserves, with part of the drop-off in nonborrowed offset by increased borrowing.

The following table shows monthly average levels of total and nonborrowed reserves (in millions of dollars)--both seasonally adjusted and unadjusted  alternatives A and B.

(16) The slowing of growth in M1 and accompanying reserve developments under alternative A would not be expected to lead to higher interest rates in either short- or long-term markets, at least in the immediate future.

At the same time, however, it is not clear that the upward interest rate pressures would be long sustained, particularly in long-term markets, in view of the likelihood that credit demands will be moderate and the possibility that a further move toward achieving lower monetary growth rates would over time have a constructive influence on market psychology. Possible directive language (18) This section presents possible language for the second paragraph of the directive corresponding to the two alternative policy courses discussed above.  Alternative A. This language is proposed for possible use if the Committee decides to call for maintaining about the money market conditions that have recently been attained, subject to a proviso clause.

This language is proposed for possible use if the Committee decides to call for maintaining about the money market conditions that have recently been attained, subject to a proviso clause. "To implement this policy, [DEL: the Committee seeks to achieve more moderate growth in monetary aggregates over the months ahead, taking account of developments in capital markets.] System open market operations until the next meeting of the Committee shall be conducted with a view to MAINTAINING PREVAILING [DEL: achieving bank reserve and] money market conditions; [DEL: consistent with these objectives] PROVIDED THAT SOMEWHAT FIRMER CONDITIONS SHALL BE SOUGHT, TAKING ACCOUNT OF THE CURRENT TREASURY FINANCING AND OF DEVELOPMENTS IN CAPITAL MARKETS, IF IT APPEARS THAT THE MONETARY AND CREDIT AGGREGATES ARE SIGNIFICANTLY EXCEEDING THE GROWTH PATHS EXPECTED." If the Committee adopts this alternative, it may wish to consider the money market conditions noted for alternative A in paragraph of "prevailing" conditions, and for purposes of the proviso clause to adopt the aggregate growth paths discussed earlier in connection with alternative A paths.

The proposed language contemplates that in making operating decisions under the proviso clause the Manager would take account of both the current Treasury financing and developments in capital markets.  Alternative B. This language is proposed for possible use if the Committee decides to hold to the course of continued orderly firming of bank reserve and money market conditions, insofar as that might be necessary to maintain downward pressure on the growth rates of the aggregates and insofar as such firming proves to be feasible in light of the current Treasury financing.

unless the monetary aggregates appear to be increasing at rates well below those discussed earlier under alternative B. On the other hand, the formulation of this alternative--with its greater emphasis on monetary aggregates--would also be consistent with the specifications of alternative A (or some modification thereof) since a more moderate growth in M1 in particular is indicated in the paths associated with alternative A.
