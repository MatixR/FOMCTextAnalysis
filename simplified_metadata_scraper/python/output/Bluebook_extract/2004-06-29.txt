Under Alternative A, the existing stance of policy would be maintained at this meeting.  Alternative B would raise the target for the federal funds rate by 25 basis Chart 5 Optimal Policy for the Benchmark Inflation Objective 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Percent Real Federal Funds Rate 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Percent Nominal Federal Funds Rate Greenbook Baseline Optimal Policy 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Percent Civilian Unemployment Rate 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Percent ex.

The real federal funds rate is calculated as the quarterly average nominal funds rate minus the four-quarter lagged core PCE inflation                   rate as a proxy for inflation expectations.

Alternative C would boost the funds rate by 50 basis points to 1½ percent.

(13) If the Committee finds the staff analysis in the Greenbook compelling and the forecasted outcome about the best available in current circumstances, it might implement the 25 basis point firming of Alternative B.  Any earlier concerns the Committee may have harbored about the sustainability of the expansion probably have been assuaged by recent economic indicators, including the past few employment releases and anecdotal information such as that contained in the June Beigebook.

Such a modest move would also be favored if the Committee, like the staff, sees underlying inflation as still low and a considerable degree of slack remaining in resource markets.  In announcing implementation of Alternative B, the Committee would presumably want to modify its existing indication that the accommodative stance of policy is providing “important” support to economic activity but could retain the associated point regarding the impetus given by productivity.

If so, a 50-basis-point increase in the federal funds rate, as in Alternative C, might be favored if Committee members doubt that inflation will be restrained by slack in the economy to the extent forecast by the staff, either because of skepticism about the output gap framework or concern that the economy is closer to potential than estimated by the staff, as in the “Less Room to Grow” scenario in the Greenbook.

In contrast to the language proposed for Alternative B, the announcement accompanying a 50-basis-point hike could indicate that “incoming inflation data are somewhat elevated, and long-term inflation expectations have shown some tendency to edge higher,” as part of the rationale for the action.

With regard to the final sentence of the existing risk assessment, a 50-basis-point move would seem to call for deletion of the “measured” language. (18) The combination of policy action and explanation proposed under Alternative C would come as a considerable shock to market participants.

(19) The Committee might be attracted to the unchanged policy stance of Alternative A if it thinks that the recent increase in inflation owes largely to transient factors and fears that the pace of economic growth might prove insufficient to work down resource slack should policy begin to tighten at this time.

If the Committee were to select Alternative A, presumably it would also retain the judgment it reached at the May meeting that the risks to both sustainable growth and price stability are balanced.
