QIV averages based on staff projection for December  Alternative B--which involves continuation of prevailing bank reserve and money market conditions-contemplates growth in M2 and M1 that would place these aggregates at around the midpoints of their tentative longer-run ranges by March.

Growth of this aggregate on a quarterly average basis would be around a 6 percent annual rate in the first quarter, implying a smaller rise in velocity than in the fourth quarter, but a still substantial 4 percent annual rate. (19) Borrowing at the discount window would be expected to aver- 650 million under alternative B, with federal funds continuing to trade in a 9-1/4 to 9-1/2 percent range, probably nearer the upper end .

Corporate demands on credit markets may pick up as capital spending outpaces the improvement in profits and internal funds.  Alternative A involves an easing of bank reserve positions- with borrowing falling to around $400 million and federal funds dropping to around 9 percent or a little below-that would tend to place M2 and M1 in the upper halves of their tentative longer-run ranges by March.

In the degree that an easing in market conditions over the month ahead contributes to additional strength in economic activity and associated money demands as the year progresses, a tightening of reserve provision and increases in money market rates later next year--possibly to levels above those currently prevailing--may be neces- sary to constrain money to the tentative long-run ranges.  Under alternative C, growth in M2 would be constrained to the lower half of its longer-run range.
