Under alternative B, federal funds would con- tinue to trade around 4 percent, with adjustment plus seasonal borrowing 100 million. 0 Under alternative A, the federal funds rate would decline to the 3-1/2 percent area in association with a 50 million.

M2 would remain in the lower half of its provisional 1992 range through March under both alternatives, but under alternative A would be on a trajectory to move up in its range over the second quarter.

If rates were to edge down, the dollar might come under some downward pressure, but it is not expected to change significantly under this alternative. (24) Short-term interest rates would fall by nearly the 50 basis point decline in the federal funds rate under alternative A. With the funds rate around or perhaps a little below most assessments of the underlying inflation rate, market participants might see such a policy move as unsustainable, thereby limiting the decline in bond rates.

12 Under the easier conditions of alternative A, M2 would be expected to be expanding at a percentage point faster pace in March and into the next quarter; all of the added growth in M2 would occur in M1, other liquid deposits, and M2 money funds.  M3, under alternative B, would expand at only a 2 per- cent annual rate over February and March, after even slower growth in December and January.
