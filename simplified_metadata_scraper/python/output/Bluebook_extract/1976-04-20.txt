From the fourth quarter of '75 to first quarter of '76, M2 and M3 expanded at annual rates very near the mid-points of the ranges and shown above under alternative B); thus, continuation of growth near these rates would be associated with QIV '76 levels close to those implied by the earlier targets.

Our projected Federal funds rate patterns through the first quarter of 1977 for all alternatives are shown in appendix table IV. Under alternative B, the funds rate is expected to reach the 7 per cent level by early next year.

Under alternative B, the funds rate is expected to reach the 7 per cent level by early next year. (10) If the funds rate stays around the mid-point of its alternative B range over the next four weeks, short- and longer-term interest rates are unlikely to change significantly.

While the volume of corporate and municipal bond offerings appears to be dropping off from its exceptional March pace, the forward calendar remains high, and substantial longer-term offerings by the Treasury could exert some upward pressure on bond yields.  Alternative C contemplates a gradual tightening of the money market over the next four weeks to the mid-point of a 4¾-5¾ per cent funds rate range in the process of moving toward lower longer-run growth rates for the aggregates.

This would tend to drop the rate of growth in M2 toward the bottom of the indicated April-May range.  Under alternative C, we expect that interest rates would have to rise considerably further to achieve a 5 per cent M1 growth from QI '76 to QI '77.

By early 1977, the funds rate might be around 7¾ per cent.  Under alternative A, the mid-point of the longer-run growth target for M1 is 7 per cent.

Under alternatives A and B, banks are likely to have sufficient funds available without reliance on significant increases in CD's.
