Even with the unemployment rate drifting up slightly by the end of 2001, the still taut labor market, together with rising non-oil import prices, generates a noticeable pickup in core CPI inflation, to 2-3/4 percent next year and 3 percent in 2001. (7) While the Committee is likely to view an inflation outcome like that in the staff forecast as unacceptable, it still may choose to keep the stance of policy unchanged, as in alternative B. The staff outlook for inflation may strike the Committee as plausible but surrounded by an unusually large element of uncertainty, which may be reduced by the accumulation of additional evidence with the passage of time.

Moreover, recent declines in stock prices and rising risk spreads on some corporate bonds seem to have reflected a heightened investor edginess; in these circumstances, the Committee may be more inclined to keep policy on hold so as not to add to market unease through an unexpected policy tightening.  An unchanged intended federal funds rate, as under alternative B, along with retention of a symmetric directive, would foster the sense that the Committee probably will not act over the remainder of this year, especially given Y2K-related uncertainties.

The choice of alternative B with a tilt toward tightening, which would be announced immediately, would tend to increase the perceived chances of a near-term firming, causing interest rates to back up slightly and markets to become more sensitive to incoming data and to statements by policymakers.

This year borrowers seem to be securing financing somewhat earlier than the norm, which may help to relieve some pressures, though not by enough to prevent spreads from remaining quite elevated. (9) The Committee instead could favor a 1/4 percentage point firming in the 2 percent, as in alternative C. A rationale for this policy tightening would be that the inflation uptrend embodied in the staff forecast is both likely and unacceptable and warrants a faster and more aggressive policy response than is assumed in that forecast.
