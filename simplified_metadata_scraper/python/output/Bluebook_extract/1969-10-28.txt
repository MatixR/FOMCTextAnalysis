a Note: Dates are inclusive. p/ Partly projected. Prospective developments (7) For the second paragraph of the current economic policy directive, the Committee might wish to consider language along the following alternative A): 'To implement this policy, System open market operations until the next meeting of the Committee shall be conducted with a view to main- taining the prevailing firm conditions in money and short-term credit markets; provided, however, that operations shall be modified if bank credit appears to be deviating significantly from current projections.

With constraints on supplies of funds at most major types of financial institutions expected to persist, it seems likely that interest rates there is will move upward again unless /strong additional evidence as to a weakening of the economy, peace in Viet-Nam, or a shift in monetary policy. Indeed, in the last few days, long-term rates have risen, particularly in the minicipal bond market. Policy alternative (15) If the Committee should decide to move toward somewhat less firm money market conditions, it might wish to consider directive alternative B): "To implement this policy, System open market operations until the next meeting of the Committee shall be conducted with a view to achieving slightly less firm conditions in money and short-term credit markets; provided, however, that operations shall be modified if bank credit appears to be deviating significantly from current projections.

Assuming the bill rate remains within the range, however, we would not expect the November aggregatesto be more than a percentage point or two stronger than projected under alternative A of the directive.

Thus, relative to the alternative A projections, bank credit and deposit expansion, might show a more noticeable strengthening in December than in November.
