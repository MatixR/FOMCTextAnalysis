Two such alternatives are presented below, and depicted in the charts on the following pages. Alternative A is designed to achieve a level of M-1A in December equal to that implied by the midpoint growth path of the 3½ to 6 percent range for this aggregate over the QIV '79 to QIV '80 period.

Only minor variations in growth rates would be expected under the other alternatives. For the December to June period, bank credit growth under alternative B would be 81 percent.

Only minor variations in growth rates would be expected under the other alternatives. For the December to June period, bank credit growth under alternative B would be 81 percent.  Alternative A calls for growth in M-1A at about a 7½ percent annual rate between April and September, and continuation of that growth rate over the remainder of the year.

The federal funds rate range  alternative A is 10 to 14 percent.

Thus, although nominal GNP is projected to rise at only a 5½ percent annual rate in the second half of the year, our econometric models would suggest that, at current interest rates, money would tend to grow much more rapidly than that, and probably somewhat in excess of the 7½ percent alternative A path, as the public attempts to restore recently depleted cash balances.

This would generate upward rate pressures at a time when income velocity of M-1A would be declining, a reversal of the normal situation.1/ If, however, the recent evident weakness in M-1A should prove largely to represent a lasting shift in the public's liquidity preferences, then upward rate pressures might be minimal, or indeed there could be some further downward drift in rates.  The specifications for alternative A call for a considerable pick-up in growth of M-2 for the May-June period, to about a 7¾ percent annual rate.

A return to MMMF growth after the decline associated with the March 14 actions appears already to have begun, and with market rates far below their recent peaks, growth of small time and savings deposits, especially the 2½ year variable ceiling certificates, is expected to pick up. (14) With the federal funds rate essentially unchanged in the near term, as contemplated under alternative A, other market interest rates probably would hold near current levels or edge upward a bit, especially if and as monetary growth strengthened perceptibly.

But even so loan growth at banks could pick up, particularly if recent loan weakness makes banks a bit more sanguine about their ability to remain within loan restraint guidelines. 1/ Of course, at this point it seems likely that the opposite, and also unusual, pattern will prevail in the second quarter--a sharp rise in velocity and a substantial decline of interest rates. (15) To achieve the growth in aggregates for the May-June period specified under alternative A, total reserves would have to expand at about a 4 percent annual rate from April to June.

Nonborrowed reserves would expand at about a 27 percent annual rate, assuming a frictional level of adjustment borrowing from Reserve Banks on the order of $100 to $200 million (and continued special borrowing of about $750 million).  Alternative B contemplates a more rapid growth in the monetary aggregates than alternative A over the short run--for example, an 8 per- cent annual rate of growth in M-1A over the May-June period--in the process of reaching the Committee's longer-run path by September (rather than by .

In foreign exchange markets, the dollar would probably weaken, as short rates fell further relative to foreign interest rates.  To attain the aggregates of alternative B over the May- June period, total reserves would have to increase at a 5 percent annual rate. With borrowing at frictional levels, as in alternative A, nonborrowed reserves would increase at a 28 percent rate.
