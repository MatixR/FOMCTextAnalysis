Alternative B is designed to achieve the 4¾ percent midpoint of the Committee's QIV '79 to QIV '80 range for M-1A, which implies growth over the last three months of 1980 of this aggregate at an annual rate more than 2 percentage points faster than under alternative A. The lower panel of the table shows growth for the two alternatives on a quarterly average basis.

Only minor variations in growth rates would be expected under alternative B. (9) The relationships of the September-to-December targets to the Committee's longer-run ranges are depicted in the charts on the following pages. Under alternative A, M-1A growth would be somewhat below the mid- point of its longer-run range, but the staff believes that in the fourth quarter M-1B would be at, and M-2 slightly above, their respective longer- run upper bounds. Under alternative B, both M-1B and M-2 would exceed their longer-run upper bounds, though differences from the one-year growth rates implied by alternative A are slight because of the short time period remaining in the year.

In addition, the 4½ to 5½ percentage point increase in short-term interest rates that has occurred since June is likely to be restraining the quantity of money demanded relative to income in the fourth quarter. (11) The growth of M-1A for September to December under alternative A is so low, however, that it may be expected to be associated with further, relatively moderate,upward interest rate pressures in the Chart 1 Actual and Targeted M-1A and M-1B: -Longer-Run Range --.

Such borrowing is likely to be reflected in a federal funds rate in the 13 to 14 percent area, given the present 11 percent discount rate. (12) The higher federal funds rate and increased member bank borrowing likely to be associated with alternative A would probably be accompanied by an upward adjustment in both short- and long-term market interest rates.

And if signs of a weakening in economic activity emerge, as would be consistent with the staff's GNP projections, expectations of future rate declines would become more prevalent and influence the actual market rate structure.  Under alternative B there is less chance that interest rates will rise in the near term.

To achieve the aggregates specified 1/ Appendix II displays the quarterly interest rate and monetary aggregates pattern underlying alternative A and the staff's GNP projection for 1981, contained in the current Greenbook.

While borrowers may have grown more accustomed to the higher nominal mortgage rates, monthly housing payments represent a substantial barrier to many potential home buyers.  Under both alternatives A and B the non-transaction component of M-2 is expected to continue increasing at a moderate rate.

The specifications adopted at the September meeting are shown in strike-through form. In the short run, the Committee seeks expansion of reserve aggregates consistent with growth of M-1A, M-1B, and M-2 over the [DEL: August] SEPTEMBER to December period at annual rates of about [DEL: 4] percent, [DEL: 6½] ____ percent, and [DEL: 8½] ____ percent respectively, provided that in the period before the next regular meeting the weekly average federal funds rate remains within a range of [DEL: 8-to-14] ____ TO ____ percent. If it appears during the period before the next meeting that the constraint on the federal funds rate is inconsistent with the objective for the expansion of reserves, the Manager for Domestic Operations is promptly to notify the Chairman, who will then decide whether the situation calls for supplementary instructions from the Committee.
