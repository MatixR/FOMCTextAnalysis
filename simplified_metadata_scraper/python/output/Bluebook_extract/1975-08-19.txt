The short-run specifications for alternative C--which contemplate a near-term rise in the Federal funds rate to around 7-1/4 per cent (the mid-point of the range presented)--are thought to be consistent with a policy strategy geared to ultimate attainment of the 6-1/4 per cent mid-point of the Committee's 5--7-1/2 per cent long-run target range for M1.

If the staff projection of significantly more rapid growth in nominal GNP proves correct, we believe that efforts to hold M1 expansion to the 6-1/4 per cent long-run target will require further substantial increases in the Federal funds rate during the fall and early winter--perhaps to 10 per cent or more by early 1976.  Alternative B--which contemplates a rise in the Federal funds rate during the intermeeting period to 6-3/4 per cent (the mid-point of the 6--7-1/2 per cent range presented)--is thought to be consistent with the first stage of a possible longer-run strategy that would hold M1 growth within the Committee's 5--7-1/2 per cent target range--but near the top end of that range.

As noted in the Greenbook, a rate of money growth in the upper part of the Committee's long-run target range would help accommodate the special price effects resulting from decontrol of old oil and the worsening international outlook for food prices.  Alternative A is also consistent with a longer-run strategy that would allow growth in M1 near the top of the 5--7-1/2 per cent target range.

Therefore, the staff believes that this strategy would imply somewhat higher money market rates early in 1976 than under alternative B. (11) During the immediate August-September period, growth in the monetary aggregates is expected to pick up from the depressed July pace.

Under alternative B, the average 50 basis point advance in the funds rate would probably exert only a small dampening influence on the aggregates during the two month projection period; the average M1 growth rate for August-September might be reduced 4 per cent.

The steep rise in the funds rate contemplated under alternative C--to a 7-1 ahead--would be expected to exert a more pronounced restraint on near- term monetary growth.

M1 expansion might be held to an annual rate of about 5-1/2 per cent in September, giving an August-September average of 5-1/4 per cent. (12) Although we anticipate that interest rates would need to rise substantially as the year progresses under any of the longer- run scenarios described above, the unchanged money market conditions of alternative A would probably encourage general interest rate stability for a time.

The market appears to have made its adjustment to the higher funds rate now prevailing, and the Treasury announcement of its somewhat increased third quarter needs has already been taken into account by market participants. (13) The 50 basis points rise in the Federal funds rate contemplated under alternative B would probably trigger roughly commensurate advances in other short-term rates, and long-term markets would also come under renewed upward rate pressure.

Market repercussions from the rise in the Federal funds rate of 100 basis points or more contemplated under alternative C, of course, would be more extreme.

Increasingly, however, higher market interest rates will come to impinge on savings inflows to the intermediaries, and under alternative C this impact would probably be quite pronounced by the fourth quarter.

Because of the developing squeeze, we have assumed an increase in Regulation Q ceilings amounting to one-half a percentage point for longer-term certifi- cates (to become effective by year-end) under all alternatives presented. This assumption reduces, but does not eliminate, the marked slowing that would otherwise have been projected in the rate of expansion of consumer-type time deposits and the more broadly defined measures of money supply. (15) In the August-September period, we would expect savings inflows to continue at the more moderate recent pace, but perhaps to be drifting lower, particularly under alternative C. The bank credit proxy is expected to remain quite weak, since banks are unlikely to become aggressive in seeking funds through issuance of CD's and non-deposit liabilities until business loan demand strengthens materially.
