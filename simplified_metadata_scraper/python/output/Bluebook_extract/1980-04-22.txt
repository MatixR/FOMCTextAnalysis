Growth rates for reserve measures in this and subsequent tables are adjusted to remove the effect of discontinuities from breaks in the series when reserve requirements are changed. Prospective Developments and Short-term Targets (9) Shown below for Committee consideration are three alternative targets for the monetary aggregates over the December to June interval, along with implied growth rates for the March to June period. Also shown are intermeeting federal funds rate ranges, with the funds rate range currently in effect shown under alternative B. detailed and longer-range specifications are shown on the tables on pages 8 and 9.

Only minor variations in growth rates would be expected under the other alternatives For the December to June period, bank credit growth under alternative B would be 9-1 May-June growth in these aggregates would have to accelerate to about a 9½ percent annual rate to attain the June target level.

Even though real GNP is expected to decline significantly this quarter, the rate of increase in nominal GNP is still projected at over an 8 percent annual rate, suggesting a need for appreciable growth in transactions balances.1/ However, given the restraining effects on money demanded of past increases in interest rates, and with real economic activity apparently slowing significantly, the May-June increases in M-1A and M-1B required under alternative B may lead to a decline in the federal funds rate to the 16 to 17 percent area, or perhaps even lower, over the intermeeting period.

The specifications for alternative B call for a 6¾ percent rate of growth of M-2 for the December-June period, and a 6¼ percent rate from March to June.

M-3 growth under alternative B is projected at a 6½ percent annual rate over the March-June span, considerably slower than in the first three months of the year. (13) Growth in the aggregates at the rates specified under alternative B implies an annual rate of growth from March to June of the monetary base and of total reserves of about 4½ and 7½ percent, respectively.

Mortgage rates in any event are likely to edge off from their recent peaks in view of the sharp recent drop in bond yields and the likelihood that thrifts will find it a little easier to attract deposits.  Alternative C calls for one-half percentage point less growth in M-1A and M-1B, at an annual rate, over the December to June period relative to alternative B.

This would imply growth in M-1A over the two months of May and June of about 7¾ percent, or more than 1½ percentage points less than alternative B. The funds rate would probably be in the area of 18 percent in the weeks ahead, or perhaps a little lower.

The dollar probably would not weaken further on foreign exchange markets and might strengthen a bit.  As shown in the charts, alternative C implies that all of the monetary aggregates would be below their midpoint paths by June.

The staff anticipates, for example, a federal funds rate of around 13 to 14 percent for late 1980 under alternative B, and this rate would have to be lower under alternative C.

The staff anticipates, for example, a federal funds rate of around 13 to 14 percent for late 1980 under alternative B, and this rate would have to be lower under alternative C.  Alternative C would probably require growth in total reserves at about a 4 percent annual rate.

This alternative, however, is more likely to induce borrowing under the new temporary seasonal credit program, thereby requiring a downward adjustment in the nonborrowed reserves path.  Alternative A calls for more rapid growth in the monetary aggregates than B and C, and entails almost an 11 percent annual rate of increase in M-IA over the next two months.

As indicated in the charts, M-1A and M-1B would be somewhat above their long-run midpoint paths by June, implying less rapid growth of the narrow money stock (and higher interest rates) in the second half of 1980 than the other two alternatives.  To achieve alternative A targets, total reserves might have to expand at an annual rate of 5¼ percent in the March to June period.

Such growth of reserves probably would be associated with a fairly substantial drop in the federal funds rate in the intermeeting period, perhaps into the lower half of the 12 to 19 percent range suggested for this alternative.  Alternative A would be accompanied by further declines in short-term market rates as market participants became more firmly convinced that the System would not be putting a floor under interest rates.
