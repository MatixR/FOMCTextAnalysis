The three growth paths shown for the narrowly-defined money supply present alternatives that take account in differing ways of the recent shortfalls relative to expectations, as follows:  Alternative A shows a pattern consistent with a 6 per cent annual rate of growth for M1 over the first quarter of 1971.

Thus alternative A does not make up for the fourth quarter shortfall.

As a result, under alternative A the March level of the money 1 billion below previous expectations.

As a result, under alternative A the March level of the money supply would be about $1 billion below previous expectations.  Alternative B shows a growth path for the first quarter which makes up for the shortfall in December and in the fourth quarter.

As a result, under alternative A the March level of the money supply would be about $1 billion below previous expectations. (B) Alternative B shows a growth path for the first quarter which makes up for the shortfall in December and in the fourth quarter. The first quarter growth rate in this alternative is 7-1/2 per cent, which would lead to a March level for the money stock equal to that resulting from the earlier 5-1/2 per cent path for the fourth and first quarters taken together.  Alternative C, which has an 8-1 growth in the first quarter for M1, makes up for the shortfall and raises the growth rate in money supply for the September-to-March period back up to the 6 per cent rate of expansion experienced over the first three quarters of 1970.

Realization of alternative A aggregates would require, in the staff's judgment, pushing the Federal funds rate up from its recent 2 per cent.

Marginal reserve measures would be tighter than recently prevailing.  Under alternative B, the money market may have to be eased from currently prevailing conditions; the funds rate was around 4-1/2 per cent on Friday and might have to be moved down into the lower 4 per cent range specified.

Under alternative C, which would probably require a funds rate below 4 per cent, the bill rate might also decline below 4 per cent, although expectations that rates were bottoming out might tend to inhibit such a decline in the 3-month rate.

Recent upward adjustments in interest rates on intermediate-term Government securities were partly in anticipation of such an enlarged refunding. (12) With the forthcoming Treasury refunding probably largely discounted by the market, with recent corporate issues well received, and in light of the still large spread of long- over short-term rates, it seems likely that longer-term interest rates will drop further, except under conditions specified for alternative A. Interest rate declines would tend to accelerate should the Federal funds rate move down significantly from prevailing levels.

Relatively more expansion in time deposits would be expected under alternatives B and C, in view of the anticipated further declines in market interest rates.

For the present projection, we have assumed a further drop in Euro-dollar holdings of about $300 to $400  Alternatives B and C.

Finally, it will be noted that the structure of all three alternatives is similar to that in the directives the Committee was issuing before the December 15 meet- ing; it has been assumed that the Committee adopted a different structure in the second paragraph of the December 15 directive primarily because of special circumstances it expected to prevail during the period, encompass- ing the year-end, to which that directive applied.  Alternative A. This alternative is proposed for possible use if the Committee decides upon a 6 per cent target growth rate for the money supply in the first quarter, despite the shortfall in the fourth quarter from the 5 per cent rate that had been expected at the time of the last meeting.

Unlike alternatives B and C below, the first sentence of this alternative does not indicate that the Committee desires to promote easier conditions in credit markets.

Such a statement has been omitted since this directive might entail tighter money market conditions with potential consequences for credit markets generally.  Alternative B. This alternative is proposed for possible use if the Committee decides that the fourth-quarter shortfall in money should be made up in the first quarter.

That interest rates--encompassing intermediate- and longer- term as well as short-term rates--would decline under this alternative.  Alternative C. This alternative is proposed for possible use if the Committee decides to seek growth in money over the first quarter at a faster rate than would be required simply to make up the fourth quarter shortfall.

Whereas alternative B includes a statement to the effect that Committee seeks to promote some easing of conditions in credit markets," the word "some" is omitted in the corresponding statement in this alter- native.

This difference reflects the expectation that interest rates would decline somewhat more under this alternative--which calls for --than under alternative B. Table 1 PATHS OF KEY MONETARY AGGREGATES SEASONALLY ADJUSTED STRICTLYCONFIDENTIAL (FR) January 11, 1971 1970: Sept.
