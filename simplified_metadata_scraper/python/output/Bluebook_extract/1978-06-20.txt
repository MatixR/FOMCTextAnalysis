On balance, the staff is projecting that--under Alternative A--the recent regulatory changes will permit thrifts to maintain deposit flows this summer at near recent rates. (12) If the Federal funds rate were maintained around the currently prevailing levels of 7½ per cent, as envisioned under Alternative A, most other short-term rates would likely also show little net change over the very near term.

In the mortgage market, with credit demands remaining large, further increases in mortgage rates (and another near-term increase in FHA/VA mortgage rate ceilings) can be expected, even with the maintenance of thrift institution deposit inflows at around recent levels.  Alternative B calls for an increase in the Federal funds rate to around the mid-point of a 7½ to 8 per cent range between now and mid-July.

Under Alternative A, the Federal funds rate might need to rise to 9 to 10 per cent by fall to restrain growth in the aggregates to within the longer-run ranges.

Under Alternative A, the Federal funds rate might need to rise to 9 to 10 per cent by fall to restrain growth in the aggregates to within the longer-run ranges. Under Alternative B, restraint would be introduced earlier and, as a result, the level of the funds rate required in late 1978 and early 1979 would be somewhat less.

The second formulation places main emphasis on money market conditions. In both formulations, variants are shown for particular phrases that are intended to be associated with the specifications discussed in  alternatives A and B.
