Under Alternative A, the Committee lowers the intended federal funds rate 25 basis points to 5 percent.  Alternative B maintains the target for the federal funds rate at 5¼ percent.  Under Alternative C, the Committee tightens by 25 basis points, bringing the target rate to 5½ percent.

If the Committee similarly has not substantially changed its assessment  of the economic outlook, it may be attracted to Alternative B, under which the federal funds rate is maintained at 5¼ percent and the statement continues to highlight concern about inflation.

The statement accompanying Alternative B could acknowledge that economic growth slowed in the first part of the year, but indicate that the economy still seems likely to expand at a moderate pace over coming quarters.

Thus, implementing Alternative B is likely to provoke little market reaction.

If so, the Committee might wish to reduce  the chance of a more pronounced economic slowdown by easing policy 25 basis  points as in Alternative A.  The recent disappointing data on home sales and inventories of new homes for sale may heighten concern that the extent of the ongoing adjustment in the housing market and associated spillovers to household and business spending could be greater than currently anticipated.

The rationale for Alternative A would note that, although the economy seems most likely to expand at a moderate pace, the weakness in housing and capital spending implies a significant risk that economic activity might grow more slowly than anticipated.

If so, the Committee might prefer to foster a  more decisive slowing in inflation by tightening 25 basis points at this meeting, as in  Alternative C.  Price pressures might not yet be viewed as convincingly on a downward trend, and the softening in the dollar and increases in energy and other commodity prices since the March meeting may have heightened the Committee’s concerns about the inflation outlook.

The statement accompanying Alternative C could reiterate the Committee’s judgment that the economy seems likely to expand at a moderate pace.
