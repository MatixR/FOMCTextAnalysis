Consumer credit will probably continue to expand at a pace well below the extra- ordinary rate of earlier this year.  The aggregate specifications of alternative B are thought to involve pressures on bank reserve positions indexed by discount window 700 million.

The pressure of credit demands on longer-term markets may moderate, though, as the effects of the previous relatively steep declines in rates on corporate and state and local issuance wear off.  Alternative A contemplates a more expansive reserve posture that would encourage more rapid growth in M1 and M2.

Growth of M3 may turn out to be somewhat further above the currently specified 3-month growth rate, as an additional easing of market conditions encourages credit expansion.
