The increase in household indebtedness--though still quite substantial--is projected to moderate a bit as rising interest rates damp demands for mortgage and consumer credit.  The specifications of alternative B are expected to be consistent with borrowing from the discount window continuing at about $1 billion (apart from any special borrowing related to the Continental situation), and with growth in nonborrowed and total reserves at annual 2 and 5 percent, respectively, over May and June.

In addition, banks might manage their reserve positions more cautiously (holding more excess reserves or seeking to conserve borrowing access at the discount window) should the banking environment become uncertain in the aftermath of the Continental package, thereby placing upward pressure on the funds rate unless compensating adjustments are made to reserve paths. (12) Interest rates generally may well continue to fluctuate around current levels under alternative B, but credit markets are in a highly sensitive state.

Nonetheless, the severity of the decline in bond prices in recent weeks suggests that this market--where yields have risen as much or more than short-term rates--could have overadjusted, and, if short rates do not rise further, some decline in long-term rates could develop. However, even if bond rates fell, mortgage rates probably would continue to move higher in lagged response to previous increases in market interest rates and to emerging earnings pressures on thrift lenders.  The specifications of alternative A contemplate some easing of pressures on bank reserve positions over the coming inter- meeting period consistent with somewhat faster growth of the aggregates than under alternative B.

Thus, alternative A increases the odds that renewed tightening of money market conditions might be necessary later in the year if the Committee wishes to hold M1 and M2 close to the midpoints of their ranges and M3 and credit to near the upper ends of their ranges.  Alternative C involves restraining growth of M1 and M2 to rates below current FOMC short-run objectives and sets in train forces that would work to bring M3 and credit growth back toward their longer- run ranges.

Discount window borrowing might rise toward  under alternative C, which probably would be associated with federal funds trading consistently somewhat above 11 percent.
