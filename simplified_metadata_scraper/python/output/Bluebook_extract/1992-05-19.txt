Under alternative B, federal funds would continue trading in the 3-3/4 percent area; extending the current assumption of $100 million for adjustment plus seasonal borrowing would be expected to preserve the current 1/4 percentage point spread of the funds rate above the discount rate, at least over the first part of the intermeeting period.  Under alternative A, the federal funds rate would drop to 4 percent.

The same federal funds rate could be achieved by cutting the discount rate 1/2 percentage point to 3 percent and specifying borrowing at the alternative B level of alternative C, the federal funds rate would rise to 4-1/4 percent, in 125 million.

Consequently, prices in domestic credit and foreign exchange markets probably would not show much reaction should the Committee main- tain current reserve market conditions by choosing alternative B at this meeting.

However, long-term yields are likely to remain fairly steady or possibly even edge down as expectations for growth and infla- tion are trimmed back; the passage of an effective balanced budget amendment would add to downward pressures on long-term rates. (10) The extent of the easing of reserve market conditions under alternative A would catch market participants unawares, and the 1/2 point drop in the federal funds rate would induce a nearly compar- able decline in other money market interest rates.

However, following an easing move, especially of the dimensions of alternative A, investors would become more assured of sustained economic expansion, but also less confident of any longer-term decrease in inflation, which together would limit any reductions in long-term rates.

With interest rates on dollar-denomi- nated securities becoming less attractive relative to returns abroad, the exchange value of the dollar would adjust downward.  The more restrictive policy of alternative C would come as a considerable surprise to market participants.

Most of the pickup should stem from the liquid components, as outflows to cover tax payments prove to be smaller than implicitly anticipated by seasonal factors.

Total domestic nonfinancial debt is anticipated to expand at a little above a 5 percent rate over the second quarter, lifting it in June to just above the lower bound of its 4-1/2 to 8-1/2 percent monitoring range. (15) The growth of M2, M3, and debt through June would be little affected by either the easing or tightening of reserve conditions  alternatives A or C.

If the lower funds rate of alternative A is maintained through year-end, growth of M2 for the year could be expected to come in around 4 percent.

Some impetus to money demand would derive from the reduced opportunity cost of holding liquid balances and, later in the year, from added strength in spending. If alternative C is adopted and the higher rates maintained, a 3 percent annual pace for M2 would be more likely.

While growth of M3 for the year of 2 percent is expected under the constant funds rate of alternative B, this projec- tion would have to be shaded up or down by perhaps 1/4 point if alterna- tive A or C were chosen at this FOMC meeting and sustained for the rest of the year.

An alternative for the last sentence is shown in brackets This alternative would stress the Committee's expectation of a resump- tion of growth in broad money over May and June, in contrast to the traditional three-month specification, which would show little if any monetary growth (for example, 1 percent for M2 and zero for M3 under alternative B).
