Under alternative B, funds would continue to trade in the 9-3/4 to 9-7/8 percent range; in light of recent experience, unchanged reserve market conditions are likely to involve borrowing of around $600 million.

Under alternative A, the funds rate would decline to the 9-1 to 9-3/8 percent area with borrowing around $400 million, and under alter- native C federal funds would rise to 10-1/4 to 10-3/8 percent and borrow- 800 million.

As a consequence, this aggregate through June should remain below the 3 percent lower bound of its target cone, even under the reduced interest rates of alternative A. However, if money market conditions of either alternative A or B were maintained through the summer, the waning effects of earlier increases in market interest rates, reinforced by the delayed upward adjustment of liquid deposit rates, likely would bring M2 within its annual range by the end of the third quarter, assuming spending and income growth close to the green- book projections.

But with the federal government's seasonally adjusted borrow- ing declining further in light of the Treasury's ample cash balance, expansion of total debt likely will slip to around a 7 percent average annual rate in May and June, edging this aggregate below the 8-1/2 percent midpoint of-its annual monitoring range. (11) Since market yields now appear to have built in some near- term easing of monetary policy, maintaining current conditions under alternative B probably would be associated with some back-up in short-term rates.

In any case, some downward pressure on the exchange value of the dollar would be likely as interest differentials favoring dollar assets narrowed further.  The tightening of policy under alternative C would be a considerable surprise to financial markets, and would likely induce a substantial-backup in rates.
