Alternative A would lower the target federal funds rate 25 basis points to 5 percent.  Alternative B would maintain the target for the federal funds rate at 5¼ percent.  Alternative C envisions raising the target to 5½ percent.

Alternative C envisions raising the target to 5½ percent The draft language to characterize recent information on economic activity differs  across the three options:  Alternatives A and B refer explicitly or implicitly to recent moderate economic expansion, while Alternative C emphasizes the second-quarter Chart 7 The Policy Outlook in an Uncertain Environment 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 Percent Note: Appendix B provides background information regarding the specification of each rule and the methodology used in constructing confidence intervals and near-term prescriptions.

With regard to recent financial developments,  Alternative A cites tighter credit conditions for some borrowers as a source of greater downside risk to growth, Alternative B notes the change in credit conditions without explicitly stating that it is a cause of increased risk, and Alternative C is silent.

(18) If the Committee continues to view the current stance of policy as likely to  foster sustainable growth and an acceptable trajectory for inflation, then it may wish  to choose Alternative B, under which its target for the federal funds rate would remain at 5¼ percent for the time being.

The draft statement for Alternative B reiterates the view that the economy is likely to continue expanding at a moderate pace over coming quarters.

Taken as a whole, the language in Alternative B is slightly softer than the June statement, but it also suggests that the Committee does not expect the less accommodative conditions in credit markets to have a significant adverse effect on the economic expansion.

Alternative  B seems generally consistent with those expectations, so a sizable market reaction to a   Alternative B appears unlikely.

(21) The Committee might instead view recent data and developments as  indicating that the balance of risks has shifted enough to warrant cutting the target  federal funds rate by 25 basis points, as in Alternative A.  The housing market appears to be weakening further, indicators of private spending outside of the housing sector have been mixed of late, and credit spreads have widened—perhaps suggesting that downside risks to growth have increased.

The draft statement in Alternative A continues to note that the economy seems likely to expand at a moderate pace, but it also explicitly recognizes that greater weakness in the housing sector and the diminished availability and higher cost of credit to riskier borrowers have raised the odds that the economy will grow less than expected.

If the Committee judges that  the downside risks to growth and the upside risks to inflation are now roughly  balanced, it might wish to leave the stance of policy unchanged at this meeting but  release a statement that combines the Alternative A language on real activity B.

If the Committee judges that  the downside risks to growth and the upside risks to inflation are now roughly  balanced, it might wish to leave the stance of policy unchanged at this meeting but  release a statement that combines the Alternative A language on real activity (A.2)  with the Alternative B language on inflation (B.3) and the balanced risk assessment of  Alternative A action.

If so,  the Committee might prefer to raise the funds rate 25 basis points at this meeting, as  in Alternative C.  Even under the baseline outlook, the optimal policy path shown in Chart 6 indicates that policy would need to be tightened about 1 percentage point over the next year should the Committee wish to bring core inflation down to 1½ percent.

The statement accompanying Alternative C could reiterate the assessment that the economy seems likely to expand at a moderate pace, but reorder the clauses to underscore the view that the adjustment in the housing sector appears unlikely to derail the economic expansion.
