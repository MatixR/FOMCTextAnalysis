The overall CPI accelerates by even more over the two years as a consequence of the rebound in energy prices.2 (7) Despite the likelihood that overall inflation will rise, the Committee might choose  alternative B at this meeting.

Indeed, the Committee may be of the opinion that the staff has built in too large an uptick to inflation, perhaps by placing too little emphasis on the disinflationary force of ample industrial capacity and the market discipline now exerted on the ability of firms to pass along price increases, or by giving too much credence to the power of oil producers to enforce their recent curbs on supply.  Continuing the current stance of policy, as envisioned in alternative B, would match the expectations currently embodied in financial market prices.

With the economic environment remaining benign and concerns about near-term monetary policy tightening mostly quiescent, major equity price indexes are likely to be little changed on net, despite pressure on corporate profit margins. (9) If the Committee were concerned that inflation was likely to be on an upward path, as in the staff forecast, it might favor the 1/4 percentage point tightening in the intended federal funds rate of alternative C. With aggregate demand remaining strong, credit conditions improving further, and many emerging market economies showing signs of stabilizing, the Committee might believe that the current meeting is an appropriate time to roll back the policy easing of last November, initiating the policy action needed to contain inflation over time.

As a result, the 25 basis point hike in the intended federal funds rate of alternative C could spark a substantial reaction in financial markets.
