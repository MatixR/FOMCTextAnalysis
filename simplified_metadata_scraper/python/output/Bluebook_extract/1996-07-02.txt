In these circumstances, even if the Committee wished to lean against the sorts of incipient inflation pressures inherent in the staff forecast, it might be able to afford to wait for more information to gauge whether those pressures were likely to develop and their extent. (21) A 1/4 percentage point increase in the federal funds rate, as under alternative C, might be favored if the Committee wished to impose greater restraint on spending to reduce the odds of a gradual increase of inflation pressures.

For example, the tighter alternative in the Greenbook, in which policy is sufficiently restrictive to make noticeable progress toward price stability in 1997 and beyond, assumes that a quarter point tightening at this meeting would be followed by considerable further firming later in the year. (22) A 25 basis point rise in the federal funds rate at this meeting as under alternative C would exceed the small amount currently built into money market yields.

There is some risk that market participants would read the action as sig- nalling that the Federal Reserve was quite concerned that the economy had excessive momentum and was prepared to tighten considerably fur- ther, prompting a very substantial upward movement in interest rates, especially in short and intermediate maturities, and in the dollar. (23) The money and credit flows associated with a flat federal funds rate under alternative B were discussed in the previous sections of this document under the baseline case.

Money growth would be expected to slow somewhat more under alternative C, putting the broad aggregates on paths more likely to leave them below the upper ends of their longer-term ranges.
