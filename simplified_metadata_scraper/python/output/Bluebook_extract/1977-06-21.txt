If this assumption were not made, the projected M-1 growth rate would be reduced by about 2 percentage points in July and about 1¼ percentage points in the 2-month June-July period. Furthermore, the Treasury may continue redeeming bills on into July. Although it is widely expected that the Treasury will market about $1.5 billion of 15-year bonds in the last week of June, it appears that this will be the only new money it will raise in the coupon market until early August. (10) Given this background, and assuming that Federal funds continue to trade at around 5-3/8 per cent as contemplated under alternative B, it seems probable that short-term rates will remain close to current levels in the near term.

Inflows of interest-bearing deposits are still expected to slow sufficiently to keep growth in M-2 and M-3 in the lower part of their respective one-year ranges.  The alternative C specifications involve an increase of the funds rate over the next few weeks to the mid-point of a 5½-6½ per cent range.

If ceiling rates are unattractive relative to market rates, beginning in July some institutions may experience substantial withdrawals in connection with heavy maturities of "wild card" accounts.1/ (14) The immediate tightening of the money market under alternative C would tend to lessen the degree of restraint that would be needed later to achieve growth in M-1 over the QI '77-QI '78 period near the mid-point of the Committee's one-year range.

The funds rate under this alternative would be expected to reach 6½ per cent in the fourth quarter of this year and to remain around that level in early 1978. Because short-term market interest rates also would be expected to be lower than under alternative B or A, banks and thrift institutions should be able to maintain stronger inflows of interest-bearing deposits at that time.

Although growth in M-2 and M-3 would consequently be stronger in late 1977 and early 1978 than under the other alternatives, even under alternative C the growth rates projected for M-2 and M-3 over the year ending QI '78 are in the lower part of their respective ranges.

Although growth in M-2 and M-3 would consequently be stronger in late 1977 and early 1978 than under the other alternatives, even under alternative C the growth rates projected for M-2 and M-3 over the year ending QI '78 are in the lower part of their respective ranges. (15) An easing of the Federal funds rate over the near term to the mid-point of a 4½ to 5¼ per cent range--as called for under alternative A--and the associated decline in short-term rates might well be accompanied, at least temporarily, by significant declines in 1/ From July to October 1973 interest ceilings were removed on time deposits with minimum denominations of $1,000 and maturities of at least four years.

In order to achieve growth rates in M-1 at the mid-point of the Committee's one-year range, however, the Federal funds rate would have to begin to rise relatively soon and to reach a  alternatives B and C.

Thus, under alternative A, the Federal funds rate would be expected to average around 7¼ per cent in the first quarter of 1978.

As suggested below, the particular language needed in the opening lines of the money market formulation would depend on the specific conditions sought; the three alternatives shown--calling, respectively, for somewhat easier, prevail- ing, and somewhat firmer money market conditions--are intended to be associated with the specifications discussed in the preceding section  alternatives A, B, and C.
