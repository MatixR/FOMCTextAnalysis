Under Alternative A, the Committee would increase its 1.

In recognition of the pending completion of Treasury security  purchases and the gradual scaling down of the Federal Reserve’s liquidity  programs, Alternative B notes that the Federal Reserve will use “a range of tools” rather than “all available tools” to promote economic recovery and preserve price stability.  Under Alternative C, the size of agency MBS purchases would be reduced to “about $1 trillion” and that of agency debt to “about $150 billion,” from their previously announced maximums, and the pace of purchases would be gradually reduced until their completion by year-end.

Alternative C also makes more explicit the conditionality of the funds rate target on the evolution of the economic outlook by changing the language that characterizes the period over which the target range is likely to remain extraordinarily low.

Alternative A states that economic activity “is leveling out” but notes that the economic recovery could be relatively weak.  Alternatives B and C are progressively more optimistic, with Alternative B saying that economic activity has “picked up following its severe downturn” and Alternative C stating explicitly that the data suggest a “recovery in economic activity has begun.

Alternatives B and C note increased activity in the housing sector.

To explain this  view, Alternatives A and B note that “substantial resource slack continue to dampen cost pressures,” while Alternatives B and C state that apparently well anchored.   Alternative A also notes that “inflation has fallen considerably over the past year.

THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE B  If policymakers believe that the policy stimulus already in train is likely to foster  the most satisfactory economic outcomes feasible given current economic  circumstances, the Committee could reaffirm its forward guidance regarding the funds  rate and continue implementing its previously announced large-scale asset purchases  (LSAPs), while providing additional information regarding the winding-down process,  as in Alternative B.  Maintaining the current stance of monetary policy might be appealing if the Committee shares the staff’s assessment that incoming economic and financial news is consistent with inflation remaining subdued and economic growth picking up to an acceptable pace in coming quarters as financial market conditions and the housing sector continue to improve.

Alternative B suggests two possible end dates for the purchases:  the end of the first quarter or sometime in the second quarter of 2010.

A statement such as that suggested for Alternative B would be close to market expectations and would likely have muted effects in financial markets.

THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE C  If policymakers view the incoming data as pointing to more underlying  momentum in the nascent recovery than they previously anticipated and are at least as  optimistic as the staff regarding the economic outlook, they might choose to trim the  size of the LSAPs and to adjust the language regarding the anticipated period over  which the funds rate is likely to remain extraordinarily low, as in Alternative C. Under this alternative, the Committee would announce lower amounts of planned purchases of agency MBS and agency debt compared with the current maximum amounts and would revise the stated expectation for a very low federal funds rate.

Participants might prefer Alternative C if they viewed the continued improvement in financial market conditions and the significant upward revision in the staff forecast as suggesting that less monetary policy support from the Federal Reserve is required and, given the improvement in the housing sector, that a reduction in the maximum amount of purchases of mortgage-related assets, in particular, could be appropriate.

Alternative C would surprise market participants.

Thus, the release of a statement along the lines of Alternative C would likely cause short- and medium-term interest rates to rise sharply, and equity prices to drop, while the foreign exchange value of the dollar would probably appreciate.

In this case, they could decide to expand the amount of agency MBS  purchases, be more definitive about the total amount to be purchased, and extend the  timeframe for conducting those transactions, as in Alternative A.  Although the staff has marked up its forecast for economic growth significantly, the unemployment rate declines only slowly—it is projected to be still above 9 percent at the end of next year and just under 8 percent at the end of 2011—and core inflation hovers around 1 percent for several years, a level below the inflation objectives implicit in individual policymakers’  longer-run projections.

Expanding the  amount of purchases of agency debt (or even buying the maximum $200 billion)  could generate significant distortions in the markets for those securities, so this is not  proposed in Alternative A. An announcement along the lines of Alternative A would surprise market participants.

10 Reflecting concerns that a higher level of purchases could distort pricing and compromise  market liquidity, agency debt purchases are projected to cumulate to $150 billion, below the   Alternatives A and B.

The baseline scenario corresponds  to the variant of Alternative B in the Policy Alternatives section, which has agency 1.

The second scenario corresponds  to Alternative A, in which purchases of agency MBS are increased by 1.

Purchases of  agency debt are equal to those in the baseline in terms of size but are completed by  the end of this year rather than at the end of the first quarter of 2010.10  The third  scenario corresponds to Alternative C, in which the quantity of agency MBS purchases is reduced by $250 billion to $1 trillion and agency debt purchases stop at 150 billion.

For Alternative A, the peak also occurs in the 2.

For Alternative C, the balance sheet peaks at 12 The composition of Federal Reserve assets in all three of these projections differs notably from historical patterns.

$2.2 trillion at the end of 2009, and assets decline to $1.4 trillion at the end of the  projection period.12  Balance Sheet Projections Summary  Alternative A Alternative B Alternative C Total Assets Peak month June 2010 June 2010 December 2009 2.

In the scenarios corresponding to Alternatives A and B, reserve balances peak in June of 2010, whereas in Alternative C, they peak in 13 The calculated growth rates of the monetary base presented in the table are based on an approximation for month-average values.

Reserve balances decline as the balance sheet shrinks in all  scenarios, but in Alternative C, a resumption of open market purchases is assumed in 25 billion.

At a quarterly frequency, the monetary base continues to expand for the   Alternative A and B.

For Alternative C, in which asset purchases end in 2009, the monetary base begins to contract in the first quarter of 2010.

For Alternatives B and C, this contraction is reversed near the end of the projection horizon.

In the scenario corresponding to Alternative A, purchases of agency MBS are increased by 1.

In the scenario corresponding to Alternative C, purchases of agency MBS are decreased by 1 trillion.

Purchases are decreased equally over the over the remaining months of 2009 Agency debt purchases mirror those in the scenario corresponding to Alternative A. • By the end of the projection period in the scenario corresponding to Alternative C, the expansion of currency and capital combined with a runoff of other assets necessitates the resumption of standard open market purchases to maintain reserve balances at a level of $25 billion.
