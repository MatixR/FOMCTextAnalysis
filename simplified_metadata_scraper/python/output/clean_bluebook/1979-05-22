Prefatory Note
The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain.
Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a redaction process that removed information obtained on a 
confidential basis.  All redacted passages are exempt from disclosure under applicable 
provisions of the Freedom of Information Act.
1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked 
and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not 
reliably recognized by the OCR process and were not checked or corrected by staff.

Recent developments
(1) M-1 grew at a 17½ per cent annual rate in April, with
somewhat more than half of the acceleration estimated to be related to
the processing of tax payments and refunds. Deposit data for early
May indicate that these temporary influences are unwinding, and for
the April-May period, M-1 is projected to expand at about an 8 per cent
annual rate, above the 4 to 8 per cent range adopted by the FOMC. M-2 is
projected to grow at a 9¼ per cent rate for the 2-month policy period,
also above its 4 to 8½ per cent range selected at the April FOMC meeting.
The interest-bearing component of M-2 grew more rapidly in April than
expected, as sales of money market certificates (MMCs) by banks spurted
and outflows of savings and other small time deposits included in this
aggregate slowed markedly. The success of banks in attracting MMCs during
the first full month since the elimination of the differential ceiling
rate on such deposits apparently came at the expense of reduced growth of

MMCs at thrift institutions. In part reflecting this shift, thrift deposit
inflows fell to a 2 per cent annual rate in April on a month-end basis,
compared to an average 9 per cent annual rate over the first quarter.
(2) Growth in commercial bank credit picked up sharply in April
to a 13 per cent annual rate, led by a rebound in business lending. Banks,
nonetheless, reduced their outstanding amount of large time deposits, financing
their asset growth with the increased inflows of demand deposits, MMCs, and
funds borrowed from abroad.
(3) The Manager of the System Open Market Account continued to
seek reserve conditions consistent with a Federal funds rate of 10 per cent
or a bit higher early in the period after the April FOMC meeting. In late
April, projections for the monetary aggregates suggested that growth of M-1
and M-2 would be at or above the upper ends of their respective ranges for
the April-May period. Following a telephone conference of the Committee
on April 27, the Manager began aiming for a Federal funds rate of 10¾ per
cent. On May 11, the FOMC concurred in the Chairman's view that, though
the growth of the monetary aggregates had been revised up somewhat further,
this funds rate objective remained consistent with the prevailing directive
after taking account of overall financial market conditions and uncertainties
in projections of the aggregates in this period.
(4) Required reserves declined in April and are expected to
fall further in May despite the pronounced strengthening in monetary
growth. The disparate movements of reserves and money are explained
mainly by the release of required reserves associated with the substantial
run-offs of large denomination time deposits. In addition, the growth
in demand deposits at nonmember banks and currency is estimated to account
for half of the projected expansion of M-l in the April-May period. Pro-
vision of reserves via the discount window has risen with the widening
of the spread between the Federal funds rate and the discount rate. Member
bank borrowing has averaged a little over $1 billion thus far in May, up
from an average of just under $1 billion during the first four months of
the year. Given the increase in borrowing, nonborrowed reserves are expected
to fall at about a 13 1/4 per cent annual rate over the April-May period while
total reserves are projected to decline at only a 5 per cent annual rate.
Growth in currency continues to account for all of the growth of the monetary
base. Growth of the base is expected to remain around the 4 1/4 per cent annual
rate that prevailed over the first three months of the year.
(5) Short-term interest rates are little changed on balance from
their mid-April levels. They declined around the time of the FOMC meeting
but then rebounded in late April and early May in response to the System's
move toward additional money market restraint. The 3-month bill rate
was most recently quoted around 9.7 per cent and the 3-month commercial
paper rate about 10 per cent. Longer-term interest rates have risen 10
to 25 basis points, though, in part reflecting increased inflationary
expectations by market participants. With thrift deposit flows slowing
further, mortgage yields continued to rise to new highs.
(6) The dollar has continued to show strength in the exchange
markets, reflecting stronger U.S. trade figures, further indications of a
slowdown in U.S. economic expansion, and continued acceleration of inflation
abroad. The dollar's average exchange value has risen a bit more than
1 per cent since the April FOMC meeting,
.U.S. authorities sold about $1 billion against German
marks, half of which were acquired by the System and used to extinguish
its swap debt to the Bundesbank. The swap line had been in continuous
use since October 1977.

change in related monetary and financial flows over various time periods.

Prospective developments
(8) The table below presents for Committee consideration three
alternative specifications for the monetary aggregates and the Federal
funds rate for the May-June period. Alternative B would maintain the
Federal funds rate at the current 10-1/4 per cent level, while alternatives
A and C, respectively, would ease and tighten money market conditions in
coming weeks. (More detailed and longer-term data are contained in the
tables on pp. 7 and 8.)

Federal funds rate
(Intermeeting period) 9-1/2 to 10 10 to 10-1/2 10-1/2 to 11
(9) The unwinding of the Treasury lag in processing April
individual income tax payments and of the recent bulge in the payment of
tax refunds will be retarding the growth rate of M-1 over the balance of
the current quarter. Partly because of these special factors, M-1 growth
is expected to be quite slow in the May-June period. Under alternative B,
with the funds rate remaining at the prevailing level of around 10-1/4 per
cent cent, M-1 is likely to increase over the two-month policy period in
a 1/2 to 4-1/2 per cent annual rate range.

(10) As illustrated in the upper panel of the chart on page 10,
the April increase in M-1 raised the level of that aggregate to just above
the low end path of its longer-run QIV '78 to QIV '79 range. Growth in
M-1 at the lower end of its projected May-June alternative B range would
place the level of this aggregate by June around the lower limit of its
longer-run range while growth at the upper end of the range would move the
aggregate higher in the range, though not quite to the midpoint. (The
table on p. 11 shows growth rates from April required to achieve levels
implied by the FOMC's longer-run ranges).
(11) Under alternative B, the staff expects M-2 to expand in
a 4 to 8 per cent annual rate range in May-June. Growth at the midpoint
of that range would bring M-2 to the low-end path of the Committee's QIV '78
to QIV '79 objective for this aggregate by mid-year.
(12) Although growth in M-2 over the balance of this quarter will
be retarded by the slowing of M-1 growth, the interest-bearing component is
expected to remain relatively strong. Not only is the decline in savings
deposits likely to remain more modest than earlier this year, but
also banks are expected to retain an enlarged share of the MMC market
in view of the recent elimination of the rate ceiling differential on these
deposits. Large denomination time deposits are not expected to contribute
to growth in M-2 in the near-term because banks will probably continue to
rely on Eurodollar and other nondeposit funds to finance their credit
(13) Looking ahead to the whole QIV '78-QIV '79 policy period,
the staff expects growth in both M-1 and M-2 to be within the Committee's

longer-run ranges, on balance, with little change in interest rates,
given the GNP projection. With respect to M-1, this assumes further that
in the second half of 1979 demand deposits shift to ATS accounts at a rate
that depresses M-1 growth by about 2 percentage points (annual rate) and
that the public also continues to economize on M-1 holdings through shifts
to other assets, though at a slower pace than seems to have been the case
thus far this year. There is substantial uncertainty about both of these
assumptions, however, in part because of possible repercussions on bank
and public attitudes toward ATS and similar accounts of the recent court
ruling that would forbid such accounts after the end of this year unless
the Congress acts to authorize them. Bank credit growth over the year
may be slightly above the targeted range. At present, bank credit
appears to be running well above the upper end of its longer-run range;
however, loan demand is projected to be lower in the second half of the year
as the economy grows at a slow pace, and this should work to bring bank
credit growth down closer to its longer-run range.
(14) In contrast to banks, thrift institutions' deposit flows
are expected to remain relatively weak, although above the exceptionally
low April rate of growth. The mid-March regulatory actions have apparently
had a larger than expected impact on the ability of thrifts to issue
MMCs--the major vehicle through which their deposit inflows had been
maintained since mid-1978. Despite the lower than expected thrift deposit
inflows, the more rapid growth of the commercial bank deposit component of
M-3 is likely to keep the rate of expansion of this aggregate near the
low-end of its longer-run range, as shown in the chart on page 13.

(15) Under alternative B, market interest rates are expected
to show little net change,although markets remain highly sensitive to
incoming information on prices, economic activity, energy, and the money
supply. Short-term credit demands from business may remain fairly strong
over the next few weeks but--with the exception of a very short-term cash
management bill offering in early June--the Treasury is not expected to raise
any new cash in the bill market over the balance of the quarter. In the
long-term area, offerings of corporate and State and local government
bonds are expected to be moderate for the rest of the quarter. The Treasury
will likely be out of the longer-term market over the balance of the
quarter, meeting its needs in coupon markets with comparatively small
additions to the regular 2-year note cycle offerings. In the mortgage market,
however, yields can be expected to continue rising as available supplies
of credit are constrained by the reduced deposit flows to thrift institutions.
(16) Alternative C contemplates a rise in the Federal funds
rate to the midpoint of a 10 to 11 per cent range. Growth in M-1 and
M-2 would likely be in an annual rate range of 0 to 4 and 3 to 7 per
cent, respectively. Short-term interest rates would increase as the funds
rate rises. Treasury bill rates could come under particular upward
pressure if the dollar strengthens on exchange markets and foreign
central banks in consequence engage in substantial support operations.
In the short-run, long-term rates would also likely rise; however, such
increases might be moderated if the market came to believe that a tightening
action now will hasten the ultimate peak in interest rates.
(17) Alternative A calls for a decline in the funds rate over
the intermeeting period to the midpoint of a 9 to 10 per cent range.
Growth in M-1 and M-2 would likely be in annual rate ranges of 1 to 5
and 4½ to 8½ per cent, respectively. An easing action at this time would
be unexpected by the market and hence could induce a sharp decline in
short-term interest rates. On the other hand, market concerns about the
inflationary outlook might moderate the impact of an easing action on
longer-term yields. Similar concerns might also induce some weakness of
the dollar in exchange markets.
Directive language
(18) Given below are suggested operational paragraphs for
the directive in the customary form. Alternative language consistent
with the short-run specifications of the alternatives discussed in the
preceding section is shown for the Committee's objective for the Federal
funds rate early in the period. At a later point, alternative language is
also provided for placing main emphasis either on monetary aggregates
or on money market conditions. The specifications adopted last month are
shown in strike-through form.
In the short-run, the Committee seeks to achieve bank reserve
and money market conditions that are broadly consistent with the
longer-run ranges for monetary aggregates cited above, while giving
due regard to the program for supporting the foreign exchange value
of the dollar and to developing conditions in domestic financial
markets. Early in the period before the next regular meeting,
System open market operations are to be directed at maintaining
the (or ATTAINING A) weekly average Federal funds rate
(A) SLIGHTLY BELOW THE CURRENT LEVEL.
(B) at about the current level.
(C) SLIGHTLY ABOVE THE CURRENT LEVEL.
Subsequently, operations shall be directed at maintaining the
weekly average Federal funds rate within the range of [DEL: 9¾ to 10½]
____ TO ____ per cent. In deciding on the specific objective for
the Federal funds rate the Manager shall be guided mainly by the
relationship between the latest estimates of annual rates of growth
in the [DEL: April-May] MAY-JUNE period of M-1 and M-2 and the following
ranges of tolerance: [DEL: 4-to-8] ____ TO ____ per cent for M-1 and
[DEL: 4 to 8½] ____ TO ____ per cent for M-2. If, with approximately equal
weight given to M-1 and M-2, their rates of growth appear to be

If the rates of growth in the aggregates appear to be above the

time when the objective for the funds rate has already been moved
to the corresponding limit of its range, the Manager will promptly
notify the Chairman, who will then decide whether the situation calls
for supplementary instructions from the Committee.
