MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES
Recent Developments
(1) Growth of the monetary aggregates picked up substantially in
April. A surge in transactions balances around mid-month, which pushed M1 to
an 18 percent rate of growth, likely was related to a huge volume of tax
payments. Nonwithheld tax payments by individuals processed by the Treasury
in April and early May were nearly $25 billion higher than last year, ap-
parently owing to the unusually sizable realization of capital gains late
last year in advance of less favorable treatment under the new tax law.
Partly reflecting these tax effects, and possibly the redemptions reported
at mutual funds as rates rose in early April, M2 accelerated to around a 6
percent annual rate; M3 growth also rose to nearly 6 percent last month
accompanying a pickup in bank credit expansion. These growth rates were in
line with the Committee's specifications for the March-to-June period of
around 6 percent or less, and left the broad aggregates in April just below
the lower ends of their annual cones. Liquid deposits ran off at the end of
April and in early May as tax payments cleared, reversing much of the previous
bulge in M1, and probably also contributing to the sluggish behavior of M2
that appears in train early this month.
(2) The nontransactions component of M2 remained weak in April and
early May. Some of this may be tax related, reflecting transfers into M1
around mid-April from other accounts in M2 as well as the clearing of tax
checks drawn on MMDAs and money market funds. More generally, widening
opportunity costs as market interest rates have increased likely have been
reducing incentives to hold M2 balances. Growth in the non-M2 portion of
M3 was held down by weakness in institution-only money funds as market

rates rose. However, commercial banks stepped up their issuance of large CDs
in April, as the rise in long-term interest rates shifted some credit demands
from capital markets to banks and churning in securities markets apparently
generated demands for security loans.
(3) Growth of the debt of domestic nonfinancial sectors in April
is estimated at a 9-1/2 percent rate, a little above the reduced pace of the
previous two months. Given its ample cash position, the Treasury continued
to pay down bills in regular weekly auctions last month, but with coupon
offerings maintained, on a seasonally adjusted basis Treasury borrowing
strengthened last month. Meanwhile, the upsurge in interest rates prompted
state and local governments to cancel or defer many refunding issues, which
had accounted for a sizable portion of their debt issuance this year. Business
credit growth in the aggregate probably tapered off somewhat, as borrowing
was postponed with the rise in bond yields, but in the household sector, debt
growth appears to have picked up a little. Bank data suggest that consumer
credit strengthened a bit in April, perhaps partly for tax purposes, and
mortgage debt growth likely was sustained by previous commitments and by
continued takedowns under home equity lines.
(4) In light of downward pressures on the dollar, the provision of
reserves through open market operations was cautious at times through the
period, and during the reserve maintenance period ending May 6 the allowance
for adjustment and seasonal borrowing used to construct the reserve path was
raised from $300 to $400 million. Demands for reserves strengthened in April
reflecting increases in required reserves associated with the steep rise in
transaction accounts near mid-month. In the second half of the month, as
the large volume of tax payments cleared, Treasury balances at Reserve Banks
rose precipitously, absorbing reserves. Unusual uncertainties in the
projections of required reserves and Treasury balances, as well as occasional
shortages of RP collateral, ccmplicated the management of reserves over the
intermeeting period. In these circumstances, the federal funds rate spiked
to well over 7 percent late in April, before dropping back to around 6-3/4
percent. The reserve shortages and higher funds rate prompted a considerable
rise in discount window borrowing to $689 million in the period ended April
period, borrowing has averaged $490 million.
(5) Most other interest rates also have risen, with long-term
rates climbing particularly steeply. International developments--the
escalation of trade tensions between the United States and Japan and the
downward pressure on the dollar--raised questions about continuing private
demands for dollar assets, the prospects for U.S. inflation, and the
response of monetary policy. Bond markets stabilized for a time following
announcement of the slight firming in policy and reports of reasonably
active foreign participation at the Treasury's mid-quarter auctions. How-
ever, market sentiment remained uneasy, and worsened in response to rising
commodity prices and the sizable increase in the Producer Price Index.
Bond yields generally have risen a little over a percentage point since the
last FOMC meeting. Commitment rates for fixed-rate mortgages have risen
somewhat more--nearly 1-1/2 percentage points-reflecting increased lender
caution in a volatile rate environment. Short-term rates are up three-
eighths to three-quarters of a percentage point-including three one-quarter
percentage point increases in the prime rate.
(6) The dollar was under substantial selling pressure in foreign
exchange markets for most of the intermeeting period amid continuing tensions
in the trade area and persisting doubts as to whether countries would take
steps to correct underlying domestic and international imbalances. The
dollar has tended to stabilize recently, in part reflecting actions to firm
monetary conditions in the United States and in to ease conditions in
Japan, Germany, and the United Kingdom. The differential between rates on
rose by about 120 basis points in favor of the dollar, while the diffe-
rential in longer-term instruments rose by more than 160 basis points.

Policy alternatives
(7) Three alternative specifications for money growth from March
to June appear in the table below, along with associated federal funds rate
ranges. (More detailed data, including growth rates implied by each alter-
native from April to June and from the fourth-quarter base of the long-run
ranges through June, are presented in the table and charts on the following
pages.) Under all the alternatives, M2 is expected to grow sluggishly on
average in May and June, reflecting at least in part the reversal of the
tax-related buildup and the effects of the recent increases in market rates,
leaving this aggregate in June noticeably below the lower bound of its long-
run range. M3 expansion through June would be supported by issuance of
managed liabilities needed to finance expected bank credit expansion, and
this measure would be around the lower bound of its annual range in June. M1
growth, though slowing considerably from the tax-induced surge in April, still
would average nearly 10 percent over the first half of the year.

(8) Alternative B assumes maintenance of the current $400 million
allowance for adjustment and seasonal borrowing. This is expected to in-
volve some decrease in the federal funds rate from recent levels, which have

partly reflected market perceptions that the System is, or soon would be,
seeking firmer reserve conditions than those assumed in this alternative.
Under normal circumstances, attainment of the alternative B borrowing path
and its broad perception as the System's operating objective might be as-
sociated with the federal funds rate dropping to appreciably below 6-1/2
percent. However, continuation of concerns about the dollar and infla-
tion and related uncertainties about the stance of monetary policy might
prevent the funds rate from falling below the 6-1/2 percent area. If the
funds rate were to settle around 6-1/2 percent, Treasury bills probably would
trade in a 5-3/4 to 6 percent range. The lower level of the funds rate could
encourage a decline in rates on other private short-term instruments.
(9) The slight drop in money market rates expected under this
alternative may not be accompanied by an improvement in bond yields. Longer-
term markets are likely to remain highly sensitive to the behavior of the
dollar on foreign exchange markets and indications of emerging price pressures
in the United States. While increases in some price measures should moderate
a bit from the elevated rate of earlier months, they are expected to remain
considerably in excess of the pace of last year. Moreover, the staff expects
the dollar to remain under downward pressure with alternative B, in light of
slow progress in the adjustment of nominal external imbalances, arising in
part from weak growth in our major trading partners. Under these conditions,
markets are likely to continue to anticipate a firming in monetary policy
before very long.
(10) Under alternative B, M2 growth is expected to be held down
in May, in part by the unwinding of tax payment effects. Expansion of this
aggregate is projected to rebound in June to a 5-3/4 percent rate--roughly
in line with the pace that might be expected based on interest rate movements
and projected income growth. But this would still mean rather slow growth
over the second quarter and by June this aggregate would have grown
a full percentage point below its lower bound. Balances depleted by April
tax payments are not likely to be replenished quickly. Rates paid on M2
assets should continue to lag behind recent increases in market rates,
although small time deposit rates in some areas of the country are moving
up quickly. The velocity of M2 implied by the staff's GNP forecast would
rise at a 3 percent annual rate this quarter, compared with a gain less
than half that size in the first quarter. While an increase in velocity
would be expected with the further rise in the average opportunity cost on
M2, under alternative B this increase would be somewhat greater than predicted
by most available models of M2 demand. M2 growth in the second quarter
apparently is being depressed by special factors, perhaps related to a draw-
down of balances accumulated late in 1986 when capital gains were realized,
and to shifting preferences for financing consumer purchases out of liquid
assets rather than with credit.
(11) M3 growth is expected to average around 6 percent in May and
June under alternative B, keeping this aggregate near the lower end of its
long-run range. Expansion of M3 should be sustained by an anticipated pickup
in net issuance of large time deposits and other managed liabilities to
support asset growth at depository institutions. However, M3 growth may be
held down by increased borrowing by banks from their foreign branches, espe-
cially if foreign central banks continue to intervene heavily and place the
proceeds in the Euromarkets. Business borrowing at commercial banks, which
already has accelerated so far this quarter in response to higher costs of
longer-term corporate financing, is expected to continue strong. Some
bounce-back of thrift asset expansion from the depressed first-quarter pace
is anticipated in the second quarter, in part as higher mortgage rates boost
originations of ARMs, which are much less likely than fixed rate mortgages
to be sold into pools. Expansion of all credit to nonfinancial sectors, in
markets as well as through depositories, is expected to continue at around
a 10 percent rate over May and June, placing the debt aggregate just below
the upper end of its monitoring range.
(12) Owing to the clearing of tax payments in late April and early
May, M1 likely will be flat in May on a monthly average basis before rebound-
ing in June to around an 8 percent annual rate under alternative B. June
growth would represent a moderation from the average pace since the fourth
quarter of last year, in response to the upward movement of market interest
rates. There is some chance that the deceleration could be even more marked,
should depositors be particularly sensitive to widening spreads between rates
on small time deposits and OCDs. Under alternative B, quarterly average growth
for M1, at 7-1/2 percent, still would slightly exceed projected GNP expansion,
implying a decline in M1 velocity for the tenth straight quarter.
(13) Alternative C assumes either a $200 million increase, to
$600 million, in the borrowing allowance used to construct reserve paths,
or a rise in the discount rate of one-half percentage point. With the
market already anticipating some firming of policy, any increase in the
federal funds and other market rates under this alternative might be rela-
tively muted, although a discount rate increase could have a more sizable,
temporary impact on very short-term rates. Federal funds might settle into
a 6-3/4 to 7 percent range, and bill rates might rise to around 6-1/4 percent
or a little higher. Any upward adjustment of Treasury bond yields probably
also would be comparatively small, as this policy action would tend to temper
bearishness about the dollar in exchange markets, especially if it were
accompanied by further easing moves abroad, and relieve some anxieties about
the outlook for U.S. inflation. Quality spreads could widen some, however,
if the higher rates were seen as raising the odds on a weak economic perform-
ance, or were to intensify concerns about the international debt situation.
An additional increase in the prime rate seems likely under this alternative.
(14) The continued widening of opportunity costs of monetary
assets implied by alternative C would further depress demands for core
deposits, with M2 growth from April to June likely slowing to a 2-1/4 percent
pace. Growth at this rate would leave M2 at the lower end of the parallel
band associated with its longer-run range. The implied expansion--of around
the long-run range would seem to require a considerable easing of policy later
in the year. Transactions deposits would be especially affected by an upward
movement of market rates, which would substantially boost opportunity costs
on NOW accounts and constrain demand deposit growth partly because compensat-
ing balance requirements were reduced. M3 growth would be expected to remain
at about its April pace as bank credit growth stayed strong, placing this
aggregate at the lower bound of its long-run range in June.
(15) Alternative A, which assumes a reduction of borrowing at the
discount window to $200 million, would induce the federal funds rate to drop
back over time, probably to below 6 percent. The easing of reserve pressures
would tend to boost M2 growth in June to a 7 percent annual rate, thereby
limiting, though not preventing, a widening by June of the shortfall of M2
relative to the 5-1/2 percent lower bound of its annual range. Lower interest
rates and stronger nominal income growth than in the staff greenbook forecast
would be expected to boost M2 demand in the second half of the year, providing
greater assurance that this aggregate would grow within its range for the
year. The specified growth of M3 over these two months, at 6-1/4 percent,
would move this aggregate in June to just above the lower bound of its
range. M1 under this policy alternative would be expected to grow at only
a 4-3/4 percent average rate over the last two months of this quarter, but
its June pace of 10 percent would be more suggestive of its underlying momentum
entering the remainder of the year.
(16) Under alternative A, short-term interest rates would retrace
their recent increases. Unless it were accompanied by substantial easing
moves abroad, the exchange value of the dollar would move sharply downward,
heightening inflation concerns. Under these conditions bond yields would be
unlikely to decline much, if at all.
Directive language
(17) Two variants of draft language for the operational paragraph
are shown below. In both variants, alternative language shown in brackets
at the end of the first sentence would take account of the difference between
the actual reserve pressures in recent weeks and those specified in the
reserve paths. The first variant then follows the format of the March 31
directive which placed particular emphasis on the behavior of the dollar in
foreign exchange markets in guiding any intermeeting reserve adjustments.
The language in the second set of brackets would allow for easing as well as
firming over the intermeeting period should the Committee not want to rule
out this possibility. Given the recent behavior of prices, the Committee
may wish to consider whether to substitute wording like "indications of
inflationary pressures", shown in the third set of brackets, for the
current "progress against inflation."
Variant II returns to a structure more like that used prior to
March 31, placing greater emphasis on monetary growth in guiding possible
intermeeting reserve adjustments. However, this variant also would retain
"developments in foreign exchange markets" as a key factor that could call
for an adjustment in reserve pressures during the intermeeting period.
OPERATIONAL PARAGRAPH
Variant I
In the implementation of policy for the immediate future, the
Committee seeks to DECREASE SOMEWHAT (Alt. A)/maintain (Alt. B)/
INCREASE SOMEWHAT (Alt. C) the existing degree of pressure on
reserve positions [THE DEGREE OF RESERVE PRESSURE SOUGHT IN RECENT
WEEKS]. Somewhat/SLIGHTLY greater reserve restraint might/WOULD

acceptable depending on developments in foreign exchange markets,
taking into account the behavior of the aggregates, the strength
of the business expansion, progress against inflation [INDICATIONS
OF INFLATIONARY PRESSURES], and conditions in credit markets.
This approach is expected to be consistent with growth in M2
and M3 over the period from March through June at annual rates
of around [DEL:6] ____ AND ____ percent [DEL: or less], RESPECTIVELY. Growth
in M1 is expected to [DEL: remain] SLOW substantially OVER THE BALANCE
OF THE SECOND QUARTER [DEL: below its pace in 1986]. The Chairman

OVER THE BALANCE OF THE SECOND QUARTER. SOMEWHAT/SLIGHTLY
GREATER RESERVE RESTRAINT MIGHT/WOULD, OR SOMEWHAT/SLIGHTLY
LESSER RESERVE RESTRAINT MIGHT/WOULD, BE ACCEPTABLE DEPENDING ON
THE BEHAVIOR OF THE MONETARY AGGREGATES AS WELL AS DEVELOPMENTS
IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE MARKETS, WHILE ALSO TAKING ACCOUNT OF THE
