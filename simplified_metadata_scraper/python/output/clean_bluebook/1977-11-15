Prefatory Note 
 
 
The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version available 
based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the Board 
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was created 
through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned 
versions text-searchable.2   Though a stringent quality assurance process was 
employed, some imperfections may remain. 
 
Please note that some material may have been redacted from this document if that

1  In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic 
format.  All scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced 
tilting) and lightly cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other 
blemishes caused after initial printing). 
 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optical character recognition computer program (OCR) 
first created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, 
staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.  Please note that the numbers and text in charts and

Recent developments
(1) M-1 growth accelerated to a 12 per cent annual rate in
October, but recent data suggest that growth in November will slow sub-
stantially to about a 1 per cent annual rate. Thus, over the October-
November period, M-1 is now expected to expand at an annual rate of about
6 per cent, as compared with the Committee's 3 to 8 per cent range for
this period. Growth of time deposits other than negotiable CD's has
picked up in recent weeks, about offsetting a slowing in the expansion
of passbook accounts. M-2 growth for October and November is projected at
near a 7¾ per cent annual rate, just above the mid-point of its range.
Deposit flows into thrifts moderated in October, but remained at historically
high levels. Nonborrowed reserves declined in October, reflecting increased
volume of member bank borrowing from the System. However, borrowing has
fallen somewhat since the increase in the discount rate to 6 per cent in
late October, and, given the recent strength in deposits, nonborrowed
reserves are expected to expand at a 2¾ per cent average annual rate for
October and November combined.

(2) Following the October FOMC meeting, the Desk continued to
aim for a Federal funds rate of around 6 per cent. However, at the end
of October, as available data suggested that the aggregates were growing
at rates near to, or above, the upper ends of their ranges, the Desk sought
slightly firmer money market conditions. Most recently, with additional
data indicating a more moderate growth of the aggregates, the Desk has
once again been aiming at a funds rate around 6 per cent. Over the inter-
meeting period, the funds rate has generally fluctuated between 6 and 6-5/8
per cent.
(3) With the Federal funds rate showing little change on balance
since the October meeting--at a time when a number of market observers
had expected it to rise further--short-term market interest rates have
declined somewhat. This small decline in rates occurred even though credit
flows in short-term markets increased. Business loan growth at banks
accelerated in October--perhaps reflecting in part a change in seasonal
borrowing patterns. In addition, outstanding commercial paper of nonfinancial
firms remained unchanged after declining in September. Banks met a portion
of the rise in loan volume by running off Treasury securities, as they
have been doing since June of this year, and by issuing negotiable CD's
at the fastest rate in over three years.
(4) Rates on Treasury and corporate bonds have edged slightly
higher since October, while yields on municipal issues have dropped some-
what. Corporate and municipal bond offerings moderated in recent weeks,
especially relative to normal seasonal patterns. The Treasury, however,
has auctioned a substantial volume of intermediate- and longer-term debt
in conjunction with its mid-quarter refunding operation. Also, household
demands for mortgages and consumer credit appear to have remained strong.
Despite some slowing in their deposit growth, savings and loan associa-
tions apparently have maintained a very active stance in mortgage markets,
in part by augmenting deposit inflows with borrowings from Home Loan Banks.
(5) In its refunding operations, the Treasury auctioned
$3.3 billion of 3-year notes at an average rate of 7.24 per cent, $2 billion
of 10-year notes at 7.69 per cent and $1.3 billion of 30-year bonds at
7.94 per cent, to raise $4.1 billion of new money and redeem $2.4 billion
of maturing debt. The 3-year note auction was marked by a very large
volume of noncompetitive tenders. In trading after the auction, the
price of this note fell following the System's temporary firming move,
but subsequent price increases have erased this early decline; the other
issues have been consistently trading at premiums relative to their
respective auction averages. Dealers distributed the bulk of their awards
of each issue quite rapidly.

Prospective Developments
(7) Shown below for the Committee's consideration are three
alternative sets of specifications for the monetary aggregates and the
Federal funds rate for the forthcoming intermeeting period. (More
detailed and longer-term data for the aggregates are shown in the tables
on pp. 7 and 8).

M-2 5½ to 9½ 5 to 9 4½ to 8½
Federal funds rate
(Intermeeting period) 5¾ to 6¼ 6¼ to 6¾ 6¾ to 7¼
(8) Under alternative B, the Federal funds rate would be
expected to remain near the mid-point of the 6¼ to 6¾ per cent rate range
specified by the Committee at its last meeting. M-1 growth over the
November-December period likely to be associated with such a funds rate
would be in a 2-7 per cent annual rate range. While data available so
far this month suggest that M-1 will expand only slightly in November,
the staff would anticipate an acceleration in December--perhaps to about
an 8 per cent annual rate--given the projected strengthening of nominal
GNP and the associated underlying transactions demands for cash. Such an
expansion would produce a 7½ per cent annual rate of growth of M-1 from the
third to the fourth quarter, somewhat below the 9 per cent average annual
rate of growth of this aggregate in the second and third quarters of 1977.

(9) If staff expectations are realized for November-December,
M-1 in the first three quarters of 1978 would have to expand at a 4 to
4 per cent annual rate to achieve the mid-point of the Committee's
longer-run range of 4-6 per cent for the QIII '77-QIII '78 period. This
is likely to require further increases in interest rates, given our view
that money demand will continue to be stronger relative to economic
activity than was the case in 1975 and 1976, and also given the projected
11 per cent annual rate of increase for nominal GNP over the first three
quarters of next year. The Federal funds rate may have to begin rising
by late December and reach a level of about 7¾ per cent in the spring,
as shown in Appendix I. The increases in money market rates would, of
course, be accompanied by a return to higher rates of velocity growth, as
shown in Appendix II.
(10) Growth in M-2 over the November-December period is likely
to be in a 5 to 9 per cent annual rate range under Alternative B. The
time and savings deposit component of M-2 under this alternative is
expected to continue to expand at near its recent pace. Although savings
deposits at commercial banks are likely to continue growing relatively
slowing over the near-term as interest sensitive depositors shift to
higher yielding assets, time deposits at banks, especially those not
subject to Regulation Q ceiling, are expected to grow at a relatively
rapid rate. In addition, shifting of maturing wildcard accounts from
banks to thrifts will no longer be a depressant on commercial bank time
deposit growth, as seems to have been the case during the third quarter.
(11) Even with the higher rates of interest expected in 1978,
the time and savings deposit component of M-2 is likely to grow next
year at a pace only marginally below that expected for November-December.
Historically, very low rates of growth of savings deposits at banks have
been short-lived--as the most interest sensitive depositors tend to shift
out of such assets quickly. Inflows of consumer-type time deposits to
banks are likely to weaken significantly. However, given the staff's
projection of continued sizable bank credit demands, banks can be expected
to step up their offerings of large denomination time deposits included
in M-2 but not subject to Regulation Q ceilings.
(12) Inflows to thrift institutions moderated somewhat in
October. Such inflows may moderate somewhat further over the next few
weeks under alternative B, and can be expected to decelerate markedly in
1978 if the projected rise of interest rates materializes. However, the
deceleration at thrifts--and at banks as well--is not likely to be as
marked as might be expected from interest rate considerations alone
because of the high level of nominal income growth projected for 1978
and the large volume of longer-term time certificates now outstanding at
depository institutions. This would tend to moderate the extent to which
thrifts will have to increase their borrowing and reduce liquidity in
order to meet outstanding mortgage commitments.
(13) If the Federal funds rate remains near its present 6-1/2
per cent level over the intermeeting period, as envisioned under Alterna-
tive B, short-term interest rates will probably show little net change
during the next few weeks, even though demands for short-term funds are likely
to be rather strong over this period. The Treasury is expected to sell
a large block of cash management bills in early December and the moderate
forward calendar of corporate bond offerings suggests that business demands
for credit may be relatively strong in the short-term area over the balance
of the year. Under these circumstances, it appears likely that yields on
long-term bonds will be relatively stable over the near term and could
even edge down a bit.
(14) Alternative C contemplates an increase in the Federal funds
rate to the mid-point of a 6¾ to 7¼ per cent range between now and the
next Committee meeting. With additional monetary restraint in place some-
what sooner, the staff would expect growth in the monetary aggregates to
be somewhat slower over the next few months than under Alternative B. Con-
sequently, somewhat less monetary restraint would be needed later in 1978,
and interest rates would rise a little less next year under alternative C
than under B.
(15) A near-term increase in the Federal funds rate to around
7 per cent would probably be associated with an increase in money market
rates of about one-half percentage point. Member bank borrowing from the
discount window would probably once again rise substantially, and pressures
for another increase in the discount rate would soon develop. The bank
prime rate also could be expected to increase by at least one-fourth of
a percentage point. Long-term rates would probably rise considerably
less, on balance, than short-term market rates, particularly in view of
the large volume of investable funds available from insurance companies
and pension funds.
(16) An easing in the funds rate to the mid-point of a 5¾ to
6¾ per cent range, as envisioned under Alternative A, could stimulate sub-
stantial downward adjustments in interest rates. Such rate movements, how-
ever, would probably be short-lived, since the added impetus to growth in
the monetary aggregates would soon require a sharp reversal in interest
rates in order to constrain the aggregates to the Committee's longer-run
ranges. With M-1 likely to expand at about a 7 per cent average annual
rate over the fourth quarter of 1977 and the first quarter of 1978 under
this alternative, interest rates would have to rise sufficiently to hold
M-1 growth in the second and third quarters of 1978 to a 3½ per cent
annual rate. The projected Federal funds pattern for this alternative
calls, therefore, for sustained increases to around 8¼ per cent in the third
quarter of 1978. Under such circumstances, some adjustment in Regulation Q
ceilings may have to be considered by next summer.
Directive language
(17) Given below are alternatives for the operational paragraphs
of the directive. The first formulation places main emphasis on near-term
rates of growth in monetary aggregates. The second formulation, like the
directive adopted at the last meeting, places main emphasis on money market
conditions; it shows--in strike-through form--the specifications adopted at
the last meeting. As suggested below, the particular language needed in
the opening lines of the money market formulation would depend on the
specific conditions sought; the three alternatives shown--calling, respec-
tively, for somewhat easier, prevailing, and somewhat firmer money market
conditions--are intended to be associated with the specifications discussed
in the preceding section under alternatives A, B, and C.
"Money Aggregates" Formulation
The Committee seeks to encourage near-term rates of growth in
M-1 and M-2 on a path believed to be reasonably consistent with
the longer-run ranges for monetary aggregates cited in the preceding
paragraph. Specifically, at present, it expects the annual growth
rates over the November-December period to be within the ranges of
____ to ____ per cent for M-1 and ____ to ____ per cent
for M-2. In the judgment of the Committee such growth rates are
likely to be associated with a weekly-average Federal funds rate of
about ____ per cent. If, giving approximately equal weight to
M-1 and M-2, it appears that growth rates over the 2-month period
will deviate significantly from the midpoints of the indicated
ranges, the operational objective for the Federal funds rate shall
be modified in an orderly fashion within a range of ____ to
____ per cent.
If it appears during the period before the next meeting that
the operating constraints specified above are proving to be signif-
icantly inconsistent, the Manager is promptly to notify the Chairman
who will then decide whether the situation calls for supplementary
instructions from the Committee.
"Money Market" Formulation
At this time, the Committee seeks to maintain about the prevail-
ing money market conditions (OR TO ACHIEVE SOMEWHAT EASIER OR SOME-
WHAT FIRMER MONEY MARKET CONDITIONS) during the period immediately
ahead, provided that monetary aggregates appear to be growing at
approximately the rates currently expected, which are believed to
be on a path reasonably consistent with the longer-run ranges for
monetary aggregates cited in the preceding paragraph. Specifically,
the Committee seeks to maintain the weekly-average Federal funds
rate at about [DEL: 6-1/2] ____ per cent, so long as M-1 and M-2 appear
to be growing over the [DEL: October-November] NOVEMBER-DECEMBER period
at annual rates within ranges of [DEL: 3 to 8] ____ TO ____ per cent and [DEL: 5-1/2
to 9-1/2] ____ TO ____ per cent, respectively. If, giving
approximately equal weight to M-1 and M-2, it appears that growth
rates over the 2-month period are approaching or moving beyond the
limits of the indicated ranges, the operational objective for the
weekly-average Federal funds rate shall be modified in an orderly
fashion within a range of [DEL: 6-1/2 to 6-3/4] ____ to ____ per cent.
If it appears during the period before the next meeting that
the operating constraints specified above are proving to be signif-
icantly inconsistent, the Manager is promptly to notify the Chairman
who will then decide whether the situation calls for supplementary
instructions from the Committee.
