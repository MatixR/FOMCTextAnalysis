MONEY MARKET AND RESERVE RELATIONSHIPS
Recent developments
Yields in debt markets--which had already begun to recede
from their extreme May highs at the time of the last Committee meeting--
dropped substantially further in late May and early June when optimism
about passage of the pending tax bill was revived. Overall declines
fron the May highs ranged to about 20 basis points on municipal, new
corporate, and U.S. Government bonds, and to nearly 40 basis points
on longer maturities of Treasury bills. Since then, as market
participants have awaited final confirmation of their general
optimism on the tax bill, yields in most debt markets have levelled
off, showing little change on balance.
The downswing in bill rates carried the yield on 3-month
bills to the lower end of the 5.65 -- 6.00 per cent range projected
in the last Blue Book, but rates on other short-term debt instruments,
such as commercial and finance company paper, have remained at or
relatively closer to their recent peaks. While the movement of bill
rates to the lower part of the range in part reflects the more optimistic
outlook for tax action, it also reflects the less taut atmosphere in
day-to-day money markets that has prevailed since the latter part of
In the latter part of May and early June, Federal funds rates
have most frequently been in a 6 -- 6-1/4 per cent area, and at times
under 6 per cent, while rates on new loans to dealers posted by New
York banks were frequently 6-1/4 -- 6-1/2 per cent--as compared with

for dealer loan rates in the brief period of extreme tightness in the
early part of May. The day-to-day money market has been less tight
partly because the very large increase in Euro-dollar borrowings
enabled major money market banks to maintain a more comfortable basic
reserve position. In addition, the expectational impact on bill
rates of restored market confidence as to fiscal legislation reduced
banks' concern about an inordinately large CD run-off.
Bank credit, as indicated by the proxy, has shown more
strength than projected at the time of the last meeting of the Committee.
The May bank credit proxy has been revised upward slightly to a 1-1/2
per cent annual rate of growth, and, as will be indicated in the
prospective section, the June rate of expansion is now expected to be
larger than May (and also larger than earlier projected).
Loan demands on banks have strengthened after the mid-April
to mid-May lull, while at the same time banks sold somewhat less of
the securities obtained in the mid-May Treasury financing than
originally anticipated. In financing loans and securities, banks have
been able to obtain somewhat more time deposits than expected. And for
individual banks, the increased availability of Euro-dollars and more
moderate decline in U.S. Government demand balances were also factors
providing more funds, net. At the same time, the banking system as a
whole appears to have economized on excess reserves in recent weeks
in the process of expanding bank credit.
June 14, 1968.
CONFIDENTIAL (FR)
With the central money market tending to ease somewhat, and
banks economizing on excess reserves, net borrowed reserves during the
past two statement weeks deepened to an average of about $470 million,
about $100 million deeper than in May on average. Member bank borrowings
averaged $720 million during the past two weeks, about the same as in
May. Since mid-May net borrowed reserves have ranged between a low of
$355 million and a high of $540 million, with the high number occurring
in the week ending June 5, the second half of a double-settlement period.
The table below shows the behavior of key monetary variables
(as annual rates of increase) during the same periods as shown in the
previous Blue Book. Changes in the data reflect the recent experience

Prospective developments
With the Congressional decision on fiscal legislation almost
at hand, with the dividend and interest crediting period for savings
institutions near, and with international financial conditions re-
maining uncertain, the constellations of money market conditions and
monetary variables consistent with alternative monetary policies over
the period ahead are even more unpredictable than usual. They will
depend in large part on events outside the immediate sphere of monetary
policy or of prevailing domestic economic conditions.
The course of these events is likely to impinge on demands
for bank credit and money, bank behavior with respect to portfolios and
time deposits, and movements of Treasury bill rates as well as long-
term interest rates in various market sectors. Favorable developments,
in the sense of enactment of fiscal legislation and the avoidance of
international financial crises, are likely to lead to tendencies for
long- and also, in some degree, short-term interest rates to decline
and to a greater willingness by banks to purchase securities in the
market. Unfavorable developments are likely to be accompanied by a
sharp rise in interest rates on a broad front, further withdrawal
of banks from securities markets, and a further tightening of
mortgage credit conditions as both banks and nonbank savings
institutions find themselves severely strapped for funds and with
prospects for an easing of conditions dim.
The progress of fiscal legislation will also affect demands
in the market for day-to-day money and demands by banks for borrowings

from the Federal Reserve and the Euro-dollar market. Passage of the
tax increase would tend to tranquilize banks' fears about the availability
of deposit and reserve funds in the weeks ahead, although immediate needs
for short-term credit are likely to be substantial. On the other hand,
a disappointment on the tax front may lead to an immediate and also
very intense scramble for short-term funds. Variations in the
demands for day-to-day money would lead to differential effects on
interest rates more broadly viewed and on monetary aggregates,with
the net impact depending on whether or to what extent the System attempts
to maintain current money market conditions between now and the next
meeting of the Committee.
Current money market conditions would appear to encompass
a Federal funds rate generally in a 6 -- 6-1/4 per cent range, net
borrowed reserves in a $300 - $450 million range, and member bank
borrowings averaging around $650 - $700 million. Pressures in the
aftermath of the mid-June tax date, any difficulties banks might have
in rolling over their very large Euro-dollar holdings, and corporate
need to pay $1 billion of additional taxes within a short span of time
after the tax bill is enacted are all factors that would put pressure
on the central money market and hence may require net borrowed reserves
more toward the shallow end of the range if the Federal funds rate is
not to rise over the period ahead.
Given this set of day-to-day financing costs and pressure
on bank reserve positions, the 3-month bill rate can be expected to
fluctuate within a 5-1/2 -- 5-7/8 per cent range. The effect on
CONFIDENTIAL (FR)
investor and dealer expectations of a favorable decision on taxes
could accentuate any near-term tendency for bill rates to decline and
moderate any upward pressure that might develop later. In the days
immediately ahead, the bill rate could move toward the lower end of
the range in reflection of reinvestment demand from holders of maturing
June tax bills not turned in for taxes; in addition, the System is
likely to be a sizable buyer for seasonal reasons and also to offset
the reserve impact of swap repayments. But the odds suggest upward
pressure on bill rates later as the Treasury markets bills to meet
its cash need early in July, as businesses seek short-term funds to
make tax payments, and as investors tend to lengthen portfolios.
The money and short-term market conditions noted above would
appear consistent with expansion in the bank credit proxy in a 3 - 6
per cent, annual rate, range in June, and about 3 percentage points
would be added for Euro-dollar borrowings, Time and savings deposits
in June are expected to rise in a 4 - 6 per cent annual rate range
as banks' experience with consumer time and savings deposits and CD's
have been more favorable than anticipated. CD run-offs are now pro-
jected to be around $600 million, or only a little more than seasonal.
The money supply in June is expected to rise in an 8 - 10 per cent,
annual rate, range, close to previous projections. Continued declines
in U.S. Government deposits appear to be contributing to expansion in
private demand deposits, but in addition business loan expansion thus
far this month appears to be developing strongly, with consequent growth
in private cash balances for transactions purposes.
June 14, 1968.
CONFIDENTIAL (FR) -7- June 14, 1968.
Assuming passage of the tax increase and with the Treasury
raising $4 billion of new cash in July, largely early in the month
through tax anticipation bills, growth of the bank credit proxy in that
month might be in a 1 to 4 per cent annual rate range. This projection
assumes maintenance of the current constellation of day-to-day money
rates and net reserve position of banks. Whether the proxy is toward
the lower or upper end of the range will depend in large part on
expectational reactions affecting market interest rates and the ability,
or willingness, of banks to secure deposits. If banks are in a position,
or willing, to obtain deposits they will not have to liquidate securities
now in portfolio or rapidly sell securities obtained during the pro-
jected financing in order to accommodate expected relatively strong
loan demands.
With or without a tax increase, demand deposits are not
likely to be a significant source of funds to banks in July as Government
and private deposits show complicated but generally offsetting movements
on average. U.S. Government deposits are expected to decline further,
on average (seasonally adjusted), but to rise in the course of the
month from the exceptionally low end of June level. With large Federal
expenditures continuing to create sizable transfers to private deposits,
the money supply is likely to show a continued vigorous expansion on
average for the month, but during the course of the month money growth
should slow considerably.
Growth in time deposits in July will depend greatly on the
course of short-term rates and the ability of banks to obtain CD's.
CONFIDENTIAL (FR) -8- June 14, 1968.
Consumer-type time and savings deposits are not likely to add sig-
nificantly to the availability of funds even if short-term rates
decline moderately since over-all interest rate levels would still be
relatively high in the critical late June-early July period, and since
consumers are likely to reduce their savings rate somewhat in the wake
of a tax increase. If the 3-month bill rate should move into the upper
half of the range noted above, and other short-term rates should remain
close to recent levels, run-offs of CD's might be fairly substantial
given current Regulation Q ceilings.
Developments under alternative policy assumptions. Bill
rates may well tend to decline for a time, for seasonal reasons and
following affirmative tax action. But part of this decline--if it
occurs--may be in anticipation of monetary policy changes. Under such
conditions, for the bill rate to hold at a significantly lower level--
say, in a 5-3/8 -- 5-5/8 per cent range--would probably require a
reduction in the Federal funds rate to below 6 per cent and also an
associated reduction in pressures on banks' net reserve positions (with
net borrowed reserves at times as low as $200 million). If the Com-
mittee adopted a directive thus permitting day-to-day money market rates
to decline in accommodation of reductions in other market interest rates,
the resulting less restrictive over-all money and credit market con-
ditions should lead to increased willingness on the part of banks to
expand credit. Bank credit expansion in July would likely be toward
the upper end of the range indicated above, or larger, depending in part
on how eager banks are to recapture CD funds and on the availability
of such funds in view of expected sizable business and Treasury needs
for credit.
CONFIDENTIAL (FR) -9- June 14, 1968.
As noted earlier, it is possible that market pressures might
be such as to prevent or limit a prompt response in short-term market
rates following affirmative tax actions. Given this possibility, the
Committee might wish to adopt a policy to lead market rates down, which
would be implemented by Desk action to lower the Federal funds rate to
below 6 per cent, say, initially around 5-3/4 per cent, with an
associated reduction in net borrowed reserves to a $200 to $300 million
range. Prompt System initiative in achieving such money market conditions
would provide greater assurance (than in the preceding alternative) that
bill rates would adjust down in the 5-3/8 -- 5-5/8 per cent range, or
perhaps a bit lower depending on the strength of expectational forces.
