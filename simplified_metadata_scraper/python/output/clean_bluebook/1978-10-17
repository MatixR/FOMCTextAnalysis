Prefatory Note
The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain.
Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a redaction process that removed information obtained on a 
confidential basis.  All redacted passages are exempt from disclosure under applicable 
provisions of the Freedom of Information Act.
1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked 
and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not 
reliably recognized by the OCR process and were not checked or corrected by staff.

Recent developments
(1) M-1 growth surged to a 14.1 per cent annual rate in
September, but appears to be slowing in October on the basis of data
for the early part of the month. Over September and October M-1 is
now projected to rise at about a 9 per cent rate, at the upper end of
the FOMC's range. M-2 appears to be increasing at about a 10 per cent
annual rate in the September-October period, just below the upper end
of the FOMC's range. Both savings and small time deposits grew sur-
prisingly rapidly at banks in September, and growth in total deposits
at thrift institutions accelerated further to about a 15-1/2 per cent
annual rate. Sales of the new money market certificates by banks and
thrift institutions remained large last month, in total matching the
August pace.

(2) Following the September FOMC meeting, incoming data
suggested that M-1 growth would be around the upper end, and M-2 growth
in the upper half, of their respective short-run ranges. The Account
Management responded by raising its Federal funds rate objective to
8-3/4 per cent, the upper end of the Committee's range. The discount
rate was raised 1/4 point to 8 per cent on September 22 and was again
raised to 8-1/2 per cent after the close of business Friday, October 13.
Member bank borrowing has averaged from $1-1/4 to $1-1/2 billion during
the past three statement weeks.
(3) Prior to the latest discount rate increase, most short-
term interest rates had increased another 20 to 50 basis points from
the September FOMC meeting, as the market reacted to the further
increases in the Federal funds rate and to the continued strength in
published monetary aggregate data. The 3-month Treasury bill rate,
however, dropped back sharply to around 7-3/4 per cent--below its level
at the time of the September meeting--as foreign demand for bills were
relatively strong and the Treasury continued to emphasize 6-month bills
in the regular weekly refundings. In after-hours trading on Friday,
following the latest discount rate action, Treasury bill rates rose 10
to 15 basis points.
(4) Yields on long-term Treasury and corporate securities
also moved higher over the inter-meeting period--generally by 20 to 30
basis points as of the close of business on Friday--as interest rate
expectations appeared to shift in response not only to the further rise
in short rates, but also to the persistence of rapid inflation and to
signs that economic activity might be stronger over coming months than
some had anticipated. These recent increases left long-term Treasury
and corporate yields somewhat below their highs for the current expan-
sion reached in mid-July, even though the funds rate had risen 100
basis points since that time. In contrast to yields on other long-
term bonds, yields on municipal issues remained essentially unchanged
during recent weeks, owing in part to a sharp decline in advance
refundings by State and local units.
(5) Growth in commercial bank credit picked up somewhat in
September, as investments and security loans rose after declining in
August. Real estate and business loans expanded at just below the
average rates observed since late spring, and the bank prime rate
rose to 10 per cent. Average rates charged by S&Ls on new home loan
commitments also have edged up of late, despite enlarged deposits flows
and reduced borrowing from Home Loan Banks, as the cost of obtaining
funds through the 6-month money market certificate has risen further.
Mortgage credit demands apparently remain strong, and loan takedowns
and commitments rose at S&Ls in August.

Prospective developments
(7) Alternative longer-run growth ranges for the monetary
aggregates over the one-year QIII '78 to QIII '79 period are shown
below for Committee consideration. M-1 ranges shown in the top line
reflect staff estimates of the expected shift from demand deposits to
savings deposits over the year ahead as a result of the introduction of
the automatic transfer service (ATS) on November 1, while M-1 ranges
that abstract from the estimated impact of ATS are shown in parentheses
in the second line. The upper limits of the ranges on the top line are
noticeably lower than those on the second line because the staff
believes that some significant shift from demand to savings deposits
as a result of ATS will almost assuredly occur, as explained in paragraph
8; the ranges of the top line are relatively wide to allow for the
uncertain size of this shift. Alternative B is based on the same growth
rate range for M-1 as adopted by the Committee in July for the QII '78
to QII '79 period, while alternatives A and C encompass, respectively,
more and less expansion of M-1. For reasons to be discussed later, the
M-2 and M-3 ranges in nearly all cases have been raised relative to
current ranges.

(8) Over the QIII '78-QIII '79 policy period, the staff
projects that ATS would reduce M-1 growth by between 1½ and 4½
percentage points. The upper end of this range assumes that some-
thing less than 20 per cent of the nearly $95 billion of eligible demand
deposits shift to savings deposits in the first year of ATS, while the
lower end assumes something less than 10 per cent shifts. While
uncertainties are, of course, vast, the upper end of the range is
comparable to first year experience with NOW accounts in the four New
England states that were permitted to offer such accounts in early
1976. Transfers under present circumstances may be slower because
of the absence of competition from thrifts, which was present in
New England. However, it would appear that bank pricing of the ATS
will make such service quite attractive for large deposit holders, who
account for a major share of eligible deposits.
(9) Given the degree of uncertainty regarding the size
of the distortion in M-1 produced by automatic transfers, the staff
also proposes that the Committee consider the desirability of
supplementing, at least for a transition period, the other monetary
measures with the aggregate "M-l+", which will not be affected by
shifts between demand and savings deposits at banks and should
provide useful collateral evidence about the strength of the
1/transactions demand for money.- This aggregate--defined as M-1
plus savings deposits at commercial banks, NOW accounts at thrifts,
credit union share drafts, and demand deposits at MSB's--was discussed
in appendix V of the September Bluebook. The addendum to the table
1/ It would, of course, be affected by shifts from deposits at
savings institutions to commercial bank ATS accounts. Such shifts
should be relatively modest. We have assumed a shift of $2 billion,
which adds .4 of a percentage point to growth in M-1+ over the
QIII '78-QIII '79 period.
in paragraph (7) shows M-1+ ranges thought to be consistent with the
other aggregates.
(10) The demand for transactions balances is expected to
remain quite strong over the new QIII '78 to QIII '79 policy period,
with nominal GNP projected to rise at almost an 11 per cent annual
rate. Thus, a further rise in the Federal funds rate appears needed
under alternatives B and C if growth in the aggregates is to be held
within their ranges. Even under alternative A, some further increase in
the funds rate might well be required. Staff projections of the funds
rate for each alternative are shown in appendix I.
(11) Under alternative B, we would expect the Federal funds
rate to level off in a 9 to 10¼ per cent range by early next year if
M-1 growth over the QIII '78-QIII '79 period is to be at around the
upper end of a 4 to 6½ per cent range, abstracting from the effects of
ATS.1/ This represents an upward adjustment in the level of interest
rates forecast by the staff. The interest rate forecast might have
been expected to decline because alternative B in effect forgives
the "overshoot" in M-1 growth during the third quarter and, hence,
does not imply as low a rate of monetary growth over the next few
quarters as it did earlier. However, our previous interest rate fore-
cast assumed a fairly significant downward shift in M-1 demand relative
to income. There has been no evidence of such a shift in recent quarters,
and without the restraint of even higher interest rates than earlier
projected it appears that growth in M-1 (or M-1+) would run above the
1/ Allowing for the ATS effect on M-1, and given the 1½ to 4½ per
cent range of probable ATS effect, M-1 growth in a 2 to 5 per cent
range after ATS would be economically equivalent to 6½ per cent
ex-ATS.
alternative B range. Even so it should be noted that our new interest
rate estimates still assume some renewed downward drift in M-1 demand,
apart from the effects of automatic transfers.1 /
(12) The longer-run ranges for M-2 and M-3 have been
raised relative to M-1. Thus, under alternative B, M-2 growth for
the year ahead is expected to be in a 7 to 9½ per cent range and
M-3 growth in an 8 to 11 per cent range, ½ and 1 percentage point
higher than current longer-run ranges. The M-2 range was raised
to take account of the recent somewhat more rapid growth in time
deposits other than large CD's and to allow for a modest shift from
deposits at thrift institutions to ATS accounts at banks.2/ The
range for M-3 was raised more substantially in recognition of the
apparent ability, and also willingness, of savings institutions,
especially S&L's, to raise substantial amounts of new money through
the 6-month money market certificate. Of course, net inflows of
deposits to thrifts should slow from its recent pace in the months
ahead, as rising interest rates further moderate inflows of deposits
subject to fixed rate-ceilings, the effects of the stock adjustment
from other financial assets wane, and depository institutions perhaps

become less aggressive in offering the new certificates as the spread
continues to narrow between their deposit costs and mortgage rates.
(13) The longer-run alternative C ranges encompass growth
rates for M-2 and M-3 nearer to those currently in place. In addition,
alternative C calls for a slower longer-run growth in M-1--in a
3 to 5 per cent range, abstracting from ATS. Growth around the
upper end of that range would tend to compensate for the "overshoot"
in M-1 expansion over the first three quarters of this year and would
lead to about a 6 per cent annual rate of growth from the end of
1977 through the third quarter of 1979, as may be seen in the bottom
line of appendix III-1.
(14) Two alternative short-run specifications for the
monetary aggregates and the Federal funds rate believed to be generally
consistent with the longer-run proposals for the aggregates are presented
below for Committee consideration. Alternative I contemplates a Federal
funds rate range centered on the current 8¾ per cent level, while
Alternative II calls for a rise in the funds rate to 9¼ per cent.
No easing alternative for the short-run is presented because all
proposed longer-run ranges involve either stable or rising interest rates
over the next several months. (More detailed and longer-run data
are shown in tables on pages 10 and 11; the numbers in parentheses
in those tables show estimates abstracting from the effect of ATS).

M-2 6 to 10 5½ to 9½

(Intermeeting period)
(15) For the Committee's convenience, and in case of an
adverse court finding, the short-run specifications include M-1
both with and without the impact of automatic transfers. The
supplementary aggregate M-1+ is also shown should the Committee wish
to provide additional quantitative guidance for the Desk in the
transitional period. In developing our estimate for M-1 including
the effect of ATS, we have assumed that $900 million are shifted from
demand to ATS accounts on average in November, with a range of error of
plus or minus $600 million. This works out to an effect on M-1
over the two month Oct-Nov. period of ½ to 2½ percentage points at
an annual rate. Over this period M-1 can be expected to grow
in a 1 to 7 per cent annual rate range (or 3½ to 7½ per cent)
abstracting from ATS). A sizable build-up in Treasury cash balances
may be a factor holding down M-1 growth in October, but in November
M-1 expansion is expected to resume at close to the average pace
thus far this year (apart from the effect of ATS).1/
(16) Expansion in M-2 under Alternative I is likely to be
in a 6 to 10 per cent annual rate range over the October-November
period. The interest-bearing component of M-2 will, of course,
be buoyed by shifts from demand to automatic transfer savings
accounts, and growth of the remaining savings and time deposits
included in this aggregate is expected to slow only somewhat from
its recent strong pace. Although inflows to nontransferable savings
accounts are expected to slow sharply from the recent surprisingly
rapid pace, sales of 6-month certificates and large denomination time
deposits are likely to continue to support time deposit growth at a
rate close to recent levels.
(17) The continued surprising strength of thrift deposits
is also likely to be sustained in October as these institutions,
through the issuance of 6-month certificates, capture a larger than
normal portion of the sizable volume of longer-term certificates
maturing this month at banks and thrifts. Growth in thrift deposit
inflows seems likely to begin slowing by November, though remaining
considerably stronger than in the first half of the year.
(18) If the Federal funds rate remains around its current
level of 8¾ per cent over the intermeeting period and published
1/ The relationship between current levels of M-1, as well as other
monetary aggregates, and the FOMC's longer-run ranges are shown
in the set of charts attached after p. 18.
growth of the monetary aggregates moderates as the staff projects,
other short-term interest rates are also likely to change little.
Business demands for short-term credit probably will continue at
the more moderate third quarter level, and the Treasury is not
expected to be tapping the bill market for new money until late
in the year.
(19) Under alternative I, yields on longer-term securities
also are likely to show little further change in the near-term,
abstracting from possible expectational effects of any new Administration
wage-price program. Oncoming supplies of new corporate and municipal
securities are expected to remain relatively moderate, and given recent
foreign central bank acquisitions of nonmarketable Treasury securities,
the Treasury's need to raise new cash in the market over the fourth
quarter has been reduced somewhat further. In its mid-November
refunding--to be announced October 25--the Treasury is expected to roll
over $4.6 billion of maturing debt and to raise around $1½ to 2
billion of new money. Following thisoperation, the Treasury probably
will need to raise only about $7 billion of new money in the coupon
market over the remainder of the fourth quarter.
(20) Alternative II calls for an increase in the Federal
funds rate to around the mid-point of a 9 to 9½ per cent range during
the intermeeting period. This alternative appears particularly
appropriate if the Committee opts for the slower longer-run growth
in the aggregates encompassed by alternative C. It would also be
consistent with the longer-run policy stance indexed by alternative B,
as well as with near-term efforts to support the dollar in exchange
markets. The tightening of the funds market over the weeks ahead
envisaged by alternative II would--by introducing restraint earlier--
increase the likelihood that the funds rate would not have to rise
into the upper part of the 9 to 10¼ per cent range projected for next
year under alternative B.
(21) Under alternative II, M-1 growth, including the effect
of automatic transfers, would likely be in a ½ to 6½ per cent annual
rate range over the October-November period, M-2 in a 5½ to 9½ per
cent range, and M-1+ in a 2½ to 6½ per cent range. The additional
interest rate pressure would slow the growth of non-transferable
savings deposits and time deposits subject to fixed rate-ceilings, but
the effects of this slowing on the total interest-bearing components
of M-2 and M-3 may be dampened by issuance of 6-month certificates
and, at banks, large denomination time deposits.
(22) The percentage point increase in the funds rate
contemplated under alternative II would place further upward
pressure on other short- and long-term interest rates. The bond
markets appear to be in a strong technical position, with dealer
inventories light and the forward calendar of new offerings moderate,
but such a rise in the funds rate, coupled with the recent discount
rate action, is likely to carry long rates back above the early
July peaks. Mortgage market conditions are likely to tighten further
as the effective cost of the 6-month money market certificate moves
up to close to 9½ per cent, and thrifts become somewhat more cautious
in their lending attitudes.
Directive language
(23) Given below are suggested operational paragraphs
for the directive. Alternative language consistent with the short-
run specifications of the alternatives discussed in the preceding
section is shown for the Committee's objective for the Federal funds
rate early in the period. At a later point, alternative language is
also provided for placing main emphasis either on monetary aggregates
or on money market conditions. The specifications adopted at the
September meeting are shown in strike-through form.
(24) To take account of uncertainties associated with
the introduction of ATS, the Committee may also wish to consider certain
modifications of its instructions to the Manager. These might include
introduction of M-1+ as a third operating range and insertion of
language to recognize the uncertainties introduced by ATS. In
addition, at least for now, the Committee may wish to eliminate the
phrase in the directive that gives equal weight to M-1 and M-2 so
as to enable the Manager to take the behavior of M-1+ into account in
appraising performance of the aggregates in the transition period.
These modifications are indicated in the language below in capital
letters and strike-through form.
In the short run, the Committee seeks to achieve bank
reserve and money market conditions that are broadly consistent
with the longer-run ranges for monetary aggregates cited above,
while giving due regard to developing conditions in domestic
and international financial markets more generally AND TO
