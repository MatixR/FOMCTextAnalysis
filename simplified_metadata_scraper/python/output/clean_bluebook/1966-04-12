Prefatory Note 
 
 
The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version available

of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was created 
through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned 
versions text-searchable.2   Though a stringent quality assurance process was 
employed, some imperfections may remain. 
 
Please note that some material may have been redacted from this document if that

1  In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic 
format.  All scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced 
tilting) and lightly cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other 
blemishes caused after initial printing). 
 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optical character recognition computer program (OCR) 
first created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, 
staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.  Please note that the numbers and text in charts and 
tables were not reliably recognized by the OCR process and were not checked or corrected by staff.

MONEY MARKET AND RESERVE RELATIONSHIPS
Money markets
Recent developments. The spread between bill rates and
other short-term rates widened during recent weeks. All short-term
rates rose around the mid-March tax date, following the increase in
the prime loan rate, but since then bill rates have fluctuated in a
lower range while other short-term rates either have stabilized or
have risen slightly further. The recent peak for the 3-month bill
was reached in the mid-March auction at 4.72 per cent; subsequently,
the 3-month bill rate declined sharply to as low as 4.46 per cent
before moving back up above the discount rate.
Differences in supply situations help to account for the
differential movements of bill and other short-term rates. Increased
supplies of other short-term debt instruments -- notably, negotiable
CD's and agency issues -- continued to reach the markets at rising
yields necessitated by the conjunction of new financings and large
roll-overs. On the other hand, the bill market was temporarily
depleted of trading supply in the wake of unusually large purchases
by investors during late winter; in addition, $3 billion in March
tax bills matured without replacement and the weekly $100 million
additions to the 3-month bill were drawing to a close. Most
recently, dealers' inventories of bills have been rebuilt to sizable
levels, in part through their own aggressive bidding in auctions,
and this has led to the firming in bill yields.

.... ... | .. . .. .. , +12 2,.,
Over the three statement weeks ending April 6, net borrowed
reserves averaged about $230 million and member bank borrowings about
$580 million -- in each case slightly higher than the levels of the
previous 3-week period. The Federal funds market also appeared to
tighten a shade further, with funds trading at an effective rate of
4-3/4 per cent on 10 of the 15 days in the period and with a small
amount of trading at a new high 4-7/8 per cent rate reported late
in the period. Dealer financing costs also moved higher in the
most recent week, reflecting both the pressures in the funds market
and larger dealer financing needs.
Prospective developments. On the assumption that net
borrowed reserves will continue to average close to recent levels
over the next 4 weeks, the 3-month bill rate might be expected to
fluctuate in a 4.55 to 4.70 per cent range. The recent tightening
of money market conditions may persist through the April tax period,
when Federal funds are likely to continue trading at 4-3/4 per cent
and occasionally at 4-7/8 per cent. Such pressures could abate
toward the end of April and in early May. After the mid-April tax
date funds typically shift toward the money centers. Also, seasonal
demands for bills,from public funds and other investors, may be
supplemented by demand from sellers of maturing issues in the
Treasury May refunding. But rather heavy agency issues in prospect
for the weeks ahead, including a sizable amount of new money, could
be an offsetting influence.
The course of bond yields will be importantly influenced
by Administration policy with respect to a tax increase. So long
as economic indicators remain buoyant, continued postponement of a
decision on taxes could generate a new wave of bearish investor
sentiment. The Government bond market is now particularly
susceptible since it is in a less strong technical condition
as a result of the recent build-up in dealer bond positions.
The downward movements of bond and bill yields since
early March have occurred despite some tightening of bank net
reserve positions. As noted above, continuation of the present reserve
posture is not likely to be accompanied by any further decline in
rates and probably by some upward movement. Any further tightening
of reserves -- to, for example, net borrowed reserves in a $250-$300
million range -- is likely to place bill rates in a 4.60-4.75 per
cent range and at the same time exert further upward pressure on
bond yields, particularly if market participants become convinced
that a further step-up in monetary restraint is in process.
Reserve flows, bank credit, and money
Recent developments. Increases in total deposits and
total reserves were slightly stronger in the second half of March
than anticipated at midmonth, with the daily average figures for
the month as a whole now showing annual rates of increase of 3 per
cent in both cases over the previous month. Higher member bank
borrowing accounted for all of the increase in total reserves,
as nonborrowed reserves declined for the first time since last
Weekly data indicate a sharp bulge in deposits and
credit over the March tax period and into early April, following
the sluggish growth of the previous four weeks. Much of this
increase appears temporary. The more rapid expansion of time
deposits in recent weeks apparently reflects city bank attempts
to prepare for expected large credit demands later in April and
to lengthen average maturities on CD's. In addition, dealer
borrowing from banks increased substantially during the last two
statement weeks in reflection of their enlarged inventories.
Prospective developments. With increases in all cate-
gories of deposits pushing levels well above the March average
in the latest weeks and with credit demands remaining very strong
through the April 15 tax period, a sharp rise is expected in the
daily average bank credit proxy this month, with the annual rate of
increase in the 10-12 per cent range. An increase in total
reserves of about 7 or 8 per cent would appear consistent with
this expected expansion.
After April, a more moderate rate of increase in monetary
aggregates is anticipated, even if net borrowed reserves are not
deepened from recent levels. The rate of increase in bank credit
may fall back to or somewhat below the projected March-April average
of around 7 per cent. Several factors may reduce time deposit
expansion below the rate of recent weeks -- the spread between CD and
bill rates may narrow, and both growing corporate spending programs
and prospective large agency offerings may absorb funds that
would otherwise be invested in CD's. Bank credit growth is also
likely to be moderated by repayments of the enlarged borrowing during
the March 15-April 15 tax period. On the other hand, the mid-May
Treasury refunding may temporarily increase bank credit expansion,
though the effect may be relatively small in view of the expected
routine nature of the financing.
Moderation of loan demand after mid-April would also
tend to reduce the growth rate of private demand deposits to around
5 per cent over the months ahead. The rate of increase in April
may still average above that rate, although below the March average
of 12 per cent.
