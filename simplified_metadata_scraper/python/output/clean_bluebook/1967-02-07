MONEY MARKET AND RESERVE RELATIONSHIPS
Recent developments
Money market conditions have eased further, and there
has been a substantial increase in most of the monetary aggregates
since the last meeting of the Committee. The easing in money market
conditions was accompanied by a decline of about 30 basis points in
the 3-month bill rate, to around 4.50 per cent, and by roughly
commensurate reductions in CD rates offered by major banks. The
most often quoted rate on CD's maturing within 90 days is now 5
per cent. Rates on commercial paper, finance company paper, and
bankers' acceptances declined sharply, after having lagged behind
the decline in bill rates in late 1966.
Federal funds were generally traded in a 4-3/4 to 5 per
cent range in the last two statement weeks ending in January, after
being around 5-1/4 per cent earlier in the month. The decline in
the Federal funds rate was in part the result of a marked improve-
ment in the basic reserve deficiency of major New York banks in the
second half of January. This improvement reflected not only a
seasonal reflow of reserve funds to New York banks but also their
notable success in obtaining CD money during the period. And
although dealer finance needs remained well above normal in the last

CONFIDENTIAL (FR)
two statement weeks of January, dealer new loan rates posted by
major New York banks declined to an average of about 5-1/2 per cent.
Net borrowed reserves declined to an average of $60 million
and member bank borrowings to $475 million for the month of January,
as compared with figures of $191 million and $529 million respectively
in December.
In the statement week ending February 1, the money market
was easy, with most Federal funds trading at 4-1/2 per cent or lower
and with dealer loan rates further reduced. Net free reserves of
$154 million were published for the week, with borrowings averaging
only $176 million. Such unusually easy conditions were occasioned
largely by developments related to the snowstorm in the Midwest
on Thursday and Friday; the storm generated a sharp rise in float,
but the full extent of the rise was not evident until late in the
statement week. Late week adjustments in reserve figures--which
occurred too late to be offset effectively by System open market
operations--added almost $200 million of free reserves.
The success of banks in attracting CD money as market
interest rates dropped sharply during January contributed to an
increase of time deposits at a 17.3 per cent annual rate in the
month on average. U.S. Government demand deposits also rose sharply
in the month, as payments by corporations of withheld income taxes
were shifted out of February into January. There was only a

partially offsetting decline in private demand deposits, as business
loans from banks rose sharply, partly in order to finance the tax
Total member bank deposits (the bank credit proxy) rose
at about a 15.5 per cent annual rate in January on average, with
the rise sustained throughout the month. But there
was a decline in other sources of bank funds, as liabilities to
foreign branches dropped off substantially and there was also a
reduction in borrowing from the Federal Reserve discount window.
After including the reduction in foreign borrowing, the proxy
rose by a 12.5 per cent annual rate during the month.
Nonborrowed reserves rose at about a 23 per cent annual
rate in January on average. However, as already noted, a part of the
reserves becoming available to banks from open market operations was
used to reduce borrowings from the Federal Reserve, and some was
held as increased excess reserves. Thus required reserves last
month expanded at a 13 per cent annual rate.
The general easing of monetary policy not only stimulated
declines in money market rates and growth in bank credit, but also--
in conjunction with recent Presidential statements about the
desirability of a tax increase and easier monetary conditions--
helped generate bullish expectations in bond markets. The relatively
sharp resulting decline in long-term rates, together with the increased

availability and lower cost of time deposits, induced reductions
in the prime loan rate of banks from 6 per cent to 5-3/4 per cent
and, at a few banks, to 5-1/2 per cent.
Prospective developments
Discounting the special weather influences affecting the
February 1 statement week, the maintenance of prevailing money
market conditions could involve net borrowed reserves averaging
close to $50 million and a Federal funds rate fluctuating around
tend to oscillate near the lower end of the range as long as
the basic reserve position of major New York banks continues to be
relatively comfortable and the 3-month bill rate stays close to the
discount rate. Moreover, partly because banks no longer have to face the
basic problems of reserve adjustment that stemmed from their earlier
inability to roll over maturing CD's, there may be less reluctance
on their part to make temporary use of the discount window, thus
tending to hold down the premium on the Federal funds rate abcve
the discount rate.
The 3-month bill rate recently fell to just below the
discount rate, and, in part, this may have reflected the considerable
market ease related to the snowstorm. It is unlikely that the rate
will move back much above the discount rate in the period immediately
ahead, however, for February ordinarily is a month of good bill

demand and declining bill rates. At the same time, it is difficult
to foresee any pressures working toward significantly lower bill
rates. Dealer bill inventories remain exceptionally large; the
System is likely to be reducing its security holdings around
mid-February; and the Treasury is likely to be offering a sizable
amount of additional June tax bills toward the end of the month.
All in all, a policy resulting in net borrowed reserves
averaging close to $50 million should be consistent with a 3-month
bill rate in a 4.40 - 4.60 per cent range. Under such circumstances,
long-term rates may not show much further downward movement; and
some technical upward adjustments from the recent rapid yield
declines are a possibility, especially if new issue calendars
become further enlarged. However, both short- and long-term rates
could show significant further downward movements if expectations
shifted markedly further as a result of unfavorable economic news
or more concrete peace talk prospects.
Given such bill rates, we expect a slower--but still
impressive--net expansion in CD's during February, perhaps one in
a $750 million to $1 billion range (as compared with a $2.2 billion
expansion during the four weeks ending January 25). The recent
reductions in CD rates se3m indicative of diminished bank interest
in bidding for such funds. The projected CD increase, together with
continued expansion of other time and savings deposits at around recent
rates, contributes to a projected time and savings deposit growth for
CONFIDENTIAL (FR)
the month on average of 15 - 17 per cent. Part of this growth on a
daily average basis reflects the rapid weekly expansion during
January; from the end of January to the end of February a 10 - 12
per cent rate of growth is projected.
U.S. Government deposits are expected to decline slightly
on average in February. Payment date for the expected June tax bill
is uncertain, but is assumed to be in early March. Private demand
deposits, after declining in January, are expected to rise in February,
partly reflecting the decline in Government deposits and also a growth
in demand for cash balances on the part of businesses for liquidity and
precautionary reasons and to prepare for large March and April tax
payments. In February private demand deposits might expand in a
Such developments in time and demand deposits are con-
sistent with a bank credit proxy expanding by about 9 - 11 per
cent on average in February. The rise would be about 2 percentage
points less with inclusion of Euro-dollar borrowings by banks,
even in the event that Euro-dollar borrowings by banks do not
decline further from their end of January levels. With a slower
week-to-week time deposit growth during the month and a sharp
decline in U.S. Government deposits around the end of the month, the
credit proxy is projected to rise by only about 2 per cent from the
end of January to the end of February. This should be followed by
February 3, 1967.
CONFIDENTIAL (FR) -7- February 3, 1967.
considerably stronger expansion in March weeks, however, reflecting
the expected tax bill financing by the Treasury and also mid-March
tax period borrowing.
The relatively slow growth in the credit proxy from the
end of January to the end of February assumes slower business loan
expansion as February progresses, with some of earlier tax-related
borrowing being repaid. It also assumes a modest decline in dealer
loans made by banks, but continued bank interest in purchasing
securities to restore their liquidity. Bank credit expansion could
be weaker than projected if inventory adjustments are unexpectedly
large, and demands for credit fall off.
If open market operations are conducted so as to ease
money market conditions somewhat further, this could involve a
modest positive net reserve position for banks (say, free reserves
in a zero-$100 million range) and Federal funds trading more often
around the discount rate. These money market conditions might
bring about somewhat greater increases in the monetary aggregates,
but the effect of such incremental ease on bank credit expansion is
unlikely to be as dramatic as in the recent past. Recent experience
suggests that banks would not find it desirable to continue to expand
time deposits at the rapid January rate, especially if loan demand
in the weeks immediately ahead moderates from the heavy demands
of January. Therefore, banks may adjust interest rates offered on
CONFIDENTIAL (FR)
CD's and other time deposits in line with declines in market rates.
The 3-month bill rate would be likely to be within a 4.25 - 4.45
per cent range with such a policy shift, and with some attendant
reduction in other money market rates.
The easier monetary policy discussed above and the
expectations generated it would place more downward pressure on
customer rates. Moreover, the sustainability of the present discount
rate would probably be more widely questioned--with the ebb and flow
of expectations in that respect possibly generating a wider band of
interest rate movements. In addition, it would become more likely
that any technical reaction in long-term bond markets would be
forestalled or minimized, with long rates remaining steady or
declining somewhat further.
