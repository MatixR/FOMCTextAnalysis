Recent developments
(1) Changes in RPD's and the monetary aggregates have fallen
short of the Committee's September-October ranges of tolerance, as
the accompanying table shows. In the case of M1, the net contraction
already evident in August continued in September, perhaps in part because
market participants moved out of cash into securities in anticipation of
interest rate declines. A very slight decline also appears to be in
train for October. Growth in M2 was restrained mainly by the contraction
in M1, as expansion in consumer-type time deposits at banks continued to
be fairly strong. The largest shortfall relative to Committee targets
was in RPD's; this was associated not only with weakness in M1 but also
to a great extent with the sharp recent declines in the outstanding
amount of large CD's.

(2) The adjusted credit proxy appears to be growing in the
September-October target period at only about a 3-1/2 per cent annual
rate, the slowest two month pace since early 1970. Banks have been
less eager to issue large CD's in light of the recent moderation in
business loan expansion. There have also been market reports that large
banks have come to prefer overnight Federal funds borrowing as compared
with CD's, given recent expectations of declining short-term rates.
(3) The recent shrinkage of M 1 and the reduced growth of other
money and credit aggregates created market anticipations that System
operations were likely to add to downward pressures on interest rates.
For this reason market attention was closely riveted on the day-to-day
pattern of Desk operations, especially their relationship to the pre-
vailing level of the Federal funds rate. When Desk transactions appeared
to indicate some willingness to supply reserves more aggressively,
market interest rates declined sharply, particularly in the short-term
sector. During the inter-meeting period short-term yields were off
generally 100 to 150 basis points. Among key rates, the 90-day Treasury
bill yield showed the largest decline, moving down from about 8.70
per cent at the time of the last meeting to an interim low of 6.94 per
cent, and trading most recently at about 7.15 per cent. Bond yields
characteristically have shown more moderate inter-meeting declines,
ranging generally from 15 to 30 basis points.
(4) By late September, incoming data began to indicate that all
of the money and reserve aggregates were falling below the Committee's
ranges of tolerance. At the same time, the Federal funds rate was tending
above the 10-3/4 per cent upper limit of the Committee's range of tolerance.
In these circumstances, the Desk moved against shortfalls in the aggregates
through sizable reserve supplying operations. However, because market
interest rates had already dropped sharply in anticipation of a policy
modification, and in view of the provision in the directive to take account
of financial market conditions, the Desk avoided overly aggressive actions
for fear of further exacerbating the general rate decline.
(5) Since developing market circumstances had led to incon-
sistencies in the instructions under which the Manager was operating, a
telephone meeting was held on October 2. The Committee directed the
Manager to provide reserves at a pace consistent with an average Federal
funds rate of 10-1/2 per cent. At a second telephone meeting on October 10,
when more current data indicated a further shortfall in the money and
reserve aggregates, the constraint on the Federal funds rate was relaxed,
with the Manager directed to move in stages to 10-1/4 and then, if new
data confirmed the weakness in the aggregates, to 10 per cent. As the
money market eased in the first two statement weeks of October, member
bank borrowings dropped to an average of about $1.4 billion, after
averaging $1.9 billion in September.
(6) Nonbank thrift institutions had a more favorable deposit
experience in September as net outflows (seasonally unadjusted) slowed
appreciably. In early October, preliminary data for large New York City
savings banks show sizable net savings losses, but partial data for other
savings banks and for savings and loan associations were more favorable.
The combination of recent rate declines in securities markets and reduced
concern about deposit outflows at thrift institutions has contributed on
balance to a leveling off of mortgage rates.
(7) The table on the next page shows (in percentage annual rates
of change) selected monetary and financial flows over various recent
time periods. Appendix Table III compares money supply growth rates computed

Prospective developments
(8) Three alternatives for Committee consideration summarized
below include growth rates for M1 over the fourth and first quarters at
annual rates of 6-1/2 per cent alt. A), 5 per cent (alt. B), and 3-1/2
per cent (alt. C). As shown in the chart on the following page, the
6-1/2 per cent growth rate of alternative A returns M1 by March of next
year to a long-run 5-1/4 per cent growth path (illustrated by the dashed
line). The 5 per cent growth rate of alternative B brings M1 by March
to a 4-1/2 per cent trend line (shown by the dotted line on the chart)
that starts from the September money supply estimate available at the
last Committee meeting. This line represents the longer-run path
associated in the last Bluebook with the short-run targets adopted by the
Committee at its September meeting.

(9) Given the lagged effects on money demand of the interest
rate increases of earlier this year, the staff believes that attainment of the
growth rates for reserves and monetary aggregates specified in alternative B
is likely to involve a further decline in the Federal funds rate over the
near-term. A sharper decline in the funds rate would be likely under A.
Under alternative C, money market conditions seem most likely to remain
around those prevailing recently, given the more restrained growth in
reserves and the aggregates posited.
(10) RPD growth for October-November of course becomes larger
the easier are the policy alternatives. While the differences in RPD
growth in the short-run are modest, the differences in growth of non-
borrowed reserves are larger in order to compensate, under the easier
alternatives, for the further drop in member bank borrowings that would
be envisaged. The unchanged money market conditions of alternative C
encompass a Federal funds rate centered in a 9-1/2--10-1/2 per cent range
and member bank borrowings that fluctuate around $1.5 billion. To attain
the aggregates specified under B, the Federal funds rate would be expected
to decline toward the lower part of the 8-3/4--1-l/4 per cent range
indicated, and average member bank borrowings may decline to around
$1.3 billion. Under A, the funds rate could drop considerably further
to around 8 per cent and member bank borrowings to around $1 billion.
However, it has become very difficult in recent weeks to anticipate shifts
in member bank demands for borrowing as market conditions change, and
these estimates of borrowing could even be a bit on the high side.
(11) Under alternative C, unless the Federal funds rate declines
to the lower end of the indicated range, Treasury bill rates are likely
to move somewhat higher, as expectations of additional easing in monetary
policy are disappointed. Upward pressure on bill rates is likely to be
larger in the event that the Treasury were to offer additional bills for
payment late this month or in connection with the mid-November refunding
operation (the refunding of $3.7 billion of outstanding publicly-held
debt will be announced October 24). Under alternative B, and even more
so under A, short-term market interest rates are likely to decline over
the next few weeks as market expectations of further easing in policy
are confirmed. Bank prime rates probably would be reduced, and some
further rate declines would be likely to occur in long-term markets.
(12) Although the interest rate declines anticipated under the
easing alternatives might be fairly sharp, it is quite likely that rates
will turn around, particularly under alternative B. This assumes that
the economy expands as projected in the Greenbook and therefore that the
underlying transactions demand for money will be relatively well maintained
and credit demands will be fairly strong. Thus, under alternative B, bill
rates might be back in the neighborhood of current levels, or perhaps
above them, by around year-end. The degree of any reversal would be
tempered, however, if it proves necessary to reduce the funds rate
somewhat below the bottom of the alternative B range later this year in
order to achieve the desired monetary growth path.
(13) With resumed growth in November more than offsetting a
small decline in October, M 1 would expand at a modest rate over the two
month period. Expansion is expected to continue into the first quarter
of 1974 as transactions demands remain moderately strong, the retarding
effect of interest rate increases earlier this year wears off, and recent
interest rate declines further strengthen money demand.
(14) Other key assumptions underlying the monetary relation-
ships discussed in this bluebook are: (1) resumed expansion of out-
standing large negotiable CD's, as banks experience moderate business
loan growth and seek to offset a run-off on balance in U.S. Government
deposits between now and year-end; (2) expansion of other time and
savings deposits at banks at a moderate rate under alternative C as
money market conditions remain unchanged and short-term interest rates
rise from current levels, with net inflows strengthening under the
easier conditions of alternatives B and A; (3) reimposition of some
sort of interest rate ceilings on consumer-type certificates maturing
in 4 years or more at banks and other savings institutions, with the
ceiling structure working to redistribute savings flows at the margin
toward nonbank savings institutions.
Proposed directive language
(15) Presented below are three alternative formulations for
the operational paragraph of the directive, which are intended to
correspond to the similarly lettered policy alternatives discussed in
the preceding section. For all three alternatives it is proposed to
retain the instruction to take account of international and domestic
financial market developments and to add a reference to the forthcoming
Treasury financing. Alternatives A and C refer to the average growth
rates in the monetary aggregates "than has occurred thus far this
year." The annual rates of growth from December 1972 to September 1973
are as follows: M1, 4.2 per cent; M2, 6.9 per cent; and the bank credit
proxy, 13.0 per cent.
Alternative A
To implement this policy, while taking account OF THE FORTHCOMING
TREASURY FINANCING AND of international and domestic financial
market developments, the Committee seeks to achieve bank reserve and
money market conditions consistent with [DEL: moderate] FASTER growth in
monetary aggregates over the months ahead THAN HAS OCCURRED THUS
FAR THIS YEAR.
Alternative B
To implement this policy, while taking account OF THE FORTHCOMING
TREASURY FINANCING AND of international and domestic financial
market developments, the Committee seeks to achieve bank reserve and
money market conditions consistent with moderate growth in monetary
aggregates over the months ahead.
Alternative C
To implement this policy, while taking account OF THE FORTH-
COMING TREASURY FINANCING AND of international and domestic
financial market developments, the Committee seeks to achieve bank
reserve and money market conditions consistent with [DEL: moderate]
SOMEWHAT SLOWER growth in monetary aggregates over the months
ahead THAN HAS OCCURRED THUS FAR THIS YEAR.
