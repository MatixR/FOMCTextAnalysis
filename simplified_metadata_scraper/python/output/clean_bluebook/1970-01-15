MONEY MARKET AND RESERVE RELATIONSHIPS
Recent developments
(1) Security yields showed somewhat varying patterns of
change in different markets during December, but since the turn of the
year most yields have declined somewhat. Yields on Treasury securities
reached new record highs at year-end due in part to special influences
associated with the new tax reform bill. As bid quotes on both 3- and
6-month bills broke through the 8 per cent level, rates on most other
short-term securities were also carried upward to new highs. Yields
on municipal and new corporate bonds, on the other hand, reached their
highs earlier in December when new issue volume was unusually heavy.
Subsequently as volume receded over the holiday period, underwriters
were able to trim back inventories, and yields turned down. A special
factor contributing to the decline in yields recently has been the
large volume of small orders from individuals being financed partly by
withdrawals from depositary institutions.
(2) The 3-month Treasury bill reached a record 8.10 per cent
in the auction on December 29, somewhat above the upper end of the
7-1/2--8 per cent range projected in the last blue book. Over most
of the period since the last meeting, however, the bill rate has
fluctuated within the blue book range and most recently has dropped
to around 7.90 per cent--about the same level as that prevailing at the

last Committee meeting. In addition to the high cost of dealer financing,
factors exerting upward pressure on bill yields in December included
sizable further foreign sales, and smaller than expected demands from
year-end bank window dressing and from reinvestment of the proceeds
of maturing Treasury 2-1/2 per cent bonds and December tax bills.
(3) Seasonal pressures caused the basic reserve deficits of
money market banks to deepen substantially over most of December. This,
and the general churning typical of the year-end, contributed to a
substantially enlarged average volume of daily trading in the Federal
funds market, and carried the daily effective rate on Federal funds most
frequently into a 9-1/4--9-3/4 per cent range, somewhat above that in
the previous inter-meeting period.
(4) Preliminary estimates of December changes in the monetary
aggregates show that the money supply increased on average at about a
2 per cent annual rate, and the bank credit proxy declined at about an
0.5 per cent rate. These estimates contrast with declines of 3 to 6 per
cent and 1 to 4 per cent,respectively, projected for these aggregates
in the last blue book. Over a part of the period between Committee
meetings, however, current projections on which the Account Manager
was operating showed a money supply decline deeper than the blue.book
projection, and the credit proxy was projected to decline at a rate
near the low end of the blue book range. A very large ($5.2 billion)
bulge in private demand deposits in the last week of December was
responsible for the stronger than expected performance of both the money
supply and the bank credit proxy. This bulge appears partly to
represent the temporary effect of repatriation of corporate funds from
abroad to conform to the Commerce Department's foreign investment guide-
lines, and partly some increase in transactions balances that developed
in the process of savers' switching out of intermediary claims into
market instruments. In addition, it should be noted that there was a
sharp, and as yet unexplainable, drop of cash items in process of
collection at New York City banks in the last week of December, which
is expected to be reversed.
(5) After adjustment for the change in Euro-dollar borrowings
the bank credit proxy for December is estimated to have declined at
roughly a 1 per cent annual rate. But with commercial paper continuing
to expand, the bank credit proxy adjusted to include all nondeposit
sources of funds including Euro-dollars shows an increase at about a
1-1/2 per cent annual rate. Total time and savings deposits grew at
about a 5 per cent annual rate on average in December, as expected.
(6) The tendency around the turn of the year for the Federal
funds and other short-term rates.to advance to levels above the blue
book range, and earlier indications that the monetary aggregates were
at or below the bottom end of the range projected in the blue book,
influenced the Account Manager to supply reserves even though member bank
borrowings and net borrowed reserves were running somewhat shallower on
a day-to-day basis than in earlier weeks. In addition, there were
unusual complications in projecting reserve factors, particularly
float, that led to sharp variations in projections of net reserve
availability. At the same time, there was the usual seasonal rise in
excess reserves at year end. As a result, net borrowed reserves averaged
around $690 million in the three most recent statement weeks--substantially
less than the $900 million to $1.2 billion blue book range, and member
bank borrowings averaged about $1 billion, at the low end of the
projected range.

Prospective developments
(8) If the Committee decides to maintain unchanged conditions
in the money market over the next four weeks, it may wish to consider
the following second paragraph for the directive (alternative A):
To implement this policy, WHILE TAKING ACCOUNT OF
THE FORTHCOMING TREASURY REFUNDING, System open market
operations until the next meeting of the Committee shall
be conducted with a view to maintaining the prevailing
firm conditions in the money market; provided, however,
that operations shall be modified if bank credit appears
to be deviating significantly from current projections
[DEL: or if unusual liquidity pressures should develop.]
(9) The fluctuations in net borrowed reserves and the
Federal funds rate over the past several weeks make it difficult to
define prevailing money market conditions. Some of the recent
pressures on the Federal funds market have been seasonal, and these
are likely to abate over the next few weeks if the basic reserve
deficits of major money market banks improve seasonally. But part
of the recent funds market pressure appears to reflect the cumulative
effects of monetary restraint on bank liquidity. If the latter
influence continues, then maintenance of an unchanged over-all tone
of the money market--with the Federal funds rate in an 8-1/2--9-1/2
per cent range--might require that net borrowed reserves be shaded
toward the shallower end of the $900 million - $1.2 billion range
specified in recent Blue books. In any case, as the seasonal bulge
in excess reserves that developed in the second half of December
disappears, maintenance of firm money market conditions will entail
a rise in net borrowed reserves from the $630 million average of the
past two statement weeks. Member bank borrowings may continue to be
expected to average in a $1--$1.2 billion range.
(10) The 3-month Treasury bill rate will probably continue
to fluctuate generally in a 7-1/2--8 per cent range. Continuation of
relatively high dealer financing costs--with marginal dealer borrow-
ing from major New York banks remaining mainly in a 9-1/2--10-1/4 per
cent range--may limit dealers' willingness to position bills. Down-
ward pressure on bill rates could be generated as a result of season-
ally strong investment demand for bills in January, including dis-
intermediation flows; the absence of the usual seasonal Treasury cash
borrowing; and perhaps reinvestment demands associated with the mid-
February refunding. On the other hand, it is expected that thrift
institutions and Federal Home Loan Banks will have to liquidate part
of existing bill holdings to finance savings withdrawals. If with-
drawals are large enough, the FHLB's may have to call on their credit
line with the Treasury. If this occurs before the Treasury's cash
balance is seasonally rebuilt after mid-January, the balance may run
so low as to necessitate temporary direct Treasury borrowing from
the System. The reserve effect of such borrowing would be offset by
roughly equivalent System bill sales in the market. Moreover, over
the next four weeks the System will generally be on the selling side
of the market mainly to absorb the seasonal return flow of currency.
(11) The high dealer financing costs, the sizable corporate
calendar, an expected large volume of Federal Home Loan Bank and other
Federal agency issues, and the forthcoming Treasury refunding are
likely, in combination, to counter, and perhaps reverse, current
tendencies for intermediate- and longer-term interest rates to decline
--barring a major shift in market expectations. The Treasury refund-
ing will be announced on January 28, and will include at least $4
billion of publicly held issues maturing in mid-February and probably
another $1-1/2 billion of coupon issues that mature in March. The
nature of the issues to be offered in the refunding as well as the
prospective market reception of the offering are highly uncertain at
this point, given high dealer financing costs, the constraints on
banks' ability to absorb new issues, changes in the tax treatment of
capital gains and losses for banks which may reduce the relative
attractiveness of new acquisitions of U.S. Government securities,
and the prospect at this point of a crowded calendar of other issues.
(12) The constraint on banks' ability to acquire securities
is indicated by the anticipated decline in a 2-5 per cent, annual
rate, range of total member bank deposits that is projected for
January. A larger decline may develop in February when U.S. Govern-
ment deposits are projected to decline sharply. The January and
February projections also assume a weaker performance of time deposits
than has been evident during the past few months. For all commercial
banks, time deposits are expected to decline in a 3-6 per cent, annual
rate, range from December to January, with the weakness mostly
attributable to sizable outflows of consumer-type deposits following
interest-crediting as savers move into high-yielding market instru-
ments. And given interest rate relationships, attrition of domestic
large denomination CD's is expected to persist, although it will con-
tinue to be limited by the greatly reduced level of outstandings. In
February, a somewhat similar decline in time deposits is ex-
pected.Including an expected increase in foreign and domestic non-
deposit sources of funds, the adjusted bank credit proxy is anticipated
to decline in a 1-4 per cent annual rate range in January and a 4-7
per cent range in February. With a sharp recovery in U.S. Government
deposits projected for March, for the first quarter as a whole the
adjusted bank credit proxy is projected to decline by about a couple
of percentage points at an annual rate. These projections are based
on the assumption of no change in Regulation Q ceilings.
(13) The money supply in January is expected to show little
change on average from December, as the extraordinary end-of-December
bulge in the money supply disappears. Over the somewhat longer-run
of the first quarter, the money supply seems unlikely to show much,
if any, net growth (measured from the December average level to the
March average level), given current money market conditions and the
outlook for a relatively small increase in GNP in nominal terms. Such
a projection is consistent with behavior of the money supply over
the past two quarters under the current policy directive, and with
Board staff economic projections for the first quarter. In February,
however, the money supply may show some temporary rise as U.S. Govern-
ment deposits are drawn down.
(14) Policy alternative B. If the Committee should decide
to move toward achieving slightly less firm money market conditions,
it might wish to consider the following second paragraph for the
To implement this policy, WHILE TAKING ACCOUNT OF THE
FORTHCOMING TREASURY REFUNDING, System open market operations
until the next meeting of the Committee shall be conducted with
a view to [DEL: maintaining the prevailing] ACHIEVING SLIGHTLY LESS
firm conditions in the money market; provided, however, that
operations shall be modified FURTHER if bank credit appears
to be [DEL: deviating significantly WEAKER THAN CURRENTLY PROJECTED
frem current projections or if unusual liquidity pressures
should develop.]
(15) Slightly less firm money market conditions might
encompass a Federal funds rate averaging consistently below 9 per cent,
perhaps in an 8-1/2--9 per cent, net borrowed reserves averaging around
$800 million, and member bank borrowing generally a little below
$1 billion. The 3-month bill rate under these conditions may drop
to or somewhat below 7-1/2 per cent, although dealer financing costs
are likely to remain relatively high and still be a constraint on dealers'
willingness to add to positions. Longer-term interest rates, too, might
come under less upward pressure--and the recent declines could even be
extended--should the market become aware of the shift and interpret it
as the first step in a progressive easing of policy.
(16) Little effect on the monetary and banking aggregates
may be expected from such a shading in money market conditions in
January since the month is already about half over. In February,
banks' time deposit experience might improve by a percentage point or
so relative to what it would be under prevailing conditions as a decline
in market interest rates may reduce the outflow of consumer-type deposits
in some small degree. Moreover, private demand deposits, and the money
supply, may also show a shade more strength in February than otherwise
as a lower Federal funds rate makes bank slightly more willing to
accommodate borrowing demands.
(17) Policy alternative C. If the Committee wishes to place
more emphasis on monetary and banking aggregates in the directive, it
may wish to consider the following language for the second paragraph.
{DEL: To implement this policy] ACCORDINGLY, WHILE TAKING
ACCOUNT OF THE FORTHCOMING TREASUSY REFUNDING, System open
market operations until the next meeti.g of the Connittee shall
be conducted with a view to maintaining [DEL: the prevailing] firm con-
ditions in the money market, [DEL: provided, however; that operations
shall be modified if bank credi t appears to be deviating signi f -
cantly from current projections or if unusual liquidity pressures
should develop] CONSISTENT WITH A POLICY OF MONETARY RESTRAINT
AND CONDUCIVE TO MODEST AND ORDERLY EXPANSION IN THE MONETARY
AND BANKING AGGREGATES.
(18) A modest and orderly expansion in the monetary and banking
aggregates might encompass about a 2 per cent annual rate of increase
in the money supply over the first quarter (from the December
average to the March average), but, given current Regulation Q
ceilings, this might not be accompanied by an expansion in total
bank credit much, if any, greater than the small fourth quarter
rate. How much expansion in bank credit develope would depend in
large part on the extent of any accompanying decline in bill rates.
Given the current GNP projection, it is not expected that a 2 per
cent growth in money supply would lead to a sharp drop in bill
rates, although the 3-month rate may decline to around 7 per cent
on average in the first quarter, On this assumption, total member
bank deposits may show little net change over the first quarter,
although a modest rise in bank credit--perhaps in a 0-2 per cent
range (as measured on a daily average basis by member bank deposits
plus domestic and foreign nondeposit sources)--would result from
expansion in Euro-dollar borrowings and continued net new issues of
commercial paper. If the Committee wished to encourage a larger
expansion in outstanding bank credit, this would appear to require
a rise in Regulation Q ceilings or a large drop in market interest
(19) Over the quarter, the money market conditions that
would appear to be consistent with this pattern of change in the
aggregates might encompass a Federal funds rate in an 8--8-1/2 per
cent range, net borrowed reserves averaging around $700 million,
and member bank borrowings around $800 million. Marginal reserve
measures of these proportions were experienced around year-end but,
for reasons explained in paragraph (9), they are unlikely to persist
if the Federal funds rate is kept in an 8-1/2--9-1/2 per cent range
and as excess reserves decline seasonally. A step toward achiev-
ing the first quarter money market conditions specified in the first
sentence would be to accommodate a decline in the Federal funds rate
to an 8-1/2--9 per cent range over the next four weeks, with net
borrowed resevves probably in a $700-$900 million range, member bank
borrowings a little less than $1 billion, and the 3-month bill rate
falling to or somewhat below 7-1/2 per cent. If projections of the
interrelation between the monetary aggregates and money market con-
ditions are accurate, a further modest lessening of restraint in
money market conditions would appear to be required as the quarter
(20) The initial small decline in the Federal funds rate
might alter market expectations, and thereby take pressure off of
intermediate- and long-term markets. The move is so modest, however,
and the calendar of securities so large, that sharp declines in
short- and long-term interest rates are not likely to develop over
the next few weeks unless GNP turns out to be substantially weaker
than projected (and if GNP is weaker than projected, it may take
sharp declines in interest rates to achieve a 2 per cent growth in
money supply).
(21) Within the quarter, money supply and bank credit are
likely to fluctuate fairly widely. For the money stock, little net
change would be anticipated for January; an increase in a 5-7 per
cent annual rate range might develop in February when Treasury
deposits drop sharply, and little net change again would be expected
in March as transactions demands remain quite modest and some rebuild-
ing of the Treasury balance is undertaken through a Treasury bill
offering for cash. Outstanding bank credit, as measured by the
adjusted proxy, would still show declines in January, because of
time deposit outflows. There would also likely be a decline in
February, as Government deposits drop, with the decline in a 1-4 per
cent annual rate range. Experience in March is likely to improve
substantially, with a moderate growth in outstanding bank credit
expected as declines in Market interest rates reduce the relative
attractiveness of market securities and as Government deposits are
