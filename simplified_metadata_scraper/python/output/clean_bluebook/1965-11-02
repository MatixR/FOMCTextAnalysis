Prefatory Note 
 
 
The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version available 
based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the Board 
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was created 
through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned 
versions text-searchable.2   Though a stringent quality assurance process was 
employed, some imperfections may remain. 
 
Please note that some material may have been redacted from this document if that

1  In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic 
format.  All scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced 
tilting) and lightly cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other 
blemishes caused after initial printing). 
 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optical character recognition computer program (OCR) 
first created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, 
staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.  Please note that the numbers and text in charts and 
tables were not reliably recognized by the OCR process and were not checked or corrected by staff.

MONEY MARKET AND RESERVE RELATIONSHIPS
Money market
After being around 4 per cent at the time of last FOMC meeting,
the 3-month Treasury bill rate has risen to around 4.05 per cent, but
longer-term bill rates have shown relatively little change. Short-term
bill rates in the early part of October had reflected a temporary
depletion of the available supply of bills in dealer hands as a result
of sizable System and private buying. Dealers have since rebuilt their
inventory, and private buying has recently tapered off. The System was
also a small net seller of bills during the middle part of October.
The recent advance in rates has been dampened by the avail-
ability of dealer financing at relatively attractive rates and by
expectations of sizable System buying in late October and early November.
The availability of dealer financing has reflected an increase in repur-
chase money from corporations and the absence of any sustained pressure
on money market banks, especially those in New York. Concurrently,
the Federal funds market has been somewhat less taut than earlier, with
funds trading at an effective rate below 4-1/8 per cent on four trading
days during the last two weeks of October. Especially in the last week
of October, funds were very readily available and banks were able to
reduce their borrowings at the discount window to the lowest level since
Prospects. With net borrowed reserves in the neighborhood of
$100 to $150 million, bill rates can be expected to remain within a
narrow range until around mid-November; the 3-month bill should hold in

a 4.00 to 4.10 per cent band. The Treasury's cash refunding of mid-
November maturities with an 18-month note is not likely to have much
net effect on the bill market, although the announcement of a cash
rather than a "rights" refunding did cause bill rates to back up 1 basis
point. In early November, a moderating factor will be further System
purchases perhaps abetted by some seasonal pickup in private demands.
After mid-November, the money market will enter a period of
seasonal pressure generally extending at least through the mid-December
tax period. The 3-month bill rate could perhaps penetrate the upper-
end of the range noted above, even if net borrowed reserves show no
significant rise. But this will depend importantly on the strength of
late fall credit demands. The Treasury's expected bill financing in
late November (to be announced probably in mid-November) may also put
some upward pressure on bill rates, although the possibility exists
that such bill financing may turn out to be as much as $1 billion
smaller than the $3 billion earlier anticipated.
With respect to bond yields, the market remains cautious
and thin. The Treasury November refunding announcement did not disturb
the market initially, but a disappointly high allotment ratio would have
adverse effects on the market. Bond markets still appear vulnerable to
a sizable build-up in the corporate calendar, any further diminution in
bank demand for municipals, or developments in bill rates, prices, or
balance of payments which might lead to expectations of a shift in
monetary policy.

Reserve flows, bank credit and money
The moderation in October of the sharp rise in interest rates
that had developed in August and September was accompanied by a sizable
increase in nonborrowed reserves during the month. After declining during
the last two months of summer, such reserves in October rose by nearly
of the two previous months. Total reserves, too, increased in October,
after declining in summer. Fluctuations in reserve growth over the last
three months has been importantly influenced by the timing of recent
Treasury financings.
Prospects. In the coming weeks nonborrowed reserves may
continue to grow, although at slower pace than in October. Growth in
nonborrowed reserves, given the current level of free reserves, could
continue to average about the 2.5 per cent annual rate that has prevailed
since the March policy change. Factors affecting such growth will be
the vigor of loan demand, the amount of additional Treasury financing
and the relationship between the discount and market rates.
The System can be expected to supply nearly $1 billion of non-
borrowed reserves in the first two statement weeks ending in November,
of which about two-thirds has already been supplied. Declines in
required reserves are projected to supply some free reserves in this
period, but an expected $700 million outflow of currency into circulation
will absorb reserves as will a decline in float projected at almost
$400 million. In the last half of November the System will return to
the selling side of the market, although to the extent of only about
half its purchases, as reserves are supplied by the usual rise in float.

Bank credit growth (on a monthly average basis) is likely
to slow from its rapid October pace, but probably remain around the
growth is also likely to fall from its high September and October rates,
with the demand deposit component continuing to average around the
deposit growth is likely to slow from its high October rate between
now and the end of the year.
Effect of alternative policies
Money market and reserve relationships that are likely to be
consistent with alternative policy postures have not been considered at
this time because an even keel policy associated with the current Treasury
financing appears to preclude policy action, at least until after mid-
