Prefatory Note
The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain.
Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a redaction process that removed information obtained on a 
confidential basis.  All redacted passages are exempt from disclosure under applicable 
provisions of the Freedom of Information Act.
1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked 
and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not 
reliably recognized by the OCR process and were not checked or corrected by staff.

MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES
Recent Developments
(1) The Committee's decision at its meeting on March 30 to leave the intended
federal funds rate at 4-3/4 percent was fully anticipated and elicited little market response.' On
balance, yields on Treasury coupon securities have increased 25 to 35 basis points over the
intermeeting period, while bill rates have risen somewhat less. The runup in rates has
occurred since late April, responding to strength in U.S. economic data, improved prospects
in many foreign economies and the associated increases in commodity prices, as well as the
Chairman's comments on May 6 warning of possible inflation risks. Favorable readings on
prices and wages over most of the period partly offset these forces, but today's data showing
greater-than-anticipated increases in the CPI, industrial production, and consumer sentiment
pushed yields up appreciably. Federal funds futures rates, after allowing for term premiums,
now indicate that market participants see better than even odds of a quarter-point firming of
the intended federal funds rate by the October meeting (Chart 1). Further out the yield
curve, implied one-year forward rates have risen the most--35 to 45 basis points--at the two-
to five-year maturities, consistent with the view that prospective economic developments
1 The federal funds rate averaged 4.76 percent over the intermeeting period, but it
varied substantially around this level as reserve management was complicated by tax-season
uncertainties. Initially, slower-than-projected tax receipts contributed to more plentiful-than-
planned reserve supply and pushed the funds rate below target; however, in the final week of
April, a surge in receipts produced unexpectedly large reserve drains, as some of these
receipts spilled into the Treasury's Federal Reserve account, imparting a firm tone to funds
trading in late April and early May.
over the intermediate term will ultimately put substantially more pressure on short-term
interest rates than had previously been expected. Yields on inflation-protected Treasury
securities have declined slightly over the period, widening their spreads below comparable
nominal issues. However, this widening seems to have stemmed from investors' heightened
willingness to hold less-liquid assets and from some improvement in this market's liquidity as
well as from some increase in inflation expectations. The rise in nominal Treasury yields
over this intermeeting period has extended the upward movement that began in early
February on mounting evidence of the continuing strength of the U.S. economy and
diminishing concerns about difficulties overseas. Nominal Treasury coupon yields now
stand 70 to 100 basis points above their levels prevailing at the end of January.
(2) Optimism about the economy and generally favorable earnings reports have
engendered confidence about the financial condition of private borrowers, apparently
inducing investors to reduce their assessment of and aversion to risk. Over the intermeeting
period, rates on private investment-grade bonds have registered smaller increases than those
on comparable Treasury securities, while rates on below-investment-grade bonds have fallen
modestly despite heavy issuance. Business borrowers have seen little change in the terms and
standards on loans from commercial banks since late January following some tightening last
fall. Broad stock market indexes have posted gains of 1 to 11 percent over the intermeeting
period, at times touching record highs. Since late January, measures of credit spreads
generally have fallen 30 to 105 basis points, placing these spreads at or somewhat above the
levels prevailing before the financial turmoil of midsummer, and major equity indexes have
risen 1 to 17 percent.
(3) The foreign exchange value of the dollar has depreciated somewhat on a
weighted-average basis against a broad set of currencies over the intermeeting period as the
outlook for economic and financial conditions in many emerging market countries
brightened. Relative to major foreign currencies, the dollar has declined 1/4 percent, on
average, over the period, primarily owing to sizable depreciations against the Canadian and
Australian dollars. The recovery in commodity prices has supported both currencies, and the
Canadian dollar has remained firm even after two 25 basis point cuts in the Bank of Canada's
key bank rate. By contrast, the dollar has appreciated 1/2 and 2-1/2 percent against the euro and
yen, respectively, over the intermeeting period. Longer-term interest rates in Europe have
been about unchanged, but short-term rates have fallen in response to the 50 basis point
paring of the European Central Bank's refinance rate. Political turmoil in Russia and the
negative outlook for resolving the Kosovo conflict also are said to have contributed to the
euro's weakness. In Japan, the yield on ten-year Japanese government bonds has shed 55
basis points, supporting a rally in equity prices that also was reportedly abetted by substantial
stock purchases by foreign investors.
(4) Over the intermeeting period, the dollar has declined about 1-1/4 percent against
the currencies of our other important trading partners. In Mexico, the peso and equity prices
have been buoyed by the sharp rise in oil prices and lower-than-expected inflation. In Brazil,
markets also have rallied, and the dollar fell 7 percent against the real, even as the Brazilian
central bank lowered the overnight rate from 42 percent to 27 percent. In Asia, share prices
in many countries have risen more than 20 percent, and the dollar has depreciated 1 to 11
percent against the floating currencies of emerging Asia. Credit spreads on emerging market
debt have continued to narrow over the intermeeting period (Chart 2). Since their recent
peak in late January, when Brazilian prospects seemed at their worst, these spreads have
fallen about 400 basis points on average, but for most countries they have remained
appreciably above their levels of last summer.
(5) Growth of the broad monetary aggregates surged in April, as households
evidently built up liquid balances to meet a larger-than-usual increase in nonwithheld tax
payments. The bulge in M2 was reversed in late April and early May, after tax payments
cleared, and, as a consequence, M2 growth in May is expected to slow appreciably.
Averaging through April and the current projection for May, M2 is estimated to be growing
at a 5/4 percent rate, about in line with the expansion seen in the first three months of the
year and well below the pace of late last year.2 The moderation in growth this year stems
from the waning effects of factors that lifted M2 in the latter part of 1998--the three policy
easings, the wave of mortgage refinancings, and the heightened preference for holding liquid
money balances in response to the turmoil in financial markets. M3 is also growing at a more
moderate pace this year, as the contraction in bank credit since December has enabled banks
2 The notable exception to this slowing was currency, which has advanced at an 11
percent pace, on average, since December. This robust growth cannot be attributed to
foreign demand but rather appears to reflect strong domestic spending and perhaps some
initial stockpiling ahead of the century date change.
to pare back their use of managed liabilities included in M3. Nevertheless, the velocities of
both M2 and M3 extended their declines in the first quarter, each falling at a 1/4 percent
annual rate.
(6) The debt of nonfederal sectors has expanded vigorously in recent months;
from the fourth quarter through March, this measure grew at an 8-1/4percent rate, and partial
data suggest a slightly quicker advance in April. Heavy business borrowing has been
concentrated in the bond market, in part boosted by attractive yields. Households have
continued to accumulate mortgage and consumer debt in keeping with strength in home sales
and spending on consumer durables. Robust tax inflows have held back the borrowing
needs of state and local governments and have allowed the Treasury to pay down more debt.
The cutback in federal debt issuance has restrained the growth of total domestic nonfinancial
debt, which expanded at a 5-3/4 percent pace from the fourth quarter through March.

Policy Alternatives
(7) Recent economic activity has once again proven more robust than expected,
and the staff has boosted its forecast of both aggregate demand and supply. The staff
forecast carries forward some of the surprising strength in productivity growth, which buoys
profits and equity prices; the higher equity prices have added to the growth of aggregate
demand relative to the outlook in the March Greenbook. Still, productivity growth is
anticipated to slow from its extraordinary pace of recent quarters, and profits are expected to
flatten out at their recent higher level over the forecast period. Although investors could get
frustrated at the failure of earnings to rise further, the staff expects that share prices will not
deviate greatly, on a sustained basis, from where they have been in recent days. With other
financial conditions, including real interest rates and the exchange value of the dollar, also
essentially unchanged through next year, real spending slows to a pace more in line with the
growth of potential output. Even though the unemployment rate tracks a bit below the path
in the March Greenbook, and retail energy prices move higher in the near term than
previously projected, core inflation is a tad lower over the forecast period than in the
projection in March.3 The better inflation outlook reflects in part the staffs judgment that
restraint on costs associated with greater productivity gains will exert countervailing
3 The staff now projects CPI inflation of 2-1/4 percent over this year, which is at the
midpoint of the central tendency of FOMC members' projections of 2 to 2-1/2 percent as of
the February Humphrey-Hawkins report. Real GDP growth is expected to be around 3-1/2
percent over 1999 in the Greenbook, above the central tendency of 2-1/2 to 3 percent, while
the fourth-quarter unemployment rate, at 4 percent, is below the central tendency of 4-1/4 to
4-1/2 percent.
downward pressure on prices. Even so, taut labor markets begin to lift core inflation next
year in the staff forecast, and the FOMC is assumed to firm the nominal funds rate a little
next year, which keeps the real funds rate about unchanged.
(8) If the Committee believes that inflation pressures could well be damped for
some time, it might prefer to keep the federal funds rate unchanged at this meeting, as in
alternative B. The staff forecast shows only a gradual pickup in core inflation to a relatively
low level, at least through 2000. In that environment, and in light of the considerable degree
of uncertainty regarding the economy's supply side, the Committee may want to wait to get a
firmer handle on the likely extent of price pressures before acting. The Committee might see
a significant probability of more restraint on cost pressures going forward than in the staff
forecast from, for example, a lesser slowing in productivity growth or an extension of the
recent subdued pace of wage gains. The Committee might also be encouraged by the
behavior of bond rates over recent weeks, which suggests that investors respond promptly to
signs the economy might begin to overheat and, by anticipating future monetary policy
firming, impart some restraint to spending before the Federal Reserve takes action.
(9) The response of financial markets to the continuation of an unchanged policy
stance, as under alternative B, would depend importantly on whether the Committee
announces a change in the tilt of the directive. Especially after the publication today of a
surprisingly large rise in the CPI in April, market participants reportedly see a good chance
that the Committee will announce a directive tilted toward tightening. Against that
backdrop, debt and equity markets could rally some if there were no announcement
regarding the symmetry of the directive; market participants would conclude that the
Committee chose a symmetric directive and probably would see a reduced likelihood of
future action. Over time, longer-term yields would fluctuate near these lower levels as
incoming output and price data in line with the Greenbook forecast suggest a slowing
economy and damped inflation but still the possibility of eventual tightening. Under these
conditions, the average value of the dollar should not move far from its recent range. If, on
the other hand, the Committee decided to adopt and announce a tilt in its directive toward
tightening, market participants probably would place slightly higher odds on a policy
tightening sometime over the next few meetings, pushing up interest and exchange rates
modestly further. Also, with the Committee seen as more inclined to act, markets could well
become more sensitive to information bearing on the price outlook.
(10) If the Committee saw a pickup in underlying inflation as likely, it might favor
the 25 basis point firming of alternative C. Even with what would seem to be a generous
allowance for expected productivity growth and with relatively restrained pressures on
nominal and real wages at projected labor resource utilization rates, the staff still foresees a
gradual uptrend in core inflation. The forecast implies that financial conditions must tighten
appreciably to contain inflation. Moreover, the April CPI may be a sign that the tendency
for higher inflation is stronger than contemplated in the Greenbook forecast. Although
most bond yields have backed up since late last fall, in other respects financial market
conditions have eased since the Committee's last reduction in the federal funds rate, and
economic activity both here and abroad has proven more buoyant than anticipated. The
renewed appetite for risk in financial markets and apparently relentless upward march of the
stock market in recent months may suggest the possibility that financial conditions will be
more accommodative than in the staff outlook. In this context, the Committee may believe
that tightening policy now would be prudent in light of the significant risk that substantial
economic imbalances would build if the Committee postponed action until higher inflation
became more evident in the data.
(11) Financial market prices embody little expectation of a policy firming at this
meeting. As a consequence, the immediate 25 basis point increase in the funds rate of
alternative C would trigger a similar rise in short-term interest rates. The extent of the
response of other U.S. financial markets would depend on the outlook for further policy
firming, which would be importantly affected by the wording of the announcement. Longer-
term rates should go up significantly less than short rates, as some later rise in short-term
nominal rates already has been built into market prices, and investors might be more
confident of the outlook for subdued inflation with such a preemptive move by the Federal
Reserve. However, if market participants were to decide that several additional tightening
moves were likely, long rates would increase more substantially, as they often have in the past
when policy has turned in a firming direction. Some adverse reaction would be expected in
foreign financial markets, but absent a steep sell-off in domestic markets, the fallout should
be limited, given the recovery in overseas markets and their modest response to the recent
increases in U.S. interest rates.
(12) With the projected deceleration in nominal spending under any of the policy
alternatives, growth in the debt of nonfederal sectors is expected to soften in the remainder
of this year. A slowing in the pace of housing activity and in the growth of household
spending on durable goods should lead to a moderation in the recent robust rate of
accumulation of mortgage and consumer debt. Business debt growth is expected to edge
down even as the financing gap widens owing to a slowdown in cash-financed mergers and
share repurchases. Credit supply conditions are likely to remain rather favorable for most
borrowers in the months ahead, though they could tighten somewhat later on as earnings
prove sluggish. The default rate on lower-rated debt issues is likely to stay near its recently
elevated level, and spreads on such issues should hold steady. Lending standards and terms
on business loans at banks are also likely to remain stable for a while. The staff projects
rising paydowns of federal debt, despite additional spending for the conflict in the Balkans.
Total nonfinancial debt is expected to grow 5-1/2 percent over the four quarters of 1999,
placing it in the upper half of its annual range.
(13) Abstracting from the estimated effects of refunds and nonwithheld tax
payments in recent months, M2 growth has slowed considerably, even relative to the
projected deceleration in nominal spending for the second quarter. Some of the fall-off in
M2 growth has likely been temporary, reflecting the recovery of financial markets and the
unwinding of the general buildup of liquidity that occurred in the last several months of
1998. After softening substantially in May owing to the clearing of tax checks, M2 growth is
projected to pick up in the months ahead under alternative B, extending the trend decline in
velocity evident since mid-1997, and leaving growth of this aggregate for the year at about 6
percent, somewhat above its annual range of 1 to 5 percent. The recent sluggish behavior of
bank credit also appears to reflect an unwinding of the developments of last fall; as bank
credit growth steps up in the months ahead, banks should again need to turn to managed
liabilities for financing, and M3 growth should rebound as well. For 1999 as a whole, M3 is
projected to post a 6-1/2 percent growth rate, placing it a little above its annual range of 2 to 6
