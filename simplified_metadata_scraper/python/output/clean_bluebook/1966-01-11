through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned 
versions text-searchable.2   Though a stringent quality assurance process was 
employed, some imperfections may remain.

1  In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic 
format.  All scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced 
tilting) and lightly cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other 
blemishes caused after initial printing). 
 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optical character recognition computer program (OCR) 
first created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, 
staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.  Please note that the numbers and text in charts and 
tables were not reliably recognized by the OCR process and were not checked or corrected by staff.

MONEY MARKET AND RESERVE RELATIONSHIPS
Money markets
Recent developments. The money market has displayed a
tight atmosphere since the last meeting of the Committee, reflecting
in part a much larger than seasonal increase in required reserves and
also the tight reserve positions that developed at major money market
banks, especially those in New York. Federal funds traded at an
effective rate of 4-1/2 per cent in the two statement weeks ending
December 22 and since then have traded mainly at 4-5/8 per cent.
Dealer borrowing costs have also moved into a higher range.
Treasury bill rates and other short-term rates have continued
to move higher since their initial adjustments following the Federal
Reserve actions in early December. CD rates in New York were most
recently reported in a 4.75 - 4.80 per cent range for less than
Banks reportedly are concentrating CD sales in the short-term area,
where quoted yields are currently competitive with Treasury bills.
The 3-month bill rate has risen to around 4.55 per cent, in response
partly to the heavy January Treasury financing schedule (including
$100 million of weekly additions to the 3-month bill auction), partly
to the increased cost of dealer financing, and most recently to a
reversal of year-end window dressing operations. These factors have
operated against the background of a shift in market attitudes more
firmly to the belief that interest rates generally are likely to show
an upward drift over the months ahead in view of widespread forecasts
of continuing economic strength.

The rise in bill rates was moderated to a degree by the
System's willingness to finance on a temporary basis a sizable portion
of dealer inventories at a relatively attractive rate. Between
December 23 and January 6, the System acquired, gross, slightly more
than $2 billion of short-term repurchase agreements with nonbank
In the four statement weeks ending January 5, 1966, reserve
availability at all member banks declined from net free reserves
of $75 million in the week ending December 15 to net borrowed
reserves of $180 in the week of January 5, when markets were affected
by the transit strike in New York. Member bank borrowings ranged
from a low of $218 million in the week of December 22 to a high of
$561 million in the week of January 5. For the four-week period as
a whole net borrowed reserves averaged $43 million and member bank
borrowings $453 million. These reserve figures were accompanied by
a 3-month bill rate averaging 4.45 per cent and a Federal funds rate
averaging 4.53 per cent.
Prospective developments. While some earlier market uncer-
tainties have passed, such as those related to the tax date and the
Treasury's January financing plans, the market is still in process of
adjustment. Thus, the outlook over the next three weeks for both
the degree of money market pressure and the interrelationships among
money market variables remains difficult to assess. In the period
ahead, attitudes in both the bill and bond markets will be importantly
influenced by the content of the Budget Document, to be forthcoming

in about two weeks, and by whether there is either dramatic success
or failure in current peace overtures in relation to Vietnam.
Bill demand has been strong recently, and some seasonal
easing of bill rates often develops as January progresses. But the
more than seasonal strength in public and private credit demands
currently foreseen may tend to be an offsetting factor this year.
More intensive efforts by banks to obtain CD money would contribute
to pressures in short-term markets, while credit demands generally
may serve not only to keep bill yields from showing much, if any,
seasonal improvement but may also tend to keep bond yields under
Taking these considerations into account, and in the
absence of expectational shocks, the 3-month bill rate may fluctuate
in a 4.50 to 4.60 per cent range over the next three weeks, assuming
net borrowed reserves are around $100 million. A movement of the
bill rate to a range consistently below the discount rate, say 4.40 -
possibly a positive one given the current market outlook.
Reserve flows, bank credit, and money
Recent developments. Strengthened credit demands on banks
brought forth a larger than anticipated expansion of required reserves
in December. This reserve need was accompanied by a very rapid expan-
sion in nonborrowed reserves (21 per cent annual rate for the month).
Member banks borrowed more in December than in November, but this rise
in borrowings appeared to be less than seasonal as total reserves for
the month grew somewhat less than nonborrowed.
CONFIDENTIAL (FR) -4-
Prospective developments. With respect to the effect of
market factors on the reserve supply in the weeks ahead, the usual
seasonal inflow of currency from circulation is the principal factor
supplying nonborrowed reserves. Float is projected to provide a
partial offset by absorbing reserves in the latter part of January.
The System will probably need to absorb reserves over the next two
weeks if net borrowed reserves are kept in the neighborhood of
$100 million; resumption of reserve supplying operations will be
needed toward the end of January.
Expansion in both nonborrowed and total reserves is likely
to continue in January at fairly high rates, although reduced below
December. The strength of projected expansion in aggregate reserves
is partly the result of expectations of continued strong loan demands
on banks and of bank participation in Government financings because
of the use of tax and loan account credits. Bank credit on a
daily average basis, as indicated by total member bank deposits, may
increase this month at near the 11 per cent December pace.
Projections of strong reserve growth also hinge on expecta-
tions that the deposit mix will continue to require more reserves per
dollar of deposits, as in December. Growth of outstanding time and
savings deposits in January may not be much above the reduced 11.5 per
cent December pace in view of the large CD maturities scheduled for
the current month. With time deposit growth continuingat this less
rapid pace, and with strong loan demand on banks, private demand

deposits are likely to expand further. An offsetting influence,
however, would be the greater than seasonal expansion expected for
U.S. Government deposits as a result of the concentration of financing
in the current month. Private demand deposits are likely to grow
over the next few months somewhat above the 4.5 per cent rate for
the year 1965 as a whole.
