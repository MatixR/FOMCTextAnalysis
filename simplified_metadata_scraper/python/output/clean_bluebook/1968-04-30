format.  All scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced 
tilting) and lightly cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other 
blemishes caused after initial printing).

MONEY MARKET AND RESERVE RELATIONSHIPS
Recent developments
Since the April 18 announcement of the increase in the dis-
count rate (to 5-1/2 per cent) and in Regulation Q ceilings on large
denomination negotiable CD's, and in light of the Committee's move
toward firmer monetary conditions at the subsequent FOMC meeting,
both short- and long-term market yields have risen moderately on
balance, and the prime rate has risen 1/2 point. Aside from temporary
declines at the end of the double settlement week, Federal funds rates
have traded around 6 per cent in recent sessions. The 3- and 6-month
bill rates have increased by around 15-20 basis points to 5.50 and
5.65 per cent, respectively. Net borrowed reserves of $536 million
were published for the statement week containing the discount rate
change, partly reflecting very low excess reserve holdings of country
banks in the second half of their reserve periods; this figure compares
with average net borrowed reserves of $268 million for the preceding
three weeks.
Bill rates have shown only moderate increases thus far since
the discount rate hike largely because of sizable bill demands. Among
these were demands for reinvestment of the proceeds of the $2.3 billion
of tax anticipations bills which were not turned in for taxes, and large
seasonal demands from public funds.
Prior to the move to even greater monetary restraint associated
with the discount rate increase, short-term rates had moved gradually

higher in response to the early April firming of open market policy.
In the early part of April the 3-month bill rate rose by around 15
basis points to almost 5.35 per cent. Dealer financing costs rose
markedly in this period, partly as a result of the sharp rise in the
basic reserve deficit of New York money market banks as the tax period
approached. Also, one key money market bank seemed to shift its
longer-run money position policy to become more of a borrower in the
funds market and less ready a supplier of funds to dealers.
In adjustment to the Treasury bill rates and dealer financing
costs, repurchase agreements made by the Management in the period
April 3-18 were made at 5-1/8 per cent, 1/8 above the then prevailing
discount rate. In addition, an earlier scarcity of bills, which had
pushed rates sharply lower toward the end of March, was mitigated through
moderate net sales of bills by the Desk for foreign accounts, net bill
sales of $335 million by the System in the first half of the month, and
an announcement by the Treasury of $100 million cash additions to the
weekly 6-month bill auction through mid-year. Thus, of the 30 basis
point rise in the 3-month bill rate since the April 2 FOMC meeting, about
half occurred before the discount rate hike and about half afterwards.
Other short-term rates showed mixed changes in the earlier part of April
and have generally risen 10 - 20 basis points on balance since the
discount rate hike.
The progressively tighter conditions in short-term markets
put banks at an increasing competitive disadvantage in bidding for CD

money before the Q-ceiling changes. As a result, there were large
run-offs of CD's during April, amounting to over $1 billion by around
mid-month. The new CD ceiling rates led to a somewhat larger than
usual increase in outstanding CD's in the week following the tax date,
although a large proportion of these sales apparently were for purposes
of resale into the market; there are no strong indications as yet of
a widespread bank aggressiveness in seeking new CD funds. For the
most part, posted CD rates beyond the 30-59 day area have remained
somewhat below the new ceilings, but there are reports that active
issuance of 3-month CD's at the 6 per cent ceiling rate. Also in
the course of April there was a slackening in inflows of consumer-type
time and savings deposits, especially at large banks.
A sizable portion of the April CD maturities occurred around
the tax date and contributed to heavy bank sales of Treasury bills and
to the sharp run-up of bill rates at that point. Banks were experiencing
increasing loan demand pressure in the first half of the month as well,
though there was apparently some abatement of such demands after the
tax period.
Bank sales of Treasury securities to meet CD maturities and
loan demand have tended to hold down the credit proxy. For April bank
credit on average is estimated to decline at about a 3-1/2 per cent
annual rate, and time and savings deposits to rise at only a 1/2 of one
per cent annual rate. Private demand deposits, on the other hand,
expanded at around a 14 per cent annual rate in April, considerably higher

than in March, mainly reflecting large net transfers from U.S. Govern-
ment deposits. With currency also continuing to grow rapidly, the
money supply in April bulged sharply.

Prospective developments
The possibilities of a tax increase, the status of peace
negotiations, and uncertainties as to the specifics of a Treasury
financing are among the factors which make any projection of a
constellation of money market conditions in the period ahead especially
subject to unexpected variations. As best can be gauged at this point,
the maintenance of prevailing firmer conditions in the money market during
April 26, 1968.
CONFIDENTIAL(FR) -5- April 26, 1968.
the next four weeks may involve a Federal funds rate fluctuating
around 6 per cent, member bank borrowings around $750 million and
net borrowed reserves in a $350-$500 million range. Both borrowing
and net borrowed reserves might possibly be deeper depending in part
on the extent of reserve pressure that develops at central money market
banks and on the inclination of banks to borrow from the discount window
rather than in the funds market. Persistence of this degree of tautness
in such money market indicators may serve to drive the 3-month bill
rate up in a 5-1/2 -- 5-3/4 per cent range, partly because of the
associated high dealer financing costs (with costs of new money in
New York often 6-1/2 per cent or a little above) and also because of
the effect on attitudes of market participants who may not have yet
fully appreciated the extent of monetary tightness that is in train.
If it were not for the possible effect on bill rates of a
sustained taut monetary policy, the 3-month bill rate over the next few
weeks might show little, if any, tendency to rise further. The ending
of mid-April tax period pressures has begun to ease the reserve position
of central money market banks, and if past behavior is any guide, the
position of such banks is likely to be relatively comfortable in May.
Moreover, large bill sales by dealers to the public during the past
several days have depleted the trading supply of bills going into a
period when System open market operations are likely to be on the buy
side at least over the next two weeks. Finally, the weekly additions
to the 3-month bill auction are scheduled to come to an end.
CONFIDENTIAL (FR) -6- April 26, 1968.
The forthcoming mid-May Treasury financing is expected to have
relatively little impact on bill rates, unless the whole financing were
to be concentratedin a15-18 month issue. Market expectations are that
the Treasury will probably seek to avoid the sizable attrition that
might accompany a "rights" exchange for the $4 billion of publicly
held maturing issues. Rather, a cash exchange is anticipated, possibly
with both a short- and intermediate-term offering, with the Treasury
perhaps raising some new cash if market conditions are appropriate.
A cash exchange has in the past generally been associated with somewhat
less bill demand from holders of maturing issues than has a "rights"
exchange, in which the appearance of "rights" value on the maturing
issue has made it attractive for holders of the issue to sell it and
often to reinvest the proceeds in the bill market.
A bill rate even at the upper end of the projected range will
enable banks to compete fairly effectively for CD funds if they choose.
But banks are not expected to be overly aggressive in seeking longer-
term CD funds at near ceiling rates unless loan demands are exceptionally
strong or unless they become more convinced that the outlook is for
considerably higher interest rates in the months ahead--which is a
possible development if the recent revived hopes for a tax increase
again fade away. The staff expectation is that banks will add somewhat
to outstanding negotiable CD's in May, as they make an effort to begin
recovering from the approximately $1.5 billion run-off between the mid-
March and mid-April tax periods. Net additions to outstanding CD's
may be in the order of $300 - $600 million over the month, or just
slightly more than seasonal.
CONFIDENTIAL (FR)
This relatively conservative estimate of CD offerings is
also based partly on the expectation that immediate bank needs for
funds are not likely to be extremely large. Business loan demands on
banks during coming weeks are expected to slacken somewhat from their
very rapid mid-March to mid-April pace. There may be some pick-up in
bank credit demands, however, in connection with the mid-May refunding,
as dealers and other temporary holders seek financing. It is not
expected that banks, in terms of their longer-run portfolio choices,
will be able, or willing, to do much more than roll over the maturing
mid-May issues.
Given these prospective credit demands, and with the Treasury
assumed to raise only about $400 million of new cash through over-
allotments in the mid-May refunding, outstanding bank credit is likely
to show little change in the course of May, and, on average, move only
in a +2 to -2 per cent annual rate range. Bank credit would, of course,
show a larger increase if the Treasury raised more new cash than assumed
around mid-May, and particularly so if tax and loan crediting were granted
on the cash portion.
Assuming the bulk of the Treasury's cash financing is
accomplished in June, bank credit might grow at a 4-6 per cent annual
rate; loan demands are also likely to be stronger, and banks may begin
to press CD offerings more strongly on the market. If the mid-points
of these ranges are realized, bank credit expansion (as measured by
the proxy) would be at about a 4 per cent annual rate over the first
half of the year.
April 26, 1968.
CONFIDENTIAL (FR) -8- April 26, 1968.
The anticipated moderate recovery in CD's is likely to lead
to growth in time and savings deposits during May in a 5 - 7 per cent
annual rate range, with inflows of consumer time and savings deposits
remaining sluggish given the existing structure of market interest
rates. Money supply growth in May is expected to drop off from April,
though to remain relatively rapid, at around an 8 - 10 per cent annual
rate. The net new cash expected to be raised by the Treasury in May
will not be sufficient to forestall a further sizable decline in the
Treasury's cash balance (seasonally adjusted), and this will result
in further shifting of funds from U.S. Government to private demand
deposits. The quite rapid growth in currency of the past two months
is projected to slow down; the staff does not yet have any very
convincing explanation for the surge in currency growth, and,
similarly, no strong reason to assume the growth will continue.
The constrained growth in bank credit in May, and also in
June when compared with other periods of Treasury cash borrowing, is
likely to contribute to additional upward pressures on longer-term
interest rates, barring a tax increase or the psychological impact of
a break-through in Vietnam peace negotiations. There is no evidence
yet of large-scale anticipatory capital market borrowing by corporations
and state and local governments, but there are signs of a growing
calendar in both markets that will tend to add to market pressures
in a period when the Treasury will be marketing coupon issues and
possibly a PC.
