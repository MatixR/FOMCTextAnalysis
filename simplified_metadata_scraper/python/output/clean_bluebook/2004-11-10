Class I – FOMC
MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES
Recent Developments
(1) The FOMC’s decision at its September meeting to increase the target
federal funds rate 25 basis points to 1¾ percent, to assess the risks to sustainable
economic growth and price stability as balanced, and to retain the “measured pace”
language was widely expected and elicited only a muted reaction in financial markets.1
Despite mixed economic reports subsequently, the near-term expected path of
monetary policy moved higher (Chart 1).  Market participants apparently inferred an
increased likelihood of continued policy firming from both the minutes of the August
FOMC meeting, which noted the need for “significant cumulative policy tightening,”
and comments by the Chairman and other Federal Reserve officials, which were read
as downplaying the economic drag from elevated oil prices.  Futures market quotes
indicate that investors now place sizable odds on a quarter-point tightening at this
meeting, but expect a pause sometime soon.  The Desk’s survey of primary dealers
reveals that they uniformly expect firming at this meeting, most anticipate retention of
the measured pace language, and some see a modification of the statement to signal a
possible pause in the process of firming.  Futures quotes suggest that investors expect
the funds rate to rise to about 2¾ percent by the end of 2005.
(2) The shift in near-term policy expectations contributed to a flattening of the
term structure of interest rates, with the yield on the two-year Treasury note rising
oil prices seemed to heighten concerns about the near-term prospects for inflation
and, at least at times, for output growth; both stock prices and bond yields often
moved closely and inversely with oil prices from day to day.  Treasury inflation-
indexed yields fell substantially, leaving inflation compensation over the next five
years 35 basis points higher and at the upper end of its range over the past few years.
Five-year inflation compensation five years ahead, however, edged down, and survey
measures of long-term inflation expectations remained well contained.
(3) Yields on investment-grade corporate bonds moved roughly in line with
those on nominal Treasury securities of comparable maturity, keeping risk spreads on
these securities about unchanged (Chart 2).3  In contrast, spreads on speculative-grade
debt narrowed 45 basis points.  Third-quarter corporate earnings reports ran slightly
ahead of expectations, but the rise in energy prices and news of investigations of
insurance industry practices weighed on equity prices.  In recent days, equity markets
rallied as the presidential election reached a decisive conclusion, and broad share price
indexes ended the period up 3½ to 4 percent on net.
(4) The exchange value of the dollar fell almost 5 percent on balance against a
basket of other major currencies over the intermeeting period, amid heightened
concerns about financing the deepening U.S. current account deficit (Chart 3).  At
times, market participants pointed to statements of Federal Reserve officials about
international financial developments as a factor contributing to such worries.  The
dollar dropped most steeply against the Canadian dollar—about 6½ percent.  With
signs of further strengthening of Canadian domestic demand and concerns building
about inflation pressures, the Bank of Canada raised its official rate 25 basis points on
October 19.  Canada’s position as a net exporter of oil also seemed to provide support
to its currency.  The dollar declined 4¾ percent vis-à-vis the euro, moving close to a
record low, and depreciated 3½ percent against the yen.  Japanese authorities referred
publicly to taking action in the event that the yen continues to appreciate, but no
intervention occurred during the intermeeting period.4  Yields on long-term
government bonds edged up in Japan but fell about 10 to 20 basis points in Europe
and Canada over the intermeeting period.  Share prices in Japan dropped slightly, but
those in most other major industrial countries moved up about 2 to 3 percent on
balance.  The dollar depreciated slightly against currencies of our other important
trading partners.  In late October, the People’s Bank of China surprised markets by
increasing a benchmark one-year lending rate 27 basis points.  The move raised
uncertainties about the future pace of China’s economic expansion and prompted
speculation about possible changes in China’s fixed-exchange-rate regime.
(5) Domestic nonfinancial debt grew at a robust annual rate of about 7 percent
in the third quarter.  In the nonfinancial business sector, debt growth stepped up to
in part to the financing of a large merger transaction in the bond and commercial
paper markets (Chart 4).  Business loans at commercial banks continued to advance
last month, and results from the October Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey
indicate that banks have continued to ease standards and terms on these loans.
Household debt appears to have decelerated a little in the third quarter as mortgage
borrowing, although remaining quite brisk, slowed somewhat while consumer debt
continued to expand at a moderate pace.  After surging in the first half, federal sector
debt advanced moderately in the third quarter.  In October, the Treasury reached the
statutory debt limit and began using extraordinary accounting devices to continue
funding government activity (see box).
(6) M2 grew at a moderate pace in September but slowed in October.  Money
growth was likely damped by a further rise in the opportunity cost of holding M2
assets, as yields paid on deposits have lagged the increases in open market rates that
accompanied monetary policy tightening.  Thus far, the increase in the opportunity
cost of holding M2 about matches the experience of recent policy tightening periods.
M2 velocity edged higher in the third quarter, roughly in line with historical
relationships among money, nominal income, and opportunity costs.
Treasury Debt Subject to Limit
On October 14, 2004, the Treasury reached its statutory debt limit of $7,384 billion.  As 
in previous debt limit episodes, the Treasury resorted to a set of extraordinary accounting 
devices to avoid violating the statute, denoted by the shaded area in the chart below.  So far, 
the Treasury has begun to underinvest the Government Securities Investment Fund (the so-
called G-fund), part of the federal employees’ thrift savings plan.  In the past, the Treasury 
also increased debt issued by the Federal Financing Bank—debt which is not subject to the 
limit—to extinguish other Treasury debt and tapped both the Exchange Stabilization Fund 
and the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund.  While the total room for borrowing 
made available by these accounting devices will depend on the Secretary’s declaration of the 
likely duration of the debt limit emergency period, staff estimates suggest that the Treasury 
will be able to maintain normal cash and debt management practices at least through late 
November; however, on November 3, the Treasury announced that it may need to postpone 
the November 18 settlement of the four-week bill if the limit has not been raised.  The 
Congress is scheduled to reconvene the week of November 15 in order to pass 
appropriations legislation for the fiscal year, and Congressional leadership has signaled an 
intention to raise the debt limit then.  In order to make its debt issuance more predictable, 
the Treasury suspended issuance of SLGS—securities purchased by municipal governments 
to comply with rules surrounding advance refunding.  To date, there has been no evidence 
that concerns about the debt limit have affected financial markets.
Policy Alternatives
(7) The staff has marked down its outlook for economic activity through the
first quarter of next year, but the broad outline of the forecast through 2006 is
otherwise similar to that prepared for the September FOMC meeting.  The staff
forecast assumes that the Committee will raise the target federal funds rate to
tighten in late 2005 and into 2006.  This trajectory for the federal funds rate runs well
below the path embedded in market yields.  In the Greenbook projection, the outlook
of investors is assumed to align gradually with that of the staff, and the resultant
downward revisions to policy expectations lead to a modest decline in long-term
yields.  The projected path for stock prices is almost identical to that of the last round
and, as in prior Greenbooks, provides investors a risk-adjusted return comparable to
that on fixed-income securities.  The staff continues to assume about a 2 percent rate
of depreciation in the foreign exchange value of the dollar, albeit from its current
lower level.  Against this financial backdrop, real GDP growth averages about
about 4 percent thereafter.  Accordingly, resource slack is gradually taken up after the
first quarter of next year, bringing the unemployment rate close to the staff’s
estimated NAIRU of 5 percent by the end of the forecast period.  Although
diminishing, resource slack should continue to put downward pressure on core
consumer price inflation.  But these pressures are expected to be offset by a slowing
in the pace of structural productivity growth and, for a time, by the delayed effects of
past increases in the prices of oil and core imports.  Core PCE inflation is forecast at
about 1½ percent in 2005 and 2006.
(8) Table 1 presents three alternatives for near-term policy, together with draft
language for the Committee’s announcement.  The rationale paragraph has been
updated to reflect recent readings on the economy as well as the passage of time,

Assessment 
of Risk
With underlying inflation expected to 
be relatively low, the Committee 
believes that policy accommodation can 
be removed at a pace that is likely to be 
measured. Nonetheless, the Committee 
will respond to changes in economic 
prospects as needed to fulfill its 
obligation to promote price stability 
and sustainable growth.

which makes mention of developments earlier this year less relevant.  The description
of the labor market will depend importantly on the employment report released
tomorrow, but, as a placeholder, the entry in the table describes conditions as having
improved modestly.  If economic circumstances diverge significantly from this
characterization, staff will circulate alternative language in advance of Wednesday’s
meeting.  Under Alternative A, the federal funds rate target would be maintained at
might now be more inclined to pause in the process of removing policy
accommodation.  Under Alternative C, the funds rate would also be raised to
of policy at least as rapid as currently embodied in market expectations.  Under all
three alternatives, it seems likely that the Committee would view the risks to growth
and price stability as about balanced after the policy announcement.
(9) The current degree of stimulus provided by financial market prices
embodies the expectation of tightening at this meeting followed by a brief pause.  If
the Committee regarded the outlook for economic activity and inflation given these
financial conditions as striking an appropriate balance between reducing slack and
limiting inflation risks, it might wish to validate those expectations by tightening
which includes language intended to signal a possible pause in the removal of policy
accommodation.  The Committee might view a further quarter-point tightening at this
meeting as an appropriate step in the direction suggested by standard policy
benchmarks:  Such a tightening would be consonant with the prescriptions from a
battery of interest rate rules (Chart 5) and would boost the real federal funds rate
nearer to the middle of the range of various measures of the equilibrium real interest
rate (Chart 6).  The Committee’s desire to align the stance of policy more closely with

such benchmarks might be heightened by the perceived need to be vigilant in
response to the decline in the foreign exchange value of the dollar and the jump in
some short-term measures of inflation compensation.  Looking forward, though, the
Committee might regard a pause following this firming action as potentially prudent
given the uncertainties attending the macroeconomic outlook.  Such a pause would
allow the Committee time to assess the underlying strength of aggregate demand and,
given relatively anchored longer-term inflation expectations, might be viewed as
imposing little cost.
(10) Regarding the announcement of Alternative B, the Committee might signal
the possibility of a pause by noting that the firming brings “the cumulative increase
in the target rate over the past several months to 1 percentage point.”  A mention of the
cumulative policy tightening would convey the sense that the Committee was
reflecting upon the extent to which accommodation had been removed.  Citing
cumulative changes is a device last employed in the FOMC statements of June and
August 2001.  The sense that the Committee was inclined to pause for a time might
be reinforced by characterizing the stance of policy as remaining “somewhat
accommodative,” rather than “accommodative” as in the September announcement, and
would seem to parallel the Committee’s decision in January 2002 when it first
characterized policy as accommodative when the funds rate was at 1-3/4 percent.
(11) The market reaction to the announcement for Alternative B is difficult to
gauge precisely.  Futures quotes indicate that market prices have largely, but not
completely, built in a quarter-point tightening at Wednesday’s meeting, suggesting that
such an action would probably impart a bit of upward pressure to near-term yields.  In
addition, options data indicate that investors attach some probability to scenarios in
which the funds rate remains at 2 percent for a few meetings.  Nonetheless, the signal
of a possible pause might cause investors to mark down the odds they currently seem
to attach to tightening over the next several months.  In such circumstances, longer-
term yields could edge lower and stock prices might tick up.
(12) Against the backdrop of higher oil prices and a weaker dollar, the
Committee might believe that inflation pressures under the Greenbook policy
assumption are unlikely to be as well-contained as in the staff forecast.  Indeed, both
market- and survey-based measures of near-term inflation expectations moved higher
over the intermeeting period.  Faced with these developments, the Committee might
wish to tighten policy a quarter-point and adopt the firmer statement language shown
for Alternative C.  Even if the Committee found the staff forecast of a gradual
decline in inflation to be both likely and generally acceptable as a modal assessment, it
might be concerned about upside risks to the outlook.  In particular, as discussed in
the “more inflation” scenario in the Greenbook, inflation could pick up markedly if
the rise in oil prices were to trigger a significant increase in long-term inflation
expectations.  Moreover, the Committee might harbor some concerns that inflation
pressures could build if—as envisioned in the “slower productivity” Greenbook
simulation—the favorable productivity growth trends witnessed in recent years fade
over time.  In such circumstances, policy might need to be tightened relatively briskly
at coming meetings, perhaps inclining the Committee to be reluctant to hint now that
it might pause in the process of firming.
(13) The announcement of Alternative C could cite the increase in the target rate
to 2 percent with no intimation of a pause any time soon.  The stance of policy might
still be characterized simply as “accommodative” and the rationale paragraph might note
that “rising energy prices and an escalation of business costs have the potential to contribute to
upward pressure on prices” so as to highlight concerns about inflation.  The Committee
could retain the measured pace language and might also continue to assess the risks to
growth and price stability as balanced, particularly if it viewed that assessment as
conditioned on an assumption of appropriate policy.
(14) Such an announcement would probably be read as suggesting that the
FOMC is placing somewhat greater weight on inflation risks than the market currently
perceives.  It seems likely then that both real and nominal interest rates would edge
higher, and stock prices would fall.  The market reaction might be more muted if the
references to mounting inflation pressures were not as explicit.  That said, it is also
possible that, without the hint of a pause, investors would be more likely to build in
expectations of tightening at each of the next several meetings given the experience of
four consecutive firmings.  In that event, the rise in interest rates and the drop in
stock prices could be more substantial.
(15) Given the disappointing data on employment and industrial production in
recent months, along with the mixed signals from other economic indicators, the
Committee’s assessment of the near-term prospects for spending and employment
might be less optimistic than in the staff forecast.  In particular, members might read
the meager pace of hiring since the spring and weak high-tech spending as evidence of
continued reluctance on the part of firms to make significant commitments in the
current environment.  The still-weak tone in labor markets also might be viewed as a
factor depressing consumer confidence and so weighing on household spending.  In
that circumstance, the Committee might see less need to continue removing policy
accommodation at this meeting and choose to keep the funds rate at 1¾ percent and
issue a statement like that shown in Alternative A.  Even if the Committee judged the
staff forecast as likely, it might consider the projected progress in working down slack
as too slow to be acceptable, especially given that core PCE inflation runs at
concerns about disinflation were acute.  The Committee might also be concerned
about possible downside risks to the forecast from high oil prices and the potential
for a deceleration in consumer spending similar to that in the “faltering expansion”
scenario in the Greenbook.
(16) The announcement of Alternative A would indicate an unchanged target
federal funds rate but otherwise might look fairly similar to the announcement for the
September meeting.  The statement might characterize policy as “somewhat”
accommodative while the final sentence would underscore the Committee’s
commitment to both its price stability and sustainable growth objectives.  Given the
actual pause in policy adjustment, the “cumulative increase” wording employed in
Alternative B would not seem necessary.  Such an announcement would come as a
surprise to market participants.  Both real and nominal yields would likely decline and
stock prices could increase.  However, if investors interpreted the announcement as
portending weaker-than-expected economic activity, the rise in stock prices might be
muted while the drop in yields could be more pronounced.
Money and Debt Forecasts
(17) Growth of M2 from the fourth quarter of last year to the fourth quarter of
this year is currently projected at about 5 percent.  Under the staff forecast, M2
growth steps down to about 2½ percent next year, owing largely to the lagged effects
of the policy tightening undertaken in recent months on opportunity costs.  Stronger
nominal income growth in 2006 contributes to a projected acceleration in M2 to a
the forecast period, primarily reflecting a decline in household debt growth as slowing
home price appreciation trims the pace of mortgage borrowing.  Growth of the debt
of nonfinancial businesses is anticipated to pick up over the forecast period as capital
spending begins to outstrip internal funds by a wider margin.  Stronger income
growth is projected to bolster federal tax revenues and reduce federal deficits, but
federal debt is projected to advance at a pace exceeding that of nominal GDP.

Directive and Balance-of-Risks Statement
(18) Draft language for the directive and draft risk assessments identical to those
presented in Table 1 are provided below.

(2) Risk Assessments
A. The Committee perceives the upside and downside risks to the
attainment of both sustainable growth and price stability for the next few
quarters to be roughly equal.  With underlying inflation expected to be
relatively low, the Committee believes that policy accommodation can be
removed at a pace this is likely to be measured.  Nonetheless, the
Committee will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to
fulfill its obligation to promote price stability and sustainable growth.
B. The Committee perceives the upside and downside risks to the
attainment of both sustainable growth and price stability for the next few
quarters to be roughly equal.  With underlying inflation expected to be
relatively low, the Committee believes that policy accommodation can be
removed at a pace that is likely to be measured.  Nonetheless, the
Committee will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to
fulfill its obligation to maintain price stability.
C. The Committee perceives the upside and downside risks to the
attainment of both sustainable growth and price stability for the next few
quarters to be roughly equal.  With underlying inflation expected to be
relatively low, the Committee believes that policy accommodation can be
removed at a pace that is likely to be measured.  Nonetheless, the
Committee will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to
fulfill its obligation to maintain price stability.

MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES
An Update
Attached is an exhibit that details the market reaction to this morning’s
employment report and a revised version of table 1 from the Bluebook.  As shown in
the top panel of the market reaction exhibit, interest rates and policy expectations
registered substantial increases following the release of the employment report.  As of
structure.  Treasury inflation-indexed yields rose nearly as much as comparable-
maturity nominal yields, suggesting that much of the market response was attributable
to an upward revision in the market’s outlook for real economic activity.  The
November federal funds futures contract ticked up a half basis point, putting the
implied probability of a quarter-point tightening at the upcoming meeting at 90
percent.  Further-ahead futures rates were marked up as much as 20 basis points, as
investors evidently concluded that a more vigorous expansion would likely be
accompanied by more rapid policy tightening than they had previously expected.
The bottom left panel of the exhibit displays the option-implied probability
distribution for the employment report outcome based on the economic derivatives
auction held at 8:00 a.m. today.  As noted by the vertical line, the reported increase of
sizable market reaction.  But, as noted at the right, the market reaction was sizable
even controlling for the magnitude of the surprise.  For example, the response of the
ten-year Treasury yield—denoted by the blue square—was larger than would have
been predicted based upon a historical event-study regression (shown by the thin
black line) but was quite close to the regression line based on experience over the last
year (the red line) during which markets have appeared especially sensitive to news
bearing on labor market conditions.
In view of the sizable employment gains reported for October and the upward
revisions for the prior two months, as well as comments from several members, the
staff has revised Bluebook table 1.  The revised table eliminates alternative A and
incorporates a new variation on alternative B that is labeled alternative B’.  The new
alternative does not hint that the Committee is entertaining the possibility of a pause.
As a result, the language of alternative B’ incorporates only minimal changes to the
wording of the September FOMC statement.  Alternatives B and C in the revised
table are slightly revised for clarity, with material struck out in rows three and four.

have the potential to contribute to
