MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES
Recent developments
(1) After growing rapidly over the three months November through
January, M1 contracted in February at a 3¾ percent annual rate, and now
appears to have grown only about 2 percent in March. Thus, over the last
two months behavior of this aggregate has been close to the zero growth
objective for that period specified by the Committee at its February meeting.
Demand deposits contracted sharply over the past two months--more than
offsetting their December-January bulge in growth. However, other checkable
deposits (OCDs) continued to expand at a relatively rapid, though decel-
erating, pace during the period.
(2) The recent performance of M1 has brought it closer to, but
still above, the upper limit of the Committee's longer-run range. As shown
in the next-to-last column of the table on the next page, growth of Ml from
QIV '81 to March '82 is estimated at about a 7¾ percent annual rate;
however, growth on a quarterly average basis for the first three months
of the year was at a more substantial 10¼ percent annual rate.
(3) Growth of M2 thus far this year has been just above its
longer-run target range, with expansion since QIV '81 at a 9¼ percent
annual rate. Over the two-month February-March period, M2 appears to
have grown at about a 7 percent annual rate, a bit below the 8 percent
rate targeted by the Committee. Growth in money market funds, though
picking up recently, has been somewhat slower than anticipated as interest
rate spreads for a time were unfavorable. Savings deposits, which had
expanded rapidly since October, grew slightly over the past two months,
while small time deposits resumed a more rapid rate of expansion.

2. Adjusted for shifts of assets from U.S. offices to IBFs.
3. Growth rates for reserves measures are adjusted to remove the effects of
discontinuities resulting from phased changes in reserve ratios under the
Monetary Control Act.
(4) Expansion of bank credit continued at around an 11 percent
annual rate in January and February (adjusted for shifts of assets to
IBFs), paced by strength in business loans. Bank credit growth seems to
have slowed in March, along with a weakening in demand for business
loans, insofar as can be judged from weekly large bank data for the first
half of March. Issuance of commercial paper has remained strong thus far
in March. Business financing obtained from long-term sources receded to
unusually low levels in the first two months of the year, but the pace
has picked up somewhat in March as long-term rates edged off from peaks
reached in early February.
(5) In conjunction with its decision to seek no M1 growth in
February and March the Committee specified an initial level of adjustment
borrowing of $1.5 billion, implying a considerable reduction in nonborrowed
reserves in February. Owing to the weaker-than-targeted money growth
early in the intermeeting period, the level of adjustment borrowing
implied by the reserves path gradually declined, but most recently the
pick-up of required reserves associated with the strengthening of M1
has contributed to a higher level of adjustment borrowing and moderate
borrowing averaged about $1.4 billion. Since the beginning of the year,
all of the total reserves growth of about 5¼ percent, at an annual rate,
has reflected expansion in borrowed reserves. Nonborrowed reserves,
despite a substantial rise in March, have declined somewhat on balance
since December.
(6) The federal funds rate has fluctuated generally in a
interest rates, too, have been volatile over the intermeeting period,
reflecting market participants' changing perceptions of the outlook for
money growth and reserve market conditions. Most short-term market
rates have declined on balance to 1 point since the February FOMC
meeting, and long-term interest rates are down 1/2 to 3/4 of a point.
(7) The dollar has risen by about 4 percent since the last
FOMC meeting. While daily movements of the dollar often have been related
to movements in U.S. short-term interest rates relative to foreign rates,
at the end of the period interest differentials were about the same as
at the beginning. The dollar benefited from relatively favorable price
developments and from a general perception that governments abroad may
be shifting to less restrictive demand policies.
Alternative near-term targets
(8) Shown below are alternative targets, and associated
federal funds rate ranges, for M1 and M2 for the second quarter. (More
detailed and longer-run data for the alternatives are contained in the
table and charts on the following pages, and the quarterly interest rate
pattern underlying the staff's GNP projection for 1982 is contained in
appendix II.) Alternative A, calling for a 4½ percent rate of growth of
M1 in the March-to-June interval, would, as shown in Chart 1, maintain
the level of narrow money above the upper end of the Committee's 2½-to-5½
percent longer-run range throughout the second quarter; however, that
rate, if sustained over the second half, would bring M1 down to the upper
end of range by year-end. The 3 percent M1 rate of growth from March to
June of alternative B is designed to bring the level of that aggregate to
about the upper limit of the Committee's longer-run range by around mid-year.
The alternative C specification of 1½ percent M1 growth would place that
aggregate at about the middle of the upper half of the range by mid-year.
Under all three alternatives, M2 would be expected to move within the
/ The new 91-day deposit instrument authorized by the DIDC, to be effec-
tive May 1, is unlikely to significantly strengthen time deposit growth,
but--reflecting the temporary ceiling rate differential--is likely
to add to thrift deposit expansion relative to that for commercial
banks. Similarly, the new unregulated 3 year deposit is not expected
to add to time deposit growth since about half of the depository
institutions have been offering less than the ceiling rate on the 2
year and over SSC.

Growth from March to June
(9) Despite the staff's projection of second-quarter growth
in nominal GNP at a 9 percent annual rate, money demand is not expected
to strengthen significantly in the March to June period. M1 growth in
the first quarter was considerably in excess of what might be expected
on the basis of actual income and interest rates, and apparently reflected
the public's increased demand for liquidity in an environment of economic
uncertainty. This demand was reflected in part in a resurgence in growth
of the OCD component of M1. Resumption of economic growth is likely to
reduce uncertainty, with the public in consequence readjusting its
financial asset holdings by drawing on its accumulated money and liquidity
balances for spending and/or investing in other financial assets. Such
behavior would lead to a sharp rise in velocity of the existing money
stock and permit expanding nominal GNP to be financed with relatively
little additional M1. The projected adjustment in money holdings and
liquidity balances is expected to take the form of a further deceleration
in growth of OCD--in the April-June period to a rate of close to 15 percent
per annum, as compared with growth at about a 50 percent annual rate in the
November-February period and at more than a 20 percent annual rate in March.
(10) In setting a path for second-quarter growth in the money
supply, we have allowed for most, and possibly all, of M1 expansion to occur
in April. Growth of M1 in April (seasonally adjusted) accelerated over
the last half of the 1970s. In the past two years, however, M1 has been

quite volatile in April--declining sharply in 1980, presumably reflecting
the credit control program, and rising very rapidly in 1981, partly
reflecting the preceding policy-induced drop of short-term interest
rates. With so volatile a performance of M1 in the most recent years,
it is difficult to judge whether the pre-1980 trend has continued and thus
whether it should be reflected in current seasonal adjustment factors.
Under the circumstances, we have assumed that the odds are tilted toward
the computed April seasonal factor this year having underestimated the
seasonal increase. But uncertainties with respect to April are great,
not only because of the special factors noted above, but also because
there are always questions about how rapidly individuals will pay their
taxes, how they will manage their cash in doing so, how quickly the
Treasury will pay refunds, and how promptly they will collect the checks
mailed in. Thus, while we have allowed for a bulge in growth in April,
a relatively moderate growth cannot be ruled out, particularly if tax
payments are made out of NOW accounts that were built up earlier or out
of money market funds (thereby avoiding a temporary build-up in demand
(11) Alternative A, which entails growth of M1 at a 4½ percent
rate from March to June, would call for an increase in total reserves
over the quarter at about an 8½ percent annual rate. Assuming a decline
in adjustment borrowing to about $750 million, nonborrowed reserves would
expand at a 13½ percent annual rate over the quarter. A federal funds
rate of 13 percent or so would be implied, given the present discount
(12) The 3-month bill rate under this alternative may decline
into the 11 to 12 percent area. Bond yields, too, would be likely to
decline, although the rally might be limited by a pick-up in corporate bond
offerings. Pressures on thrift institutions would ease a bit, but
operating losses still would continue for most institutions, especially
given the lag between declines in market rates and average deposit
costs. With U.S. interest rates falling, there is likely to be some
tendency for the foreign exchange value of the dollar to decline from
recent advanced levels, though any such weakening would be limited if
foreign monetary authorities took the opportunity to permit their
interest rates to decrease further.
(13) The alternative B specifications, which call for M1 growth
at a 3 percent rate from March to June, imply an increase in total
reserves at a 7 percent rate. Assuming adjustment borrowing of $1¼
billion, nonborrowed reserves would also increase at around a 7 percent
rate, and the federal funds rate would likely fluctuate around 14 percent
or a bit higher. Other interest rates would probably continue to fluctuate
within the range of the past several weeks, absent any substantial change
in the fiscal outlook. In addition, to the extent that the market has
discounted a considerable bulge in money growth in April, market rates
could decline somewhat if such a bulge does not develop.
(14) Alternative C, involving a 1½ percent rate of growth of
M1 over the March-to-June period, would require a growth in total reserves
at a 5½ percent rate. This alternative would appear to be consistent
with adjustment borrowing of near $1¾ billion, implying essentially no
growth in nonborrowed reserves. Under this approach, the federal funds
rate would likely rise into the 15 to 16 percent range over the inter-
meeting period. Such a rebound in the funds rate would probably lead
to a substantial rise in other short-term rates and renewed upward
pressure on long rates. These rate pressures might be moderated to the
extent that market expectations about the vigor of economic recovery and
future credit demands are dampened. The dollar would come under substantial
upward pressure in exchange markets.
(15) In considering the proposed alternatives for the second
quarter, the Committee may also want to take account of implications for
the second half of the year. If the M1 specification of alternative A is
adopted for the second quarter, this would imply a further deceleration
of M1 growth over the last six months of the year to a 2¾ percent annual
rate to be consistent with growth for the year (QIV to QIV basis) at
the year (see the top line of the "4¾" column in the table below.)
The last column of the table shows that growth at about a 4 percent
annual rate over the last six months of the year would be consistent with
hitting the upper limit of the longer-run range under alternative A--which
would provide more scope for financing expected economic recovery. If
the Committee were to adopt the second-quarter targets of alternatives
B or C, some acceleration in growth over the 6-month June-to-December
period--to just above a 4 percent annual rate under alternative C--would
be in prospect even if growth for the year were constrained to 4¾ percent.
Should the Committee accept growth in M1 for the year at the upper limit
of its longer-run range, even more rapid growth in the second half would
be in prospect (5 to 6 percent, depending on whether alternative B or C
is adopted at this meeting).

Directive language
(16) Given below is a suggested operational paragraph for the
directive. The specifications adopted at the meeting on February 1-2
are shown in strike-through form. The phrase in brackets is presented
as an option that would effectively give added weight to M2 in operations
in the circumstances of the forthcoming period.
IN THE SHORT RUN, the Committee seeks behavior of reserve
aggregates [DEL: over the balance of the quarter] consistent with GROWTH OF
M1 AND M2 FROM MARCH TO JUNE AT ANNUAL RATES OF ABOUT ____ PERCENT
AND ____ PERCENT RESPECTIVELY [DEL: bringing M1 and M2 over time into
their longer run target ranges for the year. Taking account of
the recent surge in growth of M1, the Committee seeks no further
growth in M1 for the January to March period and growth in M2 at
an annual rate of around 8 percent. Some decline in M1 would be
associated with more rapid attainment of the longer-run range
and would be acceptable in the context of reduced pressure in
the money market.] [THE COMMITTEE ALSO NOTED THAT DEVIATIONS
FROM THESE TARGETS SHOULD BE EVALUATED IN LIGHT OF THE POSSIBILITY
THAT M2 WOULD BE LESS AFFECTED OVER THE PERIOD THAN M1 BY DEPOSIT
SHIFTS RELATED TO THE TAX DATE AND BY CHANGES IN THE RELATIVE
IMPORTANCE OF NOW ACCOUNTS AS A SAVINGS VEHICLE.] The Chairman
may call for Committee consultation if it appears to the Manager
for Domestic Operations that pursuit of the monetary objectives
and related reserve paths during the period before the next
meeting is likely to be associated with a federal funds rate per-
sistently outside a range of [DEL: 12 to 16] ____ TO ____ percent.
