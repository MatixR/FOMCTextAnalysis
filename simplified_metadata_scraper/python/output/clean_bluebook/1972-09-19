The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version available 
based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the Board 
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was created 
through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned 
versions text-searchable.2   Though a stringent quality assurance process was 
employed, some imperfections may remain.

format.  All scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced 
tilting) and lightly cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other 
blemishes caused after initial printing).

MONETARY AGGREGATES AND
MONEY MARKET CONDITIONS
Recent developments
(1) In recent weeks, credit markets have been in a highly sensitive
state, while monetary and reserve aggregates have run ahead of paths indicated
at the last Committee meeting. Since mid-August Treasury bill rates have
risen from 60-80 basis points, and yields on longer-term Treasury and Federal
agency issues have moved up as much as 35 basis points. In other markets,
changes have been more moderate, with increases in short rates ranging up to
38 basis points and in long rates from 10 to 15 basis points.
(2) The sharp rise in Treasury bill rates reflected the cessation
of special demands associated with the Treasury's August refinancing, a shift
of foreign central banks from the buy to the sell side of the market, and
sales of bills in connection with the Treasury's September deficit, including
sales by the Federal Reserve to offset the reserve effect of a sharp decline
in the Treasury cash balance at the Fed. The influence of this large increase
in bill supply was accentuated in late August and early September when the
Federal funds rate broke through 5 per cent. Market expectations turned
bearish, and upward rate adjustments spilled over into non-Treasury markets.
(3) Soon after the last FOMC meeting, RPD growth appeared to be
moving toward the high end of the 5--9 per cent range adopted by the Committee,
and the Desk operated to provide reserves more cautiously. However, because
credit markets proved to be so sensitive to the resulting firmer money market
conditions, the Desk felt compelled to supply some reserve cushion even though
RPD growth rose above the target range. Desk operations helped to calm
market unsettlement. The average funds rate dropped to about 4.70 per cent
in the statement week ending September 13, although this partly reflected
a sharp drop in bank demand for excess reserves following a bulge in the
week of the Labor Day holiday. Most recently, with security markets more
stable, the Desk has tightened up on supplying reserves with the expectation
that the Federal funds rate might move to around 5 per cent,
(4) Reserves available to support private nonbank deposits now
appear to be growing at about a 12 per cent annual rate for the August-September
target period. Roughly 2 percentage points of the difference between 12 per
cent and the 7 per cent mid-point of the target range is attributable to
larger average excess reserves at banks than had been assumed in the initial
projection. Most of the enlargement of excess reserves occurred during the
Labor Day statement week, when precautionary member bank borrowing over the
holiday period produced average excess reserves for the week totaling $838
million. About 1/2 percentage point of the difference reflects changes in the
multiplier as a result of shifts in the mix of deposits.
(5) Expansion of M1 and M2 in August exceeded growth rates thought
to be consistent with policy alternative B in the last Blue Book by 1/2 to
1-1/2 percentage points (after adjusting for a decrease in the July base).
In the case of M 1 the annual growth rate for August was 6 per cent, as shown
in attached Table 2. However, data for early September suggest that growth of
M1 will be rapid from August to September, and is thus likely to be stronger
in the third quarter than thought at the last FOMC meeting.
(6) The following table compares seasonally adjusted annual rates
of change in major financial aggregates for recent periods with the year
ending in August and with the preceding two calendar years.

Prospective developments
(7) The ensuing paragraphs present various trade-offs between
interest rates and growth in monetary and reserve aggregates. At one limit,
(alternative A), we have shown an expansion in monetary aggregates that involves
essentially no change between now and the first quarter of 1973 in money
market conditions from those recently prevailing. At the other limit
(alternative D), we have shown an M1 path under which growth is curtailed
to a 6 per cent annual rate by the first quarter of next year; this path
implies a full percentage point rise in the Federal fund rate between now
and the next meeting. There are a number of possibilities in between.
Alternative B and C are two, and they involve both a more gradual slowing in
the monetary aggregate and a more gradual tightening of money market con-
(8) For each of the four alternatives noted above, the following
table shows RPD growth rates and associated money market conditions that
might be used as operating targets between now and the next meeting of the
Committee. (The tables in paragraph (11) and on pp.8-9 give longer-run paths
for monetary aggregates.) A single maximum likelihood estimate is shown for
the Federal funds rate. At any given RPD target, the strength of demand for
reserves, as well as technical market factors, will of course generate
fluctuation around the funds rate shown. The Committee presumably will wish
to specify a range of fluctuation to be tolerated by the Desk.

1/ Annual rates of growth calculated after adjusting required reserves
component of the RPD series to eliminate the discontinuity from the
change in reserve requirements resulting from the effectuation of
Regulations D and J.
(9) The changes in Regulations D and J, effective September 21,
affect the multiplier relationship between reserves and deposits, and in
the transition period immediately ahead makes that relationship more
uncertain than usual. For one thing, the ability of banks to waive
penalties on reserve deficiencies (up to $433 million initially) will
affect excess reserves to an unknown degree. To the extent that these
potential waivers are not used (either to run deficiencies or to reduce
normal excess reserves), excess reserves will rise. 1/ We have
assumed that 50 per cent is used in the first week and that use
increases to 80 per cent by the end of four weeks. For another thing,
the effect on required reserves resulting from Regulations D and J is
particularly complicated. Though Regulations D and J together will
lower required reserves for a given level of gross deposits, banks as a
1/ In our figures excess reserves, RPD, total reserves, and nonborrowed
reserves have been adjusted to include the $433 million of potential
waivers, since these are in effect reserves that can be utilized by the
banking system.
whole will have greater required reserves from the effect of Regulation J
alone, because faster reserve crediting will reduce cash items and hence
increase required reserves. 1 / But we cannot be very certain at this point
as to the distribution by individual banks of the Regulation J effect on
reserves and, therefore, of the effect on the reserve-deposit multiplier--
particularly given a totally new reserve requirement structure to evaluate.
(10) Money market conditions will also be affected by other
transitional uncertainties affecting the behavior of banks themselves. The
long lead time between announcement and effectuation of the new regulations
and the intensive educational work undertaken by Federal Reserve officials
would suggest a relatively smooth transition. But it is likely that banks
may hold somewhat more excess reserves than normal for a while in
adapting to the faster inflow and outflow of reserve funds under Regulation J
and also in not fully adjusting immediately to the reduction in requirements
under Regulation D. There may also be money market churning, and perhaps
more volatility in member bank borrowings, if inflows and outflows of
reserve funds differ from bank expectations in the initial stages of the new
(11) Paths for the monetary aggregates consistent with the initial
RPD and money market conditions shown in paragraph (8) are indexed below
by rates of change (SAAR) for M1. Detailed figures for all the usual
monetary aggregates, including various measures of reserves, are shown in
the tables on pages 8 and 9.
1/ The disappearance of cash items on banks' books (and also of float
on Fed Books) as a result of new Regulation J will also result in an upward
level adjustment in measured money supply. This adjustment will be made at
the time of our annual revision. The adjustment will not affect growth rates.

(12) Under alternative A, the Committee would be aiming at a
constellation of reserve and money market conditions--essentially involving
no change through the first quarter of '73 in money market conditions from
those prevailing on average in the past few weeks--that would reduce M1
growth only modestly from the rapid 10-1/2 per cent rate expected in the
third quarter. Some slowing in M1 demand in the fourth and first quarters
would be in prospect from the lagged effects of the recent rise in short-
term rates. But by the end of the first quarter, operations under alternative A
would probably have set in train forces leading to quite rapid M1 growth as
1973 progresses, assuming the rate of expansion in nominal GNP remains strong.
(13) The monetary aggregates under alternative B and C are con-
sistent with progressive firming in reserve and money market conditions over
the months ahead; however, alternative B moves in this direction more
gradually than alternative C. The first stage of firming, between now and
the next meeting of the Committee, would probably result in a Federal funds
rate moving up to a range around 5-1/8 per cent under B and around 5-3/8 per
cent under C. But the funds rate would probably need to rise in added stages

the following page.
1/ The dollar level of the reserve series includes $433 million of potential
reserve deficiencies on which penalties can be waived for a transition period
in connection with bank adaptations to revised Regulation J.
2/ For ease of analysis, annual rates of growth have been calculated after
adjusting the required reserve component of the reserve series to eliminate
the discontinuity from the change in reserve requirements resulting from
the effectuation of Regulations D and J. The amount of adjustment for the
RPD series is $815 million in September, $2,740 million in October, and
$2,700 million in November.
to around 5-3/4 and 6 per cent, respectively, under the two alternatives
by mid-December, as RPD growth was further restrained to reduce M1 expansion
to the annual rates shown for the first quarter in the table in paragraph (11).
(14) Alternative D sets a path which is expected to result in a prompt
upward move of interest rates. The funds rate, for example, would probably
rise to around 6 per cent within a month and then level off. Such a rise
in interest rates would permit a reduction in the growth of M1 to about a
6 per cent annual rate by the first quarter of next year.
(15) The behavior of monetary aggregates other than M1 is shown,
as noted earlier, in the tables on pages 8-9. Key developments affecting
these aggregates are: (a) a slowing in the growth of time deposits other
than large CD's in reflection of recent rises in market interest rates and,
particularly in the cases of alternatives C and D, of further rises; and
(b) continued sizable demand by banks for large CD funds associated with
sustained strong loan demand.
(16) With respect to interest rate developments in the period
before the next Committee meeting, any further increases may be quite modest
if recently prevailing money market conditions were continued. Short-term
rates have adjusted to a more normal relationship to the recently prevailing
funds rate, and the prospective volume of new security offerings in corporate
and municipal bond markets appears moderate. However, bill rates may be
affected by the forthcoming monthly Treasury auction raising $600 million of
new cash, by anticipations of cash borrowings in October and November, and
also by increased foreign central bank selling of bills if a sizable reflow
of dollars should develop.
(17) Recent investor hesitancy and a still relatively large
overhang of dealer bill positions suggest that credit market conditions
remain quite sensitive to indications of change in monetary policy. A
rise in the Federal funds rate to somewhat above 5 per cent, as contemplated
in alternatives B or C, would very likely lead to further upward adjustments
in short-term rates, with the 3-month bill rate moving up in a 4-3/4--5-1/2
per cent range. Short rate increases would be greater under alternative C
than under B, and the probability of reviving expectations of a discount
rate increase would also be commensurately greater. Long-term market rates
would probably rise somewhat, particularly if a rising funds rate were
viewed as the beginning of a more sustained tightening in monetary policy.
Upward market rate adjustments would, of course, be quite sharp under
alternative D.
Prooosed directives
(18) Presented below are four alternative formulations for the
operational paragraph of the directive, which might be taken to correspond
to the similarly lettered policy alternatives discussed in the preceding
Alternative A
"To implement this policy, while taking account of developments
in [DEL: capital] CREDIT markets, [DEL: and] international developments, AND THE
EFFECTS OF BANK REGULATORY CHANGES, the Committee seeks to achieve
bank reserve and money market conditions that will support [DEL: moderate]
SOME MODERATION OF growth in monetary aggregates over the months
Alternative B
"To implement this policy, while taking account of developments
in [DEL: capital] CREDIT markets, [DEL: and] international developments, AND THE
EFFECTS OF BANK REGULATORY CHANGES, the Committee seeks to achieve
bank reserve and money market conditions that will support SOMEWHAT
MORE moderate gr wth in monetary aggregates over the months ahead."
Alternative C
"To implement this policy, while taking account of developments
in [DEL: capital] CREDIT markets, [DEL: and] international developments, AND THE
EFFECTS OF BANK REGULATORY CHANGES, the Committee seeks to achieve
bank reserve and money market conditions that will support MORE
moderate growth in monetary aggregates over the months ahead."
Alternative D
"To implement this policy, while taking account of developments
in [DEL: capital] CREDIT markets, [DEL: and] international developments, AND THE
EFFECTS OF BANK REGULATORY CHANGES, the Committee seeks to achieve
bank reserve and money market conditions that will support moderate
growth in monetary aggregates over the months ahead."
(19) In all four alternatives it is proposed to indicate that
account is to be taken of "credit" rather than "capital" market developments
in order more explicitly to encompass short- as well as long-term interest
rates in the instruction. This is proposed on the assumption that the
Committee would want the Manager to modify his operations in the event
some unusual combination of factors subjects bill and other interest rates
to undesired upward pressure. In alternative D (and also to lesser extents
in C and B) the same language could be interpreted as calling for adapting
Desk operations as necessary to facilitate orderly market adjustments to
the higher interest rate levels foreseen.
(20) The Committee has often interpreted an instruction to take
account of "international developments" as calling for the use of operating
techniques designed to minimize downward pressures on short-term interest
rates. At times, however, some members have favored retaining such an
instruction for other reasons, such as to avoid the inference that might
be drawn from its deletion that the Committee had decided to give less
weight to international considerations. If the reference is retained at
this time, it presumably would be for the latter type of reason, particularly
with the forthcoming IMF meeting in view.
(21) It is proposed in all four alternatives to add "the effects
of bank regulatory changes" to the list of considerations to be taken into
account, in view of the uncertainties surrounding bank response to the
announced revisions of Regulations D and J.
