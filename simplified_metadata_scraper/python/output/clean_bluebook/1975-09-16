The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version available 
based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the Board 
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was created 
through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned 
versions text-searchable.2   Though a stringent quality assurance process was 
employed, some imperfections may remain. 
 
Please note that some material may have been redacted from this document if that

format.  All scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced 
tilting) and lightly cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other 
blemishes caused after initial printing). 
 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optical character recognition computer program (OCR) 
first created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, 
staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.  Please note that the numbers and text in charts and

Recent developments
(1) M1 grew at a 4½ per cent annual rate in August, and data
suggest some pick up in September. For the August-September period, M1
is now projected to grow at an annual rate of 5.7 per cent, about the
mid-point of its range of tolerance. Growth of consumer-type time deposits
also slowed in August, and M2 is projected during the August-September period
at a 7 per cent annual rate, somewhat below the lower end of its target of

1/ These figures do not incorporate the regular quarterly benchmark
revision of monetary aggregates that will be published this coming
Thursday. The revisions (based on the April call report) lowered the
rate of growth for M1 in the first half of 1975 from 5 to 4.1 per cent.
The level of M was reduced by $1.3 billion in April and by $1.2 billion
on average in the second quarter. All tables on subsequent pages of this
report (with the exception of table 1 and 2 following the charts) are based
on the new series. The new and old series are compared in Appendix table IV.
(2) Business loans at banks remained about unchanged in August,
following a small July advance, but the volume of commercial and finance company
paper outstanding rose $600 million, as the wide differential between the bank
prime and commercial paper rates continued to make the paper market relatively
attractive. Banks allowed CD's to run off for the seventh straight month,
and the bank credit proxy declined.
(3) Following the August FOMC meeting, the Desk continued to
provide reserves consistent with the Federal funds rate remaining in a range
of 6-1/8 to 6-1/4 per cent. On the basis of data for the aggregates that
became available after Labor Day, the staff reduced its projection of M1
growth for August-September to the lower part of the Committee's range of
tolerance and its projection of M2 growth below the bottom of the range. In
view of the expectation of a substantial strengthening in demands for money
and credit over coming months, and the likelihood that a decline in the
Federal funds rate may have to be reversed shortly, the Committee concurred
on September 5 in the Chairman's recommendation to instruct the Desk to
continue aiming at a Federal funds rate in a 6-1/8 to 6-1/4 per cent area,
leaning toward the lower figure. In the most recent statement week, the
funds rate averaged 6.15 per cent.
(4) Treasury bill rates have changed little on balance since the
August meeting, even though the Treasury continued to add significantly to
the supply of bills. The 3-month bill was most recently trading around
6.45 per cent. Private short-term rates, on the other hand, increased
10-15 basis points, as the demand for funds in the commercial paper market rose.
(5) Over most of the intermeeting period, yields on Treasury coupon
issues edged lower, and corporate bond yields remained about unchanged, re-
flecting the stability of short-term rates, System purchases of coupon issues
in late August, and a lull in the volume of new offerings in both sectors.
Municipal yields rose to record levels during the intermeeting period as
the financial problems facing New York City continued to cast a pall.
However, on September 9, the New York State legislature adopted a financial
plan that would avoid a near-term default on the City's outstanding securities
and cover the City's cash needs through mid-December. In response, the market
atmosphere improved and prices of MAC issues strengthened. Following the
Treasury's September 10 announcement of its sizable cash requirements over the
remainder of 1975, however, yields in all bond markets adjusted upward.
Throughout the intermeeting period, mortgage rates advanced as demands for
mortgage funds expanded and lenders became more uncertain as to the cost and
availability of savings funds.
(6) The Treasury indicated that it would be raising about $44 to
$47 billion in the second half of 1975, which is about $3-$6 billion more than
previously announced. Allowing for the funds already raised since mid-year,
the remaining cash need to be covered between now and year-end appears to be
in the $23-$26 billion range. A substantial amount of this will be auctioned
between now and the next Committee meeting. The Treasury will raise $1 billion
of new cash in the monthly 2-year note auction on September 16, and will offer
$2 billion of 29-month notes on September 24. It is also likely that another
$5 billion will be auctioned in the note market near the time of the next
Committee meeting on October 21. Meanwhile, the Treasury will also be
adding to weekly and monthly bill auctions, though in the case of the weekly
auctions by somewhat lesser amounts than in recent months.

Prospective developments
(8) Summarized below for Committee consideration are specifi-
cations for three alternative short-run policy courses. More detailed
figures--including longer-run growth rates--are presented in the
tables on pp. 6a and 6b.

(9) Following relatively slow growth in the July-August period,
in September and October M1 is expected to expand at rates more nearly
consistent with the underlying strength of transactions demands. Deposit
expansion in the previous months had been dampened as the public brought
deposit holdings into a more normal relationship with income and interest
rates, following the sharp bulge in late spring resulting from special
Treasury payments. This process now appears to have been completed.
Under alternative A --which assumes the same Federal funds rate range
for the forthcoming intermeeting period as that adopted at the last
meeting--M1 is expected to rise at an annual rate in the 6½-3½ per cent
area over this and the next month on average. M2 growth is also likely
to accelerate, mainly reflecting the more rapid expansion on demand deposits.

However, growth in consumer-type time and savings deposits also is
expected to strengthen a little, at least temporarily, from its reduced
August rate.
(10) If Federal funds over the next few weeks were to continue
trading in the recent 6-1/8--6¾ per cent range, market interest rates
generally would be likely to show little further net change. Interest
rates on Treasury securities--particularly bills and short-intermediate
issues--have been adjusting upward recently in response to the cash need
and financing package announced by the Treasury on Wednesday. Some
further yield increases could occur, though, as the new securities are
auctioned, with about $8 billion of new cash to be raised through auctions
of coupon issues between now and around the time of the next meeting.
(11) Business borrowing in the corporate bond market over the
weeks ahead is likely to be at a slower rate than in the first half of
this year, though picking up from the reduced August pace and still
quite sizable by historical standards. The prospective volume of state
and local government issues remains relatively large. The municipal market
could be stabilized, for a time, by the assistance package for New York
City enacted by the New York State legislature. It is possible that the
period of calm may last into the fall, but there are still substantial
uncertainties in the market, typified by the slow reception initially
accorded the recent offering of generously priced short-term New York
State issues.
(12) Given the large amount of Treasury borrowing that is
being compressed into the next month or so, as well as the still sensitive
state of the municipal market, a significant rise in the Federal funds
rate--for example, toward the upper end of the 5-3/4--7 per cent range
of alternative A--would likely lead to substantial further yield advances.
Interest rate increases would be accentuated if strengthening credit
demands on banks from businesses and consumers were at the same time
reducing bank willingness to add to Treasury security holdings.
(13) While alternative A basically assumes little or no change
in the Federal funds rate between now and the next meeting, the staff
believes the funds rate would have to rise later in the fall if the
monetary aggregates are to remain on track with the Committee's longer-
run objectives. A funds rate in the 7-7 per cent area would be expected
by late fall, assuming a longer-run M1 objective characterized by 7 per
cent growth from QII '75 to QII '76 (the assumption of the Green Book
GNP projection), with further funds rate increases anticipated in the
first half of next year. Attainment of a longer-run 6 per cent annual
rate of growth in M1 would be likely to require more prompt and intensive
pressure on the funds market. In view of the further interest rate increases
expected given either of these two M1 growth rates,we have assumed, in
working out all of the alternatives in this bluebook, a small upward
adjustment in Regulation Q ceilings around year-end of ¼ to ½ percentage
point on time certificates. With this assumption, longer-run M2 growth
is projected toward the low end of the Committee's announced target
range under alternative A.
(14) Alternative C encompasses an immediate substantial tightening
of the money market and is characterized by a Federal funds rate range
for the intermeeting period of 6 -8 per cent, centering on 7¼ per cent.
With growth in nonborrowed reserves more constrained, member bank borrowing
under this alternative would be likely to rise to $400 million or more,
given the 6 per cent discount rate. Nonetheless, growth of M1 in
September-October would probably be reduced somewhat, to the 6-8 per cent
area. Interest rates generally would rise quite sharply during the next
month under this alternative, particularly given the very large Treasury
financing demands described in paragraph (6). A rise in the 3-month bill
rate to [8] per cent or a little above would not be unlikely, and the yield
on 2-year Treasury notes could exceed 9 per cent.
(15) Such rate levels would undoubtedly divert savings flows
away from banks and thrift institutions. The staff would expect the
annual rate of growth in consumer-type time deposits at banks and deposits
at thrift institutions to drop to around a 7-8 per cent rate in October.
Pressures on such flows would be intensified later in the fall and early
next year, when further increases in the Federal funds rate would be
(16) Under alternative C mortgage market conditions may be
expected to tighten rather promptly, with rates rising further over the
next few weeks and with lenders becoming less willing to make loan
commitments. Under alternative A, and to a certain extent under
alternative B (to be discussed below), strains on the mortgage
market would be more delayed and less severe. The assumed adjustment
in Regulation Q ceilings would temper the impact of upward market rate
adjustments on savings inflows to thrift institutions after year-end,
but the mortgage market would still be expected to come under additional
pressure next year.
(17) Alternative B contemplates a modest tightening of money
market conditions between now and the next Committee meeting, as
indicated by the 6-3/4 per cent mid-point of a 6-7 per cent Federal
funds rate range. As in the other alternatives, additional tightening
would appear to be necessary later this year and early next year. The
staff has assumed that the Federal funds rate under this alternative
would probably rise to the 7 -8 per cent area by late fall. This
particular funds rate pattern would be consistent with a one-year growth
rate for M1 between QII '75 and QII '76 of 6-3/4 per cent. Given the
downward revision of $1.2 billion in the average level of M1 in the
second quarter of 1975, such a growth rate would result in the same
average level of M1 in the second quarter of 1976 as was implied by the
6 per cent growth path presented in the previous bluebook.
Proposed directive
(18) Given below is a proposed operational paragraph if the
Committee wishes to continue formulating its instructions in terms of
desired growth in monetary aggregates over the months ahead. No
alternatives are presented for this formulation, in the expectations that
the reference to desired growth will be taken to apply to the longer-term
targets and that the Committee will not be reconsidering its present 5 to
7 per cent target range--with which all of the short-run operating
alternatives discussed in the preceding sections are consistent--until
the October meeting.
"Monetary aggregates" proposal
To implement this policy, while taking account of developments
in domestic and international financial markets, the Committee seeks
to achieve bank reserve and money market conditions consistent with
moderate growth in monetary aggregates over the months ahead.
(19) Should the Committee desire to formulate the directive
in terms of bank reserve and money market conditions, the language needed
would depend on the specific conditions sought. These alternative
"money market" directives intended to correspond to the similarly lettered
policy alternatives are given below.
Alternative "money market" proposals

Alternative B
To implement this policy, while taking account of developments
in domestic and international financial markets, the Committee seeks
to achieve SOMEWHAT FIRMER bank reserve and money market conditions
OVER THE PERIOD IMMEDIATELY AHEAD, PROVIDED THAT MONETARY AGGREGATES
