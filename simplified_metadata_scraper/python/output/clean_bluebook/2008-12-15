CLASS I FOMC - RESTRICTED CONTROLLED (FR)
MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES
Recent Developments
(1) Financial markets remained under severe strain over the intermeeting
period.  Although there were signs of improvement in some money markets,
conditions continued to be poor, spreads were elevated, and year-end pressures
emerged.  The Treasury’s announcement on November 12 that funds from the
Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) would not be used to purchase securities
backed by mortgage-related and other assets elicited a negative price reaction in
several financial markets.  Intensifying concerns about the financial condition of
Citigroup and the potential systemic implications of its failure prompted the U.S.
government to intervene to provide financial support.  In response to deteriorating
conditions in credit markets, the Federal Reserve announced on November 25 the
creation of the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF) and also a
program to conduct large-scale outright purchases of debt issued by housing-related
GSEs and mortgage-backed securities (MBS) backed by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac,
and Ginnie Mae.  On net, the sharp deterioration in the outlook for economic growth
led market participants to mark down substantially the expected path of monetary
policy over the intermeeting period, and they now appear to expect a 50 basis point
cut in the target federal funds rate at the upcoming FOMC meeting.  Yields on
nominal Treasuries plunged and TIPS-based measures of inflation compensation
declined.  In the corporate sector, broad equity price indexes moved lower while risk
spreads soared over the intermeeting period.  Although issuance of nonfinancial
investment-grade bonds was solid in November, speculative-grade debt issuance
continued to be nil.  Bank lending exhibited broad weakness in November.
Household credit declined in the third quarter.  Numerous foreign central banks eased
monetary policy considerably amid signs of a worldwide economic slowdown.
Financial Institutions
(2) Investor concerns about the condition of financial institutions mounted
over the intermeeting period.  Credit default swap (CDS) spreads for U.S. banks
widened notably, and their equity prices fell, likely reflecting in part sharp declines in
the value of mortgage-related and other assets (Chart 1).  Anxiety about the financial
condition of Citigroup intensified, especially in the wake of the firm’s announcement
that it would lay off 52,000 workers and absorb $17 billion in distressed assets from
structured investment vehicles.  To support financial market stability, the U.S.
government on November 23 entered into an agreement with Citigroup to provide a
package of capital, guarantees, and liquidity access.1  Banking organizations began to
take advantage of the FDIC’s Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program, with twelve
institutions issuing roughly $70 billion in bonds under the program (see the box
entitled “The FDIC’s Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program”).
(3) Other financial institutions also came under pressure over the intermeeting
period.  CDS spreads for insurance companies remained elevated, possibly reflecting
concerns regarding the prospective profitability of these firms as well as declines in
the values of their investment portfolios.  Equity prices of insurance companies
slipped lower, on net, over the intermeeting period.  REITs were significantly affected
by the deterioration in the commercial mortgage market, and their equity valuations
fell and CDS spreads surged.  Average returns of hedge funds were negative for a

The FDIC’s Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program
On October 14, the Federal Deposit Insurance 
Corporation (FDIC) announced a Temporary Liquidity 
Guarantee Program (TLGP) to help improve market 
confidence in the U.S. banking system.  An interim rule was 
published on November 3, and a final rule was released 
November 21.  The TLGP has two components:  The 
Transaction Account Guarantee Program (TAGP) and the 
Debt Guarantee Program (DGP).  The TAGP covers 
(through December 31, 2009) all balances in noninterest 
bearing transactions accounts in excess of the deposit 
insurance limit of $250,000, as well as certain additional 
accounts (such as NOW accounts with interest rates of 
0.5% per year or less), held at FDIC-insured depository 
institutions. Demand deposits have soared, registering over 
150 percent annualized growth in November, in part 
because of the TAGP.  Reportedly some institutional 
investors are leaving funds in these accounts rather than 
earn very low rates in other money markets, particularly the 
repo market.  In addition, some large time deposits—which 
are not covered by this program—have reportedly been 
converted to demand deposits to benefit from the 
guarantee.
The DGP covers certain new senior unsecured obligations 
issued by FDIC-insured depository institutions and by most of 
their parent holding companies.  The guarantee covers all new 
debt with maturity over one month, up to a cap based on 
senior debt outstanding as of September 30, 2008.1  All 
guaranteed debt issued by June 30, 2009 is covered until 
maturity or until June 30, 2012, whichever is sooner.  Fees 
associated with this program range from 50 basis points for 
debt with maturities of 180 days or less to 100 basis points for 
maturities beyond 360 days.

The FDIC’s Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program (cont.)
Initial inclusion in the TLGP was automatic, with eligible institutions having until December 5 
to decide whether they wanted to continue participating in the program or to opt out of one or 
both of the DGP and the TAGP.  Virtually all large institutions chose to participate in both 
components of the TLGP.  The FDIC reports that about 800 institutions have opted out of the 
TAGP and more than 3000 have opted out of the DGP.  However, FDIC staff indicate that 
there has been some confusion regarding participation in the DGP, and these numbers are likely 
to be revised.
Issuance of debt under the DGP began in late November.  As shown in the table on the 
previous page, eligible institutions have issued about $70 billion in notes, primarily denominated 
in U.S. dollars, with maturities ranging from December 2010 to June 2012.  Roughly one-third 
of the issuance has been floating rate.  The FDIC estimates that issuance of senior unsecured 
bank notes under the DGP could eventually total as much as $500 billion.  Debt issued under 
this program has thus far traded at spreads to Treasuries somewhat wider than those of 
comparable-maturity agency debt but substantially lower than those of corporate notes not 
subject to the guarantee.  There are some notable differences in spreads on these debt issues 
across institutions.  Moreover, the differences in spreads across firms appear to be correlated 
with differences in CDS premiums.  In part, the difference in yields on guaranteed debt 
instruments may reflect investor uncertainty regarding the FDIC's payout process in the event 
of default.  Market participants reportedly indicated that, with a significant amount of DGP 
debt expected to be issued over coming months, and with the Federal Reserve expected to 
purchase large quantities of agency debt, the difference in spreads between these assets is likely 
to persist.  Nonetheless, DGP debt spreads have generally narrowed since issuance, amid 
reportedly notable trading volumes as investors have become familiar with the program.

sixth consecutive month in November, although recent losses were not nearly as large
as those in September and October.  In the wake of their recent poor performance,
hedge funds have reportedly experienced considerable net redemptions, with some
estimates suggesting that October outflows equaled about 2 percent of industry assets
under management.  Further, year-end redemption requests appeared to continue to
weigh on the industry.  To meet actual and expected redemption requests, hedge
funds were said to have liquidated positions, likely exacerbating asset price declines in
several markets.  Meanwhile, prime money market mutual funds (MMMFs), which
had experienced outflows in September and October, posted net inflows over the
intermeeting period.  The inflows likely reflected an easing of investor concerns about
the safety and liquidity of these funds, owing to the Treasury’s Temporary Guarantee
Program and the support provided by several Federal Reserve facilities.
Market Functioning
(4) Money markets remained strained over the intermeeting period, particularly
at terms beyond overnight, although there were some signs of improvement.  In
unsecured interbank funding markets, Libor fixings at most maturities declined
notably early in the period and spreads over comparable-maturity overnight index
swap (OIS) rates narrowed further from the record levels reached in October (Chart
narrowed again in recent days as the Libor fixing declined.  Trading in longer-term
interbank funding markets reportedly remained thin.
(5) In secured funding markets, conditions continued to be strained over the
intermeeting period.  Amid high demand for safe investments, the overnight general
collateral (GC) repo rate remained very low and fell to around zero late in the
intermeeting period.  Fails to deliver in the Treasury market came down substantially
from the extraordinary levels reached in October and overnight securities lending

from the SOMA portfolio fell sharply, although these declines came against a
backdrop of sharply lower transaction volume as investors have reportedly become
less willing to lend collateral out of fear that it will not be returned and as some large
dealers are reportedly reducing the amount of collateral they are supplying to the
market ahead of year-end.  However, fails have picked up somewhat in recent days as
the GC repo rate reached zero.  The low level of SOMA lending may in part be due to
a high fee relative to market rates.  Demand for safe instruments was also apparent in
the Treasury bill market, where yields turned negative at times.  During the
intermeeting period, the Treasury announced that it would not roll over bills related to
the Supplementary Financing Program (SFP), for the stated reason of preserving
flexibility in managing debt policy, and uncertainty about supply, combined with a
perceived lack thereof, appeared to exacerbate poor conditions in the bill market.
Despite the decline in spreads over Treasury GC rates later in the period, strains in
markets for repo transactions backed by agency and MBS collateral remained evident,
with bid-asked spreads and haircuts very elevated.
(6) In contrast, conditions in the commercial paper (CP) market improved over
the intermeeting period, reflecting importantly the recent measures taken by the
Federal Reserve in support of this market.  Spreads on 30-day A1/P1 financial and
asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP) continued to narrow after the Commercial
Paper Funding Facility (CPFF) became operational on October 27, although spreads
subsequently reversed a portion of the declines as maturities crossed over year-end.
By contrast, spreads on A2/P2 paper—which is not eligible for purchase under the
CPFF—stayed extremely elevated.  The dollar amounts of unsecured financial CP and
ABCP outstanding rebounded from their October lows, though this increase was
more than accounted for by issuance into the CPFF.  As of December 10, credit
extended under the CPFF totaled $311 billion.  Credit extended under the Asset-
Backed Commercial Paper Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility (AMLF) fell
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 8 of 60
by more than half over the intermeeting period, to $34 billion.  Thus far, the Money
Market Investor Funding Facility (MMIFF) program has registered no activity.  The
low demand for credit from the AMLF and MMIFF likely reflects the recent net flows
into money market mutual funds, the institutions that the two facilities were designed
to support.
(7) Strains remained evident or even intensified in a number of long-term
financial markets over the period.  The functioning of the market for Treasury
coupon securities remained impaired.  The on-the-run premium for the ten-year
nominal Treasury security surged higher from already elevated levels.  Trading
volumes in the Treasury market continued to decline and bid-asked spreads were
abnormally wide.  Liquidity in the corporate bond market was also impaired for
speculative-grade bonds, while conditions have improved somewhat in recent months
for investment-grade bonds.  In the CDS market, liquidity and price discovery
apparently remained poor, based on the number of dealers providing quotes and the
range of dealer quotes.  The announcement by the Treasury on November 12 that
TARP funds would not be used to purchase mortgage-related and other assets
sparked a sharp decline in various asset prices.  The selloff was particularly
pronounced in the market for commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS), with
an index of CDS spreads on AAA-rated CMBS widening 310 basis points, on net,
over the intermeeting period.  Secondary market prices of syndicated leveraged loans
also declined to new record lows and implied spreads on the LCDX index soared to
record levels, as hedge funds reportedly unloaded their holdings of leveraged loans
and as collateralized loan obligations came under significant pressure.  Average bid-
asked spreads in the syndicated loan market widened further, on net.
(8) Depository institutions continued to make heavy use of the discount
window.  Although primary credit outstanding declined somewhat in recent weeks, it
stood at $90 billion as of December 10.  Recent TAF auctions, for both 28-day and
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 9 of 60
number of bidders remained relatively steady.  Overall, credit extended under the
TAF increased about $150 billion to $448 billion.  Bidding was especially light for the
two forward TAF auctions conducted over the intermeeting period—each for $150
billion in short-term credit over year-end.  While a number of the Term Securities
Lending Facility (TSLF) auctions held over the period were oversubscribed, the two
most recent auctions were undersubscribed.  Market participants exercised only $8
billion of the options on $50 billion of TSLF loans against Schedule 2 collateral on
their November 24 exercise date.  However, the auction offering $50 billion in
options for 13-day Schedule 2 TSLF loans straddling the year-turn was
oversubscribed, with investors reportedly attributing the reception to the current
strong demand for Treasury collateral.  Use of the Primary Dealer Credit Facility
(PDCF) declined significantly over the intermeeting period, falling to $52 billion on
December 10 from $80 billion on October 28.  On November 10, the Treasury and
the Federal Reserve announced a restructuring of the support provided to AIG.2
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 10 of 60
(9) Even though the interest rate paid on excess reserves was raised to the
lowest target federal funds rate in place during the reserve maintenance period, the
effective funds rate continued to trade soft to the target, likely reflecting the extremely
high provision of liquidity through the Federal Reserve’s liquidity facilities (see the
box “Recent Developments in the Federal Funds Market”).
Monetary Policy Expectations and Treasury Yields
(10) The FOMC’s decision at its October meeting to lower the target federal
funds rate 50 basis points to 1 percent was broadly in line with market expectations
and elicited only a modest reaction in financial markets.3  However, economic data
releases that suggested a weaker outlook for growth and lower inflation than had been
anticipated, along with continued strains in financial markets that weighed on investor
sentiment, contributed to a sharp downward revision in the expected path of policy
over the period (Chart 3).  Responses to the Desk’s survey indicate that primary
dealers view a 50 basis point reduction in the target federal funds rate as the most
likely outcome at the upcoming meeting.  Reading policy expectations from federal
funds futures and options is not straightforward, as quotes on those instruments
reflect expectations that the effective federal funds rate will continue to average below
the target for a while (see box “Expected Softness in the Expected Federal Funds
Rate”).  Federal funds futures indicate that investors expect the effective federal funds
rate after the December meeting to be around 30 basis points.  Using our standard
assumption for term premiums, Eurodollar futures quotes suggest that investors
anticipate that the FOMC will begin gradually raising the target federal funds rate in
the summer of next year, with the rate expected to reach about 1.55 percent by the
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 11 of 60
Recent developments in the federal funds market
Trading conditions in the federal funds market over the intermeeting period were influenced 
by various factors including the rate paid on excess reserve balances (the excess rate), further 
increases in the level of reserve balances, the finalization of the FDIC’s Temporary Liquidity 
Guarantee (TLG) program, and, more recently, expectations of policy easing in December.
There have been some discernable effects of the excess rate on the federal funds market.  
Beginning November 6, the Board raised the excess rate to the lowest target rate in effect 
over the maintenance period.  After this change, brokered trades at near-zero rates 
essentially ceased and the share of federal funds trades brokered at rates below 25 basis 
points fell from 80 percent to 5 percent by the end of the month.  That said, most federal 
funds trades have still occurred at rates below the excess rate, with a significant portion of 
such trades involving sellers that were not eligible to receive interest on reserves.  While 
arbitrage by institutions eligible to receive interest on reserves could, in theory, support the 
funds rate, there are reportedly a number of impediments to this arbitrage.  Large-scale 
purchases of federal funds by eligible institutions could push their leverage ratios below 
desired levels.  Moreover, many sellers reportedly tightened their counterparty credit limits, 
limiting buyers’ ability to arbitrage.  Finally, prior to the release of the final rule for the 
FDIC’s TLG program on November 21, some buyers of federal funds were reluctant to 
arbitrage, given the possibility that they could face a 75-basis-point guarantee fee.  The 
effective rate edged up after the FDIC announced exclusion of federal funds borrowings 
with maturities of a month or less from coverage under the guarantee program.
However, once the current maintenance period encompassing the upcoming FOMC 
meeting began on December 4, the effective rate fell.  Evidently, market participants have 
been expecting a cut in the target rate—and thus the excess rate—of at least 50 basis points.  
In addition, the level of excess reserve balances has increased further, reflecting the 
expansion of the Federal Reserve’s liquidity programs and the runoff of the Treasury’s 
Supplementary Financing Program.  Against this backdrop, the share of federal funds trades 
brokered at near-zero rates jumped, and brokered volumes dropped to $70 billion, a level 
well below the average in recent years.
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 12 of 60
Expected Softness in the Effective Federal Funds Rate
Federal funds have traded appreciably below (or “soft to”) the target in recent weeks, and 
market participants are likely expecting that this will continue to be the case after the 
December FOMC meeting, given the large amount of excess reserves currently in the 
financial system.  Consequently, rates implied by federal funds futures, which settle on 
monthly averages of the effective rate, probably reflect continued expectations for softness, 
in addition to anticipated changes in the target rate at the December meeting.
Disentangling anticipated softness in the effective rate after the December meeting and 
expectations for the federal funds rate target established at that meeting is a complicated task
for at least two reasons.  First, the scope for softness in the funds rate relative to the target 
could begin to be constrained by the zero bound on nominal interest rates.  And second, 
further increases in reserve balances associated with the expansion of liquidity programs or 
the runoff of Treasury balances under the Supplementary Financing Program could exert 
additional downward pressure on the funds rate relative to the target rate.
One simple way to isolate expected softness over the very near term is to assume that 
market expectations are equal to those of the primary dealers surveyed by the Desk.  The 
table below to the left shows the probabilities assigned by primary dealers in the December 8
survey to various target rates after the December meeting.  These probabilities imply that the 
dealers expect the target rate to be lowered to 50 basis points at the December meeting.  
Since the expected effective rate implied by federal funds futures after the December 
meeting is about 30 basis points, this target rate prediction suggests that market participants 
expect the effective rate to average about 20 basis points below the target in late December.  
An alternative market-based approach is to look at basis swaps between the prime rate and 
the effective federal funds rate.  Assuming that the prime rate will continue to be set at a 
level 3 percentage points above the target rate, one can construct an implied path for the 
target funds rate as shown in column 1 of the table at the bottom right.  Comparing this 
path with the path for the effective funds rate implied by OIS rates (column 2) provides a 
measure of expected softness (column 3).  Although liquidity in this basis swap market is 
somewhat limited, these calculations suggest that funds rate softness is expected to persist 
over the next few months but to become less pronounced over time.

end of 2010.  However, given the heightened uncertainty about the economic and
financial outlook, term premiums may be larger than usual, which would imply that
investors are expecting less policy tightening.
(11) In response to the downward revision in the expected policy path and the
significantly weaker economic outlook, yields on nominal Treasury securities fell
substantially over the intermeeting period amid reports of strong safe-haven flows.
Market expectations that the Federal Reserve may begin purchasing longer-term
Treasury securities also appeared to push long-term yields lower, especially following
the Chairman’s speech on December 1 in which he pointed to the possibility of
substantial purchases of Treasury or agency securities in open market operations.  On
net, off-the-run two-year Treasury yields fell 95 basis points to 0.55 percent, while off-
the-run ten-year yields dropped 130 basis points to 3.15 percent; the on-the-run ten-
year Treasury yield dropped as low as 2.54 percent, its lowest level in more than four
decades.  TIPS-based inflation compensation over the next five years declined 50
basis points, while inflation compensation five to ten years ahead fell 90 basis points.
Although these declines occurred amid sharp decreases in inflation measures and
energy prices, they were likely amplified by poor liquidity conditions in TIPS and
nominal Treasury markets.  In contrast, comparable measures of inflation
compensation obtained from inflation swaps were little changed on net, over the
intermeeting period.  Near-term expectations for inflation from the Reuters/Michigan
and Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank surveys decreased, consistent with the further
drop in oil prices, while long-term expectations were unchanged.  Primary dealers
surveyed by the desk lowered their forecasts notably for core PCE inflation in 2009
but left their long-run forecasts for CPI inflation about the same.
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 15 of 60
Capital Markets
(12) As financial market conditions worsened, investors seemed to grow more
concerned about the likelihood of a deep and prolonged recession.  Stock prices of
financial corporations fell notably, while broad equity indexes declined, on net, amid
very high volatility (Chart 4).  Led by large profit reductions in the financial sector,
operating earnings per share for S&P 500 firms in the third quarter came in about 20
percent below year-earlier levels.  For nonfinancial firms, earnings per share rose
about 10 percent, owing almost entirely to gains by firms in the oil and gas industry.
Looking ahead, analysts marked down substantially their projections for earnings over
the coming year for both financial and nonfinancial firms, with double-digit declines
in year-over-year profitability now expected for the fourth quarter in nearly every
sector.  The spread between the twelve-month forward trend earnings-price ratio for
S&P 500 firms, and the long-term Treasury yield—a rough gauge of the equity risk
premium—continued to be exceptionally elevated.  Option-implied volatility of the
S&P 500 remained near its recent record levels.
(13) Conditions in corporate debt markets tightened further over the period.
Risk spreads on BBB-rated and speculative-grade bonds soared and risk spreads on
higher-rated bonds remained extremely elevated.  CDS spreads on investment-grade
and speculative-grade corporate bonds widened further.  Gross issuance of bonds by
nonfinancial investment-grade companies continued at a solid pace, but issuance of
junk bonds remained at zero.  Issuance of leveraged syndicated loans remained
extremely weak.
(14) To help reduce the cost and increase the availability of residential mortgage
credit, the Federal Reserve announced on November 25 a program to purchase up to
$100 billion in direct obligations of housing-related government-sponsored
enterprises (GSEs) and up to $500 billion in MBS backed by Fannie Mae, Freddie
Mac, and Ginnie Mae.  Agency debt spreads, which had widened early in the period,

narrowed sharply on the announcement.  Subsequent purchases of agency debt by the
Desk were well received and led to a further reduction in agency spreads.  On net
over the period, agency debt spreads narrowed 35 basis points while option-adjusted
spreads on agency MBS declined about 110 basis points.  Likely reflecting in part
these developments, conditions in the primary residential mortgage market improved.
The interest rate on 30-year fixed-rate conforming mortgages declined, on net, about
(15) To address the tightening of credit conditions for consumers and small
businesses, the Federal Reserve also announced on November 25 the creation of the
TALF to support the markets for ABS collateralized by student loans, auto loans,
credit card loans, and loans guaranteed by the Small Business Administration (SBA).4
The facility is expected to be operational by February of next year, and discussions
with market participants about operational details of this facility are ongoing.
(16) In the municipal bond market, issuance of longer-term municipal bonds
continued to rebound in November from the low levels of the past couple of months
even as yield ratios relative to Treasuries continued to surge.  Anecdotal reports
suggest that the upward moves in yields may owe in part to supply pressures as states
and localities seek to refinance their variable-rate demand notes through the issuance
of long-term debt.  The credit quality of municipal bonds deteriorated further, on net,
over the period, likely placing further upward pressure on yields.

Foreign Developments
(17) Foreign financial markets continued to fluctuate amid mounting concerns
about the ongoing global recession, but movements in equity prices and exchange
rates moderated somewhat relative to developments over the preceding few months.
Faced with clear evidence of a slowdown in activity and a rapid waning of inflationary
pressures, central banks around the world eased policy sharply.  The Bank of England
lowered its base rate by a total of 250 basis points, the European Central Bank by 125
basis points, and the Swiss National Bank by a total of 200 basis points.  The Bank of
Japan reduced its target for the overnight call rate by 20 basis points, to 30 basis
points.  A number of central banks in emerging market economies also eased policy,
most prominently the People’s Bank of China, which cut its main policy rate from
requirements.  The announcement on October 29 of new reciprocal swap lines with

(18) Reflecting prospects for lower inflation and accommodative monetary
policy for an extended period, ten-year nominal sovereign bond yields, which had
been relatively little changed over the previous intermeeting period, dropped sharply
in foreign industrial economies, as they did in the United States (Chart 5).  Equity
indexes in the foreign industrial economies, which suffered very large drops in the
previous period, were mixed, declining in many euro area economies and Canada but
rising in Japan and the United Kingdom.  Equity indexes rose in most emerging
markets, in many cases registering double-digit percent increases.  Sovereign credit
spreads were volatile and remained elevated over the past month.

net, since the October FOMC meeting.  Gains against some currencies—especially a

little changed on net against the renminbi; an unusual downtick in the value of the
renminbi late in the period, however, spurred concerns that the Chinese government
may be planning to guide the currency lower to help boost exports.
Debt and Money
(20) The debt of the domestic nonfinancial sectors is estimated to have
expanded at about a 7¼ percent annual rate in the third quarter, somewhat slower
than reported in the previous Bluebook, but still notably faster than the pace seen
earlier this year (Chart 6).  The strength in overall debt growth owes to a surge in
borrowing by the federal government related to the Supplementary Financing
Program and the TARP.  In the nonfinancial business sector, borrowing slowed in the
third quarter from its pace earlier in the year.  After a sharp increase during the period
of severe financial turmoil in October, when businesses reportedly drew down back-
up lines of credit at banks, borrowing appears to have fallen back in November.
Household debt is now estimated to have contracted in the third quarter, reflecting a
likely reduction in home mortgages amid continuing declines in house prices.
(21) Commercial bank credit exhibited broad weakness in November.
Commercial and industrial (C&I) loans declined slightly in November following a
surge in October.  According to the November Survey of Terms of Business Lending,
the average spread on C&I loans—adjusted for changes in nonprice loan terms—
increased 25 basis points to its highest level since early 2004, and spreads on higher-
risk loans that were not made under previous commitment increased sharply.  Growth
in consumer loans also tailed off in November, and residential real estate loans
continued to decline.  Moreover, loans drawn under home equity lines of credit,
which had expanded briskly since mid-2007, slowed last month.  Banks have reported

tightening lending standards in the Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey for some
time.  The tightening of lending standards no doubt contributed to the 6 percent drop
(at an annual rate) in the amount of total lending commitments--the sum of total
outstanding loans and unused commitments--in the third quarter, which represents
the largest decrease in that series since the data on unused commitments became
available in the second quarter of 1990.
(22) M2 expanded at an 8½ percent annual rate in November, a significant
slowdown from the pace of the previous month.  Retail money funds contracted
somewhat after a surge in October that reflected safe-haven inflows to Treasury-only
funds.  The growth of small time deposits slowed somewhat, although their rate of
expansion remained quite rapid as banks continued to bid aggressively for these
deposits.  Liquid deposits showed a moderate expansion in November.  Flows into
demand deposits, which are covered by the FDIC’s new Temporary Liquidity
Guarantee Program, were significant and apparently reflected shifts out of savings
accounts as well as a redirection of funds by banks’ customers away from other
money market instruments, given their extremely low interest rates.  Currency growth
remained strong, likely because of continued solid foreign demand for U.S.

Economic Outlook
(23) The staff has again revised down sharply its outlook for economic activity.
Conditions in the labor market have deteriorated more steeply than previously
thought, the decline in industrial production has intensified, consumer and business
spending have dropped further, and financial conditions, on balance, appear to have
tightened again.  As a consequence, the staff forecast now assumes that the federal
funds rate target will be lowered to ½ percent at this meeting and to ¼ percent early
next year, where it stays for the remainder of the forecast period.  Long-term Treasury
yields drift up over the forecast horizon from a level that is more than a percentage
point lower than in October, as the heavy demand for safe assets moderates when
economic activity begins to improve later next year, and as the ten-year window for
the Treasury yield extends further beyond the period of very low short-term interest
rates anticipated for the next few years.  Corporate bond yields decline over the
forecast period, as economic conditions eventually improve and risk aversion abates.
Mortgage rates, which declined a bit less than Treasury yields over the intermeeting
period, drop further to about 5 percent—nearly a percentage point lower than in the
October forecast.  Equity prices rise at an annual rate of about 12 percent from a level
that is approximately 9 percent lower than in October.  The foreign exchange value of
the dollar is flat in 2009 and declines about 3 percent in 2010.  Oil prices, which have
dropped about $29 per barrel over the intermeeting period, rise in line with futures
quotes to around $65 by the end of 2010, a level $20 per barrel lower than in October.
The staff forecast also assumes that a large fiscal stimulus package, amounting to
about $500 billion, is approved by the Congress early in 2009.
(24) Against this backdrop, real GDP is expected to fall at an annual rate of
remainder of 2009 and in 2010, the economy is forecast to recover slowly.  Amid the
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 24 of 60
weaker outlook for GDP growth, the unemployment rate is anticipated to rise to
and 3½ percentage points above the staff’s estimate of the NAIRU.  Increased slack
in resource utilization, diminished pressures from energy and materials prices, a
decline in import prices, and some reduction in inflation expectations lead to a further
projected moderation in core PCE inflation from 2 percent this year to 1 percent in
and 1 percent in 2010.
Monetary Policy Strategies
(25) As indicated in Chart 7, the Greenbook-consistent measure of short-run r*
now stands at -3½  percent, about 30 basis points lower than in the October
Bluebook.  The further decline in r* over the intermeeting period primarily reflects the
continued decline in equity prices and the widening of credit spreads, as well as the
weakness of incoming data on the labor market, motor vehicle sales, consumer
spending, industrial production, and business sentiment.  Financial and economic
developments also explain an extremely steep drop in the estimate of short-run r*
obtained from the small structural model.  This measure has moved down about 3¾
percentage points since the last Bluebook to about -6¾ percent.5  The estimate of
short-run r* from the FRB/US model has fallen 1 percentage point since the previous
Bluebook and is now around -6¼  percent.  The estimates of short-run r* span a wide
interval, but all except the single-equation estimate are well below the current level of
the actual real federal funds rate.

(26) Chart 8 depicts optimal control simulations of the FRB/US model using the
long-run staff forecast.6  In these simulations it is assumed that, in view of potential
adverse effects of very low interest rates on financial markets and institutions, the
Committee would not wish to lower the target federal funds rate below 25 basis
points.7  For an inflation goal of either 1½ percent or 2 percent (the left-hand and
right-hand sets of charts, respectively), the optimal control simulations prescribe a
trajectory for the nominal federal funds rate that hits the lower bound early in 2009
and remains there through 2013, before tightening shortly thereafter.  Absent a lower
bound to short-term nominal interest rates, the optimal policy would have required a
much larger reduction in the nominal federal funds rate, on the order of 5 percentage
points in 2009.  Under either inflation goal, the unemployment rate is significantly
higher for the next few years than in the October Bluebook, rising above 8 percent at
the end of 2009 and remaining above the NAIRU through 2012; the path of core
inflation is 40 to 80 basis points lower than in the October Bluebook, staying below 1
percent from 2010 onwards, reflecting the much weaker current and projected state of
aggregate demand, as well as recent declines in prices of oil and other commodities.
These optimal control simulations illustrate how the zero lower bound limits
conventional monetary policy:  With inflation falling rapidly while the nominal federal
funds rate is constrained to a level close to zero, the real interest rates increase, and
the corresponding tightening exacerbates weakness in activity and the rise in
unemployment.  The Bluebook box, “Implications of Nonconventional Policies for
Optimal Monetary Policy,” provides an illustration of how nonstandard policy actions
could alter the optimal policy path.
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 27 of 60
Implications of Unconventional Policies for Optimal Monetary Policy
Given the severe deterioration in the economic outlook 
since the last Bluebook, the optimal control simulations  
presented in the current Bluebook show the federal funds  
rate falling to its lower bound early next year and remaining 
there beyond 2012.  These simulations presume that the  
channels of the monetary transmission mechanism are  
operating normally; but, as the solid lines in the figures  
illustrate, the lower bound imposes a considerable  
constraint on the ability of the optimal policy to provide  
enough stimulus to generate a robust recovery with  
a relatively quick return of inflation and unemployment  
to desired levels.
This baseline policy exercise assumes that the Federal  
Reserve does not undertake unconventional policies  
beyond those already incorporated in the Greenbook  
forecast.  However, the exercise can be revised to take  
account of the estimated effects of a variety of  
unconventional monetary policy tools, including  
quantitative easing, targeted purchases of specific  
securities, and communication strategies aimed at  
influencing policy expectations.  Combining conventional 
optimal policy adjustments with these nontraditional policy 
responses should yield better outcomes for activity and  
inflation.1
To illustrate such a possibility, the dashed red lines in the 
Figures show the effects on the optimal policy path and  
Economic   outcomes of assuming that the Federal Reserve 
engages   in more sustained nontraditional policy actions.  
In this particular simulation, it is assumed that the  
implementation of such a policy package would lower the  
level of nominal long-term interest rates —including  
Treasury rates, mortgage rates, and corporate bond rates— 
by about 100 basis points from 2009 to 2012, and 50 basis  
points  in 2013, relative to what would occur under conventional  
optimal policy.
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 28 of 60
Implications of Unconventional Policies for Optimal Monetary Policy (Cont.)
The reduction in long-term rates boosts aggregate spending directly; it also provides further 
indirect stimulus through higher corporate equity prices and a lower foreign exchange value  
of the dollar.  In response, the unemployment rate runs ¼ to ½ percentage point below  
its path under conventional policy, and inflation does not fall quite as much.  These more 
favorable macroeconomic conditions, in turn, allow optimal monetary policy to begin to 
tighten at the end of 2012.
The economic effects of this particular example of unconventional policies are modest, but 
the estimates are subject to considerable uncertainty.  First, it is possible that aggressive 
actions could, by easing investor concerns about the outlook, lower long-term private interest 
rates by even more than 100 basis points, although the degree of substitutability across 
Treasury and private securities is uncertain and smaller effects are also possible.  Second, these 
results are based on a model in which only financial variables respond directly to 
announcements about future policies; larger stimulative effects might be obtained if the 
expectations influencing spending decisions and wage-price setting, and not just those 
influencing financial markets, also responded fully to the implications of the nontraditional 
policy actions for future economic conditions.  Third, more pronounced results might be 
possible if the nontraditional policy actions were paired with a major fiscal stimulus.
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 29 of 60
(27) As depicted in Chart 9, the outcome-based policy rule prescribes a funds
rate that drops to the 25-basis-point lower bound by 2009Q1 and stays there through
the funds rate consistent with financial market quotes declines to below 0.50 percent
during the first half of 2009 before rising to a plateau of about 2¼ percent starting in
from financial markets indicates that investors see a relatively high likelihood of policy
tightening by the end of 2009.9  As shown in the bottom panel of Chart 9, the near-
term prescriptions from both the 1993 and 1999 versions of the Taylor rules are
significantly lower than those shown in the previous Bluebook, reflecting the weaker
path for output and lower projected levels of inflation.  The 1993 Taylor rule
prescribes setting the funds rate about 1½ percentage point lower than in October;
both the first-difference rule and the 1999 Taylor rule prescribe setting the funds rate
at its lower bound.  The near-term prescriptions from the 1993 Taylor rule are slightly
higher than for the other rules because the 1999 Taylor rule and the first difference
rule are a bit more sensitive to the output gap.

Policy Alternatives
(28) This Bluebook presents four alternatives for the Committee’s consideration,
summarized by the draft statements on the following pages.  In view of the sharp
deterioration in the economic outlook, the proximity of the zero lower bound on
nominal interest rates, and the unconventional policy actions that have already been
announced, the content and structure of the proposed alternatives differ substantially
from previous Bluebooks.  Under Alternative A, the Committee decides not to set a
target for the federal funds rate, states that it anticipates that weak economic
conditions are likely to warrant funds rates near zero for some time, and makes clear
that its main policy tool going forward will be actions that make use of the Federal
Reserve’s balance sheet.  Under Alternative B, the Committee instead announces a
target range for the federal funds rate of 0 to ¼ percent and states that it will use all
available tools to promote the resumption of sustainable economic growth and price
stability.  Under Alternative C, the target rate is cut 50 basis points to ½ percent and
the possibility of a further downward adjustment, should conditions warrant, is left
open.  Under Alternative D, the federal funds rate target is left unchanged at
economic growth over time; as in Alternative C, the possibility of future policy easing
is left open.  In view of the large amounts of reserves being provided by the Federal
Reserve’s various liquidity facilities, Alternatives C and D recognize that federal funds
may trade below the target rate for at least some time.  All four alternatives
acknowledge that economic activity appears to have slowed further since the last
FOMC meeting.  Alternatives A, B, and C note that the Committee expects inflation
to moderate in coming months and even sees some risk that inflation could drop
below levels consistent with price stability; Alternative D uses the same language on
inflation as the October statement.  To make clear that adjusting the funds rate is not
the Federal Reserve’s only policy tool in a world of very low interest rates, all four

alternatives point to the recent announcements that the Federal Reserve will purchase
large volumes of agency debt and mortgage-backed securities and will implement the
Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF).  Alternatives A, B, and C also
explicitly refer to the possibility of further using the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet to
support financial markets and economic activity, including by purchasing Treasury
(29)   If the Committee agrees that the economic outlook has deteriorated
significantly since the October meeting and thinks that substantial monetary stimulus
will be needed to support a recovery in economic activity, it may be inclined to favor
Alternative A or Alternative B.  Members may be disappointed by a forecast, such as
the one presented in this Greenbook, in which economic activity contracts severely
this quarter and in the first half of next year and recovers only slowly after that, even
with a federal funds rate at 25 basis points through 2010 and with substantial fiscal
stimulus.  Accordingly, Committee members may feel that even stronger policy action
than what is assumed in the Greenbook will be necessary to promote a return to
sustainable economic growth.  Regarding the outlook for inflation, the Committee
may be concerned that the projected sharp contraction in economic activity, coupled
with the striking ongoing decline in the prices of energy and other commodities, may
cause inflation to fall to an uncomfortably low level, perhaps even lower than
projected in the staff forecast (as in the “Lower Inflation” alternative scenario in the
Greenbook).  In these circumstances, Committee members may thus wish to take a
bold action at this meeting to counter the risk of deflation, and they may also want to
presage further expansions of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet.
(30) Against this backdrop, the Committee may decide not to announce a target
for the federal funds rate at this meeting and signal instead that its focus has shifted to
the use of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet as an especially important policy tool
going forward, as in Alternative A.  The Federal Reserve’s balance sheet has already
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 39 of 60
expanded considerably in recent months and will continue to expand in the immediate
future as the Federal Reserve begins to purchase agency debt and mortgage-backed
securities in volume, as already announced, and as the TALF becomes operational.
Federal funds have often traded below 50 basis points since the October meeting
even with the current target of 1 percent.  In the last week, with the anticipation of
further policy easing at this meeting, federal funds have traded persistently below
towards balance sheet management as essentially already under way.  Committee
members may also be mindful that announcing a target that is not possible to achieve
may create the impression that Federal Reserve policy is ineffective, even though
powerful tools remain at the Committee’s disposal to address the deteriorating
economic and financial situation.
(31) One such tool is communication.  As incorporated in the third paragraph of
Alternative A, the Committee could explicitly state that it anticipates that short-term
interest rates will remain low for some time.   Members may be reluctant to enter into
an unconditional commitment because they may feel that such a commitment would
be too constraining should they need to tighten policy sooner than now expected.  To
mitigate this concern, the Committee could phrase the commitment in implicitly
conditional terms by indicating its anticipation that “weak economic conditions are
likely to warrant federal funds rates near zero for some time,” as suggested in the
statement accompanying Alternative A.10  In addition, if members were concerned
that even increased use of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet as a policy tool and a
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 40 of 60
commitment to keep interest rates low for some time might not be sufficient to
counter deflationary pressures, the Committee could explicitly state, as indicated in
the bracketed sentence, that it will seek to achieve a rate of inflation of about
inflation expectations, in turn, would reduce real interest rates and so support
economic activity.
(32) The statement suggested for Alternative A begins by acknowledging the
further weakening of the outlook for economic activity rather than with a sentence
about the federal funds rate.  This departure from the standard structure of the
FOMC statement is intended both to emphasize that the focus of the Committee has
shifted away from the target federal funds rate and to provide a clear rationale for that
shift.  The second paragraph notes the weakening of inflationary pressures and the
risk that inflation could decline for a time below rates that best foster economic
growth and price stability.  As noted above, members may wish to conclude that
paragraph with the sentence, “In support of its dual mandate, the Committee will seek
to achieve a rate of inflation, as measured by the price index of personal consumption
expenditures, of about 2 percent in the medium term.”  By using the words “seek to
achieve” and “in the medium term,” the Committee would acknowledge that it may
not be possible to maintain inflation at the desired level over the specified period, but
the statement would nonetheless signal the Committee’s policy objective.  If members
were uncomfortable with taking such a step at this meeting, they could simply omit
that sentence from the statement.  The third paragraph notes the Committee’s
decision not to set a specific target for the federal funds rate, acknowledges that the
federal funds rate has already declined to very low levels, and states the expectations
that federal funds rate will remain near zero for some time.  The statement goes on in
paragraph 4 to indicate a shift of the Committee’s focus from the target rate to the use
of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet.  That paragraph repeats a number of measures
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 41 of 60
that have already been announced but not (or only partially) implemented, thereby
emphasizing that a number of unconventional policy actions are already forthcoming,
and foreshadows the possibility that the Federal Reserve will purchase longer-term
Treasury securities if conditions warrant.  The intention to continue to actively
consider policies that employ the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet is also explicitly
stated in order to clarify that other tools could also be used if needed to support credit
markets and economic activity.
(33) While expectations of next week’s policy action are difficult to discern from
market quotes because of the continued expected softness in the federal funds rate,
the Desk’s survey suggests that most primary dealers see a 50 basis point reduction in
the target federal funds rate as the most likely outcome of the December meeting, and
that a majority sees ½ percent as the trough for the target federal funds rate this cycle.
As a result, a decision to move away from interest rate targeting and to let federal
funds fluctuate somewhere in the vicinity of the zero bound will likely surprise
investors.  Short-term interest rates will decline, but probably not by much,
considering that they are already very low and that federal funds are already trading at
rates well below ¼ percent.  Stock prices may rise if investors read the decision to
move away from targeting the level of the federal funds rate and concentrate on use
of the balance sheet as underscoring the Federal Reserve’s determination to promote
a rapid return to sustainable economic growth.  The foreign exchange value of the
dollar will likely decline somewhat.  Judging from the Desk’s survey, some market
participants may be surprised by the reference to unconventional policies in the
statement.  And the indication that the federal funds rate could remain near zero for
some time could lead investors to mark down their expected path for policy in 2009
and beyond.  As a result of these influences, longer-term interest rates should move
lower, although the size of that decline may be muted because the purchases of
agency and mortgage-backed securities have already been announced and the
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 42 of 60
Chairman raised the possibility of purchases of large quantities of Treasury securities
in a recent speech.
(34) If the Committee shares the staff view that the economic outlook has
deteriorated markedly and thinks that, given the circumstances, moving the federal
funds rate near the zero bound on nominal interest rates is desirable, but it wants to
continue to provide an explicit target for the federal funds rate, then it might choose
to establish a target range of 0 to ¼ percent as in Alternative B.  Continuing to set a
target that encompasses very low federal funds rates would not compromise the
Committee’s ability to resort to unconventional policy measures.  In addition, some
members may be concerned that switching to the use of the Federal Reserve’s balance
sheet as its main policy tool could delay a return to a more conventional monetary
policy based on interest rate targeting because some unconventional policy measures
(such as the purchases of long-term assets) may not be easy or cheap to unwind
quickly.  Consequently, members may feel that maintaining a target range, however
low, could be desirable because it may make a return to more traditional monetary
policy simpler and more straightforward once economic and financial conditions
improve.  In addition, Committee members may see the maintenance of a federal
funds target as advantageous from a governance perspective, since the determination
of the target rate is a prerogative of the Committee, whereas the Committee and the
Board both have separate authorities that can be used to affect the composition and
size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet.
(35) Achieving exactly a zero effective federal funds rate may be impossible since
there would be no incentive for depository institutions to sell funds without
compensation.  It may even be undesirable, given the strains that it could put on some
financial institutions and financial markets.  On the other hand, members may feel
that the direct monetary stimulus obtained by bringing the target rate to a very low
but positive level, along with the increased flexibility thereby provided to use
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 43 of 60
nonconventional policy actions, outweighs the associated costs.  As in Alternative A,
the Committee may also be concerned that the sharp contraction in economic activity
and the steep declines in the prices of energy and other commodities may cause
inflation to fall to an uncomfortably low level.  In such circumstances, conditional on
their desire to maintain a federal funds rate target, Committee members may prefer to
make that target as low as possible immediately, rather than making a more gradual
adjustment, to counter the risk of further severe deterioration in economic and
financial conditions.
(36) The rationale section of the statement under Alternative B begins by noting
the recent deterioration in economic conditions and in the outlook for economic
activity.  The statement is also explicit as to the reduction in inflationary pressures and
economic growth and price stability in the longer term.  The fourth paragraph makes
clear the intention to use all tools at the Committee’s disposal to promote the
resumption of sustainable economic growth and to preserve price stability.  Some of
these tools—the already announced purchases of agency debt and mortgage-backed
securities, the possible expansion of those purchases, the possibility of beginning to
purchase longer-term Treasury securities, the implementation of the TALF, and the
possible expansion of other types of liquidity provision and other means of using the
Federal Reserve’s balance sheet—are also noted.
(37) Given that most market participants appear to expect only a 50 basis point
reduction in the target at this meeting, a decision to reduce it instead by at least
apparently anticipate that the target will be brought down to ¼ percent at the January
meeting.  As a result, nominal interest rates would likely decline a little, stock prices
may increase some, and the foreign exchange value of the dollar may decline
modestly.  As in Alternative B, market participants may also be surprised by the
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 44 of 60
reference to unconventional policy measures, and medium- and long-term Treasury
yields might edge lower.
(38) The Committee may prefer Alternative C for a number of reasons.
Members may feel that a substantial policy easing at this meeting is warranted in
response to the sharp deterioration of the economic outlook in recent weeks.  A
considering that policy has been eased substantially over the last year, that a number
of extraordinary liquidity measures have been put in place or are in train, and that
mortgage rates have already dropped appreciably in light of the Federal Reserve’s
recently announced program to purchase agency debt and mortgage-backed securities.
The Committee may wish to give the stimulus produced by the combination of all
these policies a chance to show its effects, while at the same time leaving open the
possibility of a further reduction in the target rate and the implementation of more
unconventional policy actions should macroeconomic conditions fail to improve.  A
reduction in the target rate to ½ percent that is matched by a comparable reduction in
the interest rate on excess reserves would likely cause federal funds to trade below the
new target.  Even so, the Committee may still want to set a target of ½ percent to
signal where it would want federal funds to trade once financial conditions begin to
improve, some Federal Reserve programs are unwound, and the amount of excess
reserves in the system returns to a more normal level.
(39) Alternatively, members may feel that quite forceful policy action is required
to counter the sharp deterioration in the economic outlook but at the same time be
unwilling to lower the target rate below 50 basis points.  Members’ reluctance to move
to an extremely low target federal funds rate may stem from concerns about the
potential for adverse consequences on various financial markets and institutions that
such a move could engender.  Such a concern may be reinforced by the likelihood that
federal funds will trade below the new target until improved financial conditions allow
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 45 of 60
a substantial reduction in excess reserves in the financial system.  Members may also
be worried that a very low target for the federal funds rate may itself lead to
undesirable increases in inflation expectations.  The Committee may thus view
½ percent as a floor for the target federal funds rate and may wish to apply any
further monetary stimulus exclusively through unconventional policies, such as
purchases of agency and mortgage-backed securities or Treasury securities.
(40) As a third motivation for favoring Alternative C, members may view a
decision to reduce the target rate by 50 basis points as an intermediate step towards
reaching a level of rates closer to the zero bound at a later date.  Such an approach
would be consistent with the staff’s assumption in the Greenbook projection, the
prescriptions of a number of policy rules, and the optimal control simulations with an
inflation target of either 1½ or 2 percent described in the monetary policy strategies
section of this Bluebook.   Even if members are not concerned that a sustained
environment of very low interest rates will be particularly harmful to certain financial
markets and institutions, they may still believe that making the move toward the zero
bound in two steps would be preferable on the grounds that it would allow market
participants more time to adjust to a world of near-zero interest rates.  In addition, the
Committee may feel that such a gradual approach would not be overly costly in terms
of its macroeconomic objectives since further monetary stimulus could be provided
through additional unconventional policy measures.  Finally, an inclination to ease
policy 50 basis points at this meeting might be reinforced by the fact that most market
participants appear to expect a 50 basis point reduction in the target rate, and
Committee members might be reluctant to inject further uncertainty into financial
markets at a time when markets remain extremely fragile.
(41) The rationale section of the statement accompanying Alternative C begins
by acknowledging that economic activity is contracting in the fourth quarter and by
pointing to deterioration in labor markets, household and business spending, and
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 46 of 60
industrial production.  The paragraph on inflation reiterates, as in October, that the
Committee expects inflation to moderate because of the weaker economic outlook
and the decline in the prices of energy and other commodities, but also, as in
Alternatives A and B, that there are risks that inflation will fall to rates below those
that would best foster economic growth and price stability.  The next paragraph
makes clear that downside risks to the economy are the Committee’s primary concern
and indicates that the Committee “will use all its available tools to promote the
resumption of economic growth and to preserve price stability.”  This wording is
intended to leave the door open to, but not promise, a further reduction in the target
rate if conditions warrant, while at the same time making it clear that unconventional
policy actions are also available.  Some of these actions, including the possibility that
existing programs may be expanded or new programs may be implemented if
appropriate, are cited in the next paragraph.  If the Committee viewed Alternative C
as a stepping stone to an even lower target federal funds rate, it may wish to add a
sentence to signal more clearly to market participants that a further reduction in the
target rate may be forthcoming.  For example, the fourth paragraph of the statement
could conclude by saying that, “The Committee will consider whether further
reductions in the target federal funds rate would be beneficial in light of evolving
circumstances.”  On the other hand, if the Committee sees ½ percent as a floor below
which it is not likely to push the target rate, it may also wish to make its thinking more
explicit, for example by adding the clause “Although the Committee believes that
further reductions in the target federal funds rate would not be beneficial on balance”
immediately before the indication that the Committee will use all of its available tools
(which in this case would be referred to as “all other available tools”).  The statement
concludes with an acknowledgement that federal funds may trade below the target,
given the large amounts of excess reserves in the system.

(42) Since most primary dealers see a 50 basis point policy easing as the most
likely outcome at this meeting, and since a majority see ½ percent as the trough for
the target federal funds rate this cycle, the market reaction to an announcement like
that for Alternative C is likely to be muted, with short-term interest rates, equity
prices, and the foreign exchange value of the dollar all changing little.  The
movements in these variables may be a bit more pronounced if the Committee
decided to be more explicit regarding its proclivity to move the target rate lower in the
future because the uncertainty as to the floor for the target would be removed; any
such move, however, is not likely to be major, partly because market participants may
expect federal funds to trade quite soft to the target in any case.  As in Alternative B,
longer-term interest rates may decline a little, but probably not by much, because
investors may be somewhat surprised by the language on the use of the Federal
Reserve’s balance sheet as a means of further supporting credit markets and economic
(43) If the Committee’s view of the economic outlook is appreciably more
optimistic than the staff’s, and, in particular, if members believe that past policy
actions, along with those announced but not yet implemented, will be sufficient to
return the economy to a path of moderate economic growth before too long, the
Committee may wish to leave the target rate unchanged at this meeting as in
Alternative D.  Committee members may have a somewhat more upbeat outlook for
present recession, starting in the second half of next year, will be more robust than
anticipated by the staff, as in the “faster recovery” alternative scenario in the
Greenbook.  In addition, the Committee may think that the policy actions taken
recently not only by the Federal Reserve but also by other foreign central banks, the
Congress, the Treasury, and the FDIC (including the reduction in policy rates to very
low levels, purchases of agency debt and mortgage-backed securities, extraordinary
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 48 of 60
liquidity measures, official steps to strengthen the financial system, and fiscal stimulus)
should be given a chance to work, and that their combined effect could potentially be
very large.  Indeed members may be mindful that the extent and timing of some of
those policies, such as the fiscal package that will ultimately be passed by the
Congress, is still unknown.  The fiscal package may well turn out to be larger, or
implemented sooner, than currently assumed in the staff forecast.  (The “bigger fiscal
package” scenario in the Greenbook illustrates this possibility.)  With that upside risk
in mind, the Committee may want to pause at least at this meeting and see whether
the economy will show some signs of recovery as these policies begin to take effect.
The Committee may also anticipate that, although federal funds are likely to continue
to trade below target for a time because of the large amounts of excess reserves
currently in the system, an unchanged federal funds rate target provides a better signal
of its policy intentions.  The Committee may believe that, over time, existing liquidity
facilities can be scaled back or eliminated, allowing the federal funds rate to converge
back to its target level.  Alternatively, members may feel that bringing the target to an
unprecedented low level may increase uncertainty, further compromise market
functioning, decrease confidence, perhaps boost inflation expectations, and so
ultimately be counterproductive.  Members may also want to preserve some room to
lower the target rate at a later date in order to bolster confidence should further
negative shocks hit the economy.
(44) The rationale portion of the statement accompanying Alternative D
acknowledges that the pace of economic activity appears to have slowed further and
that the near-term outlook has deteriorated.  However, the statement notes that the
Committee expects the recent policy measures to improve credit conditions and
promote a return to moderate growth over time.  To underscore that the Federal
Reserve has already taken concrete actions in response to the deterioration in the
outlook, the remaining part of that paragraph notes that the Federal Reserve will
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 49 of 60
purchase large amounts of agency and mortgage-backed securities and will implement
the TALF early next year.  The language on inflation remains unchanged from the
October meeting, and the last paragraph acknowledges, as in Alternative C, that
federal funds may continue to trade below the target for some time.  The statement
concludes by noting that the Committee will monitor economic and financial
developments and will act as needed to promote its statutory objectives.  That
declaration, together with the indication of downside risks to the outlook, would likely
be seen as signaling that the Committee is open to further reduction in the target rate
at upcoming meetings if conditions warrant.
(45) Given current expectations, market participants would likely be extremely
surprised if the Committee were to leave the target rate unchanged.  Short-term
interest rates would probably back up somewhat, although the extent of the increase
would likely be moderated by recognition that federal funds would continue to trade
below target for some time.  Equity prices would drop, and the dollar would
appreciate.  The absence of any reference to additional means of using the Federal
Reserve balance sheet to improve credit and liquidity conditions would likely induce
investors to reconsider their views of the likelihood of further purchases of assets by
the Federal Reserve, and medium- and longer-term yields would probably move
notably higher.  Overall, volatility and strains in financial markets would likely
Money and Debt Forecasts
(46) The staff forecast for M2 has changed little since October.  After expanding
at a 7½ percent rate this year, boosted by the decline in short-term rates and the
associated drop in the opportunity cost of holding M2 assets, M2 growth is projected
to slow to about 3 percent in 2009 as nominal GDP growth falls and opportunity cost

begins to rise.  In 2010, M2 is anticipated to grow at roughly the same rate as in 2009
and about in line with nominal GDP.
(47) Amid sharply curtailed mortgage and consumer credit, household debt is
expected to decline about 1 percent in 2009 and to rise just a little in 2010 as credit
constraints ease only gradually.  Even though overall credit conditions are expected to
ease over time, nonfinancial business debt will likely expand at a weak pace next year
and in 2010, as capital spending will remain sluggish.  Federal debt, which has surged
in the second half of 2008 because of government programs aimed at addressing
financial market strains, is anticipated to continue to grow at a rapid pace throughout
the forecast period.  Overall, total domestic nonfinancial debt is projected to expand

Alternatives for the Directive
(48) Federal funds have traded predominantly around or below ½ percent since
the October meeting even with a target rate of 1 percent.  Given the provision of
large amounts of excess reserves through the liquidity programs that the Federal
Reserve has put in place in recent months, and with balance sheet constraints that
prevent many depository institutions from exploiting the arbitrage between low
federal funds rates and higher interest rates on excess reserves, the funds rate has
fallen well short of the target set by the Committee, as discussed in more detail in the
“Recent developments in the federal funds market” box.  As noted earlier, the
proposed statement for Alternatives C and D acknowledge that the same will likely be
true in the future, at least so long as the amount of excess reserves in the system
remains elevated.  If the Committee wanted to maintain a target, potential steps to
soak up excess reserves, short of drastically reducing the size of existing liquidity
facilities and currency swap agreements with foreign central banks—an option that
the Committee presumably would find unappealing—include, in principle, financing
existing and potential new liquidity facilities by issuing Federal Reserve bills or by
expanding the Special Financing Program (SFP) and thus the size of the Treasury
balance at the Federal Reserve.  However, the former measure would require
authorization by the Congress, and the Treasury is unlikely to take the latter step in
the near term because of possible debt-ceiling constraints.  Indeed, concerns about
the debt ceiling have led the Treasury to reduce over recent weeks the size of the SFP
and the associated balances placed at the Federal Reserve.  A possible alternative
would be for the Federal Reserve to offer depository institutions a term deposit
facility in which they could place funds for fixed periods of time and earn interest at a
rate above that paid on excess reserves.  Balances placed under this facility would not
count toward reserve requirements and could not be accessed before their maturity.
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 53 of 60
The staff has begun to develop plans for such a facility, but its likely effectiveness in
putting upward pressure on the federal funds rate is unclear.
(49) If the Committee wants to keep a target for the federal funds rate of either
½ percent as in Alternative C or 1 percent as in Alternative D, and agrees that the
options available to drain reserves from the system and enable the Desk to meet the
target are either unlikely to materialize or are likely to be otherwise undesirable, it may
wish to change the wording of its directive to the Desk to recognize that it does not
expect the target to be consistently met given the circumstances.  The Committee may
wish to include in the directive a sentence similar to that in the public statements that
will accompany the policy decisions and explicitly indicate that it recognizes that the
federal funds rate may tend to trade below the new target.  If it were to choose
Alternative C, the Committee may also want to direct the Desk to purchase
$100 billion in housing-related GSE debt and up to $500 billion in agency-guaranteed
MBS, as already announced, and to do so by the end of the second quarter of next
year to provide a more specific time frame than the “several quarters” indicated in the
November 25 press release.  Such a directive is not included under Alternative D
because if the Committee were optimistic enough about the outlook to select that
alternative, it might not want the desk to complete the full amount of the announced
(50) Under Alternative B, the Committee would direct the Desk to seek
conditions in reserve markets consistent with federal funds trading in a range of 0 to
¼ percent.  It may also want to direct the Desk to purchase GSE debt and agency-
guaranteed MBS over the next intermeeting period, but to leave the Desk ample
latitude to vary the timing and pace of such purchases depending on conditions in the
market for such securities and on broader mortgage market and housing sector
conditions.  The Committee may want to reiterate the limits that have already been
announced for such purchases.
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 54 of 60
(51) If the Committee decides not to set a target at all, as in Alternative A, it
could specify to the Desk that it has suspended setting a target and that it anticipates
that the reserve conditions associated with its open market operations and the
liquidity programs put in place by the Federal Reserve will result in federal funds rates
near zero.  It may also direct the desk to purchase GSE debt and agency-guaranteed
MBS over the next intermeeting period, as under Alternative B, and subject to the
same limits.
(52) Draft language for the directives is provided below.
Directive Wording
Alternative A:  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and
financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable
growth in output.  Over the intermeeting period, the Committee directs the
Desk to purchase GSE debt and agency-guaranteed MBS, with the aim of
providing support to the mortgage and housing markets.  The timing and pace
of these purchases should depend on conditions in the markets for such
securities and on a broader assessment of conditions in primary mortgage
markets and the housing sector.  By the end of the second quarter of next year,
the Desk is expected to purchase up to $100 billion in housing-related GSE
debt and up to $500 billion in agency-guaranteed MBS.  The Committee has
suspended setting a target for the federal funds rate, and it anticipates that the
reserve conditions associated with its open market operations and the liquidity
programs put in place by the Federal Reserve will result in federal funds rates
near zero.
Alternative B:  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and
financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 55 of 60
growth in output.  To further its long-run objectives, the Committee seeks
conditions in reserve markets consistent with federal funds trading in a range of
agency-guaranteed MBS during the intermeeting period with the aim of
providing support to the mortgage and housing markets.  The timing and pace
of these purchases should depend on conditions in the markets for such
securities and on a broader assessment of conditions in primary mortgage
markets and the housing sector.  By the end of the second quarter of next year,
the Desk is expected to purchase up to $100 billion in housing-related GSE
debt and up to $500 billion in agency-guaranteed MBS.
Alternative C:  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and
financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable
growth in output.  To further its long-run objectives, the Committee has
established a target for the federal funds rate of ½ percent.  In view of the large
volume of reserves provided by the Federal Reserve's various liquidity
programs, the Committee recognizes that the federal funds rate is likely to
average somewhat below the ½ percent target rate.  The Committee directs the
Desk to purchase GSE debt and agency-guaranteed MBS during the
intermeeting period with the aim of providing support to the mortgage and
housing markets.  The timing and pace of these purchases should depend on
conditions in the markets for such securities and on a broader assessment of
conditions in primary mortgage markets and the housing sector.  By the end of
the second quarter of next year, the Desk is expected to purchase up to
$100 billion in housing-related GSE debt and up to $500 billion in agency-
guaranteed MBS.

Alternative D:  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and
financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable
growth in output.  The Committee has maintained its target for the federal
funds rate at 1 percent, but in view of the large volume of reserves provided by
the Federal Reserve's various liquidity programs, the Committee recognizes that
the federal funds rate is likely to average somewhat below the 1 percent target
