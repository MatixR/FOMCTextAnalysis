Prefatory Note 
 
 
The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version available 
based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the Board 
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was created 
through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned 
versions text-searchable.2   Though a stringent quality assurance process was 
employed, some imperfections may remain. 
 
Please note that some material may have been redacted from this document if that

1  In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic 
format.  All scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced 
tilting) and lightly cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other 
blemishes caused after initial printing). 
 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optical character recognition computer program (OCR) 
first created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, 
staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.  Please note that the numbers and text in charts and

MONEY MARKET AND RESERVE RELATIONSHIPS
Recent developments
Bank credit expansion slackened markedly in the last three
statement weeks of August as measured by the proxy, although increasing
at a 17 per cent annual rate for the month on average (and 18½ per
cent, after including the rapid increase in Euro-dollar borrowings
in August). Outstanding business loans contracted sharply last month,
but banks' holdings of U.S. Government securities continued to rise
on balance. Until the last week in August weekly reporting banks
continued for the most part to be moderate net sellers of Treasury
bills following their massive increase in holdings in connection with
the large early July Treasury tax bill issue. However, holdings of
U.S. Government securities rebounded toward the end of August, as
banks participated heavily in the $2.5 billion Treasury cash financing
involving a 3½ year note with a 5-3/8 per cent coupon (that could be
paid for with full tax and loan credit) and purchased Treasury bills
in the market.
Generally, the U.S. Government's financing needs have been
the principal influence tending to enlarge bank credit expansion
during the past two months. Treasury debt offerings were reflected
not only in the investment and underwriting function of banks but also
in the position of Government security dealers. Dealers built up bill
positions in early July and generally maintained them at advanced levels

through August. Positions in coupon issues have fluctuated widely with
the recent Treasury refunding and cash financing. In view of uncertain-
ties as to the future course of interest rates, dealers were unusually
quick to dispose of the 15-month note obtained in the mid-August re-
funding, despite the large positive carry available with 5¼ per cent
coupon issue relative to borrowing costs that have frequently been
around 4 per cent.
Dealers have recently experienced a positive carry on
practically all Treasury issues in portfolio, with the exception of the
from domestic sources and from abroad, along with a usual seasonal
improvement in New York banks' basic reserve position, contributed to
an easing in the Federal funds and dealer loan markets. In the latter
part of August the Federal funds rate fell to a level generally below
level. In consequence, dealers relied increasingly on banks to finance
their positions, with more than three-fifths of dealer borrowings at
banks as compared with one-third a year ago August. In early September,
however, both Federal funds and dealer loan rates moved back to 4
per cent and above.
Banks were able to increase both their outstanding negotiable
CD's and their liabilities to foreign branches each by $600 million
further over the period from August 2 to August 30. The inflows of
such funds appeared larger to some banks than immediate loan demands

justified, even with the mid-September tax date and potential CD run-
offs approaching, and there were recent reductions in rates on CD's
maturing within three months by a few major banks. During the first
week of September outstanding CD's declined markedly at New York City
On average in August all time and savings deposits at com-
mercial banks rose at a 17.5 per cent annual rate, while the money
supply rose by 8 per cent. The private money supply showed no growth
in the last half of August, even though U.S. Government deposits declined
during the last three weeks of the month.
In support of the August expansion in total deposits, total
reserves rose at a 12 per cent annual rate, somewhat less than the
expansion in required reserves, as banks economized to a degree on
excess reserves. The 3-month bill rate fluctuated in a 4.15 - 4.45
per cent range since the last meeting of the Committee, and such a
relatively high level of rates may have induced some banks to move, at
the margin, out of Federal funds into bills. During the four statement
weeks ending September 6, member bank borrowings averaged $75 million
and free reserves $283 million, little changed from the previous four

Prospective developments
Maintenance of prevailing money market conditions over the
next three weeks would appear to encompass a Federal funds rate averaging
$100 million, and free reserves between $200 and $300 million. The
approaching September tax date is not expected to generate any sizable
problems, but, as the basic reserve deficiencies of major reporting
banks enlarge, it will be a factor adding at the margin to market
pressures and tending to forestall the re-emergence of Federal funds
and dealer loan rates as low as in late August.
The 3-month bill rate could decline toward the lower end of
the indicated range because of the attractive maturity dates around
the mid-December tax period and year-end for such bills to be auctioned
in the period immediately ahead. There might also be some downward
CONFIDENTIAL (FR) -5- September 8, 1967.
pressure on bill rates generally because the auto strike may reduce
some short-term credit demands from, say, finance companies. However,
the market impact of the work stoppage is likely to be minor so long
as it is limited to one firm.
As an offset to such downward tendencies, dealer bill positions
are relatively high, and bill rates normally show a seasonal rise in
September. The System will not be a buyer in the market until late
September and early October, when System security purchases might
exceed $1 billion. At around that time, however, it is likely that
the market will be focusing on Treasury cash needs in October; current
market expectations appear to be for a $4 - $5 billion Treasury tax
bill financing later in October. In general, the course of bill rates
will be strongly influenced by the strength of demand for bills from
businesses and banks; such demands could be substantial so long as
business loan demand from banks remains quite moderate, as currently
expected, and as corporations rebuild the liquid assets that were depleted
in making the large second quarter tax payments.
It is not expected that banks will aggressively offer negotiable
CD's in the weeks immediately ahead. We are assuming a CD run-off of
$300 - $500 million in September. CD's maturing in September total
$5.1 billion, slightly less than last year, but considerably more than
in 1965. Corporate income tax payments, projected at $4.3 billion, in
September are about the same as in the last two years, but payments to
the Treasury of withheld personal income and social security taxes are
CONFIDENTIAL (FR) -6- September 8, 1967.
projected higher than in the preceding two years. These statistical
comparisons suggest a moderate CD run-off in September. The sizable
build-up in CD's and Euro-dollars during recent months might be a
factor limiting banks' interest in quickly replacing maturing CD's.
Increases in other time and savings deposits are projected at near
recent rates, with the total of time and savings deposits expected to
rise in an 11 - 13 per cent range in September on average.
Private demand deposits at banks are not likely to show any
significant expansion in September, and may well decline somewhat, as
over-all loan demands on banks are not expected to be very substantial
in the coming weeks. Real estate loans are likely to continue expanding
at near recent rates, and outstanding business loans will turn up after
their sharp August decline. However, business loans are likely to rise
at only a moderate pace since the great bulk of accelerated tax payments
are now behind us. On the other hand, loans to security dealers, which
were an important force sustaining bank credit expansion in the last
two months, are not expected to rise further and may fall on average
in September as Government security dealers' positions are reduced
in the course of the month.
With such time and private demand deposit behavior, and with
U.S. Government deposits showing a slight rise on average during the
month, the bank credit proxy may rise in a 9 - 12 per cent range
during September. However, the auto strike and possibilities of a
sharper reduction in demand for security loans than allowed for and
less bank interest in CD's suggest that the odds on a rate of growth

at the lower end of the range, or even a little lower, are not
A bank credit expansion in the projected range, with loan
demands moderate, will permit banks to add substantially to their
security holdings. This would be an influence tending to moderate
upward interest rate pressures in the municipal market that might stem
from the enlarged September calendar and would add to investment de-
mands in the markets for intermediate-term Treasury coupon issues and
for Treasury bills. In the corporate market, the somewhat less heavy
calendar of new issues may serve to keep yields from rising significantly
further, and additional declines as the month progresses cannot be
ruled out.
If the Committee wishes to alter monetary policy in a firming
direction, it may have in view a set of money market conditions entailing
borrowings consistently between $100 and $150 million, and free reserves
averaging in a $100 - $200 million range. Such a policy would exert
upward pressure on bill rates, and the 3-month bill is likely to approach
and perhaps exceed 4½ per cent. Because market participants are very
sensitive to the possibility of a change in monetary policy at this
juncture, the tighter stance would probably be quickly detected and
translated into sizable expectational rate increases, especially in
the intermediate- and longer-term maturity range. How far and how long
such market adjustments might run would depend in good part on the
intensity of the discussions likely to follow as to implications for
CONFIDENTIAL (FR) -8- September 8, 1967.
further monetary policy action, disintermediation, Regulation Q, and
changes in the mix of fiscal and monetary policies.
The possible effect of any such firming of market conditions
on bank credit growth might well be perverse in the first few weeks.
Banks may increase efforts to capture such CD funds as they could while
rate ceilings permitted and also to accelerate inflows of Euro-dollars.
Subsequent moderation of bank deposit expansion might prove either
gradual or abrupt, depending upon how tightly CD rates crowded up
against Regulation Q ceilings.
Money market conditions intermediate between those currently
prevailing and those indicated just above as consistent with a firming
policy could be permitted to develop if bank credit growth brought the proviso
clause of a "no change" directive into play. In that event, the Federal
funds rate might still average around 4 per cent, but be more frequently
above than below that rate, and member bank borrowings average closer
to $100 million. The expectational impact of such a shading in market
conditions is likely to be less than if firmer money market conditions
are sought. While there may be some risks in such a course, the odds
are that no significant disintermediation is likely to be triggered
by so slight an adjustment, and long-term rates also may show only
a minor response.
