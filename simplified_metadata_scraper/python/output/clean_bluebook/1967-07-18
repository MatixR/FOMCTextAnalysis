MONEY MARKET AND RESERVE RELATIONSHIPS
Recent developments
The sharp rise in Treasury bill yields from the latter part
of June to early July was the most notable recent development in the
short-term market area since the last meeting of the Committee. The
3-month bill rate rose to a peak (close of business) of 4.29 per cent
from the unusual low relative to other short-term market rates of
3.33 per cent to which it had fallen in the wake of reinvestment demand
from holders of the maturing June tax bills. Most recently it has been
quoted 4.18 per cent. Longer-term bill yields have shown similar move-
ment, with the 1-year bill rising to a peak of 4.92 per cent and most
recently quoted 4.85 per cent. The upward movement in bill rates,
while partly seasonal in nature, was fueled by the Treasury financing
announcement in late June of $6.2 billion of cash borrowing in the
bill area. Interest rates on other short-term market instruments--
such as on commercial and finance company paper and certificates of
deposit--have also moved up since the last meeting of the Committee,
but by considerably less than the rise in bill rates.
The rise in the short-term market rate structure was limited
by the ample availability of reserves to the banking system and the
continuation of relatively comfortable over-all money market conditions.
The effective rate on Federal funds has continued to average just below
4 per cent. In consequence, borrowing costs have been relatively low
to dealers, although there was a slight rise in dealer loan rates at

New York City banks toward the end of June and in early July partly
in connection with midyear statement date window dressing by banks
and uncertainties about the flow of bank funds around the July 4th
holiday period.
The midyear bank statement date, which fell on a Friday, and
the holiday, which fell on a Tuesday of the same reserve settlement
week, contributed to a sharp rise in member bank borrowings (to $353
million) and in excess reserves (to a high $482 million) in the week
ending July 5. Borrowings dropped off sharply in the subsequent week
to a more representative $69 million. Meanwhile, excess reserves rose
further to $666 million, an increase which was in line with the previous
seasonal movements at this time of year as country banks hold large
excess reserves in the week following the holiday period.
Over-all, during the four statement weeks ending July 12,
borrowings averaged about $165 million, excess reserves $460 million,
and free reserves $295 million. In the previous four weeks borrowings
had averaged less, $68 million, while excess reserves were also lower,
$352 million; free reserves consequently averaged $284 million.
In the period since the last meeting of the Committee, the
Account Management has provided almost $1.7 billion of reserves through
outright gross purchases of Treasury securities. With upward interest
rate pressures focused in the bill area, $1.5 billion of these trans-
actions were in bills, about two-fifths representing purchases from
foreign accounts. Most recently, the post-holiday return flow of

currency from circulation and the usual midmonth rise in float has
led to a need to absorb reserves and the System has redeemed maturing
bills and made outright bill sales totaling about $660 million. Taking
account of another bill redemption late last month, System Open Market
operations have added $740 million of securities, net, to the portfolio
since the last meeting.
Purchases of coupon issues since the last meeting totaled about
$135 million, with $55 million maturing in over 5 years. The availability
of coupon issues for purchase has been sharply reduced; dealers' positions
in coupon issues maturing in more than a year have declined by $370
million from their level at the time of the last meeting, and their
positions in securities maturing in more than 5 years have recently
hovered around zero.
The atmosphere in long-term markets has improved at least
partly because of shifting expectations regarding defense spending
and the likelihood of a tax increase, but markets continue to be more
than usually sensitive to any further changes in market psychology.
Recent corporate issues have generally been well received at declining
yields, although some aggressively priced issues have moved slowly.
In the municipal market, while inventories remain sizable, there has
been some improvement in distribution at the somewhat higher yield
levels that have been reached.
Bank credit expansion in June (as measured by the daily
average bank credit proxy) averaged almost 9 per cent, slightly more
than previously estimated, as business loan increases around the tax

period were larger and somewhat more persisting than expected. The
privately held money supply expanded at a 13 per cent annual rate,
mainly reflecting the reduction in Treasury balances on average during
the month. Time and savings deposits grew by 16 per cent. In meeting
expanded loan demands, banks also increased borrowings from abroad by
an amount which would add almost 1 percentage to the daily average
credit proxy.
For the seven months ending in June--covering the period in
which monetary policy became relatively easy--bank credit has risen by
11 per cent (10 per cent after including a decline in borrowings abroad
through branches over the whole period), time deposits by 16 per cent,
the money supply by 7 per cent, total reserves 9 per cent, and non-
borrowed reserves by 13 per cent.
Prospective developments
The July 11 payment date for the Treasury's $4 billion tax
bill financing (with payment by full tax and loan credit) was about a
week earlier than anticipated and is the principal factor contributing
to the rise in projected average bank credit expansion in July to a
13-15 per cent range. Moreover, the yields on the tax bills were so
attractive relative to yields in the outstanding market, even dis-
counting the full value of tax and loan credit, that banks have been
selling such bills off relatively slowly. Bank credit expansion over
the balance of summer will be influenced by the timing of additional
Treasury borrowings for the sizable amounts of new cash that, at the
moment, appear to be required before late summer. A mid-August refunding
CONFIDENTIAL (FR)
of $3.6 billion of maturing coupon securities will be announced toward
the end of July.
If the Treasury does not raise significant amounts of new
cash until early September, the rate of bank credit expansion in August
is likely to be considerably slower than in July, perhaps only half as
rapid on the average. It is expected that banks will continue to
invest in municipal securities, to show an interest in recent attractively
priced Federal Agency issues, and to continue seeking to invest in
Treasury securities for liquidity purposes since many banks are still
preparing for an expected stronger loan demand in the fall. In August,
however, we expect business loans to show relatively little growth, as
the late June-early July primarily tax-related borrowings are repaid and
as inventory financing needs remain small. The recent small pick-up
in real estate lending, primarily at weekly reporting banks, may
continue and perhaps become more widespread, although the magnitudes
involved are not likely to affect the bank credit total to any great
Insofar as can be judged at this time, theae short-run bank
credit projections appear broadly consistent with the 10 per cent bank
credit growth over the entire second half of 1967 contained in the
GNP and financial projections presented to the Committee at its last
meeting. Our Blue Book projections suggest a 10-12 per cent annual
rate of increase for July and August together. While credit growth is
projected to slacken during August, it is likely to begin to pick up
in September as the Treasury begins to meet its fall cash financing needs
and assuming no prolonged auto strike.
July 14, 1967.
CONFIDENTIAL (FR) -6- July 14, 1967.
Money supply is expected to rise in a 5-7 per cent range
on average in July, though levelling off after early July and into
August as banks slowly reduce their holdings of the new tax bills and
as loan repayments liquidate some private demand deposits. Time and
savings deposits in July may grow in a 14-16 per cent range, with some
fall-off from that pace expected in August as consumer spending rises
further. Some savings could also be diverted to Treasury issues,
depending on the nature of and the terms offered in the mid-August
All of the above projections assume no change in the prevailing
money market conditions. Thus, they assume continuation of a Federal
funds rate averaging just below 4 per cent, new dealer loan rates in
New York in a 4-1/8 - 4-3/8 per cent range, and member bank borrowings
generally remaining below $100 million. Excess reserves appear likely
to decline from the unusually high average levels of recent weeks,
moving free reserves down into a $200-$300 million range. In particular,
excess reserves and free reserves are likely to drop very low in the week
of July 19, as country banks funnel into the money market some of the
large reserve excesses cumulated in the week of July 12.
Given such conditions, the annual rates of increase for the
various reserve aggregates in July are likely to be in a 15-18 per cent
range, since an increased share of reserves will be required against
the growth in private and Government demand deposits. The growth rates
are likely to slacken markedly over the balance of summer mainly because
of the much slower demand deposit growth anticipated.
CONFIDENTIAL (FR) -7- July 14, 1967.
The projected reserve expansion may be sufficient to keep the
3-month Treasury bill rate in a 4.00-4.30 per cent range between
now and mid-August. But behavior of bill rates will be strongly
influenced by Treasury financing decisions, the forthcoming new
budgetary projections for fiscal 1968, and by decisions with respect
to a tax increase. Such decisions are likely to be even more influential
with respect to the long-term market, where a program introducing
fiscal restraint could lead to some further bond yield declines,
despite the large calendar of corporate and municipal issues and the
imminent Treasury refunding.
