1  In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic 
format.  All scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced 
tilting) and lightly cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other 
blemishes caused after initial printing). 
 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optical character recognition computer program (OCR) 
first created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, 
staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.  Please note that the numbers and text in charts and

MONEY MARKET AND RESERVE RELATIONSHIPS
Money markets
Recent developments. Interest rates on a variety of short-
term debt instruments have moved higher in recent weeks, and the money
market has displayed a generally tight atmosphere. Federal funds have
traded mainly at 4-3/4 per cent, but with an increasing amount of trad-
ing at higher rates, including trading most recently at 5 per cent
and a few reported transactions at 5-1/8 per cent. With a tight funds
market, dealer financing costs have moved into a higher range.
Since mid-April the 3-month bill rate has held close to 4.65 per
cent after rising around 15 basis points earlier in the month.
Because of high financing costs, dealers have not been very willing
holders of bills recently; still, demand for bills from the public
and the System has remained fairly large, although there was some
disappointment about the extent of bill demand associated with the
The recently tighter atmosphere of money markets has
reflected in part the increased pressure on bank net reserve posi-
tions. Over the four statement weeks ending May 4, net borrowed
reserves averaged about $270 million and member bank borrowings
about $635 million--compared with averages of $225 million and $565
million, respectively, in the previous 4 weeks. Member bank borrow-
ings averaged above $600 million in every week since late March.

Prospective developments. On the assumption that net
borrowed reserves will continue to average $250-$300 million over
the next 4 weeks, the 3-month bill rate is likely to fluctuate
mainly within a 4.60 to 4.75 per cent range. Departures from this
range on some days are quite possible, however, as strong cross-
currents will be at work in the bill market. Among the factors
tending to lower rates will be a seasonal tendency toward decline,
particularly with the maturity of $4.5 billion of tax bills in mid-
June. Some demand for bills also could be generated over the near-
term from temporary investment of the cash proceeds of Treasury
issues not exchanged in the current refunding (in which the attri-
tion rate was above 40 per cent even after sizable Treasury purchases
of when-issued securities before books were closed). In addition,
demand for short Governments stemming from reinvestment of proceeds
from security flotations is likely to continue. Any renewed weakness
in the stock market also could generate some downward pressure on
bill rates.
Among the factors which will tend to exert a tightening
influence on rates will be continuing pressure from dealer financ-
ing costs associated with a taut Federal funds market. While dealers
have reduced their bill inventories somewhat recently, these remain
well above the low levels of late winter and any efforts by dealers
to work current inventories lower would tend to be reflected in
higher rates. Prospects of a large supply of Federal agency issues
CONFIDENTIAL (FR)
in the weeks ahead are also likely to exert upward pressure on bill
rates, as will continued aggressive bank efforts to attract CD funds
especially in preparation for the June dividend and tax dates.
Finally, the System will return to the selling side of the bill
market around mid-May, although its sales to absorb reserves are
not expected to be as large as its recent purchases.
Some deepening of net borrowed reserves in the period
ahead may have been already discounted by the market, but a sub-
stantial decline to, say, around $400 million, probably would have
a significant psychological impact. The reserve pressure itself
will have a substantial effect on already high day-to-day financing
costs. And the 3-month bill rate would likely under the circum-
stances rise to a range above 4.75 per cent.
Market uncertainties, as reflected in recent gyrations of
common stock prices, make the outlook for bond yields more cloudy
than usual. In the absence of further expectational shocks, however,
bond yields are likely to drift higher in the weeks ahead even if
net borrowed reserves are little changed from current levels.
Contributing factors will be the continuing large corporate and
municipal calendar and the likelihood of some agency financing in
the intermediate-term area. A substantial further tightening of
bank reserve positions would accelerate such a rise in bond yields.
CONFIDENTIAL (FR)
A 3-month bill fluctuating above 4-3/4 per cent would
certainly result in active market discussion about the sustainability
of the existing time deposit ceiling rate and of the discount rate.
The discount rate would appear to be the more immediately vulnerable
as bill rates rise; banks will become increasingly desirous of
borrowing as they find their reserve positions under pressure and
Federal funds trading more frequently at a large premium above the
discount rate.
Reserve flows, bank credit, and money
Recent developments. In April both private demand and
time deposits showed their largest increases in several months and
U. S. Government deposits rose moderately. Thus, total member bank
deposits (credit proxy) increased sharply in April. With all types
of deposits increasing, required reserves increased at nearly a 15
per cent annual rate in April, and total reserves rose somewhat more
as some banks added to their excess reserves after the low March
level. The System supplied the bulk of the increase in reserves,
with nonborrowed reserves rising at about a 13 per cent annual rate,
but banks were also forced to increase their borrowings at the
Federal Reserve.
Since around mid-April outstanding private demand deposits
and the total money supply have declined slightly. Growth in bank
credit (as measured by the proxy) has continued, but at a pace
CONFIDENTIAL (FR) - 5 -
slightly slower than from mid-March to mid-April. U.S. Government
deposits have grown sharply over the past two weeks, contributing
in part to the slowing of money expansion. Meanwhile, total time
and savings deposits have continued to increase, but the very
latest data suggest that the sharp spurt in the latter part of
March and April may be tapering off.
Prospective developments. Assuming no change in net
borrowed reserves from recent levels and continued strength in
loan demands from businesses and financial institutions, the
principal potential factors affecting variations in the growth of bank
credit and deposits between now and midyear include the following:
(1) repayments of loans made by banks related to the March-April
tax period and sales of liquid assets that banks accumulated over
that period; (2) the rise in U.S. Government deposits, associated
in part with issues of agency debt; (3) pressures developing around
the June dividend and tax periods; and (4) more moderate growth in
time deposits.
Considering these factors, it appears likely that bank
credit growth may average around 8 per cent between now and midyear,
with the rate of growth tending to be moderate in May and larger in
June. In the weeks immediately ahead, expected repayments of
security loans, together with bill sales by dealer banks, will tend
to reduce bank credit growth. And these factors, together with a
CONFIDENTIAL (FR) - 6 -
continued rise in U.S. Government deposits, may lead toa decline in
outstanding private demand deposits and the money supply.
As spring progresses, further pressures for credit expansion
are likely to develop as a result of sizable Federal agency issues
(which could total $2 or $3 billion for new cash--although this
is more than usually subject to a number of uncertainties) and June
speed-ups of corporate income tax payments and corporate remittances
to the Treasury of individual income tax withholdings.
Private demand deposit growth may be resumed later in
the spring. Over the next two months, on balance, such deposits
may show little change, which would bring the annual rate of increase
over the first half of 1966 to around 4.5 per cent. It is not
expected that banks' time deposits will expand as rapidly over the
next few months as they did in April. As the initial impact of
higher rates on savings certificates passes, gains should be more
moderate. And while we do not have current information on CD
maturities, it appears likely that banks may find it more difficult
to replace maturing issues in view of the competition from other
short-term paper.
