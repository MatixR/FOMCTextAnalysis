Recent developments
(1) M2 is estimated to have expanded at about a 30 percent
annual rate in January, after having increased at a 7 percent annual
rate in December. Some of the December increase and much of the surge
in January appear to have been associated with growth in the new money
market deposit accounts (MMDAs). These accounts, which were first
offered on December 14, had grown to $210 billion by late January.
Estimates of the sources of funds diverted to MMDAs are inevitably im-
precise, but the great bulk of the inflows to MMDAs appears to have been
from other components of M2, with roughly one-fifth of the MMDA balances
representing funds shifted from outside of M2.1/ Such shifts likely
boosted M2 growth in January by about 20 percentage points.
(2) Banks and thrifts have responded to the large net inflows
into core deposits in part by running off large CDs. Thus, M3 growth--
estimated at a 1¼ percent annual rate in December and 13 percent in
January--was much less affected by the advent of MMDAs, though the net
effect of shifts into MMDAs could account for a small portion of M3
growth in January. Banks also reacted to the strong inflows into MMDAs
by making large purchases of Treasury and other securities. Reflecting
these large increases in investments as well as a modest rebound in
lending, bank credit grew at a 10½ percent annual rate in December and
an estimated 12¼ percent rate in January, a distinct pickup from recent
months. In addition, banks advanced a large volume of funds to their
overseas branches.

(3) M1 is estimated to have grown at an 8¾ percent annual rate
in December and at a 12½ percent annual rate in January. Growth in January
appears to have been little affected on balance by the new deposit accounts.
Shifts out of M1 into MMDAs appear to have been minor, about offset by
relatively small shifts into super-NOW accounts from outside this aggregate.
Super-NOW accounts grew to only about $17 billion by late January.

the newly revised money stock data that incorporate definitional changes
and the annual benchmark and seasonal factor review.1/ On the revised
and Keogh accounts from the aggregates and to include tax-exempt money
market funds in M2 and M3. The net impact of these changes was to reduce
the annual rate of growth of M2 and M3 for 1982 by about ½ and ¼ point
to 9.2 and 10.1 percent, respectively. (Subsequent references to the
monetary aggregates in this bluebook and the data in the table on the next
page are on a revised basis.)
(5) Total and nonborrowed reserves growth slowed from about a
January. In part, the slower growth resulted from the more moderate
increases in transaction balances near year end, but it also reflected a
substantial reduction in required reserves owing to runoffs of CDs and
shifts out of savings and time deposits at member banks into MMDAs. Growth
of the monetary base, in contrast, accelerated in December and January,
mainly reflecting a rebound in currency growth. The level of adjustment
(and seasonal) borrowing at the discount window implied by the reserve paths
was maintained at $200 million throughout the intermeeting period.1/ However,
with demands for excess reserves extraordinarily strong, borrowing ran
above that level until the two statement weeks just past, when it averaged
about $150 million.2/
(6) Over the intermeeting period, the funds rate generally has
been fluctuating near the 8½ percent discount rate, except around year end
when it was temporarily boosted by statement date pressures. The heavy
calendar of Treasury auctions and the attention focused on future financing
needs by recent discussion of federal budget policy have placed upward
pressure on Treasury yields in particular. Private short-term rates have
shown small mixed changes, but Treasury bill rates have risen 35 to 40
basis points on balance. In long-term markets, Treasury bond rates are
up about 60 basis points, about twice as much as corporate rates. A small
decline in tax-exempt yields appears to reflect the slackened pace of tax-
exempt offerings following the rush of new issues sold in the fourth quarter
in anticipation of new registration requirements.
(7) The dollar has appreciated by about 2 percent on a weighted
average basis and by about 5 percent against sterling since the last FOMC
meeting. The dollar dropped by about 4 percent from the December meeting
the extraordinary volume of new deposit flows associated with MMDAs
and the related reduction in required reserves, changing reserve
requirements on the MMDA instrument in the wake of Congressional
legislation, and the general reduction in reserve requirements that
occurred in late December as a result of exempting the first $2.1
million of reservable liabilities.
to early January, then rose sharply afterwards as market participants
revised their expectations about the near-term course of U.S. interest
rates. Under the circumstances, expected cuts in official lending rates
in Germany and Japan did not materialize.
Longer-run targets for 1983
(8) Establishment of longer-run monetary and credit targets
for 1983 is complicated by the need to take account of the redistribution
of funds associated with introduction of MMDAs and super-NOW accounts--
in terms of both their transitional impact on growth rates and on the
longer-run behavioral characteristics of the aggregates. Moreover, other
developments also raise questions about the underlying trend of velocity.
For example, should last year's sharp declines in income velocities of
key monetary aggregates be interpreted as an indication that the public
will over time want to hold more money relative to GNP than historical
patterns would suggest? Should that be the case, velocity growth may not
show its usual cyclical recovery this year and the trend increase in, for
example, M1 velocity over longer periods may be reduced below the 3 percent
annual rate of the post-World War II period. On the other hand, last year's
unusual build-up in liquidity relative to income could be reversed this
year, with a consequent substantial rise in velocity.
(9) These various issues, among others, are involved in assessing
the tentative 1983 monetary targets set by the Committee last July and
alternatives to them. The targets set in mid-1982 for the monetary
aggregates this year were: M1, 2½ to 5½ percent; M2, 6 to 9 percent; M3,
Each of these potential ranges, and possible alternatives, is considered
in the paragraphs below, but with the credit discussion focused on total
(10) The 6 to 9 percent range for M2 applicable to growth from
QIV '82 to QIV '83 does not appear to be feasible, given the strength of
M2 growth in the early weeks of the year related to the shifts to MMDAs.
Assuming that a little more than half of the growth in MMDAs for the
year has already occurred, and that a smaller fraction will come from
market instruments as the year progresses, we would estimate that shifts
into those accounts from sources outside M2 would raise growth for the
year on the order of 3 to 4 percentage points. This would suggest for
the year 1983 that an M2 growth range of 9 to 13 percent could be generally
consistent with the lower tentative range set last year.
(11) Another possible approach to allowing for shifts into MMDAs
would be to base the M2 range for 1983 on the first quarter of the year,
instead of the fourth quarter of 1982, on the ground that the bulk, though
not all, of the year's shift will have taken place by March. An M2 growth
range based on the first quarter of 6½ to 9½ percent at an annual rate--
just ½ point higher than the present tentative range--would encompass a
subsequent underlying growth of 8 percent (the assumption underlying the
staff GNP projection) and leave scope for up to 1½ points of shift effect
over the last three quarters of the year. The staff would anticipate a
shift effect over this period of about that amount; a slightly higher
range would leave more room for the possibilities that shifting may be
greater than we have assumed or that the velocity of M2 will continue to
show an unusual decline in contrast to its more normal stability (exhibited
on average even in recovery periods).
(12) With regard to M3, it is even more problematical to ab-
stract from shifts in an effort to assess what would otherwise have occurred,
since banks have the option of permitting large CDs to run-off in adjust-
ment to MMDA inflows. In general, it might be assumed that banks and
thrifts may employ the new accounts to enhance their share of the credit
market at least to some degree. However, even so, M3 would not necessarily
increase and could even be reduced to the extent money market funds drop.
At the same time, we would expect a rather substantial moderation in
demand for bank credit from businesses this year as they continue with
strong efforts to restructure balance sheets. Thus, maintenance of the
tentative M3 range or possibly a reduction by ½ percentage point, even
with QIV '82 as a base, may be consistent with emerging institutional
(13) The introduction of MMDAs and super-NOWs thus far has
induced greater distorting effects on the growth rate of M2 than of M1.
This is not entirely unexpected, of course, since it was never clear
whether the two new accounts might or might not be offsetting in terms
of their effect on M1. Still, it remains uncertain how to interpret the
newly emerging M1 as an increasing proportion of the aggregate comes to
bear a market interest rate and is composed of savings-type deposits.1/
These uncertainties, as well as the potential for future distortions in M1
should banks begin marketing super-NOWs more aggressively, argue against
specifying a long-run range for M1 at this point.
(14) On the other hand, the apparent modest size of shifts
thus far into and out of M1 may suggest that some confidence could be placed
in a long-run M1 range. However, if one were specified, a relatively wide
range would seem advisable. We would suggest, as one alternative, a range
of 3 to 7 percent from QIV '82 to QIV '83. Assuming there are no signi-
ficant net shifts into or out of M1 as a result of the new accounts, actual
growth may be around the upper end of this range, consistent with an 8
percent "underlying" M2 growth over the balance of the year. Such M1
growth implies that its income velocity would rise only slightly over the
year, below its trend rate of the postwar period and well below its average
during cyclical recoveries. A relatively slow velocity rise in 1983 for M1
is consistent with our quarterly model's demand for money equation, given
the staff projection of GNP and relatively stable interest rates. This equa-
tion had overpredicted the demand for money for much of the period since
the mid-1970's. However, conditions leading to the earlier sharp downward
demand shifts for money--high and rising interest rates and market innova-
tions that diverted transactions funds from M1 to other instruments--have
faded. Thus, at this point we see a risk that the 2½ to 5½ percent
M1 range--which at the upper end would entail a downward demand shift
of a couple of percentage points according to our quarterly model--would
be overshot unless income is weaker than projected or interest rates rise.
(15) We would anticipate total credit growth in 1983 to be in
an 8 to 11 percent range, as measured by the expansion in domestic non-
financial debt generated out of the flow of funds accounts consistent
with the staff GNP forecast.1/ The mid-point of this range would involve
about the same rate of expansion as last year, when nominal GNP growth was
substantially less than is expected for this year. A continued expansion
of credit in excess of GNP growth during a period of economic recovery,
as is expected for this year, is somewhat unusual, but reflects growth in
amounts, growth rates and relations to GNP. A staff memorandum
accompanying this bluebook employs a number of statistical tests to
attempt to assess the "best" measure of total credit for targeting
purposes. Use of domestic nonfinancial debt seems to be generally
reasonable, though most measures are closely grouped in their statis-
tical properties.
borrowing by sectors generating the recovery--the Federal Government
and households--while the drop-off in borrowing by the lagging sector--
businesses--is less than usual for this stage of a cycle because of the
constrained increase in their internal funds occasioned by a relatively
modest recovery.
(16) Based on the preceding discussion, the table below summarizes
what the staff believes to be a consistent set of relationships among the
money and credit aggregates for 1983, measured from QIV '82 to QIV '83.
Alternative II essentially adjusts the tentative July M2 range for the
shifts in funds generated by the new deposit accounts, and suggests ranges
for the other aggregates that the staff now believes consistent with that
M2 range. We would still expect actual growth to be toward the upper end
of all three ranges. Alternatives I and III embody somewhat easier and
tighter specifications, respectively.
(17) The table on the next page shows possible outcomes for
alternative monetary strategies. Strategy 1 is consistent with the long-
run targets of alternative II for 1983 and assumes an 8 percent underlying
M2 growth in subsequent years. The results shown represent the staff's
judgmental GNP forecast found in the greenbook, but extended to 1985. The
consequences of other monetary strategies are based essentially on differences
derived from simulations of the quarterly econometric model. Strategy 2
assumes higher M2 growth than strategy 1 in 1983 and 1984--by 1 and ½ per-
centage point, respectively. Strategy 3 slows underlying M2 growth to
about 7 percent over the three-year period. Strategies 4 and 5 are designed
to help evaluate the implications of a possible decrease in the structural
budgetary deficit from currently projected levels.
(18) Results of the first three strategies embodying alternative
monetary approaches indicate, as would be expected, that somewhat higher
money growth leads to faster real economic expansion relative to our basic
forecast but at the expense of a slight acceleration in prices over the
three year horizon rather than a steady deceleration. A deceleration in
prices would be even sharper under the slow money growth assumption, but
accompanied by a noticeably slower economic recovery.
(19) The last two strategies assume various measures of fiscal
restraint--about equally split between spending and tax initiatives--with
effects beginning in 1983 that cumulate to a $60 billion cut in the
structural deficit by 1985. If no change is made in the basic money supply
assumption of strategy 1, the quarterly model would indicate an improved
price performance as time goes on and significantly lower short-term
interest rates, but economic recovery would be slower. However, possible
psychological benefits on longer-term interest rates, as anticipation of
credit demands and inflation are reduced, and on confidence generally from
a package of fiscal restraint would not be captured by the model. If the
tighter fiscal policy is accompanied by the more rapid money growth in

the model, is slowed only a little in the first year of recovery relative
to our basic assumption, and prices are not much affected, but short-term
interest rates are substantially lower throughout the period. As a result
growth of economic activity accelerates noticeably. The considerable
declines in short-term rates under strategy 5 would help bring long rates
down and encourage business spending on plant and equipment, unless the
more rapid expansion of money assumed in this and the next year generates
inflationary fears that work to hold up longer-term market rates--a poten-
tial reaction not incorporated in these model results.
Near-term targets
(20) Alternative short-run specifications of the monetary
aggregates for the last two months of the quarter are shown in the upper
panel of the following table, with implied growth rates for the entire
quarter shown in the second panel. These specifications are, of course,
highly uncertain, as recent developments make clear. The M2 figures shown
assume some continued shifts into that aggregate in response to the
availability of the new accounts, but at a much slower pace than in late
December and January. The figures for M3 are, we believe, likely to be
much less distorted by shifts. Because M1 thus far seems to have been
relatively little affected by the shifts, an M1 specification is also
shown. (More detailed data for the alternatives are shown in the charts
and tables on the following pages. The quarterly interest rate path
consistent with the staff's GNP projection is contained in Appendix V.)

growth rate of the various monetary aggregates from their unusually rapid

of 8 percent from the end of January. Actual growth is higher because
of continued, though diminishing,shifts into MMDAs.1/ M1 growth, which
has been quite substantial for several months now, is projected to decele-
rate markedly, partly as the lagged upward effects on growth of this
on a quarterly average basis would be around 8¾ percent, implying a slight
further drop in velocity in the first quarter of the year. M3 growth over
the February-March period is expected to expand about in line with its
December-January average.
(22) Alternative B, which might be considered as most consistent
with long-run alternative II, assumes that federal funds generally trade
somewhat below the current 8 percent discount rate. Other market rates
are likely to change little between now and the next Committee meeting
under those circumstances, with the 3-month bill rate generally in an 8 to
$200 million, with total reserves probably falling on the order of 10
percent, and nonborrowed reserves by about 7 percent, as required reserves
contract mainly reflecting continued run-offs in large CDs.
(23) Somewhat easier market conditions are implied by alternative
A, which involves a drop in the funds rate to the 7 to 8 percent area.
Such a decline would probably entail a further ½ percentage point reduction
in the discount rate. Assuming a cut in the discount rate, the money market
specifications of alternative A would generally be consistent with borrowing
in the $150 million to $200 million range. Both short- and long-term market
rates would be expected to adjust downward. However, whether the decline
in long-term rates would be sustainable will depend in part on whether
incoming economic news and the budgetary outlook tend to raise market
concerns about the sustainability of easier money market conditions. The
dollar likely would resume its decline on foreign exchange markets.
(24) Alternative C, which appears most consistent with the
tightest of the longer-run alternatives presented, involves a rise in the
federal funds rate to the 9 percent area. Interest rates would adjust
sharply upward, particularly so over the short run in the Treasury note
and bond area where the market is in process of digesting a substantial
refunding. Private rates would also rise, and a portion of the recent
improvement in quality spreads may be reversed, as concerns about the
viability of major borrowers tend to re-emerge. Borrowing at the dis-
count window, given the present discount rate, would probably rise to
around $500 million, and nonborrowed reserves would contract by about
exchange markets over the short run.
(25) The debt of domestic nonfinancial sectors in the first
quarter is projected to grow at an annual rate of a little over 9 percent,
little different from its rate of expansion in the fourth quarter, and
about in line with expected growth for the current year. With its need
to finance a massive deficit, the federal government will continue to be
the predominant borrower in credit markets, accounting for almost half of
total funds raised by nonfinancial sectors. Borrowing by state and local
governments is expected to drop off from the advanced fourth-quarter pace,
when it was boosted by approaching regulatory deadlines as well as lower
interest rates. Even so, fund usage by this sector should remain fairly
strong by historical standards, reflecting in part refunding and advance
refunding of securities issued earlier at higher rates. Home mortgage
takedowns are likely to increase further in lagged response to earlier rate
declines, but installment borrowing by households may ease a bit, having
been shifted to an extent to the fourth quarter by interest rate concessions
on auto financing. Even though corporations' net need for external funds
is expected to change little in the first quarter, business borrowing may
pick up somewhat from its slow fourth-quarter pace and be accompanied by
a more rapid build-up in liquid assets, which had slowed considerably in
the fourth quarter so far as can be told on the basis of limited informa-
tion. As compared with the fourth quarter, relatively more credit expansion
in the first quarter is expected to be financed by banks and other deposi-
tory institutions as they benefit from MMDA inflows. Bank credit growth
over the quarter may be in the 9 to 10 percent annual rate area.
Directive language is in the process of preparation, and a
draft will be circulated to the Committee prior to the meeting on Tuesday.
The proposed directive will attempt to take account of recent Committee
discussions of longer-run targeting issues and of related questions of
policy implementation--including problems raised by the new money market
deposit accounts, the uncertain prospects for velocity behavior, and the
weight to be given to broader aggregates, and possibly also M1, as guides
to operations.
