The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version available 
based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the Board 
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was created 
through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned 
versions text-searchable.2   Though a stringent quality assurance process was 
employed, some imperfections may remain.

1  In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic 
format.  All scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced 
tilting) and lightly cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other 
blemishes caused after initial printing). 
 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optical character recognition computer program (OCR) 
first created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, 
staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.  Please note that the numbers and text in charts and

Recent developments
(1) Since the last meeting of the Committee, money supply measures
have grown at annual rates well above the upper limits of the Committee's
May-June ranges of tolerance, and RPD appears to be at the upper end of its
range. The overshoot is particularly large for M1, as the table shows.

(2) In May alone, M1 grew at an annual rate of 11.2 per cent,
while M2 rose at a 9.8 per cent rate. Strength in M1 continued into early
June. Some of the unanticipated acceleration of M1 growth in May and
early June may be attributable to the unusually large volume of personal
income tax refunds. At the time of the last Committee meeting tax refunds
in May were projected to exceed those of a year ago by about $1.5 billion.
Nearly complete data now available indicate that the excess was closer to
$3.5 billion. While total refunds for the fiscal year--at $22 billion--are
only about $1 billion larger than projected at the time of the last meeting,
the issuance of final refund checks was largely completed in May instead of
spilling over into June to the extent we expected.
(3) With the aggregates exceeding their ranges of tolerance by
increasing margins as the inter-meeting period progressed, the Committee
agreed to raise the ceiling on the federal funds rate. An initial adjustment
from 7-7/8 per cent to 8-1/4 per cent was made on May 24 and another increase
to 8-1/2 per cent was approved on June 8. Desk operations most recently have
been geared to a reserve strategy expected to result in a funds rate around
the four statement weeks since the last Committee meeting, though bulging
to $2.4 billion in the holiday week of May 30.
(4) Tightening of the money market was accompanied by substantial
upward adjustments in short-term interest rates, and the discount rate was
raised to 6-1/2 per cent in early June. In short-term markets, the largest
advances--of 100 basis points--occurred in rates on 3-month Treasury bills and
other short-term rates. Other short-term market rates were increased by
taken place before the 1/2 percentage point increase in Reserve Bank discount
rates on June 8. Market reaction to the discount rate advance was limited
because market participants were expecting some early Administration action
on price controls. When the temporary price freeze and other measure were
finally announced on June 13, the initial interest rate response was slightly
(5) In long-term markets, rate responses to the further tightening
of money market conditions were quite moderate. Yield advances on long-term
securities ranged generally from 5 to 15 basis points. Published series on
mortgage rates also showed advances within this same range, and there
were reports from some areas of somewhat larger increases in offering rates
on new mortgages.
(6) Growth in the bank credit proxy during the May-June target
period appears to have been somewhat slower than in earlier months and
little different from what was expected at the time of the last Committee
meeting. Business loan demand has remained strong. However, bank net
issuance of large CD's dropped off markedly in June. The new marginal
reserve requirement became applicable to such deposits outstanding in the
week beginning June 7.

Prospective developments
(8) The alternatives suggested for Committee consideration have
been framed to be consistent with those to be discussed in the chart show
on Monday. The chart on the following page shows movements in M1, which
is taken to index a collection of aggregates. It traces the actual
growth from September 1972 to June 1973 (with the June figure partly a projec-
tion)and shows alternative growth rates for the June-December period. The
slope of the middle dashed line represents continuation of the 5-1/4 per cent
long-term growth path adopted by the Committee at its March meeting and
reaffirmed in April and May. The steeper dashed line reflects a more rapid
growth rate for M1 of 6-1/2 per cent and the flatter dashed line a less
rapid rate of 4 per cent.
(9) The three alternative dashed lines take as a base, or
starting point, the average level of M1 in June that would be consistent
with the mid-point of the 5--5-1/2 per cent growth rate adopted by the
Committee in March (which in turn starts from the March level then expected).
Because of the recent rapid growth in M1, the actual level of M1 expected
for June (the circled point on the chart) is $1.2 billion in excess of the
level consistent with the previously adopted 5-1/4 per cent path. Accordingly,
a Committee decision to adhere to that longer-term growth path would require
a correction in the rate of expansion over the period ahead. If the correction
were to be completed within the next two quarters, growth from the indicated
June level to December would have to be at a 4-1/2 per cent rate (alternative B).
Similarly, as a result of the recent overshoot, a Committee decision to move
onto a higher 6-1/2 per cent long-run target growth path (alternative A) or

onto a lower 4 per cent path (alternative C) would imply growth from the
indicated June level to December at rates somewhat slower than those path rates.
(10) The combined third and fourth quarter rates of growth required
to hit the longer-run targets specified for M1 amount to 5-1/2 per cent for
alternative A; 4-1/2 per cent for alternative B; and 3 per cent for alter-
native C. These are the rates of growth which would attain a December level
that is on the desired long-run growth path after correcting for the recent
overshoot. If the June level of M1 turns out to be lower or higher than
presently projected, the growth rates to reach the desired path level of M1
in December would, of course, be revised commensurately. Targets for the
other monetary aggregates consistent with those for M1, and associated
short-run ranges of tolerance for June-July, are summarized in the table
below. (More detailed figures are shown in the table on page 6a.

Rates of Growth
(11) In the weeks immediately ahead, a Federal funds rate in
the general neighborhood of the currently prevailing 8-1/2 per cent rate
may be consistent with the specifications for the aggregates shown below for
alternative B. Under B, M1 in June-July is indicated to rise in a 6--8 per cent
annual rate, range with growth at a 9 per cent rate in June, but slowing
to about a 5 per cent rate in July. The slowing in July and the quite
modest rate of growth indicated for the third quarter in part reflect the
unwinding of the presumably temporary surge in privately held cash balances
engendered by the heavy income tax refunds. More basically, the longer-run
demand for M 1 is likely to be well below the second-quarter pace in lagged
reaction to the sharp recent rise in short-term interest rates and in reflec-
tion of the more moderate rate of growth in nominal GNP projected for the
second half of 1973.
(12) The high degree of economic uncertainty now prevailing,
including the Administration's recently announced price freeze, make pro-
jections of money demand more than usually difficult. While prices will
stablilize during the period of the freeze, the makeup of the phase IV
program and its implications for longer-term price movements are total
unknowns. The money supply paths presented in this blue book do not assume
an appreciable longer-run reduction in demand for money as a result of the
freeze and Phase IV. Nor have we made an explicit allowance in the short-
run for any temporary downward shift in transactions demand for money, such
as conceivably could result from a temporary stabilization of prices, or
from shifts into market securities if expectations of declining interest
rates become more prevalent. Because of these various uncertainties, and
their possible effects on the demand for money and hence on RPD, the Federal
funds rate ranges suggested are wider than in recent meetings (for example,
to allow for the possibility that the freeze itself may lead to a temporary
lessening of money demand, by permitting growth rates below the ranges speci-
fied or by lifting the lower end of the funds rate range.
(13) Even with a continuation of current money market conditions,
short- and long-term interest rates over the next few weeks may be under
some further upward pressure. Short rates do not appear to have adjusted
fully to the higher day-to-day rates now prevailing, and the yield spread
between short- and long-term markets is abnormally small and in some cases
negative. Interest rates would, of course, come under greater upward
pressure if money market conditions should tighten, as they might under
either alternative B or C. However, market expectations concerning the
likely content and effectiveness of Phase IV will be critical for interest
rate behavior.
(14) In view of the recent upsurge in short-term interest rates,
growth in time deposits other than large CD's is expected to slow in the
second half of the year to around a 5--6 per cent rate under alternative B.
This does not allow for any increase in existing Regulation Q ceilings; if
ceilings were raised across the board by one-half per cent, as is assumed
in the analysis to be presented in Monday's chart show, growth rates would
average about 2 percentage points higher. A sharper slowing in time deposit
inflows, is contemplated under alternative C and less of a slowing under
alternative A.
(15) Bank credit demands are expected to remain generally strong.
Should expectations of rising interest rates strengthen, though, some cor-
porate borrowers might shift out of banks into the capital market. In any
case, reduced inflows of both private demand and consumer-type time deposits
suggest that banks are likely to remain aggressive bidders for CD's. But
CD growth will probably be slower than in the first few months of the year
in reflection of the higher cost of CD's. On balance, taking all deposit
flows into account, growth in the bank credit proxy is expected to slow
further in the second half of the year under all three alternatives, with
the slowing greatest under alternative C.
Proposed directive
(16) Presented below are three alternative formulations for the
operational paragraph of the directive, which might be taken to correspond
to the similarly lettered policy alternatives discussed in the preceding
section. For all three alternatives it is proposed to delete the reference
to international developments because the speculative pressures in exchange
markets since shortly before the last meeting have not caused special
operating problems for the Desk. Retention of the reference to domestic
financial market developments is proposed in both alternatives B and C,
because both involve the possibility of a significant tightening of the
money market. As will be noted, both alternatives B and C refer to the
aggregate growth rates "indicated for the first half of the year." Including
current estimates for June, these are as follows: M1, 5.5 per cent;
M2, 7.5 per cent; and the bank credit proxy, 13.5 per cent.
Alternative A
To implement this policy, [DEL: while taking account of
international and domestic financial market developments,] the
Committee seeks to achieve bank reserve and money market con-
ditions consistent with MODERATE [DEL: somewhat slower] growth in
monetary aggregates over the months immediately ahead [DEL: than
occurred on average in the past 6 months].
Alternative B
To implement this policy, while taking account of
[DEL: international and] domestic financial market developments, the
Committee seeks to achieve bank reserve and money market
conditions consistent with somewhat slower growth in
monetary aggregates over the months immediately ahead [DEL: than
occurred on average in the past 6 months] APPEARS INDICATED
FOR THE FIRST HALF OF THE YEAR.
Alternative C
To implement this policy, while taking account of
[DEL: international and] domestic financial market developments, the
Committee seeks to achieve bank reserve and money market con-
ditions consistent with [DEL: somewhat] slower growth in monetary
aggregates over the months immediately ahead than [DEL: occurred on
average in the past 6 months] APPEARS INDICATED FOR THE FIRST
HALF OF THE YEAR.
