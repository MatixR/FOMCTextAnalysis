MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES
Recent Developments
(1) In the weeks immediately after the August FOMC meeting,
the Desk sought to maintain existing reserve pressures, basing reserve
targets initially on an allowance for adjustment plus seasonal borrow-
ing of $375 million and expecting federal funds to continue to trade
around 5-1/2 percent. Through September 12, the federal funds rate
averaged around that level, while the borrowing allowance was reduced
to $300 million in two technical adjustments, reflecting an abatement
of seasonal borrowing needs. On September 13, the Board lowered the
discount rate to 5 percent in response to weakness in the monetary and
credit aggregates, the improving inflation environment, and concerns
about the strength of the economic expansion. Accompanying that
action, the federal funds rate was expected to decline to around 5-1/4
percent, with the borrowing allowance increased to $325 million to
reflect the partial pass-through of the discount rate cut. Through
the first eight days of the current maintenance period, federal funds
have averaged 5.31 percent, and borrowing $341 million.1
(2) Market interest rates rose slightly in the days after
the August meeting, reflecting both the absence of an immediate policy
easing and the strong durable goods report. Rates declined in
subsequent weeks, however, as incoming nonfinancial and monetary
indicators were seen as increasing the likelihood of a sluggish expan-
sion, damped inflation, and an early move toward an easing of policy.
With data seen as still somewhat on the soft side, rates have con-
tinued to drift lower since the mid-September easing. On balance over
the intermeeting period, private short-term market rates are down 10
to 20 basis points, and intermediate- and long-term rates are off
about 1/4 percentage point. The prime rate was reduced by 1/2
percentage point to 8 percent subsequent to the policy action, but it
remains high relative to the cost of bank funding. The average com-
mitment rate on fixed-rate mortgages fell to 8.92 percent, its lowest
level since 1977, stimulating substantial refinancing activity.
Broader stock price indexes reached record levels shortly after the
meeting, but then lost part of their gains, finishing with increases
of 2 to 4 percent over the intermeeting period.
(3) The dollar declined against all major currencies, par-
ticularly the German mark and other EMS currencies, over the inter-
meeting period. On a weighted average basis, the dollar's deprecia-
tion was 5-3/4 percent. Of that, about half was a reversal very early
in the period of a spike occasioned by the attempted Soviet coup. The
subsequent course of Soviet events seemed to lessen further the risk
attached to mark assets. Relative monetary policy stances and pros-
pects also served to depress the dollar against the mark. German
interest rates held fairly steady, and market participants anticipated
no near-term change in the Bundesbank's monetary policy stance. In
Japan, indications of further slowing in economic growth and reserve
market operations by the Bank of Japan led to significant declines in
market interest rates and expectations of a further easing of monetary
policy. Still, the dollar has fallen 2-1/4 percent against the yen
since after the collapse of the coup, reflecting to some extent
increased market focus on Japan's burgeoning external surplus.
(4) The broad monetary aggregates have more or less levelled
out after sizable declines earlier in the summer. M2 is estimated to
have risen only slightly over August and September, and M3 to have
fallen at a 1 percent average rate. Both aggregates were somewhat
weaker than anticipated at the last FOMC meeting, leaving them around
the lower bounds of their respective annual ranges in September.4
By contrast. M1 grew at a 7 percent pace over August and September--in
line with its growth earlier in the year. On average for the
third quarter, M2 fell at a 1/4 percent annual pace and M3 at a 2-1/2
percent rate. To an extent, weak money reflects the relatively
slow expansion of nominal GNP, which is now estimated at 4-1/2 percent
in the third quarter, only a little above its pace in the second
quarter. But even given GNP, the behavior of M2 has been extraordi-
nary, as suggested by the nearly 5 percent rate of increase in its
velocity during the third quarter, in the face of the substantial
declines over previous quarters in the usual measure of opportunity
costs. The error for M2 growth in the staff money demand model
amounted to an unprecedented 6-1/4 percentage points for the quarter.
(5) The unusual weakness in M2 growth relative to that of
income in recent months reflects a variety of factors, many of them
difficult to quantify. Household portfolio shifts into higher-
yielding capital market instruments have been spurred by the lowest
yields on M2 assets in many years and a steeply upward-sloped yield
curve. Heightened demand for longer-term securities is indicated by
heavy flows into bond and equity mutual funds and an appreciable
increase in noncompetitive tenders for Treasury notes. In addition,
households may be using M2 assets to pay down debt and to finance
consumption, given the relatively high effective rates on consumer
credit and many existing mortgages. Low net returns on M2 assets have
resulted in part from declines in market rates, and also from unag-
gressive pursuit of deposits by banks and thrifts. Continued contrac-
tion of the thrift industry, along with weak bank credit, imply re-
duced demands for funding by depositories. While these developments
are primarily reflected in declines in large time deposits, they like-
ly have effects on the growth of M2 as well, through reduced advertis-
ing for retail deposits, higher service fees, a cutback in brokered
deposits at many institutions, and increased availability of alterna-
tive investments through bank offices. A portion of the shrinkage of
thrifts has resulted from stepped-up RTC activity, involving abrogated
contracts and disrupted thrift-depositor relationships. These iden-
tified shifts in household and depository behavior do not seem to
account for the entire shortfall in money growth, and they do not
themselves indicate whether this shortfall has implications for future
income. No doubt some portion of the shortfall reflects a reshuffling
of portfolios without clear implications for spending. However, the
behavior of M2 also may reflect weak prospective loan growth at
depositories, high real interest rates on longer-term instruments, or
low spending plans.
(6) Borrowing by nonfederal sectors appears to have remained
anemic in recent months, below the estimated growth of income, consis-
tent with the notion that credit supplies are still constrained and
spending is being supported in part by drawdowns of financial assets.
Consumer credit continued to decline in July and commercial bank data
suggest no growth in August and September. Bank real estate loans
fell over August and September; however, some of this decline undoub-
tedly is in commercial mortgages, and estimates of aggregate residen-
tial mortgage activity for the third quarter indicate that growth is
continuing at about the subdued second-quarter pace. Business borrow-
ing remains quite weak, likely reflecting continued sizable reductions
in inventories and reduced merger activity. Businesses continued to
raise substantial amounts in bond and equity markets, partly to fund
short-term debt. Supported by heavier borrowing by the federal
government, domestic nonfinancial debt growth appears to have picked
up to a pace of more than 5-1/2 percent in August, lifting the debt
aggregate to the lower end of its monitoring range.

Policy Alternatives
(7) Two short-run policy alternatives are presented below
for Committee consideration. Under alternative B, the federal funds
rate would be expected to remain centered on 5-1/4 percent, in as-
sociation with an initial specification for adjustment plus seasonal
borrowing of $325 million.7  Under alternative A, federal funds
would tend to trade around 4-3/4 percent, which could be fostered
either by lowering the borrowing specification by $50 million to $275
million or by lowering the discount rate by a further 1/2 point to
the present spread of the funds rate over the discount rate and thus
the current degree of cushioning of transitory shocks to the supply
and demand for reserves.
(8) Market participants in recent days appear to have built
in some prospects for additional easing of monetary policy in the
period ahead. Nonetheless, the unchanged federal funds rate associ-
ated with alternative B is unlikely to engender a marked backup in
yields in financial markets over the intermeeting period, so long as
incoming nonfinancial and monetary data are mixed, as would be the
case under the staff's forecast. Under those circumstances, the re-
cently lower exchange value of the dollar, too, probably will be
sustained. With elevated federal borrowing needs over the intermeet-
ing period continuing to place upward pressure on Treasury yields,
rate spreads on private instruments over Treasury securities also
would be anticipated to stay relatively narrow.
(9) The size and timing of the 1/2 percentage point drop in
the federal funds rate of alternative A would tend to catch financial
markets unawares, inducing almost as large a drop in other short-term
interest rates. In the context of weak money growth, such an easing
might be seen as signifying Federal Reserve concern that financial
conditions, including credit availability, were not consistent with a
moderate expansion of the economy. In these circumstances, long-term
rates would be likely to drop, at least initially, in normal propor-
tion to the decline in short-term rates. Should subsequent data
suggest, however, that the recovery is already on track and inflation
progress only moderate, long-term rates might back up a bit, as the
lower level of short-term rates appeared unsustainable. The value of
the dollar on exchange markets would ratchet lower in response to the
downward movement of interest rates in the United States relative to
those abroad.
(10) The sizable overpredictions of M2 and M3 growth over
recent months have heightened the uncertainty surrounding the staff's
projections of money growth. This experience has reinforced the
suspicion that the relationships are changing or that there are
factors affecting M2 demand--such as promotional activity for retail
deposits and opportunity costs with respect to long-term rates or tax-
adjusted consumer credit rates--that have not previously been given
sufficient weight. However, assessing the magnitude of their effects
is extremely difficult given the limited period of anomalous M2
(11) In making its projections, the staff has assumed that
the effects of some of these special factors will lessen a little in
coming months, so that somewhat faster growth in the broad aggregates
will resume. In particular, the stock adjustment to the current con-
stellation of various opportunity costs is seen as likely to abate
gradually, since holders of very liquid assets have already had ample
opportunity and incentive to shift portfolio holdings. In addition,
in light of the lengthening economic recovery and more certain income
prospects, money holders may be more willing to take on debt and thus
to resist a further steep decline in their real balances. On the
deposit-supply side, some recovery in bank credit seems in store for
coming months, which should show through to a more buoyant M2 as well
as M3. Finally, a little impetus to M2 in the fourth quarter is
likely to be provided by a pickup in growth in nominal GNP and spend-
ing. The staff's expectations for growth of the monetary aggregates
under the two policy alternatives are given in the table below, both
from September to December and from the fourth quarter of 1990 to
December. (The table and charts on the following pages contain more
detailed data.)

(12) Under the unchanged interest rates of alternative B, M2
growth is projected to pick up to a 3 percent rate over the last three
months of the year, leaving this aggregate at the lower bound of its

long-run range. M1 is expected to grow at a 6-1/2 percent pace
from September to December, producing a similar growth rate on a
quarterly average basis and another decline in M1 velocity in reflec-
tion of the recent drop in its opportunity costs.9  On a quarterly
average basis, a 2-1/4 percent rate of M2 growth would be implied for
the year's final quarter, up from the slight decline posted in the
third quarter. The gain in the velocity of M2 in the fourth quarter--
given the staff's projection of 6 percent growth for nominal GNP--
would be somewhat below the estimated 4-1/2 percent annual rate of
increase in V2 estimated for the third quarter. The implied 3-1/2
percentage point error in the staff's standard econometric model for
M2 growth would be about half the size of the record miss of the third
(13) Under alternative B, growth in M3 from September to
December is expected to strengthen to a 1-1/2 percent annual rate.
The runoff of commercial bank loans posted over the third quarter is
forecast to cease over the fourth quarter. With the strengthening of
bank capital positions progressing, and the default risk on some loan
applicants tempered by improving income prospects, bank lending terms
and conditions should remain stable and perhaps even start to ease a
little. Bank funding needs would be bolstered, cutting into the
paydown of their managed liabilities. The contraction of thrift
balance sheets, however, is likely to continue unabated in the fourth
quarter, in association with sustained heavy RTC activity, assuming
congressional appropriation of requested funding. Large time deposits
would still run off, albeit at a slower pace than over recent months,
and M3 expansion would continue to be lower than growth of M2.
(14) The debt of domestic nonfinancial sectors under alter-
native B is projected to grow at a 6-1/2 percent annual rate from
August to December, somewhat faster than the pace now estimated over
July and August. The implied growth from the fourth quarter of 1990
of 5-1/4 percent to December would move this aggregate further into
its 4-1/2 to 8-1/2 percent annual monitoring range. With the pickup
in GNP expansion, nonfederal debt growth is projected to rise to
around a 4 percent rate over the last four months of this year. The
strengthening is expected in a number of components, though growth
continues to be relatively sluggish, reflecting persisting credit
supply restraint and high spreads of lending over borrowing rates at
intermediaries. In the household sector, home mortgage debt growth
strengthens a little through year-end in the forecast, as the recovery
in housing sales remains subdued. Consumer credit is expected to
continue to contract, albeit at a slower rate. For businesses,
issuance of long-term debt should be sustained if intermediate- and
longer-term interest rates remain around current levels, while
business loans at banks and commercial paper outstanding should fall
noticeably less rapidly as inventory liquidation abates.
(15) The 1/2 percentage point decline in the federal funds
rate under alternative A would promote faster money growth than under
alternative B, improving the odds that the aggregates would end up in
the ranges. However, relative to previous bluebooks, the staff has
scaled back its estimate of the response of M2 growth to such a policy
easing. Rather than the customary 1-1/2 percentage point increment to
the growth rate of M2, we now estimate that the added growth would be
more on the order of 1 percentage point at an annual rate. With
returns on non-M1 components of M2 reaching their lowest levels in
several years and falling further relative both to rates on capital
market instruments and to household borrowing costs, households will
have stronger incentives from these channels to pare holdings of non-
transactions M2. This reasoning yields projected M2 growth over the
next three months under alternative A of 4 percent at an annual rate.
Our estimate of the responsiveness of M1 and M3 growth to monetary
policy easing, however, remains approximately unchanged, implying
growth rates of these aggregates of 8 and 2 percent, respectively,
from September to December.
