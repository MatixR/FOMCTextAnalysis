Prefatory Note 
 
 
The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version available 
based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the Board 
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was created 
through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned 
versions text-searchable.2   Though a stringent quality assurance process was 
employed, some imperfections may remain. 
 
Please note that some material may have been redacted from this document if that 
material was received on a confidential basis.  Redacted material is indicated by 
occasional gaps in the text or by gray boxes around non-text content.  All redacted

1  In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic 
format.  All scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced 
tilting) and lightly cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other 
blemishes caused after initial printing). 
 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optical character recognition computer program (OCR) 
first created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, 
staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.  Please note that the numbers and text in charts and 
tables were not reliably recognized by the OCR process and were not checked or corrected by staff.

MONEY MARKET AND RESERVE RELATIONSHIPS
Money markets
Recent developments. In late November and early December
before the discount rate increase the money market was coming under
seasonal pressure. Federal funds traded mostly at 4-1/8 per cent--
but also with increasing frequency at 4-1/4 per cent--dealer loan
rates moved into a higher range, and bill rates continued to edge
Following the discount rate advance, short-term market
rates generally, including those on Treasury bills, bankers'
acceptances, commercial paper, and certificates of deposit, adjusted
up by 1/8 - 1/4 per cent. The Federal funds rate, after some temporary
easing toward the end of the December 8 statement week, moved back to
around the new discount rate and dealer lending rates have also risen
to and slightly above 4-1/2 per cent.
The 3-month bill so far has fluctuated around the 4.34 per
cent issuing rate in the auction that followed the discount rate
announcement; this rate is apparently being influenced by the small
supply of short-term bills currently in dealer hands.
CD issuing rates posted by New York banks shortly after the
discount rate action ranged from 4-3/8 - 4-1/2 per cent for 30-89 day
money to 4.65 - 4.75 per cent for 6-month and longer-term deposits.
A national strucutre of CD rates has not yet taken form, but one large
bank today posted a rate of 4-3/4 per cent for 90-day CD money.

December 10, 1965.
CONFIDENTIAL (FR) -2-
In the December 8 statement week, free reserves averaged
$9 million as the System purchased a sizable amount of bills to
cushion the impact of the discount rate increase. Member bank
borrowings remained relatively high at $478 million, however, in
reflection of some apparent overborrowing in districts that still
had a 4 per cent discount rate. In the previous five weeks, net
borrowed reserves and member bank borrowings averaged about $85 mil-
lion and $440 million, respectively.
Prospective developments. The combination of the recent
discount rate action, widely fluctuating seasonal pressures over the
next four weeks, and forthcoming Treasury financings make estimation
of prospective interrelationships among money market variables
especially difficult at this time. If it were to be the Committee's
intent to moderate (but not fully offset) further adjustments of
money and credit market conditions, the staff estimates that net
borrowed reserves ranging around $100 million would likely be
associated with bill rates in a 4.30 to 4.45 per cent range. Some
seasonal pressure on dealer loan rates is to be expected and rates
in New York may climb to around 4-3/4 per cent, which may put some
upward pressure on bill rates. Federal funds should commonly trade
at 4-1/2 per cent and occasionally at 4.5/8 per cent. Chances of the
development of a premium funds rate will be lessened if banks find
it possible to obtain short-term CD money at rates around the
discount rate.
CONFIDENTIAL (FR)
The increase in CD ceiling rates seems to have eased the
possibility of a serious money market bind, especially around and
immediately after the tax date. But it is not yet clear how aggres-
sive banks will be in seeking CD money, and this raises the possibility
of repercussions on the bill market. In addition, the forthcoming
new supply of bills from Treasury financings could be a factor off-
setting the usual seasonal tendency for short-term rates to decline
after tax date pressures abate and as investment funds become increas-
ingly available early in the new year.
Long-term interest rates, like short-term rates, seem to
have passed through an initial phase of their adjustment to the
discount rate action. Little change in long-term rates is likely
in the weeks immediately ahead, and even some small and technical
rallies cannot be ruled out. On the other hand, the possibility of
significant additions to the corporate calendar and disclosure of the
full dimensions of the Treasury's probable cash financings in January
(around $3 billion) may disturb the current balance of market forces.
Reserve flows, bank credit, and money
Recent developments. In November, total reserves of member
banks turned down by an amount almost equal to their October rise,
as reserves required behind both private and Government demand deposits
declined. Nonborrowed reserves increased at a somewhat slower pace
than in the previous month, while borrowed reserves declined contra-
CONFIDENTIAL (FR) -4-
Prospective developments. Expansion in total reserves
appears likely to resume in December, encouraged by heavy year-end
credit demands and by a larger than seasonal rise in Government
deposits. Nonborrowed reserves should also continue to rise although,
despite the discount rate increase, banks may tend to cover somewhat
more of reserve needs through borrowings than they did last month,
when the power failure and even keel around the mid-November refunding
tended to keep borrowings down.
The System generally will be a seller of Government securities
in coming weeks, as reserves are supplied by the usual Christmas float
bulge and then, in January, by the return flow of currency from
circulation and seasonal loan repayments.
Bank credit growth on a daily average basis will be con-
siderably higher in December than November, reflecting in part the
temporary bulge of banks' underwriting of the Treasury bill financing
in late November. For the two months November-December combined,
an annual growth rate of 8-9 per cent might be expected, close to the
average for the year to date.
The amount of increase in bank credit in December depends
partly on banks' willingness and ability to obtain additional CDs,
given the flexibility under the new ceilings. In view of the large
CD maturities in December, and the reduced corporate liquidity
positions, the annual rate of net time deposit acquisition may drop
off to around 10 per cent this month, as compared with almost 17 per
CONFIDENTIAL (FR) -5-
cent in the two previous months. Parallel with this, however,
private demand deposits are likely to resume expansion this month,
at around a 4-5 per cent annual rate. This would bring private
demand deposit expansion for the year as a whole to near 4 per cent,
about the same as last year.
