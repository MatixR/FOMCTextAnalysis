MONEY MARKET AND RESERVE RELATIONSHIPS
Recent developments
Since the last meeting of the Committee on November 22,
there has been a modest easing of day-to-day money market conditions
and a more marked decline in longer-term bill rates. The 3-month
bill rate has moved down into a 5.10 - 5.20 per cent range and the
an average effective rate of slightly below 5-1/2 per cent; net
borrowed reserves of member banks have averaged $221 million during
the two full statement weeks in the interval; and borrowings have
averaged $542 million. Dealer loan rates in New York have usually
been in a 6 - 6-1/2 per cent range, and financing has been generally
available out of town at rates in a 5-1/4 - 5-3/4 per cent range.
This configuration of money market elements represents a
substantial easing from the rather tight conditions that had developed
in the first half of November when the 3-month bill had risen to
and member bank borrowings from the System were ranging between $600
and $700 million on average. But the day-to-day conditions at the
time of the last Committee meeting were already considerably easier--
when, to illustrate, the 3-month bill was about 5-1/4 per cent, and
Federal funds were trading near 5-1/2 per cent. Longer-term money
market rates, however, were still relatively high at that time--the

the most easing since then (including a decline in yields on
Federal agency issues).
The somewhat easier money market conditions of recent
weeks were accompanied by an expansion in certain monetary aggregates,
though by a little less than was implicit in the projections in the
last Blue Book. The money supply has been growing since mid-November,
with growth apparently in part accounted for by a reduction in U.S.
Government deposits (after rough allowance for shifting seasonal
patterns in tax receipts). Commercial banks have also had a less
unfavorable experience with respect to CD's as the decline in bill
rates made CD's more competitive.
Even with these recent developments, however, the bank
credit proxy (total member bank deposits) decreased at a 5.4 per
cent annual rate for the month of November as a whole. Money
supply also declined about 2 per cent on average in November, as
compared with a slight increase expected by the staff at the time of
the last FOMC meeting. There was an increase in nonborrowed reserves
in November, but total and required reserves declined further as
member banks reduced outstanding borrowings at the Federal Reserve
by about $160 million on average between October and November.
After rising sharply in early November, bank borrowings
in the Euro-dollar market were reduced as the month progressed, but
again rose markedly in early December. The average November level
CONFIDENTIAL (FR) -3- December 9, 1966.
of such borrowings was substantially above October, and after
allowance for them, the bank credit proxy in November would have shown
a smaller decline -- about 3 per cent.
The behavior of the various reserve and monetary aggregates
considered in conjunction with the easing of money market conditions
in recent weeks is consistent with the hypothesis that demands for
bank credit have been less strong, whether deterred by reported
tight lending standards or by less confident business prospects.
Business loan increases at banks were relatively moderate in early
fall, and slowed further in November (although a part of the recent
slowing may have reflected the speed-up into earlier months of
corporate payments to the Treasury of withheld income taxes). With
loan increases smaller, and given current administrative restrictions
at the discount window, banks have been willing to use some fraction
of available funds to strengthen their liquidity positions by reducing
their borrowings from the System. There have also been some reports
of renewed bank interest in acquiring municipal securities. Still,
the easing of money market conditions that has taken place has not
yet had much impact on reserve and bank credit growth.
Prospective developments
Assuming money market rates continuing about unchanged from
those prevailing currently (see first paragraph on page one), the
outlook for December suggests that bank credit is not likely to
show much, if any, expansion on average. The annual rate of change
CONFIDENTIAL (FR) -4- December 9, 1966.
in the bank credit proxy is likely to be within two percentage
points of zero, plus or minus, with aggregate reserves projected
as correspondingly weak.
The money supply is likely to increase, but projections
of the amount are clouded by the intermixture of usual mid-December
and year-end money market churning with rather special Treasury
financing patterns and general economic and Federal budgetary
uncertainties. A reasonable guess at present would put money
expansion at a 5-10 per cent annual rate in December, reflecting
a further shift out of U.S. Government deposits. This range allows
for a bulge in borrowing from banks by businesses, finance companies,
and Government security dealers related in part to December tax
period pressures and for some further run-offs in CD's.
Individual banks' expectations as to December CD experience
are diverse, with estimates for attrition at individual large money
market banks ranging up to about one-third of maturities. The staff
has assumed a run-off in a $700 million - $1 billion range during
the month, given the record volume maturities in the month
($5.5 billion), present rate relationships, and the usual sluggish
reflow of private funds into money market instruments after the
tax date. Total time and savings deposits at all commercial banks
are likely to rise at a 2-3 per cent annual rate in December,
reflecting projected continued growth of other time deposits.
CONFIDENTIAL (FR)
With respect to the impact of rate relationships on CD's,
it should be pointed out that investors have recently exhibited an
increased preference for extending maturities, as indicated in
the bill market by the relatively narrow spread that has emerged
between 3- and 6-month bills. As a result, bank CD experience may
be relatively more influenced in the period ahead by rates on longer-
term bills, especially those maturing around the March, April and
June tax dates. At the moment, the investment yield on a 6-month
bill is just under 5-1/2 per cent, while a 3-month bill yields about
Upward bill rate pressures could develop between now and
year-end. For one thing, System outright buying of bills in the
market has been reduced by the provision of reserves through reduction
in the Treasury balance at the Federal Reserve, through sales of special
certificates to the Treasury, and through foreign drawings on System
swaps to supply funds to the Euro-dollar market. This, in conjunction
with aggressive dealer bidding in recent Treasury bill financings,
has contributed to unusually large dealer bill inventories, especially
of longer-term bills. These bills may weigh heavily on the market
going into the dividend and tax period unless financing continues to
be readily available. Yet another factor tending to add to market
pressures in the period ahead may be increased bank demand for
Federal funds to replace any Euro-dollars lost as a result of foreign
year-end window dressing operations. In view of prospective year-end

money market churning, the level of net borrowed reserves consistent
with steady money market conditions may fluctuate widely in the weeks
ahead, and sometimes may have to be close to zero if current money
market rates are to be maintained in the face of peak seasonal
If the Committee wished to encourage somewhat easier
market conditions, however, this would appear to require net reserves
over the next four weeks consistently ranging around zero. Such a
net reserve position might be consistent with a 3-month bill rate
moving close to, and possibly below, 5 per cent and with a Federal
funds rate also moving down toward 5 per cent. Such a rate structure
might not fully emerge until early next year when normal seasonal
pressures abate.
Even if bill and other money market rates are thus reduced
by System action in the period ahead, this is not likely to generate
any prompt and substantial bank credit expansion because banks are
likely to be inclined to reduce their short-term borrowings further.
A modest rate of bank credit expansion, however, might be expected
as time passes since banks may be able to terminate net CD run-offs
and subsequently begin to add to outstandings. An easing of bank
liquidity positions would increase their willingness to add to
security portfolios and to accommodate loan demands. This, in turn,
would contribute to a better market for municipal and Federal

Government security issues (including participation certificates)
and probably to some renewed expansion of the money stock.
On the other hand, if loan demands do not hold up and
business activity is weaker than expected, banks might begin to lower
CD rates in line with reductions in bill rates, and transaction
demand for money may fall off. In such a situation, the rate levels
specified above would not be low enough to stimulate much of a bank
credit and money expansion.

TO: Federal Open Market Committee SUBJECT: Supplement to
FROM: The Staff Blue Book.
Since the current issue of the blue book, "Money Market
and Reserve Relationships" was prepared on Friday afternoon, aggressive
professional and investor buying interest in the Government securities
market has carried both bond and bill yields appreciably lower. As a
result, the first paragraph of the blue book text, which is given as a
reference for purposes of interpreting the staff's suggested Alterna-
tive A of the current directive, is out of date. To be fully current,
the second sentence of that paragraph should describe the 3-month bill
rate as moving down into a 5.00-5.15 per cent range rather than a 5.10-
5.20 per cent range; and the 6-month bill should be described as being
in a 5.10-5.20 per cent range rather than around 5.25 per cent. Such
bill rates, being thus at least temporarily lower relative to other money
market rates, probably also serve to raise slightly the rate of bank
credit expansion that can be expected to ensue from a maintenance of
"current money market conditions"; but their influence is not believed to
be strong enough to produce a December bank credit expansion much above
the range already specified in the blue book.
Committee members may wish to have these market changes in
mind in making any references to the blue book in this morning's
discussion.
