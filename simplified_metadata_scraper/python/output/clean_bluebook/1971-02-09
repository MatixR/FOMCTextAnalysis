MONEY MARKET CONDITIONS
Recent developments
(1) Late January data are still partially estimated, but there
appear to have been sizable shortfalls from the expected growth path for
the narrowly defined money supply (M1) in the last two weeks of the
month, as shown in the table on the following page. It now appears
that growth of the money stock for all of January was at about a 3 per
cent annual rate, below the 5-1/2 per cent rate projected at the time of
the last Committee meeting. In contrast to the shortfall in M1, more
broadly defined money supply (M2) increased somewhat more than expected
in January, as time and savings deposits other than large CD's grew
more rapidly in January than in December. The bank credit proxy grew
in January nearly as rapidly as expected at the last meeting.
(2) The sluggish January growth in the money supply occurred
despite efforts of the Trading Desk to achieve a faster rate of growth
by fostering easier money market conditions. For most of the period
since the last FOMC meeting, the daily effective Federal funds rate was
in a 3-7/8--4-1/4 per cent range, with heavy U.S. Government security
dealer positions built up in consequence of the refunding exerting some
upward pressure on the funds market. In the weeks immediately following
the last Committee meeting the Desk was aiming at a Federal funds rate
around 4-1/4 per cent, somewhat below the most typical rate prevailing

before the meeting. When the large shortfall of M1 below path for the
week of January 20 was finally confirmed (around January 28), the Federal
funds target was lowered to 4 per cent or a shade lower, and most recently,
with M1 data for the final week of January also coming in low, the target
was lowered to 3-3/4 per cent. In the latest two statement weeks, net
borrowed reserves averaged around $30 million and borrowing at the
Federal Reserve $320 million. This compares with $310 and $375 million,
respectively, for the preceding two statement weeks.
(3) The lower Federal funds rate in January, along with the
further cuts in the discount rate and in the commercial bank prime rate,
strengthened market expectations of further rate declines. In consequence,
seasonally enlarged flows of funds to banks and other financial institutions
were invested aggressively, and both short- and long-term market interest
rates dropped sharply. The 3-month Treasury bill, for example, was most
recently bid at around 4 per cent, about 65 basis points below its
level at the time of the meeting. Long-term rates are about 35-70 basis
points below levels at the time of the last meeting, after taking account
of the back-up in such yields over the past week.
(4) In the generally strong market environment, the Treasury's
quarterly financing operation, which included a pre-refunding of $13.5
billion of November 1971 and February 1972 maturities, was highly success-
ful. A total of $10.8 billion of the $19.5 billion of publicly held
eligible issues were exchanged, with $5.2 billion going into the new
per cent issue. Attrition on the $6.0 billion of February and March 1971
maturities totalled only $1.1 billion, or 18 per cent, despite the
absence of a short-term anchor issue in the refinancing. Most recently,
dealer positions in coupon issues maturing in more than a year totaled
$1.7 billion, although dealers have reported fairly good progress in
distributing their awards of about $1.1 billion of new issues.

Prospective developments
(6) The further shortfall of M 1 in January relative to FOMC
expectations indicates that a greatly accelerated rate of growth in M 1
will be required in February and March if the FOMC still wishes to attain
the March average level of the money stock that was targeted at the
previous two FOMC meetings. With January behind us, there is obviously
less time to make up a shortfall, and as a result a considerable amount
of reserves would have to be supplied over a relatively short period, with
a consequent sharp easing effect on money market conditions. A more
gradual make-up of recent shortfalls would require a less rapid provision
of reserves and less of an easing of money markets. Two alternatives for
making up the shortfall in M1 are indicated below in an effort to clarify
policy alternatives for the Committee. A third alternative, which
assumes no change from the money market conditions most recently prevail-
ing and involves no deliberate further effort to make up for past shortfalls
in M1, is presented at a later point.
(7) The table below summarizes two alternative paths for making
up the M1 shortfall. The first column--called alternative A--makes up the
shortfall by March and continues with a 6 per cent rate of growth in the
second quarter. The second column, alternative B, shows a path which does
not make up the shortfall by March; in other words, this alternative does
not retain as a target the March average level of M 1 set at the previous two
FOMC meetings. It does assume, however, that growth in M 1 would be greater
than 6 per cent in the second quarter as the shortfalls of the fourth
quarter and January are made up over a longer period. The particular path
would reach the same average level in June for M1 as indicated for
alternative A. And the growth rate over the 9 months from September
growth rates for the second quarter and the June level could, of course,
be greater if the Committee should decide that a trend growth rate of
more than 6 per cent is desirable for the longer run.

with the M1 quarterly pattern shown for alternatives A and B in paragraph (7).

money market appears to be required between now and the next meeting of
the Committee, for reasons indicated in paragraph (6). The alternative

--may entail a much lower Federal funds rate, perhaps ranging around 2-1/2
per cent, with the 3-month bill rate dropping to around 3 per cent. And
the net free reserve position of member banks is likely to average $150
million or a little more, as excess reserves build up, given the low interest
rates. It would be anticipated, however, that by early spring, the Federal
funds rate would have to rise rather sharply--to around 4-1/2 --5 per cent,
with a concurrent snapback in bill rates--as reserves are provided less
generously in order to move down to the assumed longer-run growth rate,
typified in alternative A by a 6 per cent growth in M1 for the second
(10) Since the alternative B pattern of growth in monetary
aggregates involves a somewhat less rapid February--March annual growth
rate for M1 of 9 per cent, attainment of this rate would seem to
involve a smaller reduction in the Federal funds rate than under alterna-
tive A--perhaps a funds rate in a 3--3-1/2 per cent range--and a net free
reserve position of $50-$150 million. The accompanying drop in the 3-
month Treasury bill rate might be into a 3-1/4--3-3/4 per cent range.
Because of the more gradual approach to making up the shortfall in M1
under alternative B, a sizable later snapback in money market rates would
not be expected. Still, in early spring the Federal funds rate and the
bill rate might be somewhat above the upper end of these ranges as reserves
are adjusted to bring growth in M1 onto a 7 per cent growth path for the
second quarter as a whole.
(11) The weekly paths for the monetary aggregates that would
be consistent with the monthly patterns for alternatives A and B between
now and the next meeting are shown in the table on the next page.
(12) The rate of inflow of time deposits other than large
CD's is expected to slacken later in February and March, following the
unusually rapid growth of the previous two months. A number of banks
have adjusted downward interest rates offered on consumer-type time and
savings accounts. This tendency is likely to become more widespread,
especially under alternative A, and may serve, along with an increase of
consumer spending as projected in the Green Book, to moderate savings
inflows. However, given the very rapid growth in time and savings deposits
other than large CD's that has already occurred and taking account of the
expected increase in M1, the rate of growth in M2 (M1 plus time and savings
deposits other than large CD's) is expected to be a very sizable 16-1/2
per cent annual rate in the first quarter. Under alternative B, the rate
of growth in M2 would be expected to be only slightly less rapid than
under alternative A. These estimates of M2 behavior in the future are
highly problematical because of uncertainties about the timing and extent
of bank cuts in offering rates on consumer-type accounts and the effect
of this on savers in a period of declining market interest rates.
(13) Growth in the adjusted credit proxy (rates of growth
are shown for alternatives A and B in the table on p. 8) will be influenced
by continued more moderate growth in large negotiable CD's following the
sharp expansion of earlier months. Banks have dropped offering rates sharply,
and the spread of CD rates over bill rates has narrowed. A pick-up in busi-
ness loan demand might make banks more willing borrowers through CD's, but bank

liquidity is substantial enough so that they could easily accommodate
borrowers by diverting funds from securities. Bank-related commercial
paper is expected to continue running off at about the recent $50-$100
million per week rate. We have assumed only minor further declines in
Euro-dollar borrowings.
(14) The preceding discussion has indicated that the money market
would probably have to be eased significantly further in order to make up
for recent shortfalls in M1. The Committee, however, may wish to consider
a policy of stabilizing the money market at around recently prevailing
conditions, given the sizable growth in M2 and the adjusted credit proxy
and the recent sharp drop in interest rates. Prevailing money market
conditions can be taken to include a Federal funds rate around 3-3/4--4
per cent, which would reflect the most recent objectives of the Trading
Desk; the 3-month bill rate might be in a 3-3/4--4-1/4 per cent range.
Assuming such conditions are maintained, monetary aggregates for the
remainder of the first quarter and for the second quarter, as well as
weekly paths, are shown in the accompanying table.
(15) With a policy of keeping to prevailing money market
conditions, termed alternative C, M1 growth in the first quarter would
be at a 6 per cent annual rate and no pick-up from this rate would be
anticipated in the second quarter. Thus, if the staff is correct in
this projection, the shortfalls in M1 growth for the fourth quarter and
January would not be recovered. A relatively rapid M1 growth would,
however, be expected in February and March as the effects of recent

interest rate declines gradually have an impact on demand fbr money
and on the assumption that the staff projection of a rapid GNP growth
in the first quarter materalizes.
(16) With the money market unchanged from recent easier con-
ditions, long-term interest rates may show some further declines, on
balance, over the coming weeks, as the sizable corporate and municipal
calendar and the overhang of new Treasury financing issues is worked
off. If money market conditions ease further--as would appear to be
necessary under alternatives A and B--long-term yields could be expected
to decline more sharply as banks make further aggressive efforts to
attract corporate borrowers and as investors react in anticipating
further rate declines.
Possible directive language
(17) This section presents possible language for the second
paragraph of the directive for the three alternative policy courses
discussed above.
(18) Alternative A. As noted earlier, this alternative is
proposed for possible use if the Committee decides that the shortfall
in January from the path associated with its earlier first-quarter
target growth rate (which in itself allowed for a make-up of the short-
fall that occurred in the fourth quarter) is to be made up in the re-
maining part of the first quarter.
"To implement this policy, the Committee seeks to promote
accommodative ccnditions in credit markets; GREATER GROWTH IN
THE NARROWLY DEFINED MONEY STOCK, MAKING UP THE SHORTFALL
FROM THE DESIRED GROWTH PATH THAT HAS DEVELOPED: and [DEL: moderate]
CONTINUED SUBSTANTIAL expansion in OTHER monetary and credit
aggregates. System open market operations until the next
meeting of the Committee shall be conducted with a view
to maintaining bank reserves and money market conditions
consistent with those objectives [DEL: taking account of the
forthcoming Treasury financing]."
The indicated language with respect to the aggregates (i.e., the
reference to the "narrowly defined money stock, ' followed by a separate
reference to "the other monetary and credit aggregates") is suggested
to make clear (1) that it is with respect to M1 that a shortfall is to
be made up, and (2) that the Committee is also taking account of the
behavior of key monetary aggregates other than M1.
(19) Alternative B. This alternative is proposed for possible
use if the Committee decides that past shortfalls are to be made up
over a period extending through the second quarter, and that the target
for growth of M1 in the first and second quarters should be set at 7
per cent. The Committee might choose such an approach in order to avoid
the type of "whipsawing' of money market conditions that paragraph (9)
suggests would be required to achieve annual rates of growth for M1 of
"To implement this policy, the Committee seeks to promote
accommodative conditions in credit markets, GREATER GROWTH IN THE
NARROWLY DEFINED MONEY STOCK, AND [DEL: moderate] CONTINUED RAPID expansion
in OTHER monetary and credit aggregates. System open market
operations until the next meeting of the Committee shall be
conducted with a view to maintaining bank reserves and money
market conditions consistent with those objectives [DEL: taking
account of the forthcoming Treasury financing]."
As will be noted, the language of alternative B differs from that of
alternative A only in the omission of the clause (following the reference
to the narrowly defined money stock) reading "making up the shortfall
from the desired growth path that has developed." Such a clause might
be considered unnecessary in this alternative in light of the extended
period over which the shortfall is to be made up.
(20) Alternative C. As will be noted, this alternative is
similar to the second paragraph of the directive issued by the Committee
on December 15, 1970. It is suggested for possible use if the Committee
decides not to seek to make up past shortfalls in M1 even over the more
extended time period, if doing so would require the degree of easing in
money market conditions suggested by the analysis in paragraphs (9) and
(10) above.
"To implement this policy, [DEL: the Committee seeks to promote
accommdative conditions in credit markets and moderate expansion in
monetary and credit aggregates.] System open market operations
until the next meeting of the Committee shall be conducted with a
view to maintaining PREVAILING [DEL: bank reserves and money] market con-
ditions, [DEL: consistent with these objectives, taking account of the
forthcoming Treasury financing] PROVIDED THAT MONETARY AND CREDIT
AGGREGATES APPEAR TO BE EXPANDING AT LEAST AS FAST AS PROJECTED."
The Committee may wish to have the proviso clause interpreted in terms
of the projections of M1 (or of M1, M2, and the bank credit proxy)
shown in the table on p. 13, based on the assumption of a continuation
of prevailing money market conditions. The proviso clause--like that
in the December directive--is formulated in a manner that would permit
growth in the aggregates at rates higher than projected, but would call
for easing of money market conditions to make up any shortfalls from
projections associated with this alternative.
