Prefatory Note
The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain.
Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a redaction process that removed information obtained on a 
confidential basis.  All redacted passages are exempt from disclosure under applicable 
provisions of the Freedom of Information Act.
1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked 
and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not 
reliably recognized by the OCR process and were not checked or corrected by staff.

MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES
Recent Developments
(1) As a result of deliberations at the November 5 FOMC meet-
ing, monetary policy was eased slightly the next day. The discount rate
was cut 1/2 percentage point to 4-1/2 percent, with federal funds
expected to fall 1/4 percentage point to around 4-3/4 percent. One
month later, as economic indicators continued to point toward a falter-
ing recovery and growth in the broad monetary aggregates remained slug-
gish, policy was eased again, with the funds rate moving to around 4-1/2
percent. In the initial policy move, the formal allowance for adjust-
ment plus seasonal borrowing was left unchanged, as a $25 million
increase in the allowance to reestablish a gap between the funds rate
and the discount rate was offset by an equivalent technical reduction to
take account of the ebbing of seasonal borrowing. Four more cuts of $25
million were made in the borrowing allowance over the remainder of the
intermeeting period--three of them were technical adjustments and one
was policy-induced. Borrowing averaged around its formal allowance over
the entire period, and federal funds generally traded quite close to
their intended level, averaging 4.78 percent over most of the period,
before softening to 4.50 percent in the days since the most recent
policy action.
(2) The Federal Reserve's actions and growing evidence that
the economic recovery had stalled contributed to substantial reductions
in U.S. interest rates and to a downward movement in the dollar exchange
rate. Most money market rates dropped 1/2 percentage point or more as
markets incorporated the declines in the federal funds rate and
anticipations of further near-term easing. The prime rate also came
down 1/2 point to 7-1/2 percent. Expectations of more subdued economic
activity contributed to declines in rates farther out the yield curve as
well. Rates on intermediate maturity securities decreased almost as
much as short-term rates, and the yield on thirty-year Treasury and on
corporate bonds dropped about 25 basis points over the period. Mortgage
rates also fell about 1/4 point and, at 8.53 percent, are now at a
seventeen-year low. Declines in interest rates were not sufficient to
offset the effect on stock prices of negative news on the economy and
profits, and broad stock indexes are down slightly on balance. Shares
in banking corporations were harder hit, and money center bank stocks
are down nearly 9 percent over the same period, owing in part to
Congressional consideration of a cap on credit card interest rates and
to passage of a bill without additional powers for banks.
(3) The decline in the weighted average exchange value of the
dollar was about 2-1/2 percent over the intermeeting period. Despite
the negative effects on the DM of events in the former Soviet Union, the
dollar fell more than 3-3/4 percent against the mark, reflecting expec-
tations by market participants of further tightening by the Bundesbank
in the near future. As a consequence, the mark was strong not only
against the dollar, but within the EMS as well;
The dollar declined a little less than 1 percent
against the yen, as evidence accumulated of a further slowing in the
Japanese economy and as the Bank of Japan eased monetary policy somewhat
(4) The cumulative drop in short-term market interest rates
over recent quarters and the associated decline in opportunity costs
contributed to a turnaround in M2 growth in the last two months.
Despite the sluggish growth in nominal income, the broader monetary
aggregates have shown some modest upward momentum after registering
declines over the third quarter. M2 grew at a 4-1/2 percent annual rate
in November and appears on track to meet the 3 percent pace for the
September-to-December period specified by the Committee at its last
meeting. M3 picked up to a 2-3/4 percent rate in November and most
likely will exceed somewhat the 1 percent rate expected for the three
month period. Both monetary aggregates remain right around the lower
bounds of their target ranges.
(5) The narrowing of opportunity costs has been most pro-
nounced for liquid deposits. Transactions deposits expanded at about a
20 percent rate last month, lifting Ml growth to 15-1/4 percent, despite
a slowing in currency. Savings deposits (including MMDAs) also rose
rapidly, but small time deposits and money fund shares continued to run
off. Much of this runoff no doubt represented a redirection toward
liquid deposits within M2, but part of it likely remained a net drag on
the aggregate as investors moved into capital market instruments in a
quest for higher yields. Inflows to bond and stock mutual funds, which
again were very heavy in October, are said to have remained robust in
(6) The resumption of M3 growth in the last two months was
fostered by a hiatus in RTC activity (which thus exerted less of a
depressing effect on thrift credit) and a strengthening in bank credit
growth in October and November. Bank credit was buoyed by continued
heavy acquisitions of U.S. government securities and by some turnaround
in loan growth in November. Total loans had been on the decline for a
number of months, but the resumption of growth in real estate loans and
strength in some small, but volatile, loan categories outweighed sizable
declines in business and consumer loans in November.
(7) Despite the turnaround in bank loans, growth in the debt
of domestic nonfinancial sectors, excluding the federal government, is
estimated to have stayed subdued in recent months. Financial inter-
mediaries have remained very cautious lenders, with intermediation
spreads showing little sign of narrowing, and borrowers have continued
restructuring balance sheets to reduce and lengthen debt. Nonfinancial
firms resumed issuing commercial paper in November and their bond
issuance has been substantial, but C&I loans have been weak, restraining
that sector's aggregate debt growth. With inventories evidently in
check and fixed investment expenditures down, business funding needs
have been relatively subdued. An additional factor holding down debt
growth has been the heavy issuance of corporate equities, as firms have
deleveraged and taken advantage of attractive stock prices. With mort-
gage rates coming down, home mortgage activity appears to have picked up
a bit, although much of the strengthening likely has been refinancings.
Gross bond issuance by state and local governments was strong last
month, as the cumulative drop in interest rates attracted more borrow-
ers, but with much of this for refunding purposes, net borrowing by the
sector remained subdued. Preliminary data suggest that total debt of
the nonfinancial sectors continued to grow at about a 6 percent pace in
October. Some ebbing of the rapid pace of federal debt growth points in
the direction of a slowing of overall debt in November.
(8) For the year, the debt aggregate is likely to grow at a 5
percent pace, toward the lower end of its 4-1/2 to 8-1/2 percent moni-
toring range. Federal government debt has expanded at around an 11-1/2
percent rate in 1991, with Treasury borrowing to finance the acquisition
of assets by deposit insurance funds adding 1/2 percentage point to
total debt growth. Excluding the federal government, debt increased at
a 3 percent rate over this period; in contrast to the pattern over the
1980s, this was about in line with nominal income. In addition to
slower growth of spending, borrowing has been held down by efforts to
reduce debt burdens--for example, by issuing equity and drawing down
monetary assets to finance spending. An additional factor restraining
credit growth and spending has been added caution on the part of some
lenders, as seen in tighter standards for credit and unusually stiff
price and nonprice terms.
(9) Reluctance to extend credit has been especially pronounced
at depositories, and has also been an element in the sluggish pace of
money growth. Constraints on credit supply, together with weak demand,
and the acquisition of thrift assets by the RTC resulted in a substan-
tial decline in total depository assets in 1991. M3 grew nonetheless--
though only 1 percent for the year--owing importantly to a marked rise
in money market funds over the year and substitutions of "Yankee" CDs
issued by foreign banks for non-M3 sources of funds since the cut in
reserve requirements one year ago. For retail deposits, institutions
have aggressively reduced offering rates on small time deposits, raised
fees, and cut back on advertising. In an effort to maintain returns in
the face of declining rates on M2 assets, many depositors appear to have
moved out a steepening yield curve into capital market instruments.
Partly as a result of these factors, M2 growth in 1991--at 2-1/2 per-
cent--has fallen about 3 percentage points short of the rate predicted
by the staff's money demand models. Instead of declining, as would have
been expected in response to the sharp narrowing of opportunity costs,
velocity is expected to post a slight increase over the year as a whole.

Policy Alternatives
(10) Two alternatives are given below for Committee considera-
tion. Under alternative B, the federal funds rate would continue to
center around 4-1/2 percent, in association with the allowance for ad-
justment plus seasonal borrowing staying at $75 million.3 Alterna-
tive A incorporates a 1/2 percentage point reduction in the funds rate
to 4 percent, which could be implemented in either of two ways--by
reducing the borrowing allowance to $25 million while keeping the dis-
count rate unchanged at 4-1/2 percent, or by cutting the discount rate
to 4 percent while keeping the borrowing allowance unchanged at its
current level. Although the former variant of alternative A, which
involves funds trading 1/2 percentage point below the discount rate,
would be technically possible, it likely would be associated with
somewhat greater day-to-day volatility in the funds rate. In addition,
the unusual negative spread could engender confusion among market par-
ticipants, with some speculating that a discount rate cut was imminent
and others perceiving a signal that monetary easing in this economic
cycle was over.
(11) Under the unchanged federal funds rate of alternative B,
interest rates may exhibit an initial tendency to firm a little, as
market expectations of another modest policy easing in the near term are
disappointed. If incoming data tend to confirm the staff's forecast of
some slippage in economic activity this winter, however, expectations of
policy easings of the scope now contemplated by the market are likely to
resurface, restoring the three-month Treasury bill rate to around its
current quote of 4.15 percent. Similarly, the exchange value of the
dollar could edge higher temporarily, but would probably end up trading
around recent lower levels. Bond yields could well move lower on bal-
ance by early next year, as the market's realization of the extent of
economic sluggishness tends to reduce both real rates and inflationary
expectations. However, any such bond market rally could be derailed if
it looks as though a political consensus is emerging on measures for
substantial fiscal stimulus; the effects on bond yields would be
especially adverse if it appeared that such measures would undermine the
discipline in last year's budget agreement intended to produce smaller
deficits over time. Announcement of a significant shift in Treasury
auctions away from longer-term notes and bonds and toward bills would
precipitate some decline in bond rates and rise in bill rates--judging
from recent market reactions to such proposals.
(12) Under alternative A, the 1/2 percentage point fall in the
funds rate to 4 percent would foster a smaller drop in other short-term
interest rates, given the expectations of near-term policy easing al-
ready incorporated in current market quotes. The three-month Treasury
bill rate would probably drop to around 4 percent or a bit below. The
prime rate would be cut by 1/2 percentage point, preserving its current
wide spread over funding costs. Bond yields also probably would decline
immediately, though by less than the drop in short rates. Unless data
were clear-cut in pointing to continuing weakness in the economy, the
half-point easing of alternative A--closely following the quarter-point
decline in the funds rate last week--would be seen as signalling a
priority on encouraging a strong recovery. As a result, any reduction
in inflation expectations would tend to be delayed. The exchange value
of the dollar likely would extend its recent decline. The staff
anticipates only modest decreases in foreign interest rates on average
over coming months, as cost pressures in Germany remain intense and
German interest rates put a floor under rates in other EC countries.
(13) Projected money growth rates under the two alternatives
over the interval from November to March are shown in the table below.
(More detailed data appear on the table and charts on the following
pages.) Growth in the broader aggregates is expected to continue at a
rather slow pace in coming months. Under alternative B, both M2 and M3
are projected to be only somewhat above the lower edges of their tenta-
tive 1992 target cones in March. Even under the lower short-term inter-
est rates associated with alternative A, these aggregates probably would
remain noticeably below the midpoints of their ranges.

(14) Growth in the broader monetary aggregates will continue
to be restrained by sluggish expansion of nominal income. Moreover,
other forces that have depressed money growth, and thereby buoyed
velocity relative to historical patterns, are expected to persist into
next year. Over the next four months, a resumption of resolutions of
insolvent thrifts and consolidations of banks imply a drag on retail
deposits and managed liabilities. More generally, depositories are
unlikely to bid aggressively for deposits, given prospects for virtually
no loan growth. Household balances probably will continue to be
deflected from M2 into capital market instruments, even if longer-term
market interest rates edge lower in response to weaker-than-expected
economic activity or further monetary policy easing. The differential

between longer-term market rates and returns on M2 balances still would
remain unusually wide, and any capital gains on market instruments could
augment their appeal to retail investors by boosting their reported
returns. Finally, the process of household deleveraging, involving
reductions both in borrowing and in acquisition of monetary and other
assets, is unlikely to abate substantially in coming months. Relative
to predictions of standard models of M2 demand, using the interest rates
of either alternative, the staff projections for the first quarter imply
around a 3 percentage point shortfall of M2 growth in the first quarter,
given greenbook income. However, some of the factors restraining
monetary expansion in the first quarter relative to income and interest
rates may well hold down subsequent spending as well, so that the slow
M2 growth cannot simply be interpreted as a benign downward shift in
money demand with no implications for spending.
(15) Under alternative B, both M2 and M3 are projected to grow
a little more slowly than their average rates over October and November.
M2 would be expected to post a 3 percent growth rate from November to
March, and M3 a 1-1/2 percent rate. Nominal income is projected to
grow at about the same rates in the fourth and first quarters, and
given the usual lags, the effects on money demand of the declines in
interest rates through early December also would be roughly comparable
in the two quarters. It is the resumption of RTC activity early next
year that is responsible for the slight ebbing of M2 growth. Restraint
on M3 growth will be exerted not only by heavier RTC activity but also
by a moderation in the expansion of bank credit and funding needs with
the fading of special factors that have boosted bank lending recently.
(16) The debt of domestic nonfinancial sectors is expected to
grow at a 5 percent annual rate from the fourth quarter of this year
through next March. Such growth would place the debt aggregate just
above the lower bound of the FOMC's provisional monitoring range for
next year. Federal debt likely will expand at about an 11 percent rate
through March, elevated in part by the financing of resolutions of
depository institutions. Nonfederal debt growth over the same interval
is seen remaining at nearly a 3 percent rate. This forecast assumes no
major change in the degree of caution exercised by borrowers or lenders.
However, further tightening of credit terms could result should lending
officers involved in upcoming bank consolidations begin to behave more
cautiously or should unanticipated deterioration in loan portfolios make
banks' access to funds more uncertain.
(17) The lower short-term interest rates associated with
alternative A would put M2 on a path that would carry it toward the
middle portion of its range later in 1992. This impetus would be
supplied in the first months of the year by lower opportunity costs of
holding money, and later by the boost to income flows from the decline
in interest rates. From November to March, M2 is projected to turn in a
3-3/4 percent growth rate under alternative A. The acceleration would
be wholly concentrated in liquid deposits, which should respond to the
narrowing of their opportunity costs. While deposit rates will be
reduced further--perhaps appreciably at some institutions, if lower
market rates jolt them into reassessing long-standing rates on NOW
accounts and passbook savings--they are not likely to drop enough to
eliminate the additional stimulus to money growth of the lower interest
rates in alternative A. The induced pickup of inflows to liquid depos-
its should more than offset greater outflows from small time deposits
and M2-MMMF shares into capital market instruments with increasingly
attractive relative returns. The faster M2 growth under alternative A
will show through to M3, though in muted form, since bank and thrift
credit growth will accelerate by less than M2 in the short run.
Directive Language
(18) Draft language for the operational paragraph, including
the usual options and updating, is presented below.
OPERATIONAL PARAGRAPH
In the implementation of policy for the immediate
future, the Committee seeks to decrease somewhat/MAINTAIN/
INCREASE SOMEWHAT the existing degree of pressure on reserve
positions. Depending upon progress toward price stability,
trends in economic activity, the behavior of the monetary
aggregates, and developments in foreign exchange and domestic
financial markets, slightly (SOMEWHAT) greater reserve
restraint might (WOULD) or slightly (SOMEWHAT) lesser reserve
restraint (MIGHT) would be acceptable in the intermeeting
period. The contemplated reserve conditions are expected to
be consistent with growth of M2 and M3 over the period from
NOVEMBER THROUGH MARCH [DEL: September through December] at annual
rates of about ____ AND ____ [DEL: 3 and 1] percent, respectively.
Directive Sentence on Possible
Intermeeting Changes
At its meeting on August 20, the Committee discussed the
sentence in the directive that includes a listing of the factors that
guide possible changes in monetary policy during intermeeting
periods. The sentence currently reads as follows:
Depending upon progress toward price stability, trends
in economic activity, the behavior of the monetary
aggregates, and developments in foreign exchange and
domestic financial markets, slightly greater reserve
restraint might or slightly lesser reserve restraint
would be acceptable in the intermeeting period.
At the suggestion of the Chairman, Governor Kelley subsequently
polled the members with regard to their preferences among three
alternative proposals that were made during the meeting. In a
memorandum to the Committee dated September 25, 1991, Governor Kelley
reported an inconclusive result: seven members were in favor of retain-
ing the current list (subject to a formal review each year); seven pre-
ferred to reword the factors, keying them more directly to the Commit-
tee's long-run ranges and making them sufficiently general to apply in
most circumstances without raising the issue of relative ranking: and
two opted for eliminating the listing altogether and explaining the
Committee's guidance from meeting to meeting in the text of the policy
Of the many members who expressed an interest in reviewing the
directive sentence at least yearly, several indicated a preference for
doing so at the December meeting. Three alternatives are presented

below for consideration at the upcoming meeting. The Committee would,
of course, retain the option of revising the language at every meeting
and of introducing special language in the event of unusual developments
such as the stock market crash in October 1987. In any case, on the
basis of the comments communicated earlier by many members, the Commit-
tee might want to review this directive instruction formally at least
once every year.
Proposed Alternatives
long-run objectives and sufficiently general to apply in most circum-
stances without raising questions about the ranking of the factors. One
proposal along these lines is:
In the context of the Committee's long-run objectives
for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and
giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and
monetary developments, somewhat/slightly greater reserve
restraint or somewhat/slightly lesser restraint would/
might be acceptable in the intermeeting period.
the current approach with its list of factors.
If the Committee were to decide to retain this
approach, a separate question would be whether to change the order of
the factors themselves at this time. The existing order gives prece-
dence to what the Committee may consider to be its most important long-
run objective, that of achieving price stability. Moreover, the evi-
dence of progress toward that objective has been an important factor in
the Committee's willingness to ease. Alternatively, the members may
wish to change the order at least for the near term by moving the
reference to trends in economic activity to the head of the list.
Because the sentence on intermeeting adjustments is in the operational
paragraph, a change in ordering could be viewed as desirable if the
Committee had as its near-term priority promoting a pickup in the
economy and wished to emphasize that point. This need not imply that
the Committee now considers the long-term objective of price stability
to be any less important--and this point could be emphasized in the
policy record--because the lead sentence in the directive paragraph on
the long-run ranges would continue to indicate that "the Committee seeks
monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and
promote sustainable growth in output."
factors altogether and to provide any desired explanations of the
Committee's thinking in the text of the policy record. In this case,
the relevant sentence might read:
Somewhat/slightly greater reserve restraint or somewhat/
slightly lesser reserve restraint would/might be accept-
able in the intermeeting period.
