of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was created 
through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned 
versions text-searchable.2   Though a stringent quality assurance process was 
employed, some imperfections may remain.

format.  All scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced 
tilting) and lightly cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other 
blemishes caused after initial printing). 
 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optical character recognition computer program (OCR) 
first created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, 
staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.  Please note that the numbers and text in charts and

Recent developments
(1) M1 declined at about a 3 per cent annual rate in October,
but data for early November are consistent with the staff forecast of
a substantial rebound in the current month. For the two-month target
period, M1 is projected to expand at an annual rate of about 4 per
cent, somewhat above the low end of the Committee's range of tolerance.
With growth in consumer-type time deposits a little stronger than
projected, M2 is expected to grow at about a 7½ per cent annual rate over
the two-month target period--somewhat above the mid-point of its
tolerance range.

(2) There was some increase in total short-term business credit in
October. Outstanding business loans at banks expanded by a relatively sizable
amount, mainly at banks outside the major money market centers, but this was
offset in part by another decline in commercial paper issued by nonfinancial
corporations. Outstanding bank CD's have shown little change since the
build-up that occurred in late September and early October. While this
mainly reflected the continuing weakness in business loans at large banks,
several New York City banks appear to have experienced some investor reluctance
to acquire their CD's and did not aggressively seek such funds. These banks
also relied less than they usually do on purchases of Federal funds during
the past month and generally have lengthened the maturities of their managed
(3) Immediately following the October FOMC meeting, the Desk
sought reserve conditions consistent with a Federal funds rate in a 5½ to
to 5 per cent unless incoming data on the aggregates indicated more rapid
growth. Data available shortly after the Committee meeting did in fact
suggest some strengthening in monetary growth causing the Desk to slow the
movement to a 5½ per cent rate. As a result, the funds rate averaged 5.65
per cent in the week ending October 29. When subsequent data suggested a
considerable weakening in the aggregates, the Desk followed a more
accommodative approach to reserve provision, and the funds rate moved to the
funds rate dropped increasingly below the discount rate, member bank borrowing
dwindled. Although the latest data indicate a strengthening in the aggregates,
the Desk has continued to aim at a funds rate around 5 per cent in view
of the proximity of the November Committee meeting and the continuing un-
certainties affecting financial markets.
(4) Short-term rates dropped another 20-50 basis points over the
intermeeting period, with the largest decline occuring in Treasury bill-rates. In
longer-term markets yields have also declined somewhat further except on
municipals. Municipal yields which had declined in early October from the
peak reached at the turn of the month, advanced again in late October and
early November. Most recently, however, some of this advance has been erased
as the market has come to believe that a settlement of the New York problem
is in the offing.
(5) Deposits at savings and loan associations and mutual savings
banks grew during October at an annual rate of around 11 per cent, about
the same as in September. Given the sharp declines in market rates, managers
of thrift institutions reportedly have become more optimistic about the
future course of deposit flows and therefore less cautious about extending
new mortgage commitments. Interest rates on primary mortgages have dropped
slightly; the Home Loan Bank series shows a decline in the average rate on
new commitments for 80 per cent conventional mortgages from 9.25 to 9.17
per cent over the intermeeting period. In the secondary market, average
yields in FNMA auctions dropped about 30 basis points.

Prospective developments
(7) Summarized below for Committee consideration are three
alternative sets of short-run specifications for monetary aggregates
and the Federal funds rate. All three alternatives are intended to be
consistent with the FOMC's longer-run objectives for the aggregates, as
indexed by a 5-7½ per cent rate of growth in M1 from QIII '75 to QIII '76.
Each of the alternatives, therefore,implies a different pattern of interest
rate developments, as summarized in appendix table IV and as explained
in the ensuing paragraphs.
Alt. A Alt. B Alt. C
Ranges of tolerance
for November-December
(8) Under alternative B the Federal funds rate range is
centered around the recently prevailing 5¼ per cent level. M is once
again expected to begin growing at a reasonably rapid rate; under this
alternative growth over the two-month November-December period is
estimated to be in a 6½-8½ per cent annual rate range. The main basis
for this expectation is the growing need for transactions balances
associated with the 14½ per cent annual rate of expansion in nominal
GNP projected by the staff for the fourth quarter M1 growth in Nov.-Dec.
at an annual rate of 7½ per cent--the midpoint of the indicated range--would

result in expansion from QIII '75 to QIV '75 at a rate of about 2¾ per cent,
implying a rise in income velocity at about an 11 per cent annual rate between
those quarters. This would be an extremely large rise even for the early
stages of an economic recovery, particularly if, as assumed, it is not
associated with upward interest rate pressures during the quarter.
(8) Such a large rise in velocity would not appear to be long
sustainable at current interest rate levels, given the reduction in the
public's cash balances relative to income that has already occurred and
given the continued, even though somewhat diminished, rate of expansion
projected for nominal GNP in 1976. With the demand for money likely to
continue to rise, the staff would expect the Federal funds rate to increase
in the course of next year if the rate of growth in M1 is to average near
the mid-point of the FOMC's longer-run target range of 5-7 per cent. By
summer, the funds rate might peak out at around 7½ ½er cent. This would be
lower than had been projected by the staff at the time of the last meeting.
(9) If the funds rate shows little change over the next few
could show some tendency to rise from its recent trading level of about
holiday season will coincide with continued sizable net additions to
outstanding bills by the Treasury to raise new cash. Short-term rates will
also be heavily influenced by developments with respect to New York. A
resolution of the problem would affect attitudes and expectations in a manner
likely to put upward pressure on rates, whereas a dashing of hopes would
have the opposite effect.
(10) With bond volume in the corporate and municipal markets
expected to be generally moderate, longer-term market interest rates are
likely to show little further net change between now and year-end under the
specifications of alternative B. If the New York situation is resolved
without default, yields in the municipal market could well show significant
declines. Primary mortgage market yields are likely to edge down over the
period ahead in lagged reaction to earlier declines in short-term interest
rates and corporate bond yields, and in light of a continued relatively
comfortable inflow of savings funds to thrift institutions.
(11) Both banks and nonbank thrift institutions may experience
more favorable net inflows of time and savings deposits over the next
several weeks than they had in late summer and early fall, when market
interest rates were higher. However, very recent experience suggests
no more than a modest pick-up. Because upward pressures on interest rates
in the fourth quarter of 1975 and now projected for 1976 are weaker than
those antitipated earlier, consumer-type time deposit flows are no longer
expected to slacken substantially in the near future. Accordingly, the date
for an assumed upward adjustment in Regulation Q ceiling rates has been
shifted forward, from year-end to mid-1976.
(12) Alternative A contemplates a modest further decline in
the Federal funds rate between now and the next Committee meeting, to the
making for a rebound in growth of the monetary aggregates and would also
uncertainties with regard to municipal markets and banks continue. We
would expect that such a reduction in the funds rate would have to be reversed
at least by early next year in order to keep longer-run growth in M1 at
around the mid-point of the 5-7½ per cent range, and that by Spring the funds
rate would be around 7¾ per cent.
(13) A reduction in the funds rate over the next few weeks of
about the dimensions contemplated under alternative A would probably be
accompanied by similar declines in other short-term rates and by some further
decline in longer-term market rates. Mortgage market yields would also be
likely to drop as the outlook for continued savings inflows brightens. But
declines in mortgage yields, as well as in security rates, may be limited
insofar as market participants view the easing in money market conditions
as temporary. Market attitudes will, of course, be influenced by the nature
of incoming economic news and by the degree of use, if any, of other monetary
policy instruments.
(14) Alternative C involves some rise in the Federal funds rate
a reversal in the recent trend of the funds rate would likely be accompanied
by a sharp rebound in market rates; the 3-month bill rate, for example, might
promptly move up to the 6-6½ per cent area. But if interest rates are pushed
up over the next few weeks, it is likely that less of an increase would
be required over the longer run than under alternatives A or B, since an
early start will have been made in restraining money demand. It seems
probable that the alternative C strategy might lead to a funds rate that
peaks out at around 6¾ per cent next year. Thus, over the longer run this
approach would place less pressure on banks and thrift institutions. In the
short run, however, recent easing tendencies in bank and mortgage loans rates
would be quickly reversed.
(15) Among the assumptions made in developing the specifications
presented in this blue book are: (a) no more than modest business loan growth
at banks in view of (i) expected conservative inventory investment policies
by business that would limit their demand for bank credit and (ii) continued
relatively cautious bank lending policies; and (b) unwillingness of major
banks to actively press CD's on the market in the period immediately ahead.
In addition, it has been assumed that there will be no significant further
impairment of confidence in the municipal market and banks.
Proposed directive
(16) Given below is a proposed operational paragraph if the
Committee wishes to continue formulating its instructions in terms of
desired growth in monetary aggregates over the months ahead. No alternatives
are presented for this formulation, in the expectation that the reference to
desired growth will be taken to apply to the longer-term targets and that at
this meeting the Committee will not reconsider its present 5 to 7 per cent
target range for M1, with which all of the short-run operating alternatives
discussed in the preceding sections are consistent.
"Monetary Aggregate" proposal
To implement this policy, while taking account of
developments in domestic and international financial
markets, the Committee seeks to achieve bank reserve and
money market conditions consistent with moderate growth in
monetary aggregates over the months ahead.
(17) Should the Committee desire to formulate the directive in
terms of bank reserve and money market conditions, the language needed would
depend on the specific conditions sought. Alternative "money market"
directives intended to correspond to the similarly lettered policy alternatives
are given below.
Alternative "Money Market" proposals

ments in domestic and international financial markets, the Committee
