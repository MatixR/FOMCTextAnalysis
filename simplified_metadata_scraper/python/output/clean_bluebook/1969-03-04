of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was created 
through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned 
versions text-searchable.2   Though a stringent quality assurance process was 
employed, some imperfections may remain.

format.  All scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced 
tilting) and lightly cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other 
blemishes caused after initial printing). 
 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optical character recognition computer program (OCR) 
first created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, 
staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.  Please note that the numbers and text in charts and

MONEY MARKET AND RESERVE RELATIONSHIPS
Recent developments
(1) Evidence of the System's current firm policy posture has
become more widespread in the four weeks since the last Committee meeting.
Apart from yields on short-term billsboth short- and long-term interest
rates have generally edged higher on balance. The 3-month bill rate, at near
to a low of around 6 per cent in the third week of February, given the
relative scarcity of supply and strong liquidity demands by investors.
Subsequently the bill rate recovered, reflecting partly anticipations of
further prime rate and/or monetary policy moves and partly market reaction
to the rise in the British bank rate to 8 per cent.
(2) The Treasury's February refunding resulted in an attrition
of $2 billion, or 36 per cent of public holdings of the maturing issues,
with only $800 million of such holdings being exchanged for the 6-1/4 per
cent 7 year note. Thus, a sizeable demand for bills from the attrition
in the refunding was added to other bill demands. The Treasury's
announcement in February of a $1 billion bill "strip," consisting of
$200 million additions to the monthly bills maturing in April-August,
provided some relief for the scarcity conditions in the bill market.
(3) Demands for Federal funds in the market increased during
the period as the basic reserve position of major New York banks swung

from a small surplus in the last week of January and early February to a
sizeable deficit on average in the past three weeks. During this period
banks were unable to build up Euro-dollar borrowings much further, although
paying increasingly high interest rates. Under the pressure
of market demands, and in view of the tendency for short
bill rates to decline throughout much of February, the Federal funds rate
was permitted to rise, with the daily effective rate often 6-3/4 per cent
and occasionally higher--though the average rate was around 6-1/2 per cent.
(4) Member bank borrowings in the last four statement weeks
have ranged roughly between $750 million and $1 billion, but were closer
to the lower number in three of the four weeks. The average level of
borrowings during the period--$836 million--was about $120 million above
that of the preceding four weeks. The increase took place mainly at
reserve city banks outside New York and Chicago and to a lesser extent
at country banks. Excess reserves during the recent four weeks remained
near earlier reduced levels, and net borrowed reserves were generally in
a $500 - $700 million range.
(5) Bank credit in February, as measured by the proxy plus
Euro-dollar borrowings through foreign branches, is now estimated to have
increased at about a 2 per cent annual rate, compared to a 0 to 3 per
cent rate of decline projected in the last Blue Book. The relative
strength in the proxy reflects primarily a stronger-than-anticipated
performance of private demand deposits at member banks, including inter-
bank deposits. The money supply is estimated to have grown at a 2-1/2 per
cent annual rate, instead of declining. Currency grew more than expected,
and the larger-than-anticipated attrition in the mid-February refunding
led to a higher average level of private demand deposits.
(6) Time and savings deposits declined at about a 9-1/2 per
cent annual rate on average in February, impelled mainly by continued
attrition of CD's, estimated at around $1 billion over the course of
the month. Other time and savings deposits, after contracting in January,
began to rise in February in about seasonal proportions.

major reserve and deposit aggregates for 1968 and for the first two
months of 1969:

Prospective developments
(8) Over the coming four weeks, the relationships among day-
to-day money market rates, marginal reserve measures, and other short-
term market variables may continue roughly in track with experience of
the past two months, as best can be gauged at this point. A 3-month bill
in a 6 - 6.25 per cent range might be consistent with a Federal funds
rate averaging in a 6-3/8 - 6-5/8 per cent range, with member bank
borrowings in a $700 - $900 million range, and net borrowed reserves in
a $500 - $700 million range. However, both the Federal funds and member
bank borrowings could move higher at times in reflection of shifting
borrowing tactics by banks as they adapt to potential and actual money
market strains--for example, in connection with tax dates.
(9) In addition to the possibility of a prime loan rate
increase and the high cost of Euro-dollar funds, two other influences
may tend to sustain bill rates in the projected range over the period
immediately ahead. One is the Treasury's stated need to raise around
$2 billion of new cash for payment in early April, which presumably
will be in the short-term area. The other is possible large demands by
business for short-term financing from banks or in the market to meet
relatively large March-April corporate income tax payments at a time
when there may still be a relatively large, even though diminishing,
need to finance additional inventories.
(10) However, there is some probability that the 3-month Treasury
bill rate may drop below the lower end of the range as March progresses,
even within a generally unchanged constellation of other money market
conditions. Such a decline would hinge on the effects of the beginnings
of seasonal repayment of Federal debt, in combination with continuation
of recent pattern of very limited market supplies of short bills and
sizeable market demands for short-term instruments. These demands may
reflect in part liquidity desires of institutional investors and
individuals who may be uncertain about, among other things, future
stock market trends. The bill rate may also tend to decline if the much-
rumored prime loan rate increase does not develop.
(11) Demands for day-to-day borrowings by banks are likely
to be reinforced in the weeks ahead by continued attrition in outstanding
CD's at a time of expected strong seasonal loan demands and reduced bank
liquidity. In March, outstanding large CD's at banks are expected to
decline by about a further $1 billion, assuming a bill rate at around
the mid-point of the range noted in paragraph (8). Other time and
savings at banks are expected to show a little more than seasonal growth.
Overall, total time and savings deposits are likely to decline in a 3 - 6
per cent, annual rate, range.
(12) The money supply is likely to show a marked bulge in
March--to expansion in a 6 - 9 per cent annual rate range--as U.S.
Government deposits are drawn down sharply, on average, following a
build-up, seasonally adjusted, in the previous two months. The March
rate of money supply growth is not expected to be sustained into spring,
since it is anticipated that transactions demands for cash will be
moderating in line with slower GNP growth and that Government cash
balances will be rising from their average level in March.
(13) With time deposits continuing to contract on average,
with total demand deposits showing little net change (as U.S. Government
deposit declines offset private demand deposit increases), and with
borrowings abroad costly and perhaps limited in availability, outstanding
bank credit is expected to decline somewhat, on average, in March. As
measured on a daily-average basis by total member bank deposits, the
bank credit proxy is expected to decline in a 4 - 7 per cent annual rate
range. If Euro-dollar borrowings remain at about current levels, the
adjusted bank credit proxy is likely to decline in a 3 - 6 per cent
annual rate range. This decline is not expected to persist into April;
continued CD attrition may be roughly offset by a build up in U.S.
Government deposits and growth in other time and savings deposits at
somewhat more than a seasonal pace, assuming the bulk of interest-
sensitive funds in this category of deposits have already been withdrawn.
(14) The expected continued strength of loan demands at banks
in the face of reduced availabilities of funds suggests that banks will
be forced to continue liquidating U.S. Government securities, to withdraw
further from the municipal market, and perhaps to begin reducing their
advances to the mortgage market. Thus, long-term interest rates are
expected to continue under upward pressure. Any reduction in over-all
credit demands either because of the high cost of borrowing generally or
because of a slowing in economic expansion would tend to counteract the
upward rate pressures generated by the immediate impact of monetary policy
on bank reserves and credit.
