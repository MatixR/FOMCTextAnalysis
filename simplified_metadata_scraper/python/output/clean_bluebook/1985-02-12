Prefatory Note
The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain.
Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a redaction process that removed information obtained on a 
confidential basis.  All redacted passages are exempt from disclosure under applicable 
provisions of the Freedom of Information Act.
1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked 
and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not 
reliably recognized by the OCR process and were not checked or corrected by staff.

MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES
Recent Developments
(1) The monetary aggregates expanded rapidly over the last
two months. Growth in M1 was at a 10.4 percent annual rate in December and
a 9 percent rate in January, above the growth path for November to March of
7 percent established by the Committee at its last meeting. 1 M2 and M3
over the past two months increased considerably more rapidly than their
short-run objectives of 9 percent, rising on average by 14 and 13-1/2
percent at an annual rate, respectively. From the fourth quarter of 1983
to the fourth quarter of 1984 M1 is now estimated to have grown 5.2 percent,
somewhat below the midpoint of the 4 to 8 percent growth range for the year
while M2 expanded 7.7 percent, just above the midpoint of its 6 to 9 percent
range; M3 grew by 10.5 percent, well above its 6 to 9 percent range.
(2) All of the major components of M1 contributed to its recent
strength, which has reflected the decline in interest rates since late
summer and the lift in economic activity in the fourth quarter. Growth of
M2 and M3 continued to be boosted by the tendency for declines in rates on
both MMDAs and MMMFs to lag the decrease in market rates. The reduction in
the minimum balance for super NOW accounts and MMDAs apparently had little
impact on either M1 or M2. Flows into these accounts picked up early in
the year, but contacts with banks and examination of data suggest that any
shifts to take advantage of the lower minimums came, in the case of super

MMDAs, out of other components of M2.
(3) The debt of domestic nonfinancial sectors is estimated to
have expanded at about a 14 percent annual rate in December, bringing
growth for the year to 13.4 percent, considerably above the annual moni-
toring range of 8 to 11 percent for 1984. Unusual merger activity and
share repurchases contributed about one percentage point to credit growth
last year. In addition, growth was raised a little--perhaps 1/4 of a
percentage point--by a rush of tax-exempt securities toward year-end in
advance of a lightening of certain restrictions.
(4) Total reserves increased at an average annual rate of 25
percent over December and January, as transactions accounts expanded
rapidly. With borrowing at the discount window declining over the two
months, nonborrowed reserves increased somewhat more rapidly, at an average
annual rate of 33 percent. The nonborrowed reserves path has been con-
structed over the entire intermeeting period on the assumption of sea-
sonal plus adjustment borrowing of $300 million. In the first part of
the period the Desk conducted operations in such a way as to tilt the
odds toward a reserve provision consistent with borrowing of $300 million
or somewhat less. More recently, with the aggregates running above the
FOMC's short-run paths, open market operations have been conducted with-
out such a tilt. Borrowing averaged $260 million in the first complete
reserve period in January, following a bulge in both excess reserves and
borrowing over the year-end statement date. In the following reserve
period ending January 30 and during the first half of the current reserve
period, borrowing has averaged $389 million, with excess reserves running
somewhat stronger than anticipated.
(5) Federal funds have traded mostly in an 8 to 8-1/2 percent
range over the intermeeting period, averaging just over 8-1/4 percent.
During the last week of January and into the early days of February, trad-
ing was mostly near the upper end of this range, and for a few days above
it. This development, taken together with the strength in money growth and
the relatively good performance of the economy, worked to eliminate ex-
pectations in the market that the Federal Reserve would ease further and
tended to raise concerns that the System might be seeking tighter reserve
conditions. Since the previous Committee meeting, short-term rates have
risen 20 to 40 basis points. Long-term rates fell sharply in late January
when prospects for oil prices seemed to portend a more favorable inflation
outlook; these rate declines have been largely reversed subsequently in
response to rising short-term rates and a mid-quarter Treasury financing
package that was a little larger than anticipated. On balance taxable
bond yields are up about 5 to down about 10 basis points over the period.
(6) The dollar has appreciated by about 5-1/4 percent on a
weighted average basis since the last Committee meeting to reach a new
record high. Some of the dollar's recent strength may be attributable to
indications that U.S. economic activity is more robust than had been anti-
cipated two months ago. Lower than expected U.S. trade deficits for
November-December may also have helped to boost the dollar.
The United States sold $321 million, of which $272 million was against
marks and the remainder against yen.
Alternative monetary growth ranges for 1985
(7) Three alternative long-run growth ranges for the year 1985
(QIV to QIV basis) are shown below for Committee consideration, along with
the tentative ranges for that year adopted in mid-1984.1 Alternative II
encompasses the growth ranges for the monetary aggregates adopted in July,
but includes a higher range for credit. Alternatives I and III call for
somewhat higher and somewhat lower rates of growth, respectively, in the
monetary and credit aggregates.
Adopted in
Alt. I Alt. II Alt. III mid-1984
Ml 4 to 8 4 to 7 3-1/2 to 6-1/2 4 to 7
M2 6 to 9 6 to 8-1/2 5-1/2 to 8-1/2 6 to 8-1/2
M3 6-1/2 to 9-1/2 6 to 9 5-1/2 to 8-1/2 6 to 9
Total credit 9-1/2 to 9 to 12 8-1/2 to 11-1/2 8 to 11
12-1/2
(8) The growth ranges of alternative II were taken as the basis
for the staff's projection of growth in nominal GNP for 1985 of 7-1/4 per-
cent; it was assumed that growth of M1 would be in the upper part of its
range, with interest rates expected to be around, or somewhat higher than,
current levels. Growth in the other monetary aggregates may be close to
the upper limits of their ranges, in part reflecting the strong expansion
expected in the first quarter. To the degree that interest rates rose
somewhat as the year progressed, M2 and M3 growth would more likely be
held within the ranges.
(9) The income velocity of M1 will probably increase much less
this year than in 1984, falling to a rate of increase of perhaps one per-
cent or so, to a degree reflecting a carry-through effect on the year of
the expected contraction of M1 velocity in the first quarter (as a result
of the lagged impact on money demand of late '84 interest rate declines).
So low a rate of increase for the year in velocity would also be noticeably
less than average experience in the third year of earlier expansions-a
period, however, when short-term interest rates in the past rose on aver-
age by about one-third, a rise that is not now expected in the current
expansion. The expected growth in M1 velocity over 1985 would be in the
neighborhood of, probably on the low side of, its likely long-run trend.
That trend may be currently estimated at 1 to 2 percent per year (abstrac-
ting from the impact of interest rate movements). However, uncertainties
remain about the trend rate of increase of Vl, as well as the velocity of
other monetary aggregates, given still limited experience under varying
economic circumstances in a deregulated environment. In light of the new
conditions affecting the reaction of both the public in their asset
preferences and depository institutions in their deposit pricing and
overall liability management, it is problematic to rely heavily on past
experience, and models of that experience, in estimating the interest and
income elasticities of money demand as well as the pace of financial
(10) Credit growth under alternative II is expected to be just
below the upper end of the range shown. The higher range for credit
growth in alternative II than had been tentatively adopted provides a
greater chance of encompassing actual growth, but has the disadvantage of
possibly signalling to the market a more accommodative posture by the
Federal Reserve vis-a-vis the large federal budgetary deficit. Growth of
federal debt is expected to decelerate some in 1985, but to remain quite
high relative to historical experience, and to be faster than private
debt growth. Expansion in private debt is likely to be lower this year,
as growth of nominal GNP slows. But we still expect the rate of increase
in total debt to exceed expansion in nominal GNP by about as much as last
year. Debt growth is expected to be sustained by larger than normal
merger financing, though less than last year; by the still rapid expansion
of federal debt: a wider corporate financing gap; and by the continuing
need to finance an expansion of spending by domestic sectors that is
greater than the rise in nominal GNP (given the projected continued
deterioration in our international balance on goods and services).
(11) The lessened rate of debt expansion should help restrain
growth in the broad monetary aggregates, particularly M3. Given the
portfolio quality problems faced by depository institutions, and the need
to increase their capital, we do not expect them to be significantly more
aggressive than last year in seeking to finance credit demands. Part of
the increase in credit demands is also expected to continue to be met
by net borrowings from abroad by banks, displacing issuance of CDS or
other deposits that might appear in M3 (and possibly also M2). Nonethe-
less, as noted earlier, M2 and M3 are likely to grow close to the upper
limits of the proposed alternative II ranges. Somewhat higher growth
ranges for these aggregates would increase the odds of encompassing the
actual outcome for the year, providing leeway should credit demands fall
more heavily than expected on depository institutions or should funding
patterns change.
(12) Alternative I, which involves higher ranges than alternative
II, might also be considered as consistent with the GNP projection, pro-
vided expansion of M1 were at, or a little above, the midpoint of the
specified range. The approach of alternative I would also provide more
leeway for greater M1 growth should the Committee believe that is needed
to accommodate to a real GNP growth that is as rapid as, or more rapid
than, projections. However, growth of M1 toward the upper end of the
range may also generate stronger upward price pressures as it accommodates
greater demands for goods and services in a period when inflationary
expectations are not fully abated and when fiscal policy will probably
remain expansive. Under those conditions, if progress is to continue to
be made toward reasonable price stability, such an approach is likely to
limit real growth if not later in 1985, at least in 1986.
(13) Alternative III, by contrast, would be more consistent than
I or II with a policy tilted toward a slowing of Ml and M2 growth in 1985
relative to 1984 and encouraging a greater slowdown in growth of M3 and
credit. The marked tightening of credit market conditions, at least for
part of this year, that is probably consistent with this alternative
would work toward slower growth in real GNP in 1985 than in the staff
projection. However, this alternative would also foster more restraint
on price increases than under either alternatives I or II, which do not
entail a significant price deceleration this year or probably next. If
the deceleration of inflation under alternative III occurred at the
expense of a slower real GNP growth than currently projected, it would
nonetheless lay the groundwork for a stronger real growth later consistent
with continued abatement of inflation and inflationary expectations and a
lowering of interest rates over time.
(14) The preceding paragraphs have assumed that upward price
pressures in 1985 would be essentially no less than in 1984. However,
should they be less--because, for instance, oil and other commodity
prices weakened significantly further, the dollar remained high on exchange
markets, or the increase in labor costs was even smaller than expected--
nominal interest rates could well have to fall to maintain satisfactory
real GNP growth. As the decline in yields on bank deposits and money
market funds lagged the decline in market rates, demand for monetary
assets could be expected to increase, probably for a while more than
offsetting the lessened growth in money demand associated with slower
expansion in nominal GNP. Under such circumstances, the Committee might
need to be prepared for relatively rapid growth in M2, and to a degree
Ml, for a time. For the year as a whole, growth would probably be near
the upper end of, and possibly above, the ranges adopted, as the spread of
market rates over yields on money assets remained narrower in some cases
(such as demand deposits or NOW accounts) over the whole period and as
some of the funds that had initially moved into nontransactions monetary
assets remained there even as spreads returned to more normal proportions.
Prospective near-term developments
(15) The table below presents three alternative specifications
for growth in the monetary aggregates from December to March, along with
associated federal funds rate ranges. (More detailed data can be found
on the table and charts on the following pages.) All the alternatives
call for a slowing in money growth over the next two months, but given
their rapid growth in December and January the aggregates in March would
be at levels above the upper ends of cones encompassing any of the longer-
term ranges discussed above.1 (Growth implied for QIV to March for each
alternative is given on the detailed table.)

Federal funds

(16) The specifications of alternative B, which are expected
to involve continuation of about the existing degree of pressure on
reserve positions, can be considered most consistent with growth over
a longer period within the ranges of alternative II. Under the speci-
fications of B, M1 growth would slow to around a 7-1/2 percent annual
rate on average over February and March. Such a moderation of M1 is
expected to develop without appreciable firming in money markets as the

upward effects on money demand of the steep decline of interest rates
over recent months abate. Moreover, given the rapid growth of money late
in the fourth quarter and in January, a slowing in growth would still be
consistent with the expected increase in spending on goods and services
in the first quarter. On a quarterly average basis, M1 would increase at
a 9-1/4 percent annual rate in the first quarter under alternative B, and
velocity would decline at about a 1-1/4 percent annual rate, given the
staff's GNP projection. By March, M1 under this alternative would have
increased by about 8-3/4 percent from the QIV '84 long-run base.
(17) A less rapid expansion in the nontransactions components
of M2 and M3 is also expected to contribute to a slowdown in growth in the
broader monetary aggregates under alternative B. Weakness in inflows to
MMMFs is already evident in the most recent data, as yields on these
assets have declined into fairly close alignment with the lower level
of market interest rates; a similar pattern for MMDAs can be expected as
their offering rates continue to drop in response to previous declines in
other yields. As more normal rate alignments are restored, M2 growth
should slow considerably. However, M2 velocity in the first quarter
would decline at around a 4 percent annual rate under alternative B, owing
mostly to the surge in growth of this aggregate around year-end. M3 growth
is expected to be held down by continued moderate bank CD issuance as
well as weakness in institution-only money funds.
(18) The debt of nonfinancial sectors is projected to expand
at around a 12-1/4 percent annual rate in the first quarter-still in
excess of GNP growth, but significantly below the very rapid pace of
borrowing in the fourth quarter. Growth in both private and federal debt
is expected to decelerate from the exceptionally rapid fourth-quarter
pace. Borrowing by state and local governments is anticipated to slow
sharply following its temporary surge at the end of last year, returning
to a pace more in line with the average of recent years. Household
credit usage may also ease off from its fourth-quarter pace, although
expansion of both mortgage and consumer debt is projected to continue to
outpace growth of disposable income. Borrowing to finance mergers and
stock repurchases is expected to continue at about the rate of second
half of last year, but underlying demands for funds by businesses may
strengthen, reflecting an increase in capital and inventory investment
while internal funds remain close to fourth-quarter levels. Federal debt
issuance is expected to be relatively large over the balance of the
(19) The specifications of alternative B are expected to in-
volve reserve conditions consistent with borrowing at the discount window
remaining around $300 million. With borrowing remaining a little above
its frictional level, federal funds should trade in the neighborhood
of 8-1/4 percent. Nonborrowed and total reserves would increase at
12-1/4 and 11-1/2 percent annual rates, respectively, over the February-
March period.
(20) Short-term interest rates could decline a little over the
intermeeting period under this alternative, as continuation of the funds
rate and borrowing levels assumed allay same of the current concerns in
markets about a possible tightening of reserve positions over the weeks
ahead. The rate on 3-month Treasury bills could drop back to around 8
percent, while 3-month CDs fall to about 8-1/4 percent. Bond prices
could improve somewhat following their recent drop. However, increases
are likely to be limited by still pervasive uncertainties about the
federal budget, by strength in money relative to long-run target ranges,
and an economic outlook that is not at the moment weakening.
(21) Alternative A, which contemplates that M1 growth will
slow relatively little from the December-January average to around an
8-1/2 percent annual rate over February and March, seems most consistent
with long-run alternative I. Borrowing at the discount window might be
reduced to its frictional level--about $100-200 million at present.
However, a further reduction in the discount rate, or provision of above
average excess reserves through open market operations at least for a
while, may also be needed if the federal funds rate is to drop nearer to
the 7-1/2 percent area that seems more consistent with the reserve growth
needed to attain the money specifications of this alternative. Non-
borrowed reserves would be expected to grow at about a 20 percent
annual rate over the February-March period.
(22) Market interest rates would be expected to drop fairly
sharply in the near term under alternative A, especially if it was
accompanied by a lower discount rate. The Treasury bill rate might
decline to around 7-1/4 percent and CDs to about 7-1/2 percent, putting
the prime rate under considerable downward pressure. Such yield declines
would probably lead to continued strong growth of M2 and M3, particularly
of their nontransactions components. In long-term markets, yields would
also fall, though the extent of such declines might be reduced by the
very heavy volume of corporate and state and local bond issuance that
would probably ensue. In addition, rate declines in long-term markets
could be limited by concerns that such an approach might lead to an
intensification of inflationary pressures, or in any event to a tightening
of market conditions later in the year to avert such pressures and to
constrain growth in the aggregates to within the long-term ranges adopted.
In exchange markets, the dollar would be likely to come under downward
(23) Alternative C specifies a sharper slowing of money growth
in February and March, consistent with a more rapid return of the
aggregates toward their longer-run ranges, an approach that may be
particularly in line with a Comittee choice of long-run alternative
III. M1 growth of around 6-1/4 percent over February and March under this
alternative would require restraining growth in total reserves to a 7
percent annual rate. This may be consistent with growth of nonborrowed
reserves of 2-1/2 percent, and a rise in borrowing to the $600-700 million
area. The federal funds rate would probably rise to around 9 percent.
(24) Other interest rates would also be expected to rise
substantially under alternative C, with the Treasury bill rate increasing
to around 8-3/4 percent. Long-term rates are also likely to advance
significantly in the short run. Upward pressures on the dollar on foreign
exchange markets would intensify, and U.S. trading partners also would
be under pressure to raise short-term rates.
Directive language
(25) Given below is draft directive language related to the
Committee's decisions on the longer-run ranges (draft language for the
operating paragraph is shown in (26) below). Suggested deletions from
the current directive are shown in strike-through form with proposed
additions in caps and certain alternatives in brackets. The considerable
uncertainties that still remain in interpreting M1 and the other aggregate
given ongoing adaptation to institutional changes by banks and the public,
appear to be clearly encompassed by the language of the second paragraph
below. With regard to Ml, the lagnuage in brackets is suggested should
the Committee wish to indicate an expectation that M1 may be in the upper
part of its range.
The Federal Open Market Committee seeks to foster monetary
and financial conditions that will help to reduce inflation further,
promote growth in output on a sustainable basis, and contribute
to an improved pattern of international transactions. In further-
ance of these objectives the Committee agreed at THIS [DEL: the July]
meeting to ESTABLISH [DEL: reaffirm] ranges for monetary growth OF [DEL: that
it had established in January: 4-to-8] ___ TO ___ percent for
M1, [DEL: and-6-to 9] ____ TO ____ percent for [DEL: both] M2, and ____ TO ____
PERCENT FOR M3 for the period from the fourth quarter of [DEL: 1983]
1984 to the fourth quarter of [DEL: 1984] 1985. The associated range
for total domestic nonfinancial debt was SET [DEL: also reaffirmed] at
[DEL: 8 to 11] ____ TO ____ percent for the year [DEL: 1984] 1985. [THE COMMITTEE
AGREED THAT GROWTH OF M1 IN THE UPPER PART OF ITS RANGE FOR
1985 MAY BE APPROPRIATE, GIVEN GROWTH OF THAT AGGREGATE IN THE
LOWER PORTION OF ITS RANGE OVER THE PREVIOUS YEAR. [DEL: It was
anticipated that-M3 and nonfincial debt might increase at rates
somewhat above the upper limits of their 1984 ranges, given
develepments in the first half of the year, but the Committee felt
that higher target ranges would provide inappropriate benchmarks
for evaluating longer term trends in M2 and credit growth. For
1985 the- Committee- agreed-en- tentative-ranges-of -monetary-growth,
measured-from the-fourth-quarter-of-1984-to-the-fourth-quarter
of-1985,-of-4-to-7-percent-for-M1 -6-to-8-l/2-percent for-M2,
and-6-to 9- percent-for M3. The associated range for nonfinancia1
debt-was- set- at- 8- to-11-perent.]
The Committee understood that policy implementation would
require continuing appraisal of the relationships not only among
the various measures of money and credit but also between those
aggregates and nominal GNP, including evaluations of conditions
in domestic credit and foreign exchange markets.
OPERATIONAL PARAGRAPH
(26) In the implementation of policy in the short run, the
Cammittee seeks to reduce SOMEWHAT (ALT. A)/MAINTAIN (ALT. B)/
INCREASE SOMEWHAT (ALT. C) pressures on reserve positions. THIS
ACTION IS EXPECTED TO BE consistent with growth of M1, M2, and M3
at annual rates of around [DEL: 7, 9, and 9] ____,____. AND ____ percent,
respectively, during the period from [DEL: November] DECEMBER to March.
LESSER RESTRAINT ON RESERVE POSITIONS [DEL: somewhat-more-rapid-growth
of-M1] would [MIGHT] be acceptable IN THE EVENT OF SUBSTANTIALLY
SLOWER GROWTH IN THE MONETARY AGGREGATES, EVALUATED [DEL: in light of
the currently estimated shortfall in growth for the fourth quarter
relative-to- the- Committee's expectations at the beginning of the
period, particularly] in the context of sluggish growth in
economic activity and continued strength of the dollar in
FOREIGN exchange markets. Greater restraint on reserve
positions might [WOULD] be acceptable in the event of sub-
stantially more rapid monetary growth and indications of
significant strengthening of economic activity and infla-
tionary pressures. The Chairman may call for Committee
