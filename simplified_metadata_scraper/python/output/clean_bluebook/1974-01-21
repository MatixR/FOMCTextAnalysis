Prefatory Note 
 
 
The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version available 
based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the Board 
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was created 
through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned 
versions text-searchable.2   Though a stringent quality assurance process was 
employed, some imperfections may remain. 
 
Please note that some material may have been redacted from this document if that

1  In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic 
format.  All scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced 
tilting) and lightly cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other 
blemishes caused after initial printing). 
 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optical character recognition computer program (OCR) 
first created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, 
staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.  Please note that the numbers and text in charts and 
tables were not reliably recognized by the OCR process and were not checked or corrected by staff.

Recent developments
(1) New revised data for monetary aggregates, scheduled for
publication on January 31, 1/ show that M 1 increased at an annual rate
of about 8-1/2 per cent in December, substantially more rapidly than
anticipated at the time of the December FOMC meeting. But there has
been little change in M1, on balance, since mid-December, and as shown
in Table 1 below, for the December-January target period M1 growth now
appears to be near the middle of the Committee's range of tolerance.
Growth in M2 appears to be close to the top of its range, as net inflows
of consumer-type time deposits to banks have been well sustained. The
sharp December rise in M1 appears partly attributable to a late month
bulge in foreign commercial bank deposit balances with U.S. banks.
Without the increase in deposits held by foreign banks, the M 1 growth
rate in December would have been about 6-1/2 per cent.

(2) RPD's have been expanding at about a 9 per cent annual rate
in the December-January target period, well within the growth range desired
by the Committee. As indicated in Table 2, however, there were minor
deviations from projections made at the time of the December FOMC meeting in
the use of RPD to support various types of deposits and excess reserves.

(3) The Federal funds rate declined to around an average of 9-3/4 per
cent soon after the last Committee meeting--and the level of member bank
borrowings has dropped to an average of about $1 billion during the past
four statement weeks--as the Desk took actions to ease conditions of reserve
availability somewhat, in accordance with the Committee's policy instructions.
Deposit data available in the early part of January, however, suggested that
both M1 and M2, partly influenced by increases in foreign deposits at U.S.
banks, were expanding at rates somewhat in excess of the upper limits of the
growth range established by the Committee, while RPD was estimated to be
increasing at a rate just below the upper limit of its range. In view of
the sensitive state of financial markets and the general economic situation,
a majority of Committee members concurred on January 11 in the Chairman's
recommendation that the Desk should continue to maintain prevailing money
market conditions, aiming at a Federal funds rate of 9-3/4 per cent.
(4) Bond market yields have generally moved up about 10 to 30
basis points since the last Committee meeting, responding first to the
potential and then to the actual weight of a heavy calendar of new
corporate and municipal issues. Meanwhile, short-term interest rates
have moved on divergent paths. Treasury bill rates have increased from
shorter maturity areas). In the private market--with business short-term
credit demands slackening in December--rates on commercial paper and
short-term bank CD's have declined 1/8 to 1/4 of a point, and banks with
prime rates of 10 per cent have dropped the rate to 9-3/4 per cent.
(5) The advance in bill rates appears attributable mainly to
the dispelling of expectations held by many market participants that
monetary policy would ease significantly over the near-term future. The
fact that the Federal funds rate failed to move down from the 9-3/4 per
cent level achieved early in the inter-meeting period appears to have
been mainly responsible for this reassessment of expectations. The
process was reinforced, however, by the sharp rise in M1 reported for
December. And bill rates also responded to ongoing and expected sales of
Treasury issues by foreign central banks. Most of the net foreign sales
in December and early January were absorbed by the System in the course of
normal seasonal reserve supplying operations. But this in turn meant that
seasonal demand for bills from the dealer market was commensurately reduced.
(6) The table on the next page shows (in percentage annual rates
of change) selected monetary and financial flows over various recent time
periods on the new revised basis. Appendix Table III compares money supply
growth rates computed on a quarterly-average basis with those computed on a
last-month-of-quarter basis. This blue book does not contain the usual
charts 1-3 on the monetary aggregates because of time pressure in converting
to the new revised money supply series.

(7) Three alternative sets of specifications for growth rates in
the aggregates and money market conditions are summarized below for Committee
consideration. (More detailed figures are shown in the table on p. 7a).

(8) Alternative C encompasses the 5-1/4 per cent growth rate
for M1 between December and June adopted by the Committee at its last
meeting. (This and other alternative growth rates are shown in the chart
on the following page in relation to the rate of increase for M1 over the
past year). The money market specifications for alternative C indicate
that continuation of the path for the aggregates adopted at the last
meeting would likely be associated with some upward movement in the
Federal funds rate from the prevailing level of around 9-3/4 per cent.
This now seems probable because we expect somewhat greater demand for
money in the first half of 1974 than we did at the time of the last

(9) The specifications for alternative B include a 6 per
cent annual rate for M1 over the first half of 1974. The staff believes
that such a growth rate would probably entail little change in the funds
rate from current levels. Thus, the range for the funds rate in that
alternative centers on 9-3/4 per cent. Alternative A includes moderately
higher growth rates for the monetary aggregates and a consequent easing
in money market conditions.
(10) No matter which of these alternatives might be chosen,
the rates of growth for M1 are expected to be higher in the second quarter
than in the first quarter of 1974, and to be quite moderate for the two
month January-February period. For example, under alternative B, the
annual rate of M1 growth over the first quarter is indicated to be around
but to rise to 7 per cent in the second quarter. The greater growth in
the second quarter reflects the temporary impact of large tax refunds--
estimated at $2-$3 billion above last year--and initial consumer adjustments
to higher social security benefit payments. We would expect M1 growth in
the third quarter, assuming little change in interest rates from those
prevailing, to be on the order of one percentage point lower than in the
second quarter as these temporary factors disappear.
(11) The outlook for interest rates in general is uncertain
partly because market attitudes are so sensitive to the course of military
and oil developments in the Middle East and their implications for domestic
inflation, international capital flows, and foreign official sales of U.S.
Government securities. Also, of course, market participants are quite
sensitive at this time to monetary policy. In long-term markets, the
recent enlarged flow of bond offerings has moved relatively well, but a
continued heavy calendar is likely to lead to a further updrift in long-
term yields--assuming no significant change in the Federal funds rate, and
no dramatic change in the outlook for oil prices and supplies. In the
short-term sector, rates could also back up somewhat further, given the
prevailing Federal funds rate, as dealer financing costs remain high and
market participants come to believe that further monetary ease is not in
prospect. However, Federal Government financing requirements appear light
enough over the next few weeks to moderate upward rate pressures. Housing
agencies will be repaying debt, and the Treasury has little or no net cash
need between now and late March or early April (assuming no sizable further
liquidation of Treasury specials by foreign central banks).
(12) Given the sensitivity of markets, a rise in the funds rate
from current levels would probably lead to an increase of interest rates
generally--adjustments that could be fairly large if the funds rate
increase were sizable, say on the order of 1/4--1/2 percentage points,
and gave signs of persisting. A drop in the funds rate from prevailing
levels, on the other hand, would be accompanied by declines in market
interest rates, particularly short-term rates. The likely strength of any
ensuing market rally is unclear. Since the market over-anticipated the
extent and speed of the easing in policy late last year, reactions to
further declines in the funds rate might be on the cautious side.
(13) The Treasury will be announcing mid-February refunding
terms on January 30. About $4-1/2 billion of maturing debt is publicly
held. Under current market circumstances, it does not appear likely
that the Treasury would seek to pre-refund additional issues or to
offer longer-term securities in volume. Thus, the refunding may be a
relatively uncomplicated operation, although somewhat larger in size than
the mid-November refunding.
(14) Net inflows of consumer-type time and savings deposits
are expected to continue at about the November-December pace at banks
and thrift institutions under alternative B, which does not contemplate
significant changes in market rates. Somewhat greater growth would be
likely to evolve under alternative A. There is risk of an appreciable
reduction in savings flows under alternative C if the money market does
in fact tighten as much as shown in paragraph (7).
(15) The various alternatives include more rapid expansion
in bank credit in the winter and spring of 1974 than occurred in the
fourth quarter of last year, when growth was quite slow. Since mid-
December, banks have once again begun to increase offerings of CD's.
We have assumed a modest continuing expansion in CD's, in contrast
to the sharp decline that occurred over the fourth quarter--a decline
that was equivalent to a reduction in bank credit growth by about
may be relatively modest in the first quarter, given recent emphasis on
capital market financing by businesses, slower consumer credit growth, and
less mortgage credit demand. Thus, banks may be reluctant to issue CD's in
any significant volume at current relatively high interest rates. We
have not assumed availability of relatively low cost funds to banks
through oil revenues in the Euro-dollar market; the means and channels
by which oil revenues will be recycled through world money and capital
markets are still unclear. If banks were to obtain more funds in the
Euro-dollar market, however, they would mainly substitute for domestic
CD sales rather than add to the over-all bank credit expansion that would
otherwise occur.
Proposed directive language
(16) Presented below are three alternative formulations
for the operational paragraph of the directive, which are intended to
correspond to the similarly lettered policy alternatives discussed in
the preceding section. For all three alternatives, it is proposed to
add a reference to Treasury financing because of the regular February
refinancing to be announced later this month. As will be noted, the
three alternatives refer to growth rates in the aggregates "over the
past 12 months." For the 12 months through December 1973, these are as
follows in terms of the revised series: M1, 5.9 per cent; M2, 8.6 per
cent; and the bank credit proxy, 10.7 per cent.
Alternative A
To implement this policy, while taking account of THE
FORTHCOMING TREASURY FINANCING AND OF internationl and domestic
financial market developments, the Committee seeks to achieve
[DEL: some easing in] bank reserve and money market conditions [DEL: provided
that the] CONSISTENT WITH SOMEWHAT FASTER GROWTH IN monetary
aggregates [DEL: do not appear to be growing excessively] OVER THE MONTHS
AHEAD THAN HAS OCCURRED OVER THE PAST 12 MONTHS.
Alternative B
To implement this policy, while taking account of THE
FORTHCOMING TREASURY FINANCING AND OF international and domestic
financial market developments, the Committee seeks to achieve
[DEL: some easing in] bank reserve and money market conditions [DEL: provided
that the] CONSISTENT WITH GROWTH IN monetary aggregates [DEL: do not
appear to be growing excessively] OVER THE MONTHS AHEAD AT ABOUT
THE RATES THAT PREVAILED OVER THE PAST 12 MONTHS.
Alternative C
To implement this policy, while taking account of THE
FORTHCOMING TREASURY FINANCING AND OF international and domestic
financial market developments, the Committee seeks to achieve
[DEL: some easing in] bank reserve and money market condition [DEL: provided
that the] CONSISTENT WITH SOMEWHAT SLOWER GROWTH IN monetary aggregates
[DEL: do not appear to be growing excessively] OVER THE MONTHS AHEAD
THAN HAS OCCURRED OVER THE PAST 12 MONTHS.
(17) In the event that the Committee again wishes to couch
the operational paragraph of the directive in terms of money market
conditions, the specifications of alternative A might be associated
with the language adopted at the December meeting (". . .the Committee
seeks to achieve some easing in bank reserve and money market conditions,
provided that the monetary aggregates do not appear to be growing
excessively." The specifications of alternative B might be associated
with language indicating that ". . . the Committee seeks to maintain
about the prevailing money market conditions, provided that the monetary
aggregates appear to be growing at rates within the specified ranges
of tolerance."
