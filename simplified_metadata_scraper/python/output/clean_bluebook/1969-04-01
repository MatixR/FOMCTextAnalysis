of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was created 
through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned 
versions text-searchable.2   Though a stringent quality assurance process was 
employed, some imperfections may remain.

format.  All scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced 
tilting) and lightly cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other 
blemishes caused after initial printing). 
 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optical character recognition computer program (OCR) 
first created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, 
staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.  Please note that the numbers and text in charts and

MONEY MARKET AND RESERVE RELATIONSHIPS
Recent Developments
(1) Since the last meeting of the Committee the cumulating
impact of monetary restraint has been reflected in further increases in
long-term interest rates, another rise in the prime loan rate, and a
contraction in major deposit and reserve aggregates. At the same time,
there has been little further upward movement in yields on intermediate-
term securities, while Treasury bill yields have declined substantially.
In the bill market, the combined pressure of seasonal bill demands,
supply scarcities, and the absence of an overt monetary policy move that
many in the market had expected brought the 3-month bill rate to below
6 per cent following the mid-month corporate tax payment period. Most
recently the 3-month bill yield was quoted 5.99 per cent bid, about 16
basis points below its level at the time of the March 4 meeting.
(2) In recent weeks, conditions in the Federal funds market
have tended to be slightly firmer than in the four weeks preceding the
March 4 Committee meeting, with the effective rate averaging around
6-3/4 per cent. In the four weeks ending March 26, net borrowed reserves
have been deepening in a $550 - $750 million range, averaging close to
$675 million, compared with $600 million for the previous four weeks.
Member bank borrowings have fluctuated in about a $750 million to $950
million range, averaging almost $840 million, about the same as in
(3) Estimates of the rate of change in the bank credit
proxy for March, adjusted to include banks' borrowing of Euro-dollars
through their foreign branches, have fluctuated around the lower end
of the average annual rate of decline of 3 - 6 per cent projected in
the last blue book. The proxy is currently estimated to show a
decline of about 6-1/2 per cent annual rate on average for the month.
Not only has the proxy declined a little more than projected, but the
components of the adjusted proxy have moved rather differently from
earlier anticipations. The decline in deposits was greater, partly
offset by larger Euro-dollar borrowings. Within the deposit category,
time deposits have shown more strength than earlier projected, but
contrary to projections, there was no net growth in private demand
deposits even though U.S. Government deposits declined substantially,
on average.
(4) The money supply is now estimated to show only about a
2 per cent annual rate of rise on average from February to March,
reflecting growth in currency about in line with other recent months.
Business loan expansion in March was considerably weaker than the staff
anticipated, and corporations appear to have utilized cash balances
more intensively to help finance their tax payments. Private demand
deposits were also absorbed by very rapid bank sales of the $1 billion
bill strip issued in early March.
(5) The average level of outstanding time and savings
deposits showed little change from February to March, in contrast to
sizable contractions in the previous two months. Net inflows of
consumer-type time and savings deposits in March were stronger than
anticipated. Outstanding negotiable CD's, however, continued to
decline roughly in line with projections, with attrition in March
estimated at about $1-1/4 billion. The decline in such CD's since
early December totals about $5-1/2 billion.

Prospective developments
(7) The projected relationships among marginal reserve
measures, day-to-day money market rates, bill rates, and bank reserve
and credit flows for April have to take account of several special
factors: potential withdrawals by individuals from time and savings
deposits after the end-of-March interest crediting; potential mid-April
tax period pressures; and possible downward bill rate movements particu-
larly after the tax period and as further bill redemptions by the
Treasury take place. While uncertainties as to possible outcomes are
great, there are fairly good odds that, under current monetary policy,
bill rates will average lower for April as a whole relative to the
Federal funds rate than in recent months, and that bank credit growth
might resume, though at a slow pace.
(8) Continuation of prevailing conditions in day-to-day money
markets would imply a Federal funds rate around the 6-3/4 per cent
average of the past few weeks, and new loan rates to dealers at New York
banks at 7 per cent or above. Member bank borrowings may be in a $750
million - $1 billion range, and net borrowed reserves in a $550 - $800
million range. Mid-April tax period pressures may entail strong demands
for Federal funds as banks attempt to finance necessitous short-term
borrowing by business customers; sales finance companies and Government
security dealers are also likely to have increased borrowing needs
around this time. However, demands on the funds market might be less
intense in the latter part of April, and it might prove necessary for
the System to maintain upward pressure on the Federal funds rate to
keep bill rates from dropping so sharply as to change market assessment
of the stance of monetary policy.
(9) Given the above marginal reserve and day-to-day money
rate specifications, the 3-month Treasury bill may fluctuate in a 5.80 -
6.15 per cent range. Over the near-term, given the recent build-up
in dealer positions in short-term bills, upward bill rate pressures may
be generated by reversal of quarterly bank statement date and Cook
County tax period window dressing and by mid-April tax period financing
needs. The upward pressures might not carry rates very far, however,
if market participants begin to focus more sharply on prospects for
a diminished supply of bills later in April and over the next two months
as the budgetary surplus permits repayment of a substantial amount of
Treasury debt. In the latter part of April, downward pressures on bill
rates could drop the yield on the 3-month bill toward, or below, the
bottom of the indicated range, partly as a result of reinvestment demand
from maturing April tax bills not used to pay taxes. On April 30 Treasury
will probably announce the terms of the mid-May refunding, which might
also generate prospects of some additional demands for bills. If the
bill rate nears the bottom end of the range, and particularly if it drops
below, downward pressures might cumulate as the market comes to expect
a less restrictive monetary policy.
(10) Assuming that the 3-month bill does not drop below the
bottom end of the range--and averages a little below 6 per cent for
April as a whole--outstanding CD's at banks may be expected to decline
by $600 - $800 million. This would be a considerably smaller decline
than in previous months, particularly since a reduction of around
$300 million would be expected for seasonal reasons.
(11) With CD attrition projected to slow, it is likely that
total time and savings deposits of banks may show little net change on
average in April, as in March, compared with about a 10 per cent annual
rate of decline over the first two months of the year. New inflows
of consumer-type time and savings deposits in April are expected to be
at a slower rate than in recent weeks. Individuals are likely to make
larger than seasonal withdrawals following the interest-crediting period
to invest in market instruments, and many savers are likely to draw on
their balances to finance sizable retroactive tax payments.
However, the staff does not expect withdrawals for interest rate reasons
at banks (or thrift institutions) to be significantly worse than in
January; long-term market rates are higher than around year-end, but
Treasury bill rates are lower than around year-end.
(12) Private demand deposits at banks in April are expected to
show little net change on average, despite a considerable rise in U.S.
Government deposits in consequence of payment of the recent $1.8 billion
bill strip on the last day of March and of heavy tax inflows in April.
A rebound in credit demands on banks in April, partly to finance these
tax payments, is expected to sustain private demand deposits.
(13) Given these deposit flows, the bank credit proxy may
increase in a 1 - 4 per cent annual rate range in April. Demands for
Euro-dollars are expected to continue strong, though perhaps moderating
a shade as domestic deposits become somewhat more readily available than
in March. The adjusted bank credit proxy (including Euro-dollars) might
therefore rise in a 2 - 6 per cent annual rate range.
(14) Over all, long-term interest rates are likely to edge
upward, assuming expectations as to peace do not become more favorable
or that recent declines in short-term rates do not cumulate. Mortgage
borrowing demands are expected to continue relatively strong, and the
volume of corporate bond offerings may pick up. And with respect to
State and local governments, banks are still likely to be only marginal
net buyers at best.
Policy alternative
(15) The Committee may wish to consider a more restrictive
complex of money market targets, particularly if firming action involv-
ing other monetary policy instruments is taken. An increase in the
discount rate to 6 per cent probably would be taken as a clear signal
of a move to reinforce monetary restraint, while a smaller rise would
have obvious elements of ambiguity in current market circumstances.
A rise to 6 per cent may tend to raise the whole interest rate structure
somewhat, although it would appear that prevailing market interest rates
have to some extent already discounted some such action. The 3-month
bill rate may move up into a 6-6.30 per cent range. If the discount
rate were raised shortly after the FOMC meeting, the combination of
such an increase, the recent build-up in dealer bill positions, and
expected April tax period pressures might press bill rates quickly
toward the upper end of the range. But such rate pressures should
moderate in the latter part of April, for reasons noted earlier.
Discount rate action in the latter part of April could, therefore,
serve principally to offset downward yield pressures likely to develop
at that time rather than to boost the rate structure to new higher levels.
(16) Assuming banks continue relatively reluctant to borrow
from the window, a higher discount rate is likely to be associated with
some increase in propensities to sell bills, to borrow Euro-dollars,
and to borrow in the Federal funds market. Given this behavior pattern,
a set of money market targets for open market operations consistent with
maintaining the developing taut credit market conditions (as compared
with such conditions absent a discount rate increase) would include a
Federal funds rate around 7 per cent or slightly above, member bank
borrowings centering around $1 billion, and net borrowed reserves in a
$650-$900 million range.
(17) Under these conditions, and given existing Regulation Q
ceilings, total member bank deposits (without adjustment for Euro-dollars)
in April might change in a wide -2 to +2 per cent, annual rate, range,
with the actual development depending in part on the timing of a dis-
count rate action (and thus how soon time deposit performance is
affected) and on whether a discount rate hike were to be combined with
other actions. The increased demands for Euro-dollars would be likely
to be reflected both in higher interest rates in that market and in
somewhat more inflow. An enlarged inflow might keep the rate of change
in the adjusted bank credit proxy a little above zero.
(18) Consumer-type time deposits might be marginally affected
by higher market rates associated with a discount rate hike and tighter
open market operations, but more importantly banks' ability to slow their
CD attrition is likely to be curtailed. A CD run-off continuing at a
rate around $1 billion a month may be expected.
(19) Upward interest rate pressures in long-term markets are
likely to be extended. Banks may become more convinced that a capital
loss year is in prospect, and thus become more active sellers of longer-
term securities. And the corporate bond market calendar, which has
been relatively moderate in recent months, might expand as corporations
move rapidly to establish claims on financial resources; they might also
begin taking down commitments from banks in anticipation of reduced
credit availability and perhaps another prime loan rate rise. The dura-
tion and strength of rises in long-term interest rates will probably
depend on how successful the policy moves are in breaking inflationary
(20) The announcement of an increase in reserve requirements--
say a 1/2 point increase on either demand or time deposits--in conjunction
with a discount rate rise would likely have, among other things, a more
pronounced effect on expectations. Interest rates would probably
rise somewhat more, although the odds on the 3-month bill rate moving
above the upper end of the range in paragraph (15) are small, given the
Federal funds rate specified in paragraph (16). Bill market pressures
would be modified by the view that a reserve requirement increase would
entail less bill sales (or more bill buying) through the open market
account. Moreover, it is likely that marginal portfolio adjustments of
banks to a reserve requirement increase will fall on longer-term
securities to a considerable extent since bank liquidity is already sub-
stantially reduced. The impact of monetary restraint would become more
widespread as smaller banks would become less willing holders of State
and local and U.S. Government securities, and a larger number of banks
are under greater pressure to tighten lending policy. Bank credit may
be weaker in April than indicated in paragraph (17), and there may
possibly be more of a lingering downward effect on the averages for
the succeeding months.
