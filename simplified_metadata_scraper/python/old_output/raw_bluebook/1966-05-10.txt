MONEY MARKET AND RESERVE RELATIONSHIPS

Money markets

Recent developments. Interest rates on a variety of short-

term debt instruments have moved higher in recent weeks, and the money

market has displayed a generally tight atmosphere. Federal funds have

traded mainly at 4-3/4 per cent, but with an increasing amount of trad-

ing at higher rates, including trading most recently at 5 per cent

and a few reported transactions at 5-1/8 per cent. With a tight funds

market, dealer financing costs have moved into a higher range.

Since mid-April the 3-month bill rate has held close to 4.65 per

cent after rising around 15 basis points earlier in the month.

Because of high financing costs, dealers have not been very willing

holders of bills recently; still, demand for bills from the public

and the System has remained fairly large, although there was some

disappointment about the extent of bill demand associated with the

refunding.

The recently tighter atmosphere of money markets has

reflected in part the increased pressure on bank net reserve posi-

tions. Over the four statement weeks ending May 4, net borrowed

reserves averaged about $270 million and member bank borrowings

about $635 million--compared with averages of $225 million and $565

million, respectively, in the previous 4 weeks. Member bank borrow-

ings averaged above $600 million in every week since late March.

Prospective developments. On the assumption that net

borrowed reserves will continue to average $250-$300 million over

the next 4 weeks, the 3-month bill rate is likely to fluctuate

mainly within a 4.60 to 4.75 per cent range. Departures from this

range on some days are quite possible, however, as strong cross-

currents will be at work in the bill market. Among the factors

tending to lower rates will be a seasonal tendency toward decline,

particularly with the maturity of $4.5 billion of tax bills in mid-

June. Some demand for bills also could be generated over the near-

term from temporary investment of the cash proceeds of Treasury

issues not exchanged in the current refunding (in which the attri-

tion rate was above 40 per cent even after sizable Treasury purchases

of when-issued securities before books were closed). In addition,

demand for short Governments stemming from reinvestment of proceeds

from security flotations is likely to continue. Any renewed weakness

in the stock market also could generate some downward pressure on

bill rates.

Among the factors which will tend to exert a tightening

influence on rates will be continuing pressure from dealer financ-

ing costs associated with a taut Federal funds market. While dealers

have reduced their bill inventories somewhat recently, these remain

well above the low levels of late winter and any efforts by dealers

to work current inventories lower would tend to be reflected in

higher rates. Prospects of a large supply of Federal agency issues



CONFIDENTIAL (FR)

in the weeks ahead are also likely to exert upward pressure on bill

rates, as will continued aggressive bank efforts to attract CD funds

especially in preparation for the June dividend and tax dates.

Finally, the System will return to the selling side of the bill

market around mid-May, although its sales to absorb reserves are

not expected to be as large as its recent purchases.

Some deepening of net borrowed reserves in the period

ahead may have been already discounted by the market, but a sub-

stantial decline to, say, around $400 million, probably would have

a significant psychological impact. The reserve pressure itself

will have a substantial effect on already high day-to-day financing

costs. And the 3-month bill rate would likely under the circum-

stances rise to a range above 4.75 per cent.

Market uncertainties, as reflected in recent gyrations of

common stock prices, make the outlook for bond yields more cloudy

than usual. In the absence of further expectational shocks, however,

bond yields are likely to drift higher in the weeks ahead even if

net borrowed reserves are little changed from current levels.

Contributing factors will be the continuing large corporate and

municipal calendar and the likelihood of some agency financing in

the intermediate-term area. A substantial further tightening of

bank reserve positions would accelerate such a rise in bond yields.

CONFIDENTIAL (FR)

A 3-month bill fluctuating above 4-3/4 per cent would

certainly result in active market discussion about the sustainability

of the existing time deposit ceiling rate and of the discount rate.

The discount rate would appear to be the more immediately vulnerable

as bill rates rise; banks will become increasingly desirous of

borrowing as they find their reserve positions under pressure and

Federal funds trading more frequently at a large premium above the

discount rate.

Reserve flows, bank credit, and money

Recent developments. In April both private demand and

time deposits showed their largest increases in several months and

U. S. Government deposits rose moderately. Thus, total member bank

deposits (credit proxy) increased sharply in April. With all types

of deposits increasing, required reserves increased at nearly a 15

per cent annual rate in April, and total reserves rose somewhat more

as some banks added to their excess reserves after the low March

level. The System supplied the bulk of the increase in reserves,

with nonborrowed reserves rising at about a 13 per cent annual rate,

but banks were also forced to increase their borrowings at the

Federal Reserve.

Since around mid-April outstanding private demand deposits

and the total money supply have declined slightly. Growth in bank

credit (as measured by the proxy) has continued, but at a pace

- 4 -



CONFIDENTIAL (FR) - 5 -

slightly slower than from mid-March to mid-April. U.S. Government

deposits have grown sharply over the past two weeks, contributing

in part to the slowing of money expansion. Meanwhile, total time

and savings deposits have continued to increase, but the very

latest data suggest that the sharp spurt in the latter part of

March and April may be tapering off.

Prospective developments. Assuming no change in net

borrowed reserves from recent levels and continued strength in

loan demands from businesses and financial institutions, the

principal potential factors affecting variations in the growth of bank

credit and deposits between now and midyear include the following:

(1) repayments of loans made by banks related to the March-April

tax period and sales of liquid assets that banks accumulated over

that period; (2) the rise in U.S. Government deposits, associated

in part with issues of agency debt; (3) pressures developing around

the June dividend and tax periods; and (4) more moderate growth in

time deposits.

Considering these factors, it appears likely that bank

credit growth may average around 8 per cent between now and midyear,

with the rate of growth tending to be moderate in May and larger in

June. In the weeks immediately ahead, expected repayments of

security loans, together with bill sales by dealer banks, will tend

to reduce bank credit growth. And these factors, together with a



CONFIDENTIAL (FR) - 6 -

continued rise in U.S. Government deposits, may lead toa decline in

outstanding private demand deposits and the money supply.

As spring progresses, further pressures for credit expansion

are likely to develop as a result of sizable Federal agency issues

(which could total $2 or $3 billion for new cash--although this

is more than usually subject to a number of uncertainties) and June

speed-ups of corporate income tax payments and corporate remittances

to the Treasury of individual income tax withholdings.

Private demand deposit growth may be resumed later in

the spring. Over the next two months, on balance, such deposits

may show little change, which would bring the annual rate of increase

over the first half of 1966 to around 4.5 per cent. It is not

expected that banks' time deposits will expand as rapidly over the

next few months as they did in April. As the initial impact of

higher rates on savings certificates passes, gains should be more

moderate. And while we do not have current information on CD

maturities, it appears likely that banks may find it more difficult

to replace maturing issues in view of the competition from other

short-term paper.

Explanation of Projections in Table B-1

1. Changes in Federal Reserve credit inciate reserves needed to offset projected changes in
required reserves and factors affecting the supply of reserves.

2. Projected changes in currency outside banks reflect seasonal movements plus an allowance
for growth of about $30 million per week.

3. Projected effects of Treasury operations, included in "technical factors," reflect scheduled
and assumed calls in current two weeks and thereafter, maintenance of Treasury balances with
Federal Reserve at $200 million.

4. Projected changes in gold stock reflect assumed outflow after May at the rate of about
$50 million per month.
