created through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain. 
 

Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These

MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Prepared for the Federal Open Market Committee

By the staff Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System



STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL (FR)
CLASS I - FOMC November 9, 1990

MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Recent Developments

(1) Open market operations in the first four weeks after the

last FOMC meeting were directed toward maintaining unchanged reserve mar-

ket conditions, with federal funds expected to trade around 8 percent. On

October 29 the Desk implemented the FOMC's decision that, against the

background of a weakening economy, called for a more accommodative policy

stance following the conclusion of a meaningful budget agreement: The

borrowing assumption was reduced by $50 million (of which about half was

in recognition of falling seasonal borrowing) and the federal funds rate

was expected to decline by 25 basis points to 7-3/4 percent.1 Over the

intermeeting period, federal funds often traded on the high side of expec-

tations, as commercial banks managed reserve positions cautiously to avoid

being caught short and needing either to be seen tapping funding markets

in size or being forced to the window. With the Desk boosting the sup-

ply of excess reserves early in the current maintenance period, federal

1. To account for the declines in seasonal borrowing that typically
occur in the fall, the allowance for adjustment and seasonal borrowing
also was reduced by $50 million at the beginning of each of the first
two maintenance periods following the meeting and in the middle of the
current maintenance period.
2. The Federal Reserve's published "effective" federal funds rate also

has been boosted by increasing spreads on federal funds sold to Japanese
banks relative to the rates paid by domestic banks and displayed on
broker screens. The Japanese banks are reported to be borrowing more
heavily in the overnight funds market, and their credit standing has
declined somewhat as a result of falling asset values in Japan, which
have eroded their capital directly and raised questions about their loan
portfolios.

funds have generally traded a bit below 7-3/4 percent in recent days.3

(2) Most other market interest rates also declined over the

intermeeting period. In general, decreases were greater for Treasury than

for private issues, owing to increased concerns about credit quality and

more restrictive supply conditions discussed below in paragraph (4).

Three-month Treasury bill rates fell 15 basis points, while 30-year Trea-

sury bond yields declined 20 basis points. Yields on Treasury bonds rose

appreciably shortly after the October FOMC meeting when the budget accord

failed to pass; yields more than retraced these increases in recent weeks,

however, reflecting renewed prospects for fiscal restraint, clearer signs

of a softening economy, and heightened preference for safe investments.

(3) Indications of greater weakness in the U.S. economy and the

associated expectations of easing by the Federal Reserve contributed to a

3-1/2 percent decline in the dollar's weighted average exchange value; the

decline was intensified by signs that monetary policy was tightening in

Germany and remaining restrictive in Japan. The Bundesbank increased its

Lombard rate by 1/2 percentage point, paving the way for a moderate

increase in market rates, and the Bank of Japan took pains to signal an

unchanged monetary policy in the face of a bond market rally.4

3. Although low levels of excess collateral for Federal Reserve notes
were a matter of some concern during the period, in the event open mar-
ket operations were not constrained by the level of note collateral.
Early in November, authorized note collateral (that is, eligible col-
lateral other than foreign currency assets) was boosted by $2-1/2 bil-
lion, in effect, as a result of the unwinding by the Exchange Stabiliza-
tion Fund of warehousing of foreign currency (German marks) with the
Federal Reserve. A balance equivalent to $4-1/2 billion remains ware-
housed with the System.
4.



(4) Concerns about creditworthiness were manifest in various

sectors of the credit markets during the intermeeting period. Announce-

ments that loan problems worsened during the third quarter and the deteri-

orating economic outlook and slumping real estate markets all implied

greater difficulties for a broad range of borrowers and their creditors.

A number of finance and insurance companies encountered increased investor

resistance, and yields on their debt have risen relative to Treasury

securities. Funding difficulties of certain money center banks persisted;

some lenders reportedly trimmed or eliminated a number of lines, money

funds continued to shun the obligations of a number of banks, and rates on

capital issues of several money center banks rose further. The prime rate

remained at 10 percent, resulting in an unusually wide spread over the

federal funds and CD rates, as banks sought to build margins and discour-

age borrowing. In addition, survey results indicate that banks have

further tightened credit standards and both price and nonprice terms of

credit for their business borrowers in the last three months. For non-

financial firms with direct access to credit markets, the spread of rates

paid by the highest quality borrowers relative to those on Treasury issues

was little changed. However, lower-rated issuers faced some widening of

spreads: The gap between Baa- and Aaa-rated corporate bonds rose 20 basis

points, and that between rates on medium- and high-grade commercial paper

rose about 1/8 percentage point from its September average.

(5) Diminished credit availability and retrenchment of spending

plans appear to be continuing to restrain business borrowing. C&I loans

at banks are estimated to have contracted at a 2-1/2 percent annual rate

over September and October. Bond issuance by nonfinancial firms also has



been subdued for several months. During September, firms obtained a sub-

stantial amount of financing in the commercial paper market, but outstand-

ings have been about unchanged since the end of that month. Data for

September indicate some moderation in business credit growth at finance

companies. In the tax-exempt markets, problems seem to have been confined

to the obligations of several large cities with troubled finances. Over-

all issuance was fairly strong in September before dropping off in Octo-

ber. The few pieces of available data on recent household borrowing

suggest a modest pace of expansion. About one-quarter of surveyed banks

indicated that they had begun to tighten lending standards for residential

mortgages, and a quarter said that their enthusiasm for making consumer

loans had waned. Heavy Treasury borrowing to finance its outsized fourth-

quarter deficit is augmenting growth of total nonfinancial sector debt;

this measure is estimated to have expanded at a 6-3/4 percent rate for the

year through September, leaving it near the middle of its monitoring

range.

(6) The broad monetary aggregates were about flat in October,

with M2 expanding at only a 1 percent annual rate and M3 contracting

slightly. Some slowing had been anticipated in view of weak nominal

income growth and the likely absence of the special factors that had

boosted growth during the preceding two months, but money growth has

fallen well short of projections. The shortfall in M2 can be only par-

tially accounted for by the downward revision in estimated income growth.

In general, money growth since the spring has been substantially slower

than can be explained on the basis of historical relationships with income

and opportunity costs. The underpredictions of the money demand models



may be indicative of the reduced role of deposit intermediaries in the

credit process, but they also may suggest the possibility that the path of

income was weaker than is now estimated.

(7) The sluggishness of M2 in October was broad-based. Its

liquid retail component contracted, while small time deposits remained

subdued despite a narrowing of opportunity costs in recent months. Demand

deposits also dropped. Growth of M2 from the fourth quarter through

October was 4 percent at an annual rate. The managed liability components

of the non-M2 part of M3 also declined in October as banks restrained

asset growth and thrifts shrank owing partly to the bulge in RTC

resolutions around quarter-end. Institution-only money funds, however,

surged, as their yields lagged the decline in market rates. Through

October, M3 was only 1/2 percentage point above the lower bound of its

annual range.

5. Growth of the monetary base fell to a 7-1/2 percent rate in October
from the 14 percent average rate of the previous two months, as currency
growth slowed somewhat and required reserves declined at an 8 percent
rate, in line with the drop in transactions deposits.

Monetary Policy Alternatives

(8) Three policy alternatives are presented below for Committee

consideration. Under alternative B, federal funds would continue trading

around 7-3/4 percent. Under alternative A, the funds rate would move down

to the 7-1/4 percent area, while under alternative C it would firm slight-

ly, returning to around the 8 percent level prevailing at the last meet-

ing. The associated level of adjustment plus seasonal borrowing under

alternative B would be set at $250 million in the first maintenance period

after the meeting and might need to be lowered another $50 million over

the intermeeting period to accommodate the ongoing decline in the demand

for seasonal credit. Under alternative A, the initial level of borrowing

would be lowered to $200 million (or the discount rate could be cut by 1/2

percentage point), while under alternative C it would be raised to $275

million. The relationship of reserve availability and the federal funds

rate is likely to remain highly uncertain and volatile as banks manage

reserves to avoid being seen at the discount window or being forced to tap

potentially unreceptive funding sources.

(9) Interest rates currently embody anticipation of a 1/4 point

drop in the funds rate in the near-term. Nevertheless, market rates are

not likely to back up significantly under the unchanged reserve conditions

of alternative B, since expectations of an easing would be maintained if,

as expected, incoming information confirms a weakening economy. An un-

changed policy would provide some underpinning for the foreign exchange

value of the dollar, especially if market participants see that stance as

in part motivated by concerns about potential further weakening in the



-8-

dollar. Quality spreads may widen further, reflecting year-end position-

ing and mounting concerns about defaults. A number of large banks, espe-

cially those with weak capital positions and eroding access to capital

markets, expect to be holding down balance sheet totals to bolster capital

positions and investor confidence. At the same time, many investors,

particularly mutual funds and others publishing year-end statements, are

likely to intensify efforts to shed assets of less than top quality,

including holdings of some bank obligations. Under these conditions, it

will be difficult to distinguish transitory disturbances in relative

interest rates and credit flows from signals of more fundamental and last-

ing problems of borrowers.

(10) In view of the expectations of some easing already built

into rates, short-term interest rates would decrease somewhat less than

the 50 basis point decline in the federal funds rate, under alternative A.

Banks may be encouraged to advance credit less reluctantly by the wider

margins they would enjoy, and by greater confidence of repayment as lower

interest rates countered weakness in the economy and bolstered asset

prices. Banks eventually would pass the drop in funding costs on to their

customers through a lower prime rate, though the adjustment could be slug-

gish, especially given the desire to limit footings at year-end, and mar-

gins will remain unusually high. In the context of the softer economy and

lessened pressures on resources, long-term rates, too, should decline,

with fixed-rate mortgages dropping below 10 percent. The extent of the

decline in long-term rates might be limited should the likely drop in the

foreign exchange value of the dollar be especially steep, which would be

seen as accentuating price pressures, possibly limiting the scope for



further policy easing. The odds on a sharper drop in the dollar would be

greater if the easing seemed to reflect especially heightened Federal

Reserve concern about the strength of the financial system and the real

economy, with reduced priority given to restraining price pressures. From

this perspective, the risk that market participants would interpret a

1/2 percentage point cut in the federal funds rate as conveying such

signals might be increased if the cut were accomplished by a reduction in

the discount rate.

(11) Under alternative C, the dollar would retrace at least some

of its recent decline in response to a rise in the federal funds rate. A

tightening of policy would come as a surprise to market participants,

especially in light of the recent decline in the funds rate on the heels

of the budget accord. Short-term rates would generally rise by 1/4

percentage point or more, as expectations of further easing were extin-

guished. Bond rates also would increase initially. Quality spreads might

widen appreciably, with strains on lower-rated borrowers seen as being

heightened as the Federal Reserve appeared willing to tolerate a weaker

path for economic activity.

(12) Projected growth of the monetary aggregates under all three

alternatives is presented in the table. (Detailed data are shown on the

table and charts on the following pages.) Under all the alternatives, M2

and M3 will be substantially below the paths specified in the current

directive, despite the recent easing of money market rates. To some

extent, this reflects the money growth data already in hand for October.

Looking forward, because the supply of credit through depositories has

tightened more than anticipated, asset expansion at depositories and



-10-

associated demand for funding will continue to be damped. Nominal GNP for

the fourth quarter is now projected to be somewhat slower than at the last

FOMC meeting, which also implies reduced demands for money and credit. M2

will remain below the midpoint of its 1990 range and M3 just above its

lower bound under all three alternatives; differences in monetary growth

that emerge late in the year under the various alternatives have impercep-

tible effects on annual growth for 1990 but more impact on the position of

the aggregates relative to their tentative ranges for 1991.

M1 1-1/2 1 3/4

(13) Under alternative B, M2 probably would strengthen, but only

a bit--to a 1-3/4 percent rate over November and December. Its M1 com-

ponent is projected to resume expanding over the final two months of the

year, boosted by some bounceback of transactions deposits owing to a

lagged response to the previous reduction in opportunity costs and the

effect of declining market rates on compensating balance requirements. On

a quarterly average basis, M2 would grow at a 2-3/4 percent rate, appre-

ciably faster than nominal GNP in the staff forecast but well below pro-

jections of standard money demand models. The strengthening of M2 would

be expected to extend into the first quarter, with this aggregate above

the lower end of its provisional 1991 range. Under alternative A, the

drop in opportunity costs would boost M2 to a 2-3/4 percent rate over the

final two months of the year and put it in the middle portion of its new

range in the first quarter. The firming in M2 growth under alternative C

would be quite modest and this aggregate would be entering the new year

around the lower end of its tentative 1991 range.

(14) M3 would be little changed over November and December under

any of the alternatives. Some pickup in RTC resolution activity from the

pace of recent weeks also will tend to restrain growth of the aggregates,

especially M3. The slight differences in the growth of M3 under alterna-

tive A and C in December would owe largely to inflows to money market

mutual funds, as their rate advantage temporarily rose or declined,

respectively. In all cases, growth in M3 through the first quarter of

next year would be around the lower end of its tentative range.

(15) Stringent conditions in credit markets and weak credit

demands will damp private credit growth over the remainder of the year.

In the business sector, credit flows for construction and development

activities and commercial properties will decline in the fourth quarter,

partly in response to the pull back by lenders. Less than top-rated

firms--including medium and smaller businesses--are likely to face higher

costs and further reduction in the availability of credit from banks and

other lenders. In the context of desires to bolster capital ratios at

year-end, the reluctance of banks to extend credit to some borrowers may

be accentuated by demands from some borrowers with existing lines of

credit. In particular, medium-rated commercial paper issuers can be

expected to tap their backup lines with banks to pay down paper in

response to wider spreads in that market. Household debt growth also



-13-

should slow, reflecting the weakness in consumption expenditures--espe-

cially for durables--and anemic housing activity. The growth of the debt

of nonfederal sectors is expected to average only around 5 percent over

the fourth quarter. The federal government, by contrast, will be a heavy

borrower over the final two months of the year. As a result, the growth

of total debt of domestic nonfinancial sectors is expected to be boosted

to a rate of about 6 percent over this period, placing growth for the year

at 6-3/4 percent, near the midpoint of its 5 to 9 percent range.

Directive Language

(16) Draft language for the operational paragraph, including the

usual options, is shown below. The language for the last sentence on the

federal funds rate range does not reflect any of the alternatives pre-

sented in the memorandum by Messrs. Lindsey, Kohn, and Sternlight.

OPERATIONAL PARAGRAPH

In the implementation of policy for the immediate

future, the Committee seeks to DECREASE SOMEWHAT/

maintain/INCREASE SOMEWHAT the existing degree of

pressure on reserve positions. Taking account of

progress toward price stability, the strength of the

business expansion, the behavior of the monetary

aggregates, and developments in foreign exchange and

domestic financial markets, slightly (SOMEWHAT) greater

reserve restraint (WOULD) might or (SLIGHTLY) somewhat

lesser reserve restraint would (MIGHT) be acceptable in

the intermeeting period. The contemplated reserve

conditions are expected to be consistent with growth of

M2 and M3 over the period from September through

December at annual rates of about ____ AND ____ [DEL: 4 and 2]

percent respectively. The Chairman may call for

Committee consultation if it appears to the Manager for

Domestic Operations that reserve conditions during the

period before the next meeting are likely to be

associated with a federal funds rate persistently

outside a range of ____ TO ____ [DEL: 6 to 10] percent.
