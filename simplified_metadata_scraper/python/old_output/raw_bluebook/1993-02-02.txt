MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Recent Developments

(1) The degree of reserve pressure was left unchanged over

the intermeeting period, with the intended level of the federal funds

rate remaining at 3 percent and the allowance for adjustment and sea-

sonal borrowing at $50 million. In the last week of 1992, the federal

funds rate was somewhat volatile, reflecting shifting market antici-

pations of year-end pressures and sizable swings in market factors

affecting reserves. However, the Desk ensured that reserves were abun-

dant in the maintenance period spanning year-end, and the funds rate

did not show any unusual tightness on December 31 itself. For the

intermeeting period as a whole, the federal funds rate averaged 2.99

percent.

(2) Most short-term interest rates fell 20 to 25 basis points

over the intermeeting period, although somewhat larger drops were re-

corded at the one-month maturity. The declines partly reflected the

passing of the year-end statement date, and a return toward more normal

relationships with the federal funds rate. With labor market indi-

cators suggesting somewhat less strength than market participants had

expected, money supply data weakening, and discussions of near-term

fiscal stimulus centering on quite moderate numbers, market partici-

pants appear to be scaling back the odds on significant Federal Reserve

tightening over the next year or so. Consequently, intermediate-term

1. Adjustment and seasonal borrowing averaged $235 million over
the maintenance periods ending January 6 and January 20, well above
allowance. The overage reflected a substantial need for funds by one
nonbank bank over the long New Year's weekend and a surge in borrowing
at the end of the January 20 maintenance period, as extremely heavy
tax receipts pushed the Treasury's balance far above projections.
Borrowing has been closer to expected levels recently, averaging $77
million to date in the current maintenance period.



Treasury yields also moved somewhat lower, and fixed-rate mortgage

yields fell about 30 basis points. Most recently, indications that the

Administration would consider new taxes lent some credibility to its

long-term deficit reduction objective and contributed to declines in

bond yields, as did suggestions that the Administration might be in-

clined to shift the composition of the federal debt toward shorter

maturities. Even with heavy supply pressures from the corporate mar-

ket, long-term rates are down about 10 to 15 basis points on balance

over the period. Stock market indexes exhibited widely varying re-

sults, with the AMEX and NASDAQ indexes up about 5 percent while the

NYSE and DJIA were about unchanged.

(3) The dollar's weighted average exchange value rose about

2 percent on net over the intermeeting period. In the first part of

the period the dollar moved higher, particularly against the German

mark, on the basis of actual and expected further easing of Bundesbank

monetary policy. Subsequently, the dollar drifted lower along with

U.S. bond yields, but it has firmed in recent days on stronger U.S.

economic spending data. Three-month interest rates declined by 55

basis points in Germany, while long-term rates decreased 15 basis

points. Rates in other European countries generally showed similar or

greater declines, with substantial reductions in the United Kingdom

associated with a 100 basis point cut in the Bank of England's official

lending rate. In Japan, three-month rates edged down by 25 basis

points, while bond yields fell by 20 basis points.



(4) After showing some strength in the late summer and autumn

of last year, the broader monetary aggregates contracted over December

and January--a considerably weaker showing than had been projected in

the December bluebook.2 M2 declined at about a 2 percent annual

rate over December and January, and M3 at about a 4-1/2 percent rate.

(5) The unexpected weakness in the broader aggregates in the

last two months entirely reflected sizable and larger-than-projected

declines in their nontransaction components. Growth of M1 also slowed,

to an average 8 percent rate, but a deceleration had been expected,

based partly on special factors. Demand deposit growth plunged on

lower mortgage refinancing activity, and other checkable deposits

slowed in December because unwinding of its sweep account

program had been completed. Currency growth, however, strengthened,

apparently as a result of large shipments of currency abroad.

Within the nontransaction component of M2, the runoff of small time

deposits slackened a bit, but expansion of savings and MMDAs slowed

abruptly and money market mutual fund assets declined more rapidly.

Anecdotal information suggests that flows into bond and stock mutual

funds fell off somewhat in December, but remained fairly robust. The

extent of the weakness in the liquid nontransaction components is

surprising. While some of this weakness may have been due to earlier

widening in opportunity costs, as yields on these components failed to

match increases in market rates this fall, the timing of the declines

2. The monetary data presented in this bluebook incorporate the
results of the annual benchmark and seasonal review--discussed in
Appendix A--and should be treated as strictly confidential until their
release to the public, tentatively planned for February 4. The
December bluebook projections, of course, were done on the old basis,
but weakness in money is apparent on the revised basis as well.

3. Reflecting the brisk growth in Ml deposits, total reserves rose
at a 5 percent pace over the November-January period, and the monetary
base expanded at a 9-1/4 percent rate.



suggests that unusually large tax payments and holiday purchases also

may have played a role. At the M3 level, the drop-off in large time

deposits accelerated around year-end, likely reflecting efforts by

banks and thrifts to improve balance-sheet ratios and reduce deposit-

insurance premiums. Reliance on managed liabilities in M3 was held

down by weakness in bank credit in December and January and greater use

of funds raised in bond and equity markets. Declines in M3 also were a

result of a steep drop in institution-only money fund shares owing to

interest rate incentives around year-end.

(6) The growth of nonfederal debt appears to have remained

subdued, below the pace of spending, suggesting that households and

business remain cautious in their attitudes toward debt. In the busi-

ness sector, bond issuance has picked up in December and January, but

shorter-term business borrowing has dropped off on balance, perhaps

owing partly to reduced needs to finance retail inventories. Consumer

credit likely rose a little in December, reflecting a modest pickup in

revolving credit. Although mortgage refinancing activity has declined

on balance over the past two months, its pace remained brisk. With

mortgage borrowing likely supported by equity extraction in the course

of refinancing as well by strong existing home sales, mortgage debt

likely has continued to expand at a healthy clip. Federal borrowing

remained heavy in December, boosting overall debt growth to a 6-1/2

percent pace.

(7) The table below shows final results for growth of the

money and debt aggregates for 1992, incorporating new benchmarks and

seasonal factors. For 1992 as a whole, the aggregates expanded at very

sluggish rates. M2 and M3 rose 1.9 and 0.5 percent, respectively,

leaving both aggregates about 1/2 percentage point below the lower



bounds of their ranges. Domestic nonfinancial sector debt increased

4.6 percent, the lower end of its range. Velocities of the broad

monetary aggregates rose substantially despite declining short-term

interest rates. The slow growth of these monetary and financial

aggregates relative to nominal GDP appears to be due importantly to de-

leveraging by households and businesses and a rechannelling of credit

flows outside the depository sector, and associated incentives for

savers to shift funds from M2 assets to debt repayment and longer-term

instruments.

Alternative Long-run Strategies

(8) To place the consideration of the annual ranges for money

and credit for 1993 in a longer perspective, the table on the following

page presents three alternative five-year monetary policy strategies,

together with the consequences for output, prices, and resource utili-

zation. The baseline strategy, labelled I in the table, judgmentally

extends the greenbook forecast for 1993 and 1994 through 1997. It

retains the assumption of no short-run fiscal stimulus, and posits

gradual progress through the entire period in reducing the structural

deficit as a ratio to GDP; these assumptions also are retained in the

simulations shown for the two alternative monetary policy strategies.

The simulations incorporate the staff's assessment that potential GDP

will grow at a 2-1/4 percent rate, benefiting from a small boost to

productivity relative to recent years. The natural rate of unemploy-

ment is seen currently as 6 percent, elevated by the labor market mis-

matches resulting from sizable industry restructuring--especially in

the defense sector--but edges back down to 5-3/4 percent later in the

simulation as the pace of restructuring wanes. M2 growth paths for the

baseline and the two alternative strategies reflect our expectation

that special forces will continue to depress M2 relative to spending,

albeit with diminishing intensity. Influences captured in the expanded

view of the determinants of opportunity costs--returns on capital mar-

ket instruments, loan rates, and a wider array of deposit rates, as

well as short-term market rates--along with other forces will be



operating in ways that both damp money growth and complicate its rela-

tion to income.

4. The M2 forecasts were based on the new Feinman-Porter model of
M2 demand, supplemented by equations to project various deposit, loan,
and intermediate-term market rates needed for the simulation. How-
ever, the staff judgmental projections shown in the table are below
those forecasted by these econometric relationships, on the order of
3/4 and 1-1/4 percentage point in 1993 and 1994, respectively, and 1/2
percentage point thereafter. The factors not fully captured in the
Feinman-Porter model that are thought to depress money growth include
a levelling off in mortgage refinancing and resumption of RTC activity
later this year and, for all years, the increased availability of
mutual fund products at bank and thrift offices and continued
restraint on deposit-seeking partly as a result of FDICIA restrictions
and requirements involving capital and other aspects of bank business
that are not fully captured in the model.

(9) The policy alternatives encompass somewhat tighter

(Strategy II) and somewhat easier (Strategy III) monetary policies,

which produce discernable differences in output and inflation over the

5-year simulation period. The difference in policy--measured by inter-

est rates or money supplies--are narrower than in similar exercises in

past bluebooks. In part this reflects the current configuration of a

relatively low inflation rate and a moderate gap between the unemploy-

ment rate and the natural rate of unemployment. In these circumstances

major differences in policy would result in deflation or a significant

acceleration of inflation. In addition, we have assumed a faster

response of long-term interest rates to changes in the federal funds

rate than is usually embodied in the quarterly econometric model, which

produces a greater response of spending for a given change in the

federal funds rate. The money growth differences are especially nar-

row, as a result of the low responsiveness of M2 demand to change in

short-term interest rates in the Feinman-Porter model.

(10) The baseline strategy provides a gradual deceleration of

inflation as measured by the consumer price index to around 2 percent

by 1997. Nominal short-term rates rise somewhat by 1995 under this

alternative, and remain flat thereafter. Declining inflation at the

same time implies more appreciable increases in real short-term rates.

As credit becomes more freely available and other unusual forces damp-

ing spending wane, the rise in short-term real rates is necessary to

restrain output to its potential. With the disinflation becoming em-

bedded in expectations, long-term nominal rates remain on a downward

trajectory, dropping below 6 percent by 1995. The resulting sizable

flattening of the yield curve, together with the improvement in bank

and household balance-sheet positions as the recovery proceeds, tends



-10-

to boost M2 demand, implying the need for a pickup in money growth in

later years even as expansion in nominal spending continues to slow

gradually.

(11) Strategy II embodies a somewhat tighter monetary policy

to produce reasonable price stability by the end of the simulation

period. To do this, policy tightens more promptly than under alterna-

tive I, keeping the federal funds rate above and money growth below the

baseline case for most of the period. Real rates are substantially

higher than in the baseline, given the faster decline in inflation,

maintaining considerable slack in resource utilization. The unemploy-

ment rate declines very little until late in the simulation. More

rapid declines would be possible if this policy reinforced the credi-

bility of the System's price stability objective, producing more rapid

decline in inflation expectations.

(12) Under the easier Strategy III, the economy would return

to full employment more quickly, but progress in disinflation would

end. Under this policy, money growth exceeds the baseline path by

about 1/4 point on average over the simulation period. Short-term

interest rates decline in the near term and remain below the baseline

path for a time. As a consequence, output is boosted to a 3-1/2 per-

cent rate of expansion in both 1993 and 1994. However, to keep infla-

tion from accelerating, policy must reverse before too long, with

short-term rates rising in the first part of next year and moving above

the baseline path in 1995.

Long-Run Ranges for 1993

(13) The table below presents staff projections for growth of

money and debt over the next two years consistent with the greenbook

economic forecast, and two alternative sets of ranges for 1993.

(Appendix B gives the ranges and outcomes for money and debt growth

since 1979.) Alternative I retains the provisional ranges selected by

the Committee last July, and is identical to the ranges used in both

1991 and 1992. The staff forecasts for expansion of M2 and M3 in 1993

are 1/2 percentage point below the lower bounds of these ranges.

Alternative II specifies 1 percentage point lower growth ranges for M2

and M3, which would encompass the staff money forecasts.

Alternatives for 1993
Alternative I

Growth from Actual Staff Forecast (Provisional
QIV to QIV 1992 1993 1994 Ranges) Alternative II

M2 1.9 2 2-1/2 2-1/2 to 6-1/2 1-1/2 to 5-1/2

M3 .5 1/2 1 1 to 5 0 to 4

Debt 4.6 5-1/4 6 4-1/2 to 8-1/2 4-1/2 to 8-1/2

M1 14.3 8 7-1/4

Nominal GDP 5.4 5-1/2 5

(14) The staff is projecting M2 growth this year of 2 per-

cent, the same as in 1992, with nominal GDP also expected to grow at

the same pace this year as in 1992. However, the influences working to

produce the comparable rise in velocity are shifting somewhat this

year. Some of the forces that damped the rise in velocity in 1992 are

not expected to be at work in 1993. For one, no further decreases in

short-term rates are contemplated in the staff forecast; policy easings

last year narrowed opportunity costs on liquid deposits, buoying M2



growth. In addition, mortgage refinancings are expected to level out,

meaning that last year's boost to M2 growth from this source will

disappear. Finally, RTC resolution activity is assumed to reemerge

after midyear, damping the funding needs of the depository sector.

However, the tendency for these factors to raise velocity in 1993

relative to 1992 will be offset by some diminution in the effects of

some other influences that were boosting velocity in 1992. Among these

will be an abatement of credit restraint by lenders and balance sheet

restructuring by borrowers. Nonetheless, bank lending to businesses

and households, while picking up, is projected to remain damped by

historical standards. Moreover, the pickup in loans will be funded by

reduced bank security acquisitions. As a consequence, banks are not

expected to become significantly more aggressive in pursuing deposits;

retail deposit rates should decline further, partly in response to the

recent fall in short- and intermediate-term Treasury rates. Even so,

the continued downtrend in longer-term interest rates in the staff

forecast should be sufficient to narrow the spread of bond rates over

retail deposit rates, ultimately reducing the relative attractiveness

of capital market instruments, including bond mutual funds. Neverthe-

less, such spreads would stay unusually wide, capital gains on bond

funds would elevate their advertised yields as rates decline, and the

process of stock adjustment to lower desired levels of retail deposits,

particularly small time deposits, probably still has a way to go.

Further reductions in consumer loan rates should cut back on household

incentives to deleverage out of nontransaction M2 balances, though

here, too, spreads would stay wide.

-12-



-13-

(15) With neither further policy easing nor larger mortgage

refinancings, the growth of the M1 component of M2 is expected to de-

cline from 14-1/4 percent last year to 8 percent this year.5 About

offsetting this slowing, the partial unwinding of the influences that

have been depressing the non-M1 component of M2 relative to spending is

expected to mute its contraction over 1993 to 1/2 percent versus 2-1/2

percent last year.

(16) M3 growth this year at 1/2 percent also is projected to

hold at last year's rate. Bank credit is not expected to pick up, as

banks meet greater loan demands by curtailing security acquisitions.

Thrift credit is projected to change little over 1993, after an

appreciable decline last year, despite the anticipated resumption of

RTC resolution activity in the second half. As a consequence, we see

a slower runoff of large time deposits in 1993 compared to 1992. How-

ever, the effects of this on M3 are about counterbalanced by much

smaller inflows to institution-only money funds, which had been boosted

in 1992 by temporary rate advantages brought on by drops in short-term

market interest rates.

(17) Debt of domestic nonfinancial sectors is projected to

pick up to a 5-1/4 percent rate over 1993. On the assumption of no

fiscal stimulus package, federal debt growth is expected to slow to

a 9-1/2 percent rate after last year's 10-3/4 percent pace. Most of

the strengthening in growth of the nonfederal component--from 2-1/2

percent last year to 3-3/4 percent over 1993--is seen as occurring

in the business sector. Business spending on fixed investment and

inventories this year is expected to move above the flow of internally

5. We expect continued sizable flows of currency abroad, especially
to Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, to buoy the growth of
the monetary base to 9 percent.



-14-

generated funds, and equity issuance is projected to drop back as busi-

nesses feel more comfortable with their financial structures. Last

year's runoff of business loans at banks should reverse, owing partly

to an easing of lending terms prompted by improved bank capital posi-

tions and perceptions of reduced credit risk as the expansion con-

tinues. In the household sector, lowered debt service burdens, further

decreases in consumer credit costs, and improved employment prospects

are anticipated to induce a resumption in consumer credit expansion

after no change on balance last year. The growth of mortgage debt

should hold at around last year's pace as housing construction again

strengthens this year, supported by further declines in fixed-rate

mortgage interest rates.

(18) Alternative II could be preferred if the Committee

viewed further substantial increases in velocities as a likely outcome

in 1993. The continued slow growth in the broader monetary aggregates

since mid-1992 in the face of still lower short-term interest rates and

a speedup of nominal GDP might be seen reinforcing the case for addi-

tional unusual velocity increases this year. Thus, growth of M2 and M3

in the lower portions of the reduced ranges of alternative II could be

viewed as fully compatible with economic outcomes along the lines of

the greenbook projection. And considerable scope would exist for money

growth higher up in the ranges if a more vigorous economic expansion

should emerge or be desired, or if velocity behavior returns more to

normal; even in those cases, growth near the reduced upper ends of the

alternative II ranges seems unlikely. Alternative II also might be

seen as being more consistent than alternative I with the Committee's

intention to move toward price stability over time. If the staff

view of velocity is correct, M2 growth within the alternative I range



-15-

would be consistent with a significant acceleration in nominal income,

forestalling further progress in reducing inflation in 1994. M2 growth

in line with the staff forecast, or even a little higher, would be

sending a much stronger signal to ease reserve conditions under alter-

native I. Moreover, the decrease in the M2 range would renew the

process of reducing those ranges to levels more consistent with rea-

sonable price stability. Alternative II does not include a reduction

in the debt range, despite the staff forecast that debt will grow in

the lower half of the proposed range. If the Committee viewed the

reduction in money ranges as essentially "technical," leaving the debt

range unchanged might reinforce that perception. On the other hand, a

reduction in the debt range would underline the favorable trend toward

reduced leverage.

(19) Alternative I could be selected if the greenbook projec-

tions were viewed as representing an unacceptably weak economic expan-

sion, with an unemployment rate still around 7 percent in the fourth

quarter of this year. Such an objective would be fostered by the

higher money growth and lower interest rates of this alternative.

Alternative I might signal the Federal Reserve's intent to accommodate

the effects on spending of a near-term fiscal stimulus package through

higher money growth. Keeping the range unchanged might also be seen

as better conveying the uncertainty about velocity behavior. The

alternative I ranges would be more consistent with M2 and M3 growth

needed to support the staff GDP projection if velocity were behaving in

line with historical relation to short-term interest rates. The Com-

mittee could choose to retain the current range but announce its

willingness to accept a shortfall if velocity were again to increase

unusually.



-16-

Short-Run Policy Alternatives

(20) Three short-run policy alternatives are presented for

consideration by the Committee. Under alternative B, the allowance for

adjustment and seasonal borrowing would be retained at $50 million, in

association with trading in federal funds continuing to be centered

around 3 percent.6 Under alternative A, the federal funds rate

would drop to 2-1/2 percent; this could be achieved either through a

reduction in the borrowing allowance to $25 million or by a half per-

centage point cut in the discount rate with unchanged borrowing.

Federal funds would trade around 3-1/2 percent under alternative C in

combination with a $25 million boost to the borrowing allowance.

(21) The markets appear to have built in an unchanged policy

in the period just ahead and thus interest rates would be expected to

remain near current levels under alternative B. Longer-term rates

might come under a little downward pressure if, consistent with the

staff greenbook forecast, news on prices continues to be good, and

economic indicators point to a little less momentum in the economic

expansion than in the second half of last year. Intermediate- and

long-term rates are likely to be especially volatile as markets digest

reports and rumors of fiscal initiatives or shifts in debt management

policy by the new Administration, and as they assess how any initia-

tives might influence monetary policy. The upcoming mid-quarter

refunding announcement, scheduled for February 3, will be watched

closely by market participants for clues of the Administration's debt

management plans, and the general shape of the Administration's fiscal

policy plans are likely to be covered in the President's address to the

6. An upward technical adjustment of $25 million to the borrowing
allowance might prove necessary in March should demands for seasonal
credit prove to be stronger than now anticipated.



-17-

Congress on February 17. The dollar would fluctuate around current

levels under alternative B, moving up on any news of unexpected eco-

nomic weakness or policy easing abroad, or down should the news about

the U.S. economy prove to be softer than expected.

(22) Short-term interest rates--including the prime rate--

would decline by the half-point drop in the federal funds rate under

alternative A. Availability constraints on business credit at banks

might ease more noticeably should bankers come to see lower rates

as improving the outlook for business profitability and lessening

strains in this sector. If incoming information suggested that the

economic expansion had lost some of its steam--such as a weak employ-

ment report--or if the easing were seen as being associated with the

likelihood of more fiscal policy restraint, this alternative might be

viewed as needing to be reversed before long. In these circumstances,

declines in intermediate- and long-term rates would be limited. The

dollar would move lower on foreign exchange markets.

(23) Although market participants seem to believe that some

tightening of monetary policy over the next year will be forthcoming,

they do not see this happening soon and thus would be surprised by the

election of alternative C. Short-term rates would rise by about 1/2

percentage point. Long-term rates, too, would rise, although the boost

to nominal rates would be held in check by the associated better out-

look for disinflation. The dollar would climb higher on foreign

exchange markets.

(24) The table below presents monetary growth rates over

the December-to-March period thought to be consistent with these



-18-

alternatives.7  M2 and M3 decline in February under all three

alternatives owing to the extraordinary contraction over the latter

part of January. On the thought that this drop owes in part to

exceptionally large tax payments at mid-month and repayment of holiday

credit card bills, elevated by unusual holiday spending, a rebound in

March is foreseen as the replenishing of these balances shows through.

(25) Under alternative B, M2 would be about flat on average

over February and March. The rebound in March owes partly to the

narrowing of opportunity costs that has occurred recently. Holding

down this pickup will be diminished mortgage refinancing closings in

the period just ahead, reflecting the fall-off in applications late in

1992, which will act as a drag on M1. (M1 is expected to grow at only

7. Following standard practice, the base for the short-run alterna-
tives is December instead of the November base used in the current
directive. The detailed table on monetary growth gives projections
for March to June and QIV 1992 to June to give an indication of where
money would be at midyear.

8. The new seasonal adjustment factors for February may be exag-
gerating the weakness in that month. Revisions to seasonal adjustment
factors, using long-standing statistical methods that incorporate
minimal staff judgmental intervention, were especially marked for the
month of February owing to considerable strength in not seasonally
adjusted money data in that month in recent years. That strength may
have been influenced importantly by the timing of System policy
easings rather than newly emerging seasonal influences and would not
be expected to be so evident this year.

a 1-3/4 percent rate over February and March.) Still, M2 would remain

below its fourth-quarter 1992 level and, on a quarterly average basis,

would decline at a 1-1/4 percent pace in the first quarter, implying a

sharp 7-1/2 percent rate of increase in its velocity.

(26) Although M3 would resume growing in March under alterna-

tive B, this aggregate would contract on balance over February and

March. A rebound in institution-only money market mutual funds as

year-end effects disappear and rate relationships are more favorable

acts to hold down the M3 run-off in February. Banks' needs for funds

are seen as remaining quite modest as businesses continue to concen-

trate their financing in the capital markets and as household spending

and borrowing moderate. Overall private credit demands are expected to

remain around the sluggish pace of recent months. Federal borrowing

which has been held down in January and February by unexpected tax

inflows, will strengthen substantially in March, boosting growth in

domestic nonfinancial debt to a 5-1/2 percent rate over February and

March and expansion from the fourth quarter of 1992 through March to

5 percent.

(27) Under alternative A, growth in M2 would pick up to a

1 percent annual rate over February and March, returning this aggregate

to its fourth-quarter 1992 level in March. In response to more attrac-

tive opportunity costs and the boost to income, M2 would be on a tra-

jectory to reach the lower bound of its long-run alternative II range

for 1993 by June, but would remain noticeably below its alternative I

range. Bigger inflows to savings and MMDAs, as well as to M1 balances,

would account for the faster growth in M2 in the months ahead. A

buildup of institution-only money funds, as holders responded to more

attractive rate relationships, would buoy M3 over February and March



-21-

under alternative A, and hold down the net declines in this aggregate

over these two months. Nonetheless, the level of M3 in March would

remain well below that of the fourth quarter of 1992, and the firmer

path of this aggregate in subsequent months still would not be

sufficient to return it to its fourth-quarter level until July.

(28) Under alternative C, M2 would decline over February and

March as larger opportunity costs act as an additional drag on this

aggregate. The rebound in its M1 component in March would about offset

a decline in February and it, too, would be about unchanged over these

two months. M3 would drop at a 1/4 percent annual rate over February

and March, as less attractive returns on M3-money funds lead to out-

flows from such funds. The weaker trajectory of this aggregate in

later months implies that even by midyear it would remain well below

its fourth-quarter 1992 level.

Directive Language

(29) Presented below for Committee consideration is draft

language relating to the Humphrey-Hawkins ranges for 1993 and to the

operating paragraph for the intermeeting period.

1993 Ranges

The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and

financial conditions that will foster price stability and

promote sustainable growth in output. In furtherance of

these objectives, the Committee at THIS [DEL: its] meeting [DEL: on

June 30 July 1 reaffirmed the ranges it had] established [DEL: in

February] RANGES for growth of M2 and M3 of [DEL: 2-1/2 to 6-1/-2]

____ TO ____ percent and [DEL: 1 to 5] ____ TO __ percent respec-

tively, measured from the fourth quarter of 1992 [DEL: 1991] to the

fourth quarter of 1993 [DEL: 1992]. The Committee anticipated that

developments contributing to unusual velocity increases

could persist DURING [DEL: in the second half of] the year. The

monitoring range for growth of total domestic nonfinancial

debt [DEL: also] was SET [DEL: maintained] at [DEL: 4-1/2 to 8-1/2] ____ TO ____

percent for the year. [DEL: For 1993, the Committee on a

tentative basis set the same ranges as in 199-2 for growth of

the monetary aggregates and debt measured from the fourth

quarter of 199-2 to the fourth quarter of 1993.] The behavior

of the monetary aggregates will continue to be evaluated in

the light of progress toward price level stability, move-

ments in their velocities, and developments in the economy

and financial markets.



-23-

OPERATIONAL PARAGRAPH

In the implementation of policy for the immediate

future, the Committee seeks to DECREASE SOMEWHAT/maintain/

INCREASE SOMEWHAT the existing degree of pressure on reserve

positions. In the context of the Committee's long-run

objectives for price stability and sustainable economic

growth, and giving careful consideration to economic,

financial, and monetary developments, slightly (SOMEWHAT)

greater reserve restraint (WOULD/MIGHT) or slightly (SOME-

WHAT) lesser reserve restraint would (MIGHT) be acceptable

in the intermeeting period. The contemplated reserve condi-

tions are expected to be consistent with GROWTH OF (DECLINES

IN) M2 AND M3 AT ANNUAL RATES [DEL: growing at a rate] of around

[DEL: 1-1/2 percent] ____ AND ____ PERCENT RESPECTIVELY OVER [DEL: M3 about

unchanged in] the period from DECEMBER [DEL: November] through

March.



APPENDIX A

MONEY STOCK REVISIONS

Measures of the money stock have been revised to incorporate
the results of the annual benchmark and seasonal factor review. The
attached tables compare growth rates of the old and revised series.
These data should be regarded as confidential until their release to
the public, tentatively planned for February 4.

Benchmark Revisions

Data for the monetary aggregates have been benchmarked using
call reports through September 1992 and other sources. The benchmark
revisions lowered the annual growth rate of M2 by .2 percentage point
over 1992. Other growth rates of M1, M2, and M3 were revised by no
more than .1 percentage point for any year.

The benchmark incorporates a change in the type of data used
to measure large time deposits held by domestic banks. We had relied
on reports from issuing banks as to bank holders of their CDs; we now
use reports by banks of CDs they hold, which we have learned to be
more accurate. (This item is one of several that are subtracted from
gross large time deposits to measure the quantity of such time depos-
its held by the nonbank public.) As a result of the change, this
netting item revised upward by as much as $12 billion over the past
seven years, thereby reducing the level of M3 by the same amount, but
causing little revision to the annual growth rates of M3. The bench-
mark also incorporates corrections for the previous misreporting by
banks of some brokered time deposits. Initially, these deposits had
been misclassified as large time deposits, rather than as small time
deposits. In last year's benchmark, this misclassification was cor-
rected for data reported by several large banks in 1990 and 1991. In
this year's benchmark, after a more thorough examination of the prob-
lem, the misclassification was corrected for a large number of addi-
tional banks, for data reported over the past nine years. The reclas-
sification of these deposits, which amounted to as much as $6 billion
in 1988, boosted the level of M2 but left M3 unaffected.

The benchmark also folded in historical data for several
money market mutual funds that began reporting for the first time
during 1992, raising the level of M3 by almost $9 billion in late
1992. Numerous other, smaller revisions were also made to the
aggregates.

Seasonal Factor Revisions

Seasonal factors for the monetary aggregates have been
revised using the X-11 ARIMA procedure applied to data through
preliminary estimates for January 1993. The seasonal adjustment
procedure used this year is identical to that used last year.

The revisions to seasonal factors redistributed some growth
in each of the aggregates from the first and fourth quarters to the
second and third quarters of 1992.

2. At the February 1979 meeting the FOMC adopted a QIV'78 to QIV'79 range for M1 of 1-1/2
to 4-1/2 percent. This range anticipated that shifting to ATS and NOW accounts in New
York State would slow M1 growth by 3 percentage points. At the October meeting it was
noted that ATS/NOW shifts would reduce M1 by no more than 1-1/2 percentage points. Thus,
the longer-run range for M1 was modified to 3-6 percent.
3. The figures shown reflect target and actual growth of MI-B in 1980 and shift-adjusted
M1-B in 1981. MI-B was relabeled M1 in January 1982. The targeted growth for Ml-A was
3-1/2 to 6 percent in 1980 (actual growth was 5.0 percent); in 1981 targeted growth for
shift-adjusted MI-A was 3 to 5-1/2 percent (actual growth was 1.3 percent).
4. When these ranges were set, shifts into other checkable deposits in 1980 were expected
to have only a limited effect on growth of MI-A and Ml-B. As the year progressed.
however, banks offered other checkable deposits more actively, and more funds than
expected were directed to these accounts. Such shifts are estimated to have decreased MI-
A growth and increased Ml-B growth each by at least 1/2 percentage point more than had
been anticipated.
5. Adjusted for the effects of shifts out of demand deposits and savings deposits into
other checkable deposits. At the February FOMC meeting, the target ranges for observed
M1-A and Ml-B in 1981 on an unadjusted basis, expected to be consistent with the adjusted
ranges, were -4-1/2 to -2 and 6 to 8-1/2 percent, respectively. Actual MI-B growth (not
shift adjusted) was 5.0 percent.
6. Adjusted for shifts of assets from domestic banking offices to International Banking
Facilities.
7. Range for bank credit is annualized growth from the December 1981-January 1982 average
level through the fourth quarter of 1982.
8. Base period, adopted at the July 1983 FOMC meeting, is QII'83. At the February 1983
meeting the FOMC had adopted a QIV'82 to QIV'83 target range for Ml of 4 to 8 percent.
9. Base period is the February-March 1983 average.
10. Base period, adopted at the July 1985 FOMC meeting, is QII'85. At the February 1985
meeting the FOMC had adopted a QIV'84 to QIV'85 target range for Ml of 4 to 7 percent.
11. No range for MI has been specified since the February 1987 FOMC meeting because of
uncertainties about its underlying relationship to the behavior of the economy and its
sensitivity to economic and financial circumstances.
12. At the February 1990 meeting the FOMC specified a range of 2-1/2 to 6-1/2 percent.
This range was lowered to 1 to 5 percent at the July 1990 meeting.
