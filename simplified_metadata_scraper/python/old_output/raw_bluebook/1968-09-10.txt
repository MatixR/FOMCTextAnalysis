MONEY MARKET AND RESERVE RELATIONSHIPS

Recent developments

(1) The rise in credit market yields in process around mid-

August wasconsiderablymoderated, though not entirely averted, by the

discount rate reduction to 5-1/4 per cent initiated on August 15.

Credit markets were also calmed by the concurrent reduction in the

repurchase agreement rate and modest easing of day-to-day money market

rates. In the municipal bond market, however, yields continued to rise

rather sharply under pressure from heavy new issue volume. The 3-month

Treasury bill rate, which had backed up to 5.17 per cent at mid-August,

following its share decline early in the month, for the most part

stayed close to its mid-month level, but most recently has traded

above 5.20 per cent.

(2) Before the discount rate action, Federal funds traded

most frequently at an effective rate of 6-1/8 per cent; since then,

however, the cost of Federal funds has tended downward to a 5-7/8 per

cent level, although a fair amount of trading has taken place at both

5-3/4 and at 6 per cent. In line with this somewhat easier tone in

the Federal funds market, dealer loan rates have also moved a little

lower, despite the persistence of large daily basic reserve deficits

on the order of $1 to $1-1/4 billion at the major New York banks.

-2-

Rates to dealers have most recently ranged around 6-1/2 per cent for

new loans, compared with rates more frequently around 6-5/8--6-7/8

per cent earlier in August.

(3) With a modest lowering of day-to-day money costs, and

with the rise of bill yields from their early August lows, the

disparities among short-term rates have lessened. None-

theless, dealer financing costs remain generally in excess of Treasury

bill yields. Moreover, dealer positions in bills and coupon issues

combined still total over $5 billion, down only slightly from mid-

August levels, and daily financing needs are running high.

(4) Partly because of the pressure of dealer financing needs,

but also partly because of expectations of lower interest rates in the

months ahead, major money market banks have remained relatively heavy

borrowers of short-term funds in the Federal funds and Euro-dollar

markets. While these banks have run deep basic reserve deficits, the

net borrowed reserve position of all member banks eased somewhat during

the past four statement weeks, averaging $205 million, as compared with

$260 million during the preceding four statement weeks. Member bank

borrowings averaged $505 million and $610 million during the two periods.

(5) With banks eager to expand investments--including

investments in municipals and in the new Treasury 5-5/8 per cent

notes--and with loan demands fairly well maintained, the bank credit

proxy grew in August at an average annual rate of about 21 per cent

(and 1/2 percentage point more with Euro-dollar borrowings included).



-3-

This growth rate compares with a 16-18 per cent range projected for

the month at the time of the last (telephone) Committee meeting. Time

and savings deposits expanded at a 21 per cent annual rate, and the

money supply by about 5 per cent.

(6) The average annual rates of growth of key monetary

variables for the past two months following the increase in fiscal

restraint and the relaxation of pressure on the banking system are

shown in the table below, in comparison with other recent periods. The

recent rapid rates of increase in reserve and most other monetary

aggregates reflect the combined impact of Treasury credit demands, banks'

initial response of quickly rebuilding outstanding negotiable CD's,

and the desires of banks and other investors to build up investment

portfolios in the expectation that interest rates would decline later.

Prospective developments

(7) Assuming no change from around levels prevailing since

the discount rate cut in the cost of one day money, the 3-month Treasury

bill rate may fluctuate in a 5.05--5.35 per cent range between now

and the next meeting of the Committee. Bill rates may rise into

about the third week in September, and then decline, for reasons

explained in paragraphs (9) and (10) below. These wide swings in

bill rates,should they develop, may also be accompanied by fairly

broad movements in other money market rates and conditions.

(8) Prevailing levels of 1-day money rates center around

5-7/8 per cent for the Federal funds rate, and 6-1/2 per cent for

dealer new loan rates. These rates may be consistent with member bank

borrowings in a $400-$600 million range. Excess reserves of banks in

this period may vary from their usual pattern as banks begin to adapt

themselves to the new lagged reserve requirements, weekly country bank

settlements, and permission to carry over reserve excesses into the

next statement week--which become effective in the week beginning

September 12. Over the long-run, one might expect excess reserves to

be reduced further as a result of these innovations, but in the transition

period excess reserves could rise as banks cautiously appraise the

effects of the new provisions. As a result, there is condiderable

uncertainty about the level of net borrowed reserves that is likely

to be consistent with other money market conditions.



-5-

(9) The greatest upward pressures on the bill rate are

likely to develop in the period around the mid-September tax date.

While corporate tax payments are expected to be much larger than a

year ago, the Treasury is expected to have to keep its balance at the

Federal Reserve at very low levels before these payments are received

(with some direct Treasury borrowing from the Fed quite possible).

This lower balance, and possible foreign transactions, will add to the

need for System absorption of reserves in the two statement weeks

ending September 18; in this period the System may have to sell more

than $1 billion of securities.

(10) The bill market may be especially sensitive to large

System bill sales, as well as any further sales by foreign accounts

that may develop, because the level of bill inventories in dealer

hands remains relatively large, particularly longer-term bills. In

addition, financing costs remain above current bill yields. Under

these conditions, it may turn out that banks' reserve position would

have to be eased temporarily to keep the expected rise in the bill rate

from cumulating and, through expectational changes, spreading to other

financial markets. However, as the Treasury balance is restored

after the mid-month tax date and the System returns to the buy side of

the market in the latter part of September, upward yield pressures

in the bill market may be relaxed, even with day-to-day money rates

and marginal reserve measures returning closer to currently prevailing

levels.



-6-

(11) The absence of aggressive bank issuance of CD's in

the past week or two has been one factor tending to moderate upward

bill rate pressures. Banks are not expected to add substantially

further to the already advanced level of outstanding CD's, although

they might be spurred to do so if September loan demand proves larger

than many banks now expect. The Euro-dollar market may continue to be

a relatively attractive alternative source of funds for banks, partic-

ularly if the recent speculative flow of funds into Germany is reversed.

(12) Even with only modest growth in negotiable CD's after

allowing for the usual seasonal decline in September, total time and

savings deposits are expected to rise in a 15-18 per cent, annual rate,

range in September on average. This rate of growth in part reflects

the carry-over effect on the September average of a fairly rapid

expansion in time deposits other than large CD's in the second half of

August, perhaps partly bolstered by re-investment of cash from redemption

of maturing issues in the August refunding. Growth in such time and

savings deposits during the course of September, and also October, is

expected to be closer to the more moderate July-early August pace.

(13) Private demand deposits may show little change on

average during the next two months, but continued growth in currency

is likely to produce a small increase in the money supply. U.S.

Government deposits may show relatively little change on average over

the two months. We have assumed a $3 billion Treasury tax bill financing

in the latter part of October.



-7-

(14) Given the money and short-term credit market conditions

discussed in paragraphs (7) through (10), the bank credit proxy in

September is expected to rise in a 7-10 per cent, annual rate, range

(and perhaps about 1/2 percentage point more if the figures are

adjusted to include liabilities to foreign branches and if these

liabilities remain at their end of August level). In October, the

bank credit growth rate is not expected to be very different, though

perhaps on the high side of the range; obviously, the timing, amount,

and character of the Treasury's projected cash financing will influence

that month's bank credit growth.

(15) As compared with the July-August average, the expecta-

tion of more moderate bank credit growth over the next two months is

based on the reduced Treasury cash need, some repayment of the current

very high level of security loans, and a lessening of business loan

demand particularly after the September tax date. At the same time,

banksare projected to be large buyers of state and local government

securities, given the continued heavy volume of offerings and the

recent back-up in yields. The projected moderation in the pace of

bank credit growth is not itself expected to contribute to significantly

higher long-term interest rates, in part because the reduced growth

reflects a reduction in credit demands.
