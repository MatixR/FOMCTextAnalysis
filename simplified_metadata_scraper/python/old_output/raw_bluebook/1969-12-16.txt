MONEY MARKET AND RESERVE RELATIONSHIPS

Recent developments

(1) With few exceptions, interest rates throughout short-

and long-term credit markets have risen further since the last meeting

of the Committee. Reflecting a rise in dealer bill positions, a sustained

high cost of dealer financing, and expectations that tax-date and year-

end pressures may be larger-than-usual this year, the 3-month

Treasury bill rate moved well above the 7-1/2 per cent top of the range

projected in the last Blue Book. It reached a peak of 7.91 per cent on

December 10, about 40 basis points above its level two meetings ago.

(2) In the previous inter-meeting period, the upsurge in

the 3-month bill rate had been accompanied by even sharper increases in

yields on other bill maturities and by sizable advances in other short-

term credit market rates as well. Since the last meeting, however, the

3-month bill has risen more in yield than other short-term instruments,

bringing it more in line with other short-term rates. For example, the

6-month bill rate rose by only about 15 basis points to a high of 8.02

per cent from its already advanced level at the time of the last meeting.

Most recently there was some improvement in the bill market, and the

3-month and 6-month bills were quoted 7.81 and 7.84 per cent, respectively

on December 12. Long-term interest rates have moved higher on balance,

although in the corporate bond sector a recent rally has pushed rates

down from the record levels reached in the first week of December.

(3) During the past two statement weeks, the weekly average

effective rate on Federal funds was between 8-3/4 and 9 per cent, or about

the same as in November. Net borrowed reserves averaged $1 billion and

member bank borrowings $1.2 billion, also little changed from November.

Dealer loan rates increased somewhat in early December, however, as

dealer bill positions and financing demands rose and the basic reserve

deficit of major reporting banks in New York began to deepen by somewhat

more than seasonal proportions.

(4) Along with the general rise in interest rates since the

last meeting of the Committee, the money supply has been weaker than

previously projected, as indicated by figures for private demand deposits

in the last statement week of November and in the first two weeks of

December. Money supply growth in November is now estimated at about a

3-1/2 per cent annual rate, slightly below the bottom of the range of the

previous Blue Book. And the December projection, as will be noted in the

section on prospective developments, has also been revised in a weaker

direction.

(5) Total time and savings deposits in November showed a slight

decline, on average, about as projected, and total member bank deposits rose

at around an 11 per cent annual rate--also about as expected--due to the very

large increase in U.S. Government deposits. Supporting deposit growth, total

reserves rose at about a 9 per cent annual rate and nonborrowed reserves

at a 5 per cent rate, as member bank borrowings rose seasonally adjusted from

October to November. Nondeposit sources of funds in November added about

2-1/2 percentage points to total member bank deposits.



(6) The following table summarizes annual rates of change

in major deposit, reserve, and credit aggregates for 1968 and to date

Prospective developments

(7) For the second paragraph of the current economic policy

directive, the Committee may wish to consider the following wording

(Alternative A):

"To implement this policy, System open market

operations until the next meeting of the Committee

shall be conducted with a view to maintaining the

prevailing firm conditions in THE money [DEL: and-short

term-credit markets; provided, however, that opera-

tions shall be modified if bank credit appears to be

deviating significantly from current projections or

if UNUSUAL LIQUIDITY pressures SHOULD DEVELOP." arise

in-connection-with-possible-bank-regulatory-changes.

(8) The specification of prevailing firm conditions in the

money market as they pertain to the Federal funds rate and marginal reserve

measures could be the same as in the previous Blue Book--a Federal funds

rate in an 8-1/2 - 9-1/2 per cent range, member bank borrowings $1 -

$1-1/2 billion, and net borrowed reserves $900 million - $1.2 billion.

Some allowance may have to be made within the period, however, to

accommodate a seasonal tendency for banks to hold higher excess reserves

in connection with year-end churning.

(9) The prevailing 3-month Treasury bill rate, as noted

earlier, has moved well above previous specifications. Over the next

four weeks, given the money market conditions noted, the bill rate may



-5-

fluctuate in a 7-1/2 - 8 per cent range. A number of factors might exert

upward pressure on the 3-month bill rate. Corporate tax payments are of

record proportions for mid-December and both corporate and bank liquidity

are strained; dealer bill positions are on the high side going into the

tax period; and if prevailing net borrowed reserves were to be maintained,

the System might have to absorb about $800 million of reserves in the

statement week ending December 24 largely in consequence of a seasonal

bulge in float. In addition, the market is likely to be anticipating

large outflows of savings from banks and thrift institutions over year-

end (with some of the funds going into intermediate- and longer-term bonds);

as a result Federal agencies and thrift institutions may have to sell

sizable amounts of Treasury bills and other short-term assets into the

market. Thus, there is a possibility that unusual liquidity pressures

could develop in the next few weeks.

(10) It is possible, on the other hand, that the bill market

has already been discounting some of these pressures. For this and other

reasons the bill rate could move back to or even below the lower end of

the range specified above during the latter part of the interval before

the January 13 meeting, although such a change cannot be predicted with

certainty. In the first half of January seasonal pressures abate, and

in late December and early January, the System is likely to be a net

supplier of reserves. In addition, Board staff projections suggest that

the Treasury may not need to raise new cash in January, as it typically



-6-

has done in past years. Because of the possibility of a bill rate

decline, the reference to "other short-term credit markets" in the

proposed directive language has been deleted on the assumption the

Committee would wish to avoid any implication that the Manager should

resist a tendency for the bill rate to recede from its current high

prevailing level.

(11) Total time and savings deposits are projected to rise

in a 3 - 6 per cent, annual rate, range in December. In part, this

rise reflects continued net inflows of foreign official time deposits,

which are assumed to continue rising at about $100 million a week.

In addition, time deposits other than large CD's appeared to become

less weak in the last week of November and thus far in December--with

outstandings showing moderate net increases after rough seasonal adjust-

ment. Finally, the steady attrition of large CD's of domestic holders

has reduced their relative weight in total time and saving deposits and

brought amounts maturing in December to the point where the actual

decline in December is unlikely to reach usual seasonal proportions.

A crude adjustment for the inappropriateness of established seasonal

factors on total time and saving deposits, given current low levels

of outstanding CD's, suggests that growth in time and savings deposits

in December might be overstated by one to two percentage points, implying

compensating adjustments throughout other months of the year. In

January, total time and savings deposits are projected to decline

rate
at a 2 - 5 per cent/partly because the seasonal rebuilding of domestic CD's



-7-

achieved in past Januaries cannot occur in the current environment of

very high market interest rates. The staff has assumed that net out-

flows of domestic time deposits other than large CD's following the end-

of-year interest-crediting will be larger than after September but not

quite as large as following the mid-year interest-crediting period, given

the outflow of interest-sensitive money that has already occurred.

(12) The money supply in December is projected to decline

in a 3 - 6 per cent, annual rate, range and little net growth is

expected in January. At current high interest rates, demand for cash

balances appears to be reduced, and the slower growth currently estimated

and in near-term prospect for GNP is consistent with a moderation in

transactions demand for money. On the other hand, year-end window

dressing by domestic non-financial corporations seeking to conform

to Commerce regulations on direct foreign investment might lead to a

temporary inflow of funds and a bulge in year-end demand deposits

similar to the one that occurred last year. Such a development would

tend temporarily to strengthen money supply performance at year-end

and in early January, as also might shifts of savingsfrom institutions

to the market. U.S. Government demand deposits seem likely to decline

moderately on average in December and to recover to about the same

degree in January, assuming that savings outflows from S&L's in January

are not so severe as to force the FHLB to make use of its direct

borrowing line at the Treasury.



(13) Total member bank deposits in December are projected

to show little net change, on average, but then to decline in a 1-4

per cent range in January. Commercial paper issued by bank-related

affiliates is expected to continue growing at about the recent $100

million per week rate, assuming no change in the current pending

status of the Board's proposed regulation. Euro-dollar takings are

likely to decline somewhat between now and year-end, if past seasonal

patterns are followed. However, business loan demands are likely to

be relatively strong this month--in view of the tax payments and

continued inventory accumulation--and banks may bid somewhat more

aggressively for Euro-dollar funds, perhaps reducing the extent of

the seasonal decline in the last half of December. All in all, in

December nondeposit sources may add about a percentage point to the

change in total member bank deposits, followed by a somewhat larger

addition in January, although the increase could be mainly the result

of a seasonal recovery in Euro-dollars.

(14) Given the continued constraints on banks, changes in

long-term interest rates are most likely to reflect expectational

factors and changes in credit market demands. A temporary seasonal

abatement in demands will develop between now and year-end, and heavy

buying of bonds by retail customers could well push interest rates

down, but the January calendar of corporate and municipal issues

appears unusually large. The magnitude and persistence of any declines

in long-term interest rates would appear to depend on the volume of



-9-

fund transfers out of equities, short-term market instruments, and

thrift institutions, as well as on the willingness of institutional

investors with regular inflows of funds to bid actively to lock-up high

yields. Such buying will depend in part on expectational forceswhich

would be strongly affected by economic news.

(15) If current projections for December are realized, the

annual rates of increase for key aggregates in the fourth quarter would

be as follows (using the midpoint of the December projections):

Annual Rates
(in percentage points)

Total reserves 2.0
Nonborrowed reserves -2.0
Money supply 0.0
Time and savings deposits 0.0
Total member bank deposits 0.5
Total member bank deposits

plus nondeposit sources 2.0

Policy alternative

(16) If the Committee should decide to move toward slightly

less firm money market conditions, it might wish to consider the follow-

ing second paragraph for the directive (Alternative B):

'To implement this policy, System open market

operations until the next meeting of the Committee

shall be conducted with a view to [DEL: maintaining-the

prevailing-ACHIEVING SLIGHTLY LESS firm conditions

in THE money and-short-term-credit markets;] provided,

however, that operations shall be modified if bank

credit appears to be deviating significantly from

current projections or if UNUSUAL LIQUIDITY pressures

SHOULD DEVELOP [DEL: aruse in connection with-possible

bank regulatory changes.]



-10-

(17) The slightly less firm money market conditions might

involve Federal funds most frequently around 8-1/2 per cent, member bank

borrowings around $1 billion or a little less, and net borrowed reserves

fluctuating around $800 million. With some change in market expectations

developing under these conditions, the 3-month bill rate might move

rather rapidly down into a 7 - 7-1/2 per cent range, and some downward

adjustment in long-term interest might be expected as well.

(18) Monetary aggregates probably would be affected only in

a minor way over the near-term by the change in market conditions

specified above, unless there is a sharp shift in market expectations.

Any significant upward impact on the aggregates probably would require

a more extended easing of money market conditions than the one specified,

especially when ceiling rates on deposits are so far below the market

and bank investment policies have become so cautious.

Explanation of Projections in Table 6

1. Changes in Federal Reserve credit indicate reserves needed to offset projected changes in
required reserves and factors affecting the supply of reserves.

2. Projected changes in currency outside banks reflect seasonal movements plus an allowance for
growth of about $50 million per week.

3. Projected effects of Treasury operations, included in "technical factors," reflect scheduled
and assumed calls in current two weeks and maintenance of Treasury balances with Federal Reserve
at $1.9 billion, thereafter.

4. Projected changes in required reserves assume the existing net reserve position of banks and
the structure of interest rates in the market, as well as the current economic outlook. On
the basis of these assumptions, projections reflect expected movements in bank credit and
money in the period ahead, including the effects of such elements as the public's loan demand,
repayments of previous loans, banks' investment preferences and willingness to supply loans,
banks' desires and abilities to obtain time and savings deposits, and the Government's financing
needs. The projections thus encompass normal seasonal developments, temporary bursts of
loans demand and expected associated repayments not currently reflected by the seasonals, and
whatever cyclical and growth demands for money and credit are expected in the projection period.
Assumed Treasury financing operations include: $-0.7 billion, December 15; $-1.1 billion,
December 22; and $100 million addition to weekly bill auctions over the remainder of the year.
