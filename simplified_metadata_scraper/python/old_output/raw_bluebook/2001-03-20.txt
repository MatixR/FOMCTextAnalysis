The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain. 
 

Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a redaction process that removed information obtained on a

scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked

1  Over the intermeeting period, federal funds have traded at rates near the target
level.  The Desk  redeemed $3.2  billion of Treasury securitie s, mostly coupon  issues, to
continue bringing SOMA holdings into conformance with the per-issue limits.  To offset the
resulting reserve drain and meet longer-term reserve needs, the Desk purchased $9.4 billion
of Treasury securities in the market and $790 million of Treasury bills from foreign
customers.  The volume of outstanding long-term RPs remained at $12 billion.

MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Recent D evelopments

(1) The Committee’s decision on January 31 to reduce the intended level of

the federal funds rate by 50 basis points, to 5½ percent, and the announcement that it

viewed risks as remaining weighted toward economic weakness were widely

anticipated and had little impact on market yields.1  Information  becoming  available

over the intermeeting period–particularly widespread earnings disappointments, sharp

declines in share prices, and a notable drop in consum er confidence–led  market

participants to mark down further their anticipated path of the federal funds rate.  The

market is now confident that the Committee will lower the funds rate by at least 50

basis points at the March meeting and has priced in high odds of a 75 basis point

action.  Looking further ahead, futures contracts point to expectations that the funds

rate will move down to  around 4¼  percent by the  fall (chart 1).

(2) Against this backdrop, the Treasury yield curve has shifted lower over

the intermeeting period, with short-term interest rates falling 50 basis points and

longer-term yields dropping 30 to 50 basis points.  Broad equity indexes have declined

about 15 percent, in large part owing to declines in  the pr ices of technology shares. 

Indeed, the technology-heavy Nasdaq has plunged 32 percent, but of late the

weakness has spread to other sectors.  Despite these substantial cap ital losses, markets

have continued to function without significant signs of strain.  However, the gloomier

profits outlook and unsettled prospects for corporate equities have put upward

pressure on private debt spreads in recent days, especially for lower-rated

corporations.  As a consequence, rates on h igh-yield bonds have fallen only 10 basis

points, while those on the bonds of better-rated corporations are off 35 to 45 basis

points.  At commercial banks, many lending officers report they have again tightened

standards and terms on business loans since the beginning of the year, raising the cost

and likely signaling the reduced availability of new loan commitments.

(3) Bond yields and stock prices fell in most other industrial countries over

the intermeeting period, albeit generally by less than in the United States.  Still, the

dollar apprec iated in value on  foreign exchange markets, gain ing 3¾ percent against a

basket of major currencies (chart 2).  The dollar strengthened most against the

currencies of countries where the potential for economic weakening was seen to be

greatest, increasing 3¾ percent vis-a-vis the Canadian dollar and 5½ percent relative

to the Japanese yen.  Over the intermeeting period, the Bank of Canada eased policy

by 50 basis points, but market participants apparently harbored considerable concerns

that this would be insufficient to absorb the impact on Canada of a slowing U.S.

economy.  The Bank of Japan trimmed 10 basis points from its call money rate, which

now stands at 15 basis points, and some officials hinted that more easing might be in

store.  But with Japanese equity prices falling 13 percent over the last six weeks and

raising doubts about the banking sector, the political coalition in power looking

fragile, and forward-looking indicators pointing to very weak domestic spending, the

prospects for economic activity in  Japan seem poor.  Market participants apparently

viewed the economic expansion in Europe as more secure and seemed unfazed by the

European Central Bank keeping its policy on hold.  Nonetheless, the dollar gained 2¼

percent against the euro.  Over the intermeeting period,

not intervene.

(4) The dollar rose ¾ percent over the intermeeting period in  terms of a

basket of currencies of our other important trading partners.  In Turkey, with a weak

banking system adding to pressures on government finances and political tensions

flaring, the central bank was forced to abandon its crawling peg in late February.  The

dollar initially appreciated over 50 percent against the Turkish lira but has

subsequently fallen back some to end the period up about 30 percent.  The spillover

to other markets was contained, with investors withdrawing for a time from the debt

of Argentina, which has sim ilarly shaky finances and political troubles.  On net,

spreads on Argentinian debt edged lower over the period, reflecting confidence in the

new finance minister.  But with the outlook for the global economy looking poorer

and investors somewhat more skittish, spreads on emerging  market debt rose 65 basis

points on net.  Emerging market equity prices have followed U.S. markets down but

have dropped somewhat less on balance.

(5) Falling interest rates have contributed to rapid growth in the monetary

aggregates in recent months.  M2 expanded at a 10¾ percent rate in February, down

only a little from its January pace, w ith the strength in  both months concentrated in its

liquid components (see chart 2).  In addition to declines in its opportunity cost, the

robust growth of M2 this year may reflect the appeal of safe, short-term assets, given 

volatile equity markets and the yield advantage of money funds relative to longer-term

investments.  M2 also was lifted somewhat last month by a pickup in mortgage loan

prepayments, the proceeds of which are temporarily held in bank deposits, and by

larger than usual tax refunds.  M3 growth, too, remained strong in February, at an

11½ percent rate, supported by a surge in institutional money market funds, whose

yields lagged the declines in money market rates.



4

(6) Businesses have taken advantage of lower long-term interest rates and a

receptive bond market since early in the year to issue a huge volume of bonds, a good

chunk of which has been  earmarked to pay down commercial paper.  Many lower-

rated commercial paper issuers, facing reluctant investors and elevated interest rates,

also have turned to commercial banks.  Bank lending to businesses has been robust

since the turn of the year, despite the reported further tightening of standards and

terms since then.  On net, business borrowing appears to be growing about in line

with the pace of late last year.  Lower interest rates also have buoyed the mortgage

market, supporting househo ld borrowing, which was augmented by robust consumer

debt growth early in the year.  State and local governments, too, have moved to take

advantage of favorable interest rates by stepping up issuance, only partly for refunding

purposes.  Overall, growth of debt of the nonfederal sectors ear ly this year appears to

have edged down from its pace of the last quarter of 2000, while growth of total

domestic nonfinancial debt has been about maintained owing to some moderation in

the contraction  of federal debt.

Policy Alternatives

(7) In the staff forecast, an inventory correction intensifies further in the

current quarter, holding output to a very small increase.  With inventories better

aligned with sales by the second half of the year and the effects of policy

easings–including another 50 basis points assumed to occur at this meeting–working

their way through to spending, output growth gradually picks up.  Although

consumption gets a lift from the expected decline of energy prices and the assumed

retroactive tax cut, the deterioration in the net worth of households damps the

rebound.  Investment demand recovers gradually, supported by continued rap id

growth in structural productivity.  The staff assum ption that po licy will be on hold

over the remainder of the forecast period implies a path for the funds rate that is

higher than expected by the financial markets, contributing to  some backup in

nominal long-term interest rates, a decline in equity prices, and a more moderate

depreciation in the dollar.  Partly as a consequence, the growth of aggregate demand

rises slowly over coming quarters and approaches that of aggregate supply only by the

end of the forecast period.  The extended period of subpar growth results in the

unemployment rate rising to about 5½ percent, producing a small drop in core PCE

inflation in 2002 from this year’s projected 2 percent pace.

(8) The Committee could select a 50 basis point reduction in the funds

rate at this meeting if it thought an easing of at least this size  would prove necessary to

promote a return of economic growth to an acceptable pace over time.  The resulting

5 percent federal funds rate would imply a real rate of around 3 percent–assuming that

inflation expectations are in line with  the staff forecast of core  PCE prices.  Even if

this places the real rate  below its long-run equilibrium value, an undershoot m ay well

be needed for a time to counter the effects of the declines in equity wealth, the

apparent downward revision to expected near-term returns on cap ital, a possible



7

overhang of productive  capacity, and lower  business and  consumer confidence. 

Although the cumulative reduction in the funds rate of 1½ percentage points since the

start of the year would represent a sharp and substantial change in the stance of

policy, aggregate demand and attitudes have deteriorated quickly.  The relatively rapid

lessening of pressures in labor markets now likely in train should counter any

tendency for inflation to move higher.  If the Committee suspected that additional

easing might be needed at some point, it might still prefer to move by no more than

50 basis points a t this meeting so  that it could better assess the initial response to its

previous actions, the underlying  strength of demand, and the extent of price pressures. 

In those circumstances, the Committee presumably would want to retain the current

statement that the risks are weighted toward economic weakness.  The Committee

could also retain that statement if it believed that 50 basis points could well be

sufficient to achieve its objectives, but saw the risks to that outlook as skewed to the

downside.   

(9) Market participants evidently expect at least a 50 basis point cut in the

target funds rate at this meeting, with federal funds futures rates suggesting high odds

that the reduction will be 75 basis points.  Participants also reportedly expect the

Committee to state that the balance of risks remains weighted  toward economic

weakness.  Therefore, a 50 basis po int move combined w ith such a statement likely

would cause interest rates to back up.  Price declines might be larger in equity markets,

where investors seem to be hoping for especially aggressive Federal Reserve act ion. 

Further easings in the stance of monetary policy over time would continue to be

anticipated, and current market expectations that the funds rate could be around 4¼

percent later th is year m ight not be material ly affected. 

(10) The Committee could decide to reduce the target federal funds rate even

more at this meeting–choosing a 75 basis point decrease–if it saw the outcome in



8

the staff forecast as plausible and consistent with its objec tives but subject to

excessive downside risks.  Sources of risk include the possibility of substantial further

decreases in equ ity prices and tightening in credit conditions as profits continue to  fall,

and fragility in consumer and business confidence.  In addition, recent profit and sales

shortfalls in the technology sector could indicate a considerable overhang of high-tech

capital throughout the economy or  even a slower  pace of structural productivity

growth going forward.  Either case would weaken investment spending for some time

and probably necessitate significant monetary policy ease.  Thus, a 75 basis point

reduction in the funds rate at this time could be appropriate to provide some

protection against the possibility of a prolonged period of economic weakness.  Even

if the Committee does not see inordinate downside risks to the staff forecast, it might

view that forecast as involving unacceptably weak output and employment, justifying a

greater easing than assumed by the staff.  In the Greenbook, the  unemployment rate

rises noticeably above the level the staff judges to  be consistent  with stable in flation . 

Moreover, the Committee may see good odds that the economy can sustainably

operate at a noticeably lower level of unemployment than is embedded in the staff

forecast, and want to lean against appreciable increases in unemployment absent

clearer  evidence that  such increases are necessary  to contain inflation .   

(11) A 75 basis point easing, if accompanied by a statement that the risks

remain weighted toward economic weakness, would generate some price gains in both

the fixed income and equity m arkets.  But, given the skittishness in financial markets

and the possibility that the stock adjustment process for capital and inventories may

have a ways to run, the Committee might still see a preponderance of downside risks

to the economy, even after the 75 basis point move and the likely reaction in asset

markets. 



9

(12) In developing its forecast, the staff has placed considerable weight on

the recent deterioration in consumer confidence and equity wealth.  If, instead, the

Committee put more emphasis on the relatively firm indicators on spending and

employment of late, it might view the forecast of output in the Greenbook as too

pessimistic.  In that case, it might think that less easing is called for  than assumed in

the staff forecast and much less than is anticipated by the market, inclining it to favor

a smaller, 25 basis point reduction in the target funds rate.  Moreover, the

disquieting readings on consumer prices for January might counsel caution in lowering

the funds rate further.  Given the sizable easing already undertaken  this year, a more

gradual approach to further reductions in  the funds rate may now be appropriate, in

part to  allow time to gauge the effects of the po licy act ions in  the pipeline. 

(13) Market participants wou ld be surprised  by an easing of only 25 basis

points, and debt and equity markets would sell off apprec iably–and even more sharply

if this action were combined with a shift to a statement of balanced risks.  But if the

Committee saw considerably more underlying strength in the real economy or greater

inflation risks than did market participants, it might view as appropriate the resulting

reassessment of the trajectory of expected policy and the consequent tightening of

financ ial conditions. 

(14) Under the staff forecast, including the assumed 50 basis point easing at

this meeting, the debt of domestic nonfinancial sectors is projected to grow at a 5½

percent rate over the period from January to June.  Sluggish economic growth and

declining profits may make lenders somewhat more cautious, but a significant

decrease in credit availability is not foreseen, and the debt of borrowers other than the

federal government is projected to increase at an 8 percent annual rate over the same

interval.  This latter growth rate far exceeds the 3½ percent pace of nominal GDP

growth foreseen for the first half of this year.  For households, the expansion of



10

mortgage debt is expected to be well maintained, reflecting the influence of low

mortgage interest rates on housing activity and mortgage refinancing.  Consumer

credit growth, by contrast, is seen as moderating significantly, as consumer outlays on

durable goods are projected to be weak.  Business debt growth should remain hefty as

external financing needs continue to be substantial, owing in  part to the weakness in

profits.  

(15) Under the Greenbook assessment of the likely evolution of nominal

income and interest rates, the staff expects M2 growth to moderate to a 7½ percent

pace over the February-to-June interval.  Falling market interest rates, mortgage

prepayment activity, and attractive returns on money funds relative to longer-term

instruments are projected to lift M2 growth in the near-term.  However, this boost, on

balance, is smaller than in the first two months of the year, as the declines in short-

term interest rates are assumed to slow from their pace around the turn of the year. 

M3 growth, projected at a 7 percent pace over the February-to-June interval, is

supported by further strong expansion of institutional money funds following the

assumed easing action at this meeting.
