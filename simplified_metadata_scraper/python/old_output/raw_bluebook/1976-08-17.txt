The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version available 
based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the Board 
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was created 
through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned 
versions text-searchable.2   Though a stringent quality assurance process was 
employed, some imperfections may remain. 
 
Please note that some material may have been redacted from this document if that

MONETARY AGGREGATES AND
MONEY MARKET CONDITIONS

Recent Developments

(1) Over the July-August period, M1 appears to be expanding

at an annual rate of about 6 per cent--the mid-point of the Committee's

operating range. Growth of M2 over the same period is now projected at

around a 10 per cent annual rate, somewhat above the mid-point of its

range. Expansion of the time deposit component of M2 in July was somewhat

more rapid than anticipated, reflecting a resumption of savings deposit

growth as short-term market interest rates declined. Deposit inflows to

nonbank thrift institutions also increased sharply during the month. Non-

borrowed reserves appear to be increasing at only about a 2½ per cent

annual rate over the July-August period, as a decline in the outstanding

volume of money market CD's of banks released reserves to support other

deposits.

(2) Given growth in M1 and M2 close to the mid-points of the

FOMC's short-run ranges, the Desk has continued to aim at a Federal

funds rate of around 5¼ per cent. With earlier market concern about a

near-term tightening in monetary policy allayed by the stability of the

funds rate--as well as by moderate growth in the monetary aggregates

and incoming economic data that seemed to indicate less than anticipated

strength in the economy--short-term market interest rates declined

another 10 to 20 basis points during the intermeeting period. The prime

rate at major banks was reduced ¼ percentage point to 7 per cent in

early August.

(3) Long-term credit markets have also been influenced by a

more optimistic assessment of the interest rate outlook. Corporate

and municipal bond yields have fallen 15 to 20 basis points since the

July Committee meeting, although this partly reflects a moderation in

the volume of new offerings coming to market during the period and

in immediate prospect. Mortgage rates have changed little over the

intermeeting period.

(4) The Treasury successfully marketed a substantial volume

of longer-term debt in connection with its mid-August refunding. To

redeem $4.5 billion of maturing obligations held by the public and to

raise new cash, the Treasury sold $10.6 billion of new securities. The

refunding package included $2 billion of 3-year notes, $7.6 billion of

10-year notes (increased from $4 billion when subscriptions for the



issue totaled $2444 billion), and $1 billion of 25 -year bonds. While

dealers were awarded most of the new bond, they received only minimal

allotments of the 10-year note. In when-issued trading, however, they

have taken a large volume of 10-year securities into their positions.

Total dealer positions in Treasury coupon issues are large, but dealers

thus far appear to be willing holders as all three new issues are selling

at sizable premiums over their issue prices and there is a very sizable

positive carry on the longer-term issues.

percentage annual rates of change) related monetary and financial flows

Prospective developments

(6) Summarized below for Committee consideration are three

alternative short-run specifications for the monetary aggregates and the

Federal funds rate.

(intermeeting period)

(7) Longer-run projections of levels and growth rates are shown

in the tables on pp. 5a and 5b. Under all three alternatives, the monetary

growth rates shown for the QII '76-QII '77 period are around the mid-points

of the longer-run ranges adopted by the Committee at its last meeting.

Expected behavior of the funds rate between now and mid-1977 under these

assumptions is shown in Appendix Table II.

(8) Over the longer-run, the three alternatives would differ

in the distribution of monetary ease or restraint--whether measured by

monetary growth rates or interest rate levels--between the second half

of 1976 and the first half of 1977. Alternative A--which involves an

easing of the money market over the next few weeks--encompasses more

monetary ease in the second half of this year than the other two alterna-

tives, and more monetary restraint in the first half of next year. At the

other end of the spectrum, alternative C--which assumes a tightening of the

1/ Nonborrowed reserves and other reserve aggregates thought to be con-
sistent with these ranges are shown in Appendix table I.

money market between now and the next Committee meeting--focuses monetary

restraint more in the second half of this year. Alternative B lies in

between. The differences among the alternatives, as indexed by growth rates

for M1 and the average level of the funds rate, are summarized in the table

below.

Alt. A Alt. B Alt. C

M1 growth
2nd half '76 5¾ 5¾ 5¼
1st half '77 5½ 5¾ 6

Average level of funds rate
2nd half '76 5-3/8 5½ 6-1/8
1st half '77 7¼ 6-7/8 6¾

(9) The intermeeting range for the Federal funds rate under

alternative B is centered on 5¾ per cent, the rate recently prevailing.

Given the projected increase in nominal GNP at about an 11 per cent annual

rate on average over the next few quarters, the staff still expects that

interest rates will begin rising fairly soon if longer-run M1 growth is

held to around a 5¾ per cent annual rate. By the second quarter of 1977,

we would expect the funds rate to average around 7¼ per cent.

(10) Under alternative B, M1 is expected to expand in a 4-8 per

cent, annual rate, range over the August-September period and M2 in a

7½-11½ per cent range. M1 is expected to increase somewhat more rapidly

in September than in August, in part because of a sharp drop in Treasury

balances. These balances have built up substantially in August, reflecting

the unexpectedly large amount of net new money raised in the recent

Treasury financing operation.



(11) M2 growth is likely to be sustained by sizable inflows of

time and savings deposits other than money market CD's, given continued

stability in the funds rate and little change in other short-term rates.

The rate of increase in such time deposits may be more rapid in September

than in August, when expansion apparently is being restrained by the diver-

sion of funds to purchase the Treasury's new 8 per cent, 10-year note.

Over the longer run, the prospective rise in interest rates would likely

dampen savings and time deposit flows. It appears likely that, by the

spring of 1977, Regulation Q ceilings would need to be increased in order

to maintain M2 and M3 growth rates near the mid-points of their respective

longer-run ranges.

(12) Demands on credit markets are expected to be relatively

modest over the next few weeks. In the August-September period, the

average monthly volume of new issues may amount to only about $1-1/2 bil-

lion for publicly offered corporate bonds, and about $2 billion for state

and local government issues--down from average monthly volumes of about

$2-1/2 billion and just under $3 billion, respectively, in the first half

of the year. There are signs of some pick-up in short-term business credit

demands, but these demands remain relatively light. However, there is a

very large inventory of U.S. Government securities in dealer hands that

has not yet been distributed to ultimate holders. Dealers hold $9 bil-

lion in U.S. Government and Federal agency issues, including $1-1/4 billion

of the new 10- and 25-year Treasury issues.



(13) Alternative C involves a tighter monetary policy over the

next few weeks and assumes that the Federal funds rate rises to the mid-

point of a 5-1/4 to 6-1/4 per cent range. Such an increase would be likely

to spark substantial efforts by Government dealers to unload their posi-

tions, and would therefore probably lead to considerable short-run upward

adjustment in yields on Treasury securities. The 3-month bill rate might

rise 40 to 60 basis points to the 5-1/2 to 5-3/4 per cent area, and Trea-

sury note and bond yields could increase 20 to 30 basis points.

(14) While alternative C involves more near-term restraint than

B, the early move toward tightening would work to limit interest rate

increases needed over the longer run to maintain M1 growth over the QII

'76-QII '77 period at around 5-3/4 per cent. The staff believes that the

funds rate could peak out at around 6-3/4 per cent during the fall under

an alternative C approach. At such a rate level, it appears that an

upward adjustment in Regulation Q may not be needed to enable the Com-

mittee to attain its longer-run M2 and M3 objectives.

(15) Alternative A assumes an easing of money market conditions

between now and the next meeting--with the funds rate dropping to the mid-

point of a 4-1/4 to 5-1/4 per cent range. Given the outlook for GNP, such

a near-term easing would probably need to be reversed shortly in order to

attain a 5-3/4 per cent growth in M1 from QII '76 to QII '77. If the

reversal were begun in early fall, the funds rate might peak out at around

7-1/2 per cent by the second quarter of 1977, a somewhat higher rate than



under alternative B. An upward adjustment in Regulation Q ceiling rates

might be required somewhat earlier than under B, perhaps in the winter of

next year.

(16) Market reactions to an easing of money market conditions

over the next few weeks are difficult to evaluate. Downward yield adjust-

ments may be limited by expectations that such an easing is likely to be

reversed soon. On the other hand, if economic news also continues to be

suggestive of a pause in activity, an easing of the money market could be

accompanied by fairly substantial rate declines in short- and long-term

markets. The 3-month bill rate, for example, might well return to around

4-3/4 per cent, its earlier low for the year. At such a rate, savings

inflows to banks and thrift institutions would probably become even larger.

This would exert pressure on these institutions to seek higher yielding

longer-term investments, and thus would place downward pressure on bond

yields and also on mortgage rates. However, some institutions--fearful

of being locked into longer-term securities should there be a reversal of

interest rates and a strengthening of credit demands--might elect to reduce

time and savings deposit rates, or at least to cut back their advertising

for deposits.

Proposed directive

(17) Given below is a proposed operational paragraph for the

directive if the Committee wishes to continue formulating its instructions

in terms of desired growth in monetary aggregates over the months ahead.

No alternatives are presented for this formulation, in the expectation that

the reference to desired growth will be taken to apply to the Longer-term

targets and that at this meeting the Committee will not consider those

targets.

"Monetary Aggregates" Proposal

To implement this policy, while taking account of develop-

ments in domestic and international financial markets, the Committee

seeks to achieve bank reserve and money market conditions consistent

with moderate growth in monetary aggregates over the period ahead.

(18) Should the Committee desire to place main emphasis on bank

reserve and money market conditions, the language needed would depend on

the specific conditions sought. Three alternative "money market" direc-

tives intended to correspond to the similarly lettered policy alternatives

are given below.

Alternative "Money Market" Proposals

Alternative A

To implement this policy, while taking account of develop-

ments in domestic and international financial markets, the Committee

seeks to achieve SOMEWHAT EASIER bank reserve and money market condi-

tions [DEL: consistent with moderate growth in monetary aggregates] over the



period IMMEDIATELY ahead, PROVIDED THAT MONETARY AGGREGATES APPEAR

TO BE GROWING AT ABOUT THE RATES CURRENTLY EXPECTED.

Alternative B

To implement this policy, while taking account of develop-

ments in domestic and international financial markets, the Committee

seeks to [DEL: achieve] MAINTAIN PREVAILING bank reserve and money market

conditions [DEL: consistent with moderate growth in monetary aggregates]

over the period IMMEDIATELY ahead, PROVIDED THAT MONETARY AGGREGATES

APPEAR TO BE GROWING AT ABOUT THE RATES CURRENTLY EXPECTED.

Alternative C

To implement this policy, while taking account of develop-

ments in domestic and international financial markets, the Committee

seeks to achieve SOMEWHAT FIRMER bank reserve and money market condi-

tions [DEL: consistent with moderate growth in monetary aggregates] over the

period IMMEDIATELY ahead, PROVIDED THAT MONETARY AGGREGATES APPEAR TO

BE GROWING AT ABOUT THE RATES CURRENTLY EXPECTED.



Appendix A

Comparison of Actual and Targeted Reserves

The table below compares the actual average level of reserves

for the four-week period ending August 18 with the "targeted" level

that had been thought consistent with the mid-points of the short-run

ranges for the monetary aggregates adopted at the last FOMC meeting.

Actual1/ Targeted Differences

1. (2+3) Nonborrowed reserves 34,371 34,326 45

2. Required reserves 34,335 34,360 -25

3. (4-5) Free reserves 36 -35 71

4. Excess reserves 164 163 1

5. Member bank borrowing 128 198 -70

6. (1+5) Total reserves 34,499 34,523 -24

7. Currency 80,952 80,989 -37

8. (6+7) Monetary base 115,451 115,512 -61

As can be seen from the table, actual nonborrowed reserves

turned out to be within $50 million of the "targeted" level. Banks

held somewhat more free reserves than the staff had expected, almost

entirely reflecting a lower level of borrowing than anticipated. On

the other hand, actual required reserves were a little below expecta-

tions. This occurred because of more weakness than anticipated in the

outstanding volume of banks' money market CD's.

1/ Includes week of August 18, which is partly estimated.



A- 2

Total reserves were only slightly weaker than anticipated, but

the monetary base was further below "target" because growth in currency

was much smaller than expected.

**Monthly averages for excess reserves and borrowings are weighted averages of statement week figures.

NOTE: Government security dealer trading positions are on a commitment basis. Trading positions, which exclude Treasury securities financed by repurchase
agreements maturing in 16 days or more, are indicators of dealer holdings available for sale over the near-term. Underwriting syndicate positions consist
of issues still in syndicate, excluding trading positions. The basic reserve deficit is excess reserves less borrowing at Federal Reserve less net Federal
funds purchases. Weekly data are daily averages for statement weeks, except for corporate and municipal issues in syndicate which are Friday figures.
