Prefatory Note 
 
 
The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version available 
based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the Board 
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was created 
through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned 
versions text-searchable.2   Though a stringent quality assurance process was 
employed, some imperfections may remain. 
 
Please note that some material may have been redacted from this document if that 
material was received on a confidential basis.  Redacted material is indicated by

1  In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic 
format.  All scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced 
tilting) and lightly cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other 
blemishes caused after initial printing). 
 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optical character recognition computer program (OCR) 
first created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, 
staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.  Please note that the numbers and text in charts and 
tables were not reliably recognized by the OCR process and were not checked or corrected by staff.

Recent developments

(1) M1 grew at a 4½ per cent annual rate in August, and data

suggest some pick up in September. For the August-September period, M1

is now projected to grow at an annual rate of 5.7 per cent, about the

mid-point of its range of tolerance. Growth of consumer-type time deposits

also slowed in August, and M2 is projected during the August-September period

at a 7 per cent annual rate, somewhat below the lower end of its target of

tolerance.

1/ These figures do not incorporate the regular quarterly benchmark
revision of monetary aggregates that will be published this coming
Thursday. The revisions (based on the April call report) lowered the
rate of growth for M1 in the first half of 1975 from 5 to 4.1 per cent.
The level of M was reduced by $1.3 billion in April and by $1.2 billion
on average in the second quarter. All tables on subsequent pages of this
report (with the exception of table 1 and 2 following the charts) are based
on the new series. The new and old series are compared in Appendix table IV.

(2) Business loans at banks remained about unchanged in August,

following a small July advance, but the volume of commercial and finance company

paper outstanding rose $600 million, as the wide differential between the bank

prime and commercial paper rates continued to make the paper market relatively

attractive. Banks allowed CD's to run off for the seventh straight month,

and the bank credit proxy declined.

(3) Following the August FOMC meeting, the Desk continued to

provide reserves consistent with the Federal funds rate remaining in a range

of 6-1/8 to 6-1/4 per cent. On the basis of data for the aggregates that

became available after Labor Day, the staff reduced its projection of M1

growth for August-September to the lower part of the Committee's range of

tolerance and its projection of M2 growth below the bottom of the range. In

view of the expectation of a substantial strengthening in demands for money

and credit over coming months, and the likelihood that a decline in the

Federal funds rate may have to be reversed shortly, the Committee concurred

on September 5 in the Chairman's recommendation to instruct the Desk to

continue aiming at a Federal funds rate in a 6-1/8 to 6-1/4 per cent area,

leaning toward the lower figure. In the most recent statement week, the

funds rate averaged 6.15 per cent.

(4) Treasury bill rates have changed little on balance since the

August meeting, even though the Treasury continued to add significantly to

the supply of bills. The 3-month bill was most recently trading around

6.45 per cent. Private short-term rates, on the other hand, increased

10-15 basis points, as the demand for funds in the commercial paper market rose.



-3-

(5) Over most of the intermeeting period, yields on Treasury coupon

issues edged lower, and corporate bond yields remained about unchanged, re-

flecting the stability of short-term rates, System purchases of coupon issues

in late August, and a lull in the volume of new offerings in both sectors.

Municipal yields rose to record levels during the intermeeting period as

the financial problems facing New York City continued to cast a pall.

However, on September 9, the New York State legislature adopted a financial

plan that would avoid a near-term default on the City's outstanding securities

and cover the City's cash needs through mid-December. In response, the market

atmosphere improved and prices of MAC issues strengthened. Following the

Treasury's September 10 announcement of its sizable cash requirements over the

remainder of 1975, however, yields in all bond markets adjusted upward.

Throughout the intermeeting period, mortgage rates advanced as demands for

mortgage funds expanded and lenders became more uncertain as to the cost and

availability of savings funds.

(6) The Treasury indicated that it would be raising about $44 to

$47 billion in the second half of 1975, which is about $3-$6 billion more than

previously announced. Allowing for the funds already raised since mid-year,

the remaining cash need to be covered between now and year-end appears to be

in the $23-$26 billion range. A substantial amount of this will be auctioned

between now and the next Committee meeting. The Treasury will raise $1 billion

of new cash in the monthly 2-year note auction on September 16, and will offer

$2 billion of 29-month notes on September 24. It is also likely that another

$5 billion will be auctioned in the note market near the time of the next

Committee meeting on October 21. Meanwhile, the Treasury will also be

adding to weekly and monthly bill auctions, though in the case of the weekly

auctions by somewhat lesser amounts than in recent months.

Prospective developments

(8) Summarized below for Committee consideration are specifi-

cations for three alternative short-run policy courses. More detailed

figures--including longer-run growth rates--are presented in the

tables on pp. 6a and 6b.

(9) Following relatively slow growth in the July-August period,

in September and October M1 is expected to expand at rates more nearly

consistent with the underlying strength of transactions demands. Deposit

expansion in the previous months had been dampened as the public brought

deposit holdings into a more normal relationship with income and interest

rates, following the sharp bulge in late spring resulting from special

Treasury payments. This process now appears to have been completed.

Under alternative A --which assumes the same Federal funds rate range

for the forthcoming intermeeting period as that adopted at the last

meeting--M1 is expected to rise at an annual rate in the 6½-3½ per cent

area over this and the next month on average. M2 growth is also likely

to accelerate, mainly reflecting the more rapid expansion on demand deposits.

However, growth in consumer-type time and savings deposits also is

expected to strengthen a little, at least temporarily, from its reduced

August rate.

(10) If Federal funds over the next few weeks were to continue

trading in the recent 6-1/8--6¾ per cent range, market interest rates

generally would be likely to show little further net change. Interest

rates on Treasury securities--particularly bills and short-intermediate

issues--have been adjusting upward recently in response to the cash need

and financing package announced by the Treasury on Wednesday. Some

further yield increases could occur, though, as the new securities are

auctioned, with about $8 billion of new cash to be raised through auctions

of coupon issues between now and around the time of the next meeting.

(11) Business borrowing in the corporate bond market over the

weeks ahead is likely to be at a slower rate than in the first half of

this year, though picking up from the reduced August pace and still

quite sizable by historical standards. The prospective volume of state

and local government issues remains relatively large. The municipal market

could be stabilized, for a time, by the assistance package for New York

City enacted by the New York State legislature. It is possible that the

period of calm may last into the fall, but there are still substantial

uncertainties in the market, typified by the slow reception initially

accorded the recent offering of generously priced short-term New York

State issues.

(12) Given the large amount of Treasury borrowing that is

being compressed into the next month or so, as well as the still sensitive



-8-

state of the municipal market, a significant rise in the Federal funds

rate--for example, toward the upper end of the 5-3/4--7 per cent range

of alternative A--would likely lead to substantial further yield advances.

Interest rate increases would be accentuated if strengthening credit

demands on banks from businesses and consumers were at the same time

reducing bank willingness to add to Treasury security holdings.

(13) While alternative A basically assumes little or no change

in the Federal funds rate between now and the next meeting, the staff

believes the funds rate would have to rise later in the fall if the

monetary aggregates are to remain on track with the Committee's longer-

run objectives. A funds rate in the 7-7 per cent area would be expected

by late fall, assuming a longer-run M1 objective characterized by 7 per

cent growth from QII '75 to QII '76 (the assumption of the Green Book

GNP projection), with further funds rate increases anticipated in the

first half of next year. Attainment of a longer-run 6 per cent annual

rate of growth in M1 would be likely to require more prompt and intensive

pressure on the funds market. In view of the further interest rate increases

expected given either of these two M1 growth rates,we have assumed, in

working out all of the alternatives in this bluebook, a small upward

adjustment in Regulation Q ceilings around year-end of ¼ to ½ percentage

point on time certificates. With this assumption, longer-run M2 growth

is projected toward the low end of the Committee's announced target

range under alternative A.



-9-

(14) Alternative C encompasses an immediate substantial tightening

of the money market and is characterized by a Federal funds rate range

for the intermeeting period of 6 -8 per cent, centering on 7¼ per cent.

With growth in nonborrowed reserves more constrained, member bank borrowing

under this alternative would be likely to rise to $400 million or more,

given the 6 per cent discount rate. Nonetheless, growth of M1 in

September-October would probably be reduced somewhat, to the 6-8 per cent

area. Interest rates generally would rise quite sharply during the next

month under this alternative, particularly given the very large Treasury

financing demands described in paragraph (6). A rise in the 3-month bill

rate to [8] per cent or a little above would not be unlikely, and the yield

on 2-year Treasury notes could exceed 9 per cent.

(15) Such rate levels would undoubtedly divert savings flows

away from banks and thrift institutions. The staff would expect the

annual rate of growth in consumer-type time deposits at banks and deposits

at thrift institutions to drop to around a 7-8 per cent rate in October.

Pressures on such flows would be intensified later in the fall and early

next year, when further increases in the Federal funds rate would be

expected.

(16) Under alternative C mortgage market conditions may be

expected to tighten rather promptly, with rates rising further over the

next few weeks and with lenders becoming less willing to make loan

commitments. Under alternative A, and to a certain extent under

alternative B (to be discussed below), strains on the mortgage

market would be more delayed and less severe. The assumed adjustment

in Regulation Q ceilings would temper the impact of upward market rate

adjustments on savings inflows to thrift institutions after year-end,

but the mortgage market would still be expected to come under additional

pressure next year.



-10-

(17) Alternative B contemplates a modest tightening of money

market conditions between now and the next Committee meeting, as

indicated by the 6-3/4 per cent mid-point of a 6-7 per cent Federal

funds rate range. As in the other alternatives, additional tightening

would appear to be necessary later this year and early next year. The

staff has assumed that the Federal funds rate under this alternative

would probably rise to the 7 -8 per cent area by late fall. This

particular funds rate pattern would be consistent with a one-year growth

rate for M1 between QII '75 and QII '76 of 6-3/4 per cent. Given the

downward revision of $1.2 billion in the average level of M1 in the

second quarter of 1975, such a growth rate would result in the same

average level of M1 in the second quarter of 1976 as was implied by the

6 per cent growth path presented in the previous bluebook.



-11-

Proposed directive

(18) Given below is a proposed operational paragraph if the

Committee wishes to continue formulating its instructions in terms of

desired growth in monetary aggregates over the months ahead. No

alternatives are presented for this formulation, in the expectations that

the reference to desired growth will be taken to apply to the longer-term

targets and that the Committee will not be reconsidering its present 5 to

7 per cent target range--with which all of the short-run operating

alternatives discussed in the preceding sections are consistent--until

the October meeting.

"Monetary aggregates" proposal

To implement this policy, while taking account of developments

in domestic and international financial markets, the Committee seeks

to achieve bank reserve and money market conditions consistent with

moderate growth in monetary aggregates over the months ahead.

(19) Should the Committee desire to formulate the directive

in terms of bank reserve and money market conditions, the language needed

would depend on the specific conditions sought. These alternative

"money market" directives intended to correspond to the similarly lettered

policy alternatives are given below.
