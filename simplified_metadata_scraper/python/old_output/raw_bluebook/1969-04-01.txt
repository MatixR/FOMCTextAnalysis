MONEY MARKET AND RESERVE RELATIONSHIPS

Recent Developments

(1) Since the last meeting of the Committee the cumulating

impact of monetary restraint has been reflected in further increases in

long-term interest rates, another rise in the prime loan rate, and a

contraction in major deposit and reserve aggregates. At the same time,

there has been little further upward movement in yields on intermediate-

term securities, while Treasury bill yields have declined substantially.

In the bill market, the combined pressure of seasonal bill demands,

supply scarcities, and the absence of an overt monetary policy move that

many in the market had expected brought the 3-month bill rate to below

6 per cent following the mid-month corporate tax payment period. Most

recently the 3-month bill yield was quoted 5.99 per cent bid, about 16

basis points below its level at the time of the March 4 meeting.

(2) In recent weeks, conditions in the Federal funds market

have tended to be slightly firmer than in the four weeks preceding the

March 4 Committee meeting, with the effective rate averaging around

6-3/4 per cent. In the four weeks ending March 26, net borrowed reserves

have been deepening in a $550 - $750 million range, averaging close to

$675 million, compared with $600 million for the previous four weeks.

Member bank borrowings have fluctuated in about a $750 million to $950

million range, averaging almost $840 million, about the same as in

February.



-2-

(3) Estimates of the rate of change in the bank credit

proxy for March, adjusted to include banks' borrowing of Euro-dollars

through their foreign branches, have fluctuated around the lower end

of the average annual rate of decline of 3 - 6 per cent projected in

the last blue book. The proxy is currently estimated to show a

decline of about 6-1/2 per cent annual rate on average for the month.

Not only has the proxy declined a little more than projected, but the

components of the adjusted proxy have moved rather differently from

earlier anticipations. The decline in deposits was greater, partly

offset by larger Euro-dollar borrowings. Within the deposit category,

time deposits have shown more strength than earlier projected, but

contrary to projections, there was no net growth in private demand

deposits even though U.S. Government deposits declined substantially,

on average.

(4) The money supply is now estimated to show only about a

2 per cent annual rate of rise on average from February to March,

reflecting growth in currency about in line with other recent months.

Business loan expansion in March was considerably weaker than the staff

anticipated, and corporations appear to have utilized cash balances

more intensively to help finance their tax payments. Private demand

deposits were also absorbed by very rapid bank sales of the $1 billion

bill strip issued in early March.

(5) The average level of outstanding time and savings

deposits showed little change from February to March, in contrast to



-3-

sizable contractions in the previous two months. Net inflows of

consumer-type time and savings deposits in March were stronger than

anticipated. Outstanding negotiable CD's, however, continued to

decline roughly in line with projections, with attrition in March

estimated at about $1-1/4 billion. The decline in such CD's since

early December totals about $5-1/2 billion.

Prospective developments

(7) The projected relationships among marginal reserve

measures, day-to-day money market rates, bill rates, and bank reserve

and credit flows for April have to take account of several special

factors: potential withdrawals by individuals from time and savings

deposits after the end-of-March interest crediting; potential mid-April

tax period pressures; and possible downward bill rate movements particu-

larly after the tax period and as further bill redemptions by the

Treasury take place. While uncertainties as to possible outcomes are

great, there are fairly good odds that, under current monetary policy,

bill rates will average lower for April as a whole relative to the

Federal funds rate than in recent months, and that bank credit growth

might resume, though at a slow pace.

(8) Continuation of prevailing conditions in day-to-day money

markets would imply a Federal funds rate around the 6-3/4 per cent

average of the past few weeks, and new loan rates to dealers at New York

banks at 7 per cent or above. Member bank borrowings may be in a $750

million - $1 billion range, and net borrowed reserves in a $550 - $800

million range. Mid-April tax period pressures may entail strong demands

for Federal funds as banks attempt to finance necessitous short-term

borrowing by business customers; sales finance companies and Government

security dealers are also likely to have increased borrowing needs

around this time. However, demands on the funds market might be less

intense in the latter part of April, and it might prove necessary for



-5-

the System to maintain upward pressure on the Federal funds rate to

keep bill rates from dropping so sharply as to change market assessment

of the stance of monetary policy.

(9) Given the above marginal reserve and day-to-day money

rate specifications, the 3-month Treasury bill may fluctuate in a 5.80 -

6.15 per cent range. Over the near-term, given the recent build-up

in dealer positions in short-term bills, upward bill rate pressures may

be generated by reversal of quarterly bank statement date and Cook

County tax period window dressing and by mid-April tax period financing

needs. The upward pressures might not carry rates very far, however,

if market participants begin to focus more sharply on prospects for

a diminished supply of bills later in April and over the next two months

as the budgetary surplus permits repayment of a substantial amount of

Treasury debt. In the latter part of April, downward pressures on bill

rates could drop the yield on the 3-month bill toward, or below, the

bottom of the indicated range, partly as a result of reinvestment demand

from maturing April tax bills not used to pay taxes. On April 30 Treasury

will probably announce the terms of the mid-May refunding, which might

also generate prospects of some additional demands for bills. If the

bill rate nears the bottom end of the range, and particularly if it drops

below, downward pressures might cumulate as the market comes to expect

a less restrictive monetary policy.

(10) Assuming that the 3-month bill does not drop below the

bottom end of the range--and averages a little below 6 per cent for



-6-

April as a whole--outstanding CD's at banks may be expected to decline

by $600 - $800 million. This would be a considerably smaller decline

than in previous months, particularly since a reduction of around

$300 million would be expected for seasonal reasons.

(11) With CD attrition projected to slow, it is likely that

total time and savings deposits of banks may show little net change on

average in April, as in March, compared with about a 10 per cent annual

rate of decline over the first two months of the year. New inflows

of consumer-type time and savings deposits in April are expected to be

at a slower rate than in recent weeks. Individuals are likely to make

larger than seasonal withdrawals following the interest-crediting period

to invest in market instruments, and many savers are likely to draw on

their balances to finance sizable retroactive tax payments.

However, the staff does not expect withdrawals for interest rate reasons

at banks (or thrift institutions) to be significantly worse than in

January; long-term market rates are higher than around year-end, but

Treasury bill rates are lower than around year-end.

(12) Private demand deposits at banks in April are expected to

show little net change on average, despite a considerable rise in U.S.



-7-

Government deposits in consequence of payment of the recent $1.8 billion

bill strip on the last day of March and of heavy tax inflows in April.

A rebound in credit demands on banks in April, partly to finance these

tax payments, is expected to sustain private demand deposits.

(13) Given these deposit flows, the bank credit proxy may

increase in a 1 - 4 per cent annual rate range in April. Demands for

Euro-dollars are expected to continue strong, though perhaps moderating

a shade as domestic deposits become somewhat more readily available than

in March. The adjusted bank credit proxy (including Euro-dollars) might

therefore rise in a 2 - 6 per cent annual rate range.

(14) Over all, long-term interest rates are likely to edge

upward, assuming expectations as to peace do not become more favorable

or that recent declines in short-term rates do not cumulate. Mortgage

borrowing demands are expected to continue relatively strong, and the

volume of corporate bond offerings may pick up. And with respect to

State and local governments, banks are still likely to be only marginal

net buyers at best.



Policy alternative

(15) The Committee may wish to consider a more restrictive

complex of money market targets, particularly if firming action involv-

ing other monetary policy instruments is taken. An increase in the

discount rate to 6 per cent probably would be taken as a clear signal

of a move to reinforce monetary restraint, while a smaller rise would

have obvious elements of ambiguity in current market circumstances.

A rise to 6 per cent may tend to raise the whole interest rate structure

somewhat, although it would appear that prevailing market interest rates

have to some extent already discounted some such action. The 3-month

bill rate may move up into a 6-6.30 per cent range. If the discount

rate were raised shortly after the FOMC meeting, the combination of

such an increase, the recent build-up in dealer bill positions, and

expected April tax period pressures might press bill rates quickly

toward the upper end of the range. But such rate pressures should

moderate in the latter part of April, for reasons noted earlier.

Discount rate action in the latter part of April could, therefore,

serve principally to offset downward yield pressures likely to develop

at that time rather than to boost the rate structure to new higher levels.

(16) Assuming banks continue relatively reluctant to borrow

from the window, a higher discount rate is likely to be associated with

some increase in propensities to sell bills, to borrow Euro-dollars,

and to borrow in the Federal funds market. Given this behavior pattern,

a set of money market targets for open market operations consistent with



maintaining the developing taut credit market conditions (as compared

with such conditions absent a discount rate increase) would include a

Federal funds rate around 7 per cent or slightly above, member bank

borrowings centering around $1 billion, and net borrowed reserves in a

$650-$900 million range.

(17) Under these conditions, and given existing Regulation Q

ceilings, total member bank deposits (without adjustment for Euro-dollars)

in April might change in a wide -2 to +2 per cent, annual rate, range,

with the actual development depending in part on the timing of a dis-

count rate action (and thus how soon time deposit performance is

affected) and on whether a discount rate hike were to be combined with

other actions. The increased demands for Euro-dollars would be likely

to be reflected both in higher interest rates in that market and in

somewhat more inflow. An enlarged inflow might keep the rate of change

in the adjusted bank credit proxy a little above zero.

(18) Consumer-type time deposits might be marginally affected

by higher market rates associated with a discount rate hike and tighter

open market operations, but more importantly banks' ability to slow their

CD attrition is likely to be curtailed. A CD run-off continuing at a

rate around $1 billion a month may be expected.

(19) Upward interest rate pressures in long-term markets are

likely to be extended. Banks may become more convinced that a capital

loss year is in prospect, and thus become more active sellers of longer-

term securities. And the corporate bond market calendar, which has



-10–

been relatively moderate in recent months, might expand as corporations

move rapidly to establish claims on financial resources; they might also

begin taking down commitments from banks in anticipation of reduced

credit availability and perhaps another prime loan rate rise. The dura-

tion and strength of rises in long-term interest rates will probably

depend on how successful the policy moves are in breaking inflationary

psychology.

(20) The announcement of an increase in reserve requirements--

say a 1/2 point increase on either demand or time deposits--in conjunction

with a discount rate rise would likely have, among other things, a more

pronounced effect on expectations. Interest rates would probably

rise somewhat more, although the odds on the 3-month bill rate moving

above the upper end of the range in paragraph (15) are small, given the

Federal funds rate specified in paragraph (16). Bill market pressures

would be modified by the view that a reserve requirement increase would

entail less bill sales (or more bill buying) through the open market

account. Moreover, it is likely that marginal portfolio adjustments of

banks to a reserve requirement increase will fall on longer-term

securities to a considerable extent since bank liquidity is already sub-

stantially reduced. The impact of monetary restraint would become more

widespread as smaller banks would become less willing holders of State

and local and U.S. Government securities, and a larger number of banks

are under greater pressure to tighten lending policy. Bank credit may



-11-

be weaker in April than indicated in paragraph (17), and there may

possibly be more of a lingering downward effect on the averages for

the succeeding months.
