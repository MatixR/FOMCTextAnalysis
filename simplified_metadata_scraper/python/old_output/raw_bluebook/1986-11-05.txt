Prefatory Note 

 
 

The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain. 
 

Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a redaction process that removed information obtained on a 
confidential basis.  All redacted passages are exempt from disclosure under applicable 
provisions of the Freedom of Information Act.    

 

                                                 
1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked 
and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not 
reliably recognized by the OCR process and were not checked or corrected by staff.

MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Recent Developments

(1) M2 and M3 increased at annual rates of 8-3/4 and 7-1/2 percent

respectively on average over September and October, well below their rates of

growth through the spring and summer. Both aggregates were within the Commit-

tee's 7 to 9 percent range for the August-December period, and in October were

very close to the upper ends of their 6 to 9 percent annual growth cones. M1

growth, while still quite strong at a 12-1/2 percent rate over September and

October, was down substantially from its average over the previous several

months .

(2) The slowing in M2 growth reflected in part weakness in its

overnight RP component relative to previous months, when if had been boosted

to finance unusually sizable acquisitions of government securities; variations

in this component largely accounted for the more marked slowing in M2 growth

in September and moderate rebound in October. Expansion in the sum of the

other components of M2 also decelerated somewhat over the September-October

period. Shifts from time deposits into the more liquid interest-bearing re-

tail components of M2 persisted in September and appear to have intensified

in October. Offering rates on time deposits have adjusted relatively promptly

to earlier declines in market rates, while rates on NOW and savings accounts

have continued to adjust only sluggishly. Inflows to OCDs have remained very

strong, and most of the slowing of M1 growth on average over the two months

was accounted for by a sharp deceleration of its demand deposit component.

NOTE: Monthly reserve measures, including excess reserves and borrowing, are cal-
culated by prorating averages for 2-week reserve maintenance periods that overlap
months. Data incorporate adjustments for discontinuities associated with implemen-
tation of the Monetary Control Act and other regulatory changes to reserve require-
ments.



However, demand deposit growth strengthened a bit over October, contributing

to a rebound in M1 growth from around 10 percent in September to 15 percent

in October. Large CDs ran off over the two months; the decline has been

especially pronounced in October, when bank credit growth slowed abruptly,

leading to a further moderation in M3 growth estimated for this month.

(3) The debt of domestic nonfinancial sectors rose in September

at about a 12 percent rate, close to its pace for the first three quarters of

the year, but has shown signs of slowing in October. Growth in September was

buoyed by the temporary surge in automobile financing. Mortgage lending evi-

dently has continued brisk over the two months in association with a robust

pace of activity in the single family home market. In October, in addition

to the slowing in consumer credit, federal government borrowing was constrained

by the debt ceiling. Business borrowing was subdued in September, but appears

to have picked up somewhat in October with a rebound in both bond offerings

and short-term borrowing. Borrowing in tax-exempt markets dropped sharply

following the September 1 effective date under the tax bill for restrictions

on public-purpose borrowing; however, private-purpose borrowing has picked up

in October following clarification of limits on issuance under the new law.

(4) Growth of nonborrowed and total reserves moderated somewhat

in September and October, reflecting the slower expansion of transactions

accounts. Reserve paths were constructed throughout the intermeeting period

assuming $300 million of adjustment plus seasonal borrowing. Borrowing

averaged $324 million in the two complete maintenance periods since the last

FOMC meeting; through the first eight days of the current period it has aver-

aged $180 million. With excess reserves in recent months running consis-

tently below levels of earlier this year, the path allowance was reduced to

$850 million.



(5) Federal funds generally have continued to trade around 5-7/8

percent over the intermeeting period. Other interest rates have eased off

somewhat on balance, with most short-term rates down about 5 to 20 basis

points and bond yields as much as 30 basis points lower. Stock prices have

firmed somewhat, retracing a portion of the declines of early September.

Perceptions of stronger foreign demands for dollar assets-prompted in part

by expectations of a cut in the Japanese discount rate, which was announced

Friday-have contributed to recent increase in bond and stock prices. The

Japanese action also was seen as giving the Federal Reserve more scope for an

easing of policy domestically, although levels of short-term rates do not

suggest widespread expectations of such a move in the near term.

(6) The dollar rose about 1-1/2 percent on balance on a weighted

average basis over the intermeeting period. In the first part of the period

the dollar had continued to move lower, particularly against the German mark

as it became clear that the Bundesbank would not act to lower interest rates

and as economic activity in Germany appeared robust. Late in October, how-

ever, the dollar firmed substantially, first on reports of large shifts of

funds by Japanese institutional investors out of yen and into dollar denomin-

ated assets, and later with the release of September U.S. trade figures, which

were much better than market expectations, and the cut in the Japanese dis-

count rate.



Policy alternatives

(7) The table below presents three alternative specifications

for growth of the monetary aggregates together with associated federal

funds rate ranges. Growth rates are shown from the August base chosen

at the last meeting. More detailed data, including implied growth for

each alternative from September to December and from last year's fourth-

quarter base to the fourth quarter of this year, are shown on the table

and charts on the following pages.

(8) With growth in the aggregates over September and October

at rates close to those contemplated at the last FOMC meeting, M2 and M3

would be expected to remain within the Committee's current 7 to 9 percent

range for the August to December period and very close to the upper ends

of their 1986 ranges under the reserve conditions assumed for each of the

three alternatives. Growth in M1, while remaining below the pace in the

spring and summer under all the alternatives, would be expected to expand

at around a 14 percent rate for the year. However, differences in reserve

conditions under the three alternatives would affect the trajectories of

the aggregates entering 1987.

the discount window around $300 million. Federal funds are likely to re-

main near 5-7/8 percent and the Treasury bill rate in the vicinity of 5-1/4

percent. Bond yields also would be expected to fluctuate around current

levels. These rates might be especially sensitive to changing perceptions

of foreign demands for U.S. securities and accompanying movements in the

dollar on foreign exchange markets through the upcoming period of auction

and distribution of the Treasury's mid-quarter refunding issues. And

credit market participants are likely to be watching developments in the

oil market particularly closely, given the uncertainty about future price

movements. Mortgage rates might continue to edge down relative to Treasury

bond yields as concerns about accelerated repayments ebb further in a

relatively stable interest rate environment. The dollar is expected to

drift lower, retracing its recent gains, in light of the continuing large

U.S. current account deficit.

(10) M2, under alternative B, is expected to expand at an 8 per-

cent rate over November and December, a little below the average pace of

September and October and appreciably slower than over the summer months.

This growth would leave M2 right at the upper end of its 6 to 9 percent long-

run range. M2 growth over the remainder of the year should be restrained by

diminishing effects of earlier declines in market rates, and perhaps even

some increase in opportunity costs as depository institutions lower offering

rates on liquid retail deposits. The prospects for a substantial slowing

of retail deposit growth, however, are limited by a continued reluctance on

the part of many depositories to breach the former regulatory ceilings of

5-1/2 percent on savings accounts and 5-1/4 percent on ordinary NOW accounts.

M2 growth in the fourth quarter would continue to exceed the expansion of

income, although by a little smaller margin than in the third quarter. The



specifications of alternative B imply a 5 percent rate of decrease in M2

velocity in the fourth quarter, given the staff GNP forecast, bringing the

drop in velocity for the year to an historically large 4 percent.

(11) Growth of M3 under alternative B also would be expected to

slow slightly further over November and December, coming in a little below

the 9 percent upper limit of its long-term range. Issuance of managed

liabilities over the balance of the year is expected to be modest as the

Treasury rebuilds its cash balance at banks and as bank acquisitions of

securities remain below the unusually rapid pace over the summer months.

The use of purchased funds by thrifts may remain light if these institutions

continue to sell a large portion of their substantial mortgage originations

in the market. On a quarterly-average basis, M3 growth for the fourth

quarter would be about 7-1/2 percent at an annual rate, considerably below

that of the previous two quarters. The implied decline in M3 velocity

would be at a 3-1/2 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter and nearly 4

percent over the year as a whole, the largest annual drop since 1982.

(12) M1, under alternative B, would be anticipated to expand in

November and December at about the reduced average September-October pace-

as a rebound in demand deposit growth would offset some moderation in in-

flows to OCDs. Opportunity costs of holding OCD balances would likely widen

a little more as offering rates on NOW accounts continue to edge lower in

adjustment to earlier rate declines. M1 growth on a quarterly-average

basis would be at a 14 percent rate in the fourth quarter, implying a 10

percent rate of decline in its velocity. For the year, M1 velocity would

register an 8-1/2 percent drop, the steepest annual decline in the postwar

period.



-9-

(13) Debt of domestic nonfinancial sectors is likely to grow

briskly over the final months of this year, bringing growth for the year

on a QIV to QIV basis to 12-1/2 percent. Federal borrowing is being boosted

somewhat as the Treasury rebuilds its cash balance following removal of debt

ceiling constraints, while the underlying deficit remains large. Issuance of

tax-exempt bonds is likely to strengthen further in the last two months of

this year owing to efforts to utilize new annual volume caps for private-

purpose issues, including corporate IDBs. Nonfinancial businesses are also

expected to step up their borrowing to finance merger and related activities

in advance of less favorable tax treatment in 1987. Household borrowing,

however, is likely to moderate somewhat from the pace of earlier months as

automobile financing weakens in the wake of the expiration of incentive

programs; mortgage borrowing is likely to be sustained near the relatively

heavy pace of the summer and early fall.

(14) Alternative A assumes either a reduction in discount window

borrowing to a near-frictional level of $150 million or a cut in the discount

rate of one-half percentage point with borrowing maintained at $300 million.

In either event, the funds rate would move down to the 5-1/4 to 5-1/2 percent

area. Other short-term rates would also decline, with the three-month bill

rate dropping somewhat below 5 percent. The response of bond yields would

depend on indicators of the outlook for economic activity and prices.

Initially, bond yields might respond little to easier money market condi-

tions, but declines in short-term yields could reinforce tendencies for

longer-term yields to move lower if economic indicators pointed to a slug-

gish economy and little likelihood of greater underlying price pressures.

The dollar might weaken appreciably under this alternative, absent any

further easing actions abroad.



-10-

(15) Growth in M2 and M3 under this alternative would not be

expected to slow any further over November and December. The more liquid

M2 components would continue to be bolstered by very narrow opportunity

costs, pulling funds from small time deposits and from the open market.

This effect might be muted if the further decline in market rates tended

to break the resistance of banks and thrifts to lowering rates on savings

and NOW accounts-a development that might be considered more likely in

the event the easier money market conditions were triggered by a cut in

the discount rate to 5 percent, below the previous regulatory ceilings on

these accounts. Under this alternative, M2 would enter 1987 above the

8-1/2 percent upper end of its tentative growth cone but within its corres-

ponding parallel bands. Bank funding needs, and thus M3, might be enlarged

by more business lending in a response to lower short-term rates, especially

if bond yields did not also decline. M3 would enter next year around the

upper end of its tentative range. M1 under this alternative would be

expected to pick up somewhat relative to its growth over September and

October, increasing in line with average growth in 1986.

(16) Alternative C contemplates an increase in discount window

borrowing to $500 million. Federal funds would be expected to trade around

the 6-1/4 to 6-1/2 percent area. The tighter reserve conditions of this

alternative would be expected to restrain growth in M2 and M3, raising the

odds that these aggregates would come within their long-term ranges for

1986 and would enter 1987 within their new growth cones. Higher short-term

interest rates also would act to damp M1 growth, although with opportunity

costs still relatively small this aggregate would continue to expand rapidly,

well in excess of income growth.



-11-

(17) There seems to be little expectation among market partici-

pants of a near-term tightening and thus three-month bills could rise as

much as 50 basis points, to about 5-3/4 percent under this alternative.

Private short-term rates could increase by more than bills to the degree

that firmer conditions were seen as intensifying the debt-servicing diffi-

culties of some borrowers. Bond rates would tend to back up also, although

the degree to which they would rise would depend on any accompanying

reassessment of inflation prospects. The dollar might strengthen, at least

for a while, on foreign exchange markets.



-12-

Directive language

(18) Draft language for the operational paragraph with the

usual alternatives is shown below. The proposed format follows that

adopted at recent meetings in specifying numerical growth rates for M2

and M3 but not for Ml. In addition, the draft retains August as the base

for the monetary growth specifications. (Should the Committee wish to

change the base to September, growth implied under each alternative for the

September-to-December period is shown in the detailed table on page 6.)

The changes suggested for the sentence concerning M1 are intended to clarify

the reference to the timing of the expected moderation in M1 growth. The

sentence on possible intermeeting adjustments keeps the language adopted

at the September meeting with respect to the role of the monetary aggregates

and other factors. It also retains the reference to the possibility of

"slight" adjustments to reserve pressures; the more usual terminology of

"somewhat", as well as alternatives with respect to the use of "might"

and "would" are given in parentheses.

OPERATIONAL PARAGRAPH

In the implementation of policy for the immediate future, the

Committee seeks to DECREASE SOMEWHAT (Alt. A)/maintain (Alt. B)/

INCREASE SOMEWHAT (Alt. C) the existing degree of pressure on reserve

positions. This action is expected to be consistent with growth in

M2 and M3 over the period from August to December at annual rates of

[DEL: 7 to 9] ____ AND ____ percent, RESPECTIVELY. While growth in M1 OVER

THE SAME PERIOD is expected to moderate from the ITS EXCEPTIONAL PACE

[DEL: exepetionally large increase] during the [DEL: past] PREVIOUS several



-13-

months, [DEL: that] growth IN THIS AGGREGATE will continue to be judged

in the light of the behavior of M2 and M3 and other factors.

Slightly (SOMEWHAT) greater reserve restraint would (MIGHT), or

slightly (SOMEWHAT) lesser reserve restraint might (WOULD), be

acceptable depending on the behavior of the aggregates, taking

into account the strength of the business expansion, developments

in foreign exchange markets, progress against inflation, and con-

ditions in domestic and international credit markets. The Chairman

may call for Committee consultation if it appears to the Manager for

Domestic Operations that reserve conditions during the period before

the next meeting are likely to be associated with a federal funds

rate persistently outside a range of ____ TO ____ [DEL: 4 to 8] percent.
