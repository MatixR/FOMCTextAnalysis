MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES 

Recent Developments 

Summary 

(1)  Measures of financial market stress intensified on net over the intermeeting 

period, reflecting heightened concern about the condition of U.S. financial 

institutions.  Late in the period, while news that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac had 

been placed into conservatorship reduced some uncertainty and eased strains in some 

financial markets, concerns about other institutions intensified.  On net, the concerns 

about financial institutions, a less optimistic outlook for economic growth, and a 

substantial fall in oil prices led investors to push back the anticipated onset of 

monetary policy tightening, with policy seen as possibly easing a bit in the near term 

and then remaining on hold well into next year.  Nominal Treasury yields declined, 

consistent with the change in policy expectations and the softer economic outlook, 

and TIPS-based measures of inflation compensation moved lower at all horizons.  

Broad equity price indexes were about unchanged on balance over the intermeeting 

period.  Yields on investment-grade corporate bonds dropped less than those on 

comparable-maturity Treasury securities and those on speculative-grade bonds edged 

up, leaving spreads wider.  Borrowing by nonfinancial business corporations slowed.  

The dollar appreciated against many currencies, reportedly reflecting a more 

pronounced downward revision in investors’ outlook for growth abroad than for 

growth in the U.S. 

Financial Institutions 

(2) Investors continued to focus on major financial institutions and the possible 

implications of strains on these firms for credit availability and the macroeconomic 



outlook.  Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were a particular focus of attention.  After the 

Treasury and the Federal Housing Finance Agency announced the placement of these 

companies into conservatorship, their stock prices dropped sharply (Chart 1).  In 

contrast, spreads on senior and subordinated agency debt narrowed as investors 

became confident that the Treasury would support Fannie’s and Freddie’s obligations, 

and option-adjusted spreads on agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) plunged.  

(See the box “Market Effects of Conservatorship for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.”) 

(3)  At a number of other financial institutions, difficulties continued and even 

intensified.  Equity prices of U.S. investment banks were quite volatile over the 

intermeeting period, moving lower on concerns about writedowns of mortgage-

related assets, and CDS spreads on these entities widened noticeably.  Developments 

at Lehman Brothers attracted considerable attention.  Analysts speculated that the 

firm would take significant additional writedowns of mortgage-related assets in the 

current quarter, and, towards the end of the period, Lehman announced that a 

$3.9 billion loss was likely for the third quarter, that it expected to spin off its 

commercial real estate assets, and that it planned to sell a majority stake in its asset-

management unit.  Lehman’s share price has dropped sharply, as market participants 

awaited news regarding a possible a capital injection or sale of the firm.  

(4) Investors also appeared to be worried about conditions at depository 

institutions.  Although bank stocks rose on the announcement of the conservatorship 

of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac—evidently on the view that the Treasury’s actions 

would bolster mortgage markets and credit markets more broadly—they were down 

modestly on net over the intermeeting period.  Moreover, CDS spreads on 

subordinated debt at bank holding companies widened again, reaching levels not seen 

since March.  Market participants also grew more concerned about regional banks’ 

credit losses, and the already-elevated CDS spreads on these entities rose a bit further.  

Three commercial banks failed over the intermeeting period, bringing the total

Market Effects of Conservatorship for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac 
 
On September 7 the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) placed Fannie Mae and 
Freddie Mac into conservatorship.  In conjunction with this action, the Treasury 
Department established agreements to acquire up to $100 billion of new senior preferred 
stock from each firm.  The Treasury will receive $1 billion of senior preferred stock in each 
GSE initially (without compensation) and will make subsequent purchases as necessary to 
ensure that the GSEs maintain a positive net worth.  The Treasury also obtained warrants to 
purchase new shares of common stock at a “nominal” price, representing up to 79.9 percent 
of the common shares of each firm on a fully-diluted basis.  Dividends on the common and 
existing preferred stock of Fannie and Freddie have been terminated, and holders of 
common and existing preferred stock will absorb any future losses before the Treasury 
sustains losses on senior preferred stock.  In addition, the Treasury created two new 
temporary programs to support housing finance through the end of 2009.  The first new 
program is a secured lending facility under which the Treasury may extend credit to Fannie 
Mae, Freddie Mac, and the Federal Home Loan Banks.  The second consists of direct 
purchases of GSE MBS by the Treasury, at its discretion, based on developments in the 
capital and housing markets. 
 
On the day following the announcement, broad equity price indexes in the United States and 
abroad rallied, with the S&P 500 index rising about 2 percent.  Treasury yields and the 
foreign exchange value of the dollar were little changed.  The government’s actions were 
viewed as positive news for the financial sector, and the S&P 500 bank sub-index rose nearly 
4 percent on the day after the announcement. 

However, prices of common and preferred stock in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac fell as 
much as 90 percent on the day after the announcement.  Supervisory data suggest that 23 
depository institutions with roughly $20 billion in assets would be significantly affected by a 
write-off of Fannie and Freddie common and preferred stock.  The federal banking agencies 
issued a joint statement that they are prepared to work with such institutions to develop 
capital-restoration plans. 
 
Spreads between yields on the two GSEs’ ten-year senior bonds and those on ten-year 
Treasury notes narrowed about 25 basis points, and spreads on their subordinated debt 
narrowed more than 200 basis points.  The two-year note issued by Fannie Mae this week 
attracted heavy demand, but market participants indicated that liquidity in the secondary 
market for GSE debt remains somewhat lower than normal.  Option-adjusted spreads on 
MBS guaranteed by Fannie and Freddie dropped more than 60 basis points on the day after 
the announcement.  Yields on new fixed-rate conforming mortgages dropped about 20 basis 
points and trended down further over the next two days.  The stopout rates at Freddie Mac’s 
auction of three- and six-month notes held on the day after the announcement declined 
about 45 basis points relative to OIS rates.  In the repo market, spreads on agency and   

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 4 of 41



 
agency MBS repos over Treasury general collateral repos were little changed for short 
maturities, but agency repo spreads reportedly fell somewhat for maturities beyond one 
month. 
 
The International Swaps and Derivatives Association declared that the conservatorship 
announcement constitutes a “credit event” for CDS written on Fannie’s and Freddie’s debt, 
and it is likely to be the largest credit event in the history of the CDS market in terms of the 
notional value of outstanding contracts.  Trading in existing contracts has halted, and, for 
those who choose to participate, an auction to determine the cash settlement value of CDS 
contracts on the two GSEs is expected to be held in early October.  Uncertainty 
surrounding the settlement of these contracts is reported to have been a factor behind the 
reduced liquidity of GSE debt this week.

number of failed banks in 2008 to 11.   In addition, the FDIC announced that the 

number of banks on its problem bank list jumped by almost a third from the first to 

the second quarter, and now stands at 117 institutions.  (See the box “Recent 

Developments at Commercial Banks.”)  Some evidence of strains at thrift institutions 

was also evident over the intermeeting period, with developments at Washington 

Mutual garnering particular attention.  Washington Mutual’s share price plummeted 

and its CDS spread widened markedly amid reports that market participants expect 

further losses at the firm.  The condition of corporate credit unions (CCUs) also came 

under scrutiny, as several large CCUs have unrealized losses on securities in their 

investment portfolios that exceed their regulatory capital; concerns about the solvency 

of some of these firms have impaired their ability to obtain short-term funding, 

particularly in the commercial paper market.  

Monetary Policy Expectations and Treasury Yields 

(5) The FOMC’s decision at its August meeting to leave the target federal funds 

rate unchanged at 2 percent had been broadly anticipated.  The accompanying policy 

statement, which many market participants interpreted as essentially balanced with 

respect to upside risks to inflation and downside risks to growth, was also in line with 

expectations.  Accordingly, the expected path for policy was little changed in the wake 

of the announcement, and the response in broader financial markets was minimal.1  

Over the remainder of the intermeeting period, market reactions to speeches by 

FOMC members and the release of the minutes of the August FOMC meeting were 

also muted.  Markets generally shrugged off incoming economic data.  Instead, market 

participants took direction from the pressures on the condition of a number of major  
                                           
1 The effective federal funds rate averaged 1.99 percent over the intermeeting period.  The 
volatility of the funds rate, though it remained slightly elevated by historical standards, was 
lower than it had been over the last several intermeeting periods.  Over this intermeeting 
period, the volume of long-term repurchase agreements was unchanged and the Desk did 
not redeem any Treasury securities.

Recent Developments at Commercial Banks 
 
The profitability of U.S. commercial banks declined sharply in the second quarter of 
2008. Industry return on assets fell to about 0.4 percent at an annual rate, its lowest 
level in more than 15 years.  Substantially higher provisions for loan losses accounted 
for most of the decline in profitability in the second quarter, and writedowns of the 
values of other assets—including securities, leveraged loans, goodwill, and leveraged 
lease transactions—also reduced reported earnings.   
 
Significant losses at several large commercial banks contributed importantly to the 
drop in profitability and prompted their bank holding company parents to raise 
capital in order to shore up the banks’ regulatory capital ratios.  Partly as a result of 
those equity infusions, regulatory capital ratios for the industry as a whole have 
remained well above the thresholds required for well-capitalized banks.  
 
Despite the rapid pace of loan-loss provisioning, the ratio of loan-loss reserves to net 
charge-offs—a rough gauge of reserve adequacy—has fallen to its lowest level in 
more than two decades.  Moreover, the overall delinquency rate at commercial banks 
is still trending up significantly—it reached its highest level since the end of 1993 in 
the second quarter—as the performance of residential mortgages and construction 
and land development loans continues to deteriorate sharply.  Consequently, loan-loss 
provisions will likely remain elevated for some time, dampening bank profits.  Given 
this adverse outlook for profitability, and with the macroeconomic and financial 
outlook quite uncertain, banking organizations may continue to find it costly to raise 
additional capital going forward.

financial institutions and the associated concerns about the economic outlook, and 

marked down their expected path for policy significantly, on net.  Futures quotes now 

suggest an expected path of the funds rate that is then flat at 2 percent through at 

least the middle of 2009, with a modest probability of easing through the end of this 

year.  Subsequently, the path rises to about 3 percent by the end of 2010, a level more 

than 60 basis points below that anticipated at the time of the August meeting (Chart 

2).  Judging from options on federal funds futures contracts, investors place high odds 

on an unchanged target at next week’s FOMC meeting, as do respondents to the 

Desk’s policy survey.  Option-implied measures of uncertainty about the federal funds 

rate six and twelve months ahead moved lower.   

(6) Two-year nominal Treasury yields declined 30 basis points over the 

intermeeting period and ten-year yields moved down about 35 basis points.   (See the 

box “Treasury Yields and Probability of Low GSE Share Prices.”)  Five-year inflation 

compensation fell 50 basis points, while five-year inflation compensation five years 

forward dropped 6 basis points.  The most recent survey measures of short-term 

inflation expectations from both the Michigan Survey and the Survey of Professional 

Forecasters were also lower than previous readings:  The drops in short-term 

expectations likely reflected the sharp decline in oil prices, as well as the softer 

economic outlook, with greater economic slack presumably now foreseen by the 

market.  On balance, respondents to the Desk’s primary dealer survey revised up their 

forecasts for near-term core PCE inflation, but their average forecasts for 2009 were 

unchanged.  Long-term survey measures of inflation expectations were unchanged 

from previous readings and dealer forecasts for headline CPI inflation from five to 

ten years ahead were also little changed.  However, the dispersion of long-term 

inflation forecasts in the Survey of Professional Forecasters declined a bit.

Treasury Yields and the Probability of Low GSE Share Prices  
 

Over the intermeeting period, uncertainty about the capital positions of the GSEs and 
speculation about the timing and structure of potential government intervention to support the 
firms induced investors to reassess the prospects for the two agencies and for financial stability.  
The chart below shows market-implied probabilities that the share prices of Fannie Mae and 
Freddie Mac would fall to very low levels over the next few months, calculated from put options 
on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac shares expiring in January.1  These estimated probabilities fell in 
mid-July after the Treasury asked Congress to pass legislation that would authorize it to inject 
capital into the agencies and the Federal Reserve Board authorized the Federal Reserve Bank of 
New York to lend to the firms if necessary.  The probabilities seesawed during the second half of 
August amid heightened uncertainty about the conditions of the GSEs and prospects for 
government intervention.  On September 8, when the stock prices of both Fannie Mae and 
Freddie Mac collapsed following the announcement that the two GSEs would be put into 
conservatorship, the probabilities shot up. 
 
The table shows correlations between movements in these probabilities and two- and ten-year 
Treasury yields over the intermeeting period.  All of these correlations are negative and 
statistically significant.2  Although such correlations do not indicate causation, these results 
suggest that investor sentiment about the prospects for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and, given 
their systemic importance, for the broad financial sector, may have been an important driver of 
Treasury yields of late.  The negative correlation appeared to break down on Monday as Treasury 
yields did not decline following the conservatorship announcement, likely because the GSEs’ 
stock prices no longer reflect information about mortgage credit availability, given the structure 
of the government’s intervention.      
 
1  Specifically, the chart shows the probabilities that the stock prices of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac will be below 
the lowest strike available (constant at $2.5 and $3 respectively) on January 16, 2009. 
2 As shown in the table, estimates of the probability of low share prices for Lehman Brothers also showed negative 
and significant correlations with Treasury yields.

Money Markets 

(7) Interbank funding markets remained strained over the intermeeting period 

as banks reportedly continued to shy away from lending term funds.  The spread of 

one-month Libor over comparable-maturity OIS rates rose modestly and the three-

month spread widened a bit more (Chart 3).  Amid poor liquidity, rates on six-month 

and one-year Libor—reference rates for a wide variety of contracts, including floating-

rate mortgages—rose over the intermeeting period, while comparable-maturity OIS 

rates fell, leaving spreads at record levels.  Depositories continued to bid aggressively 

at the Term Auction Facility (TAF) auctions held during the intermeeting period.  In 

particular, while demand was elevated for both of the 84-day TAF auctions, with 

stop-out rates just below three-month Libor, demand at the second auction was 

reportedly damped by institutions’ desire to reserve the eligible collateral for later 

auctions covering year-end.  On average, depository institutions’ use of overnight 

primary credit was about unchanged at a high level over the intermeeting period, 

while term primary credit continued to rise.  Total primary credit outstanding 

currently stands at a near-record $23.5 billion.   

(8) Foreign money market conditions deteriorated a bit over the intermeeting 

period.  Spreads between three-month sterling Libor and OIS rates widened more 

than 10 basis points as U.K. house prices continued to fall and concerns about 

valuations of asset-backed securities intensified.  Spreads of euro Libor to OIS were 

little changed, but the demand for funding apparently remained substantial.  The first 

few ECB and Swiss National Bank (SNB) auctions of 84-day U.S dollar funds were 

significantly oversubscribed, and the two 28-day dollar auctions held by the ECB and 

SNB also drew substantial bids.  Following statements by ECB Council Members 

expressing concern that some participants might be taking advantage of the ECB’s 

broad collateral rules, the ECB announced several changes effective February 2009, 

including substantial increases in its haircuts on asset-backed securities.

(9) Conditions in some repo markets deteriorated a little over the intermeeting 

period, and liquidity in non-Treasury, non-agency term repo markets remained poor.  

Following the GSE conservatorship announcement, the spread between agency debt 

repo rates and repo rates on Treasury general collateral at horizons longer than one 

month reportedly narrowed, while those on agency MBS were little changed on net.  

Haircuts on agency debt held steady over the intermeeting period, but haircuts on 

agency MBS collateral, private-label alt-A, and subprime MBS collateral increased a bit 

further.  The Desk’s single-tranche, 28-day repos continued to attract strong demand, 

and Schedule 1 Term Securities Lending Facility (TSLF) auctions were generally 

oversubscribed, reflecting the relatively favorable terms the auctions offered relative 

to market spreads for financing agency collateral.  By contrast, Schedule 2 auctions 

continued to be undersubscribed.  Two auctions of options on Schedule 2 TSLF 

borrowing over the September quarter-end were held during the intermeeting period; 

both were oversubscribed.  The stop-out rate was 1 basis point above the minimum 

fee rate at the first auction and 2 basis points above the minimum fee rate at the 

second.  There were no credit extensions through the Primary Dealer Credit Facility 

(PDCF) during the intermeeting period to date. 

(10) Liquidity in the Treasury bill market remained fairly good over the 

intermeeting period, amid robust supply.  Conditions in the commercial paper market 

continued to be strained.  Spreads on lower-rated nonfinancial and asset-backed 

commercial paper stayed at high levels, and spreads on higher-rated financial paper 

were volatile, generally remaining near the top of their recent range.  Quarter-end 

pressures in money markets reportedly tightened somewhat in recent days, in part 

reflecting broader market conditions.  Anecdotal reports suggest that market 

participants are growing more concerned about the upcoming year-end. 

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 13 of 41



Capital Markets 

(11) Broad equity price indexes were about flat, on net, over the intermeeting 

period, with the retail sector outperforming the broader market and lower oil prices 

dragging down the shares of energy firms.  Financial sector indexes were quite volatile 

and ended the period somewhat lower.  During the current quarter, analysts expect no 

growth in earnings from four quarters earlier for S&P 500 firms, as forecasted energy 

sector gains are offset by financial sector losses.  Analysts trimmed their forecasts of 

year-ahead expected earnings, reflecting a more pessimistic outlook for the financial 

sector.  Option-implied volatility on the S&P 500 rose slightly, on net, and remains at 

an elevated level.  The spread between the twelve-month forward trend earnings-price 

ratio for S&P 500 firms and the real long-term Treasury yield – a rough gauge of the 

equity premium – continued to climb and is now at its highest level since the early 

1980s. 

(12) Conditions in corporate debt markets tightened further over the 

intermeeting period.  Risk spreads rose from already elevated levels, as yields on 

investment-grade bonds fell less than those on comparable-maturity Treasury 

securities, while yields on speculative-grade bonds were roughly unchanged.  Spreads 

on investment-grade bonds are now at their highest levels since 2002, and their 

speculative-grade counterparts backed up to levels last seen in the spring.  Conditions 

in the leveraged loan market worsened somewhat over the intermeeting period:  

Secondary market bid prices fell to the bottom of recent ranges, perhaps due in part 

to concerns about a deterioration in credit quality.  Indeed, the implied spread on an 

index of loan credit default swaps (the LCDX) widened some over the period.  

However, according to the August Survey of Terms of Business Lending, the spread 

of loan rates on newly originated C&I loans over comparable-maturity market rates 

was little changed relative to May.  The ratio of municipal bond yields to comparable-

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 14 of 41



maturity Treasury yields rose to a historically elevated level, but issuance remained 

strong and market functioning appeared smooth.   

(13) Some indicators of conditions in the mortgage market worsened over the 

intermeeting period, while others remained steady.  Issuance of Fannie Mae and 

Freddie Mac MBS in August is estimated to be about in line with July’s pace but 

below the average rates seen in the first two quarters of the year.  By contrast, 

issuance by Ginnie Mae has stayed elevated, owing to originations of mortgages 

insured by the Federal Housing Administration or guaranteed by the Department of 

Veterans Affairs.  Market participants report that there have been no major 

disruptions to their ability to securitize conforming mortgages after Fannie Mae and 

Freddie Mac were placed into conservatorship, and interest rates on fixed-rate 

conforming mortgages fell markedly after the announcement.  Jumbo mortgages 

remained both costly and difficult to obtain.  Issuance of both private-label RMBS 

backed by nonconforming loans and of commercial mortgage-backed securities was 

essentially zero over the intermeeting period.  Rates and spreads on all types of 

consumer ABS rose over the intermeeting period, consistent with higher delinquency 

rates on the underlying loans in recent months.  Issuance of student loan asset-backed 

securities (ABS) was moderate in August, while there was no issuance of automobile 

loan-backed ABS.   

Foreign Developments 

(14) The dollar appreciated broadly and sharply over the intermeeting period, 

chiefly reflecting the deterioration of the foreign economic outlook relative to that in 

the United States.  The major currencies index rose by 6 percent, with gains exceeding 

10 percent against both sterling and the euro offsetting a small decline against the yen 

(Chart 4).  Data on macroeconomic activity in Europe continued to point to a 

softening economic outlook, and the Bank of England (BoE), the European Central

Bank (ECB) and the OECD all revised down their forecasts for growth in Europe.  

Still, the BoE and the ECB left their policy rates unchanged over the intermeeting 

period, noting that inflation was well above target.  Medium-term policy expectations 

have, however, declined since the August FOMC, particularly for the United 

Kingdom.  In line with expected easing by central banks, sovereign bond yields have 

fallen, mainly reflecting declines in inflation compensation.  Amid substantial 

volatility, stock markets around the world moved down as prospects for economic 

growth deteriorated.   

(15) The index of the dollar’s value against the currencies of our other important 

trading partners rose about 4 percent over the intermeeting period.  The increase 

likely reflected concerns about the prospects for weaker economic growth in 

emerging market economies, even as many central banks in the region tightened 

policy in an attempt to curb mounting inflation.  Notably, the dollar was little changed 

against the Chinese renminbi.  In an about-face from their policies of recent years, 

several other central banks in emerging market countries reportedly intervened in 

foreign exchange markets to support their currencies in the face of sharp downward 

pressures.  

Debt and Money 

(16) The debt of domestic nonfinancial sectors is projected to expand at a 

4 percent annual rate in the current quarter, up a bit from the second quarter, but well 

below the 8½ percent rise posted in 2007 (Chart 5).  The pickup is attributable to 

increased borrowing by state and local governments and the federal government, as 

the rate of growth in the business and household sectors is estimated to be slowing.  

In the nonfinancial business sector, commercial paper issuance was quite robust in 

August, with some of the issuance reportedly intended to fund a large acquisition and 

dividend payments.  By contrast, investment-grade bond issuance was moderate and

speculative-grade bond issuance remained weak, likely because of relatively high 

interest rates and risk spreads.  Smoothing through the month-to-month fluctuations, 

commercial bank credit has advanced at about the same pace in the current quarter as 

in the second quarter, as tepid loan growth has about offset more rapid gains in 

securities holdings.  Leveraged loan issuance reportedly has continued to be very 

subdued.  Household debt growth is estimated to have slowed further in the third 

quarter, with essentially no growth projected for home mortgage debt amid tighter 

terms for borrowers and declining prices and slow activity in the housing market. 

(17)  M2 contracted at a 1½ percent annual rate in August, as large outflows 

from liquid deposits and money funds more than offset robust growth in small time 

deposits.  Currency growth was moderate.  (See the box “Recent Behavior of the 

Components of M2.”)  Since April, M2 has advanced at an average annual rate of just 

1¼ percent.  Staff currently forecast a 5 percent increase for 2008 as a whole, only 

slightly faster than the growth of nominal GDP, despite a steep drop in the 

opportunity cost of holding M2 late last year and early this year.  Typically, the lagged 

effects of the decline in opportunity cost over the past year would have been expected 

to boost money growth substantially, but the effect of opportunity cost on the 

demand for M2 appears to have been damped in recent years.  Based on the sharp 

decline in opportunity cost, the staff’s standard money demand models predict a 

significant acceleration in M2 this year.  However, in light of the recent sluggish 

growth, M2 is projected to expand at a rate about ¾ percentage point less in 2008 

than in 2007.   

Economic Outlook 

(18) The staff forecast presented in the September Greenbook is conditioned on 

an assumption that the target federal funds rate is held at 2 percent until mid-year 

2009, six months longer than in the projection prepared for the August meeting, and  

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 19 of 41



Recent Behavior of the Components of M2 
 
The behavior of important components of M2 has been somewhat atypical during the current 
easing cycle.  The charts below compare the levels of selected M2 components over the first twelve 
months of the easing cycles that began in January 2001 and August 2007. 
 
During periods of policy easing, rates available on small time deposits tend to track rates on other 
money market instruments with only short lags and therefore typically fall relative to those on liquid 
deposits, which are generally adjusted much more sluggishly.  As a result, during periods of easing, 
liquid deposits generally expand rapidly and small time deposits run off; this pattern was clearly 
evident in the 2001 easing episode.  During the current easing cycle, however, liquid deposits have 
expanded rather slowly while small time deposits have recorded positive growth. 
 
The relatively rapid expansion of small time deposits in the current episode appears to reflect 
importantly bank funding decisions.  Some depository institutions have been offering relatively high 
interest rates on small time deposits to strengthen their core deposit base or, in some cases, to offset 
liquid deposit outflows in the wake of depositors’ concerns about depository institutions’ solvency.  
Last month, small time deposits expanded at a 25 percent annual rate—the fastest monthly growth 
rate since 1995, a period of monetary policy tightening.  Roughly a third of this increase was due to 
three institutions:  Bank of America, Wachovia, and Washington Mutual; these institutions offered 
especially attractive rates on small time deposits in August.  For Bank of America and Wachovia, the 
increase in small time deposits resulted in a net increase in total deposits.  However, Washington 
Mutual’s total deposits contracted over the month as outflows from liquid deposits overwhelmed 
increases in small time deposits.  For all depository institutions taken together, increases in small 
time deposits fell short of outflows from liquid deposits.  
 
Retail money market mutual funds, though growing only sluggishly in recent months, grew more 
than 17 percent from August 2007 to August 2008, much faster than the 6 percent expansion posted 
during the comparable period of the January 2001 easing cycle.  In part, the robust growth of retail 
money funds likely reflects household demand for safe and liquid assets during the financial turmoil.
 
Currency has expanded just 2 percent over the year since August 2007, with moderately strong 
domestic demand partially offset by weak foreign demand for U.S. dollars.  In June and July, 
however, there was a noticeable surge in foreign demand, likely due to strong demand for dollars in 
Argentina, which has been experiencing significant political and economic uncertainty. 

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 20 of 41



rises to 3 percent by the end of 2010, 25 basis points lower than previously assumed.  

Long-term Treasury yields are projected to edge up over the forecast period, owing to 

the rising short-term rates, but beginning from a modestly lower level.  Fixed 

mortgage rates have been marked down, in part to reflect the drop that occurred in 

response to the government’s takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, bringing 

forward nearly all of the decline in rates that had previously been projected to take 

place over the next two years.  Stock prices, which start from a level that is 

3½ percent below that assumed in the previous forecast, increase at an average annual 

rate of 11½ percent, as the equity risk premium retraces about half of the widening 

that has occurred during the financial turmoil.  The real foreign exchange value of the 

dollar is again assumed to depreciate at an annual rate of 2½ percent, but from a level 

that is about 5 percent higher than in the last Greenbook.  The price of West Texas 

intermediate crude oil is expected edge up from its current level of $103 per barrel – 

about $20 per barrel less than in the previous projection – to $107 by the end of 2009 

and to hold to that level in 2010.  In the forecast, the continued deterioration of the 

housing sector, restraint from the earlier increase in energy prices, weak consumer 

sentiment, and the considerable strains in financial conditions hold down growth in 

the near term, and a gradual improvement in these factors leads to modest 

acceleration in economic activity over time.  On balance, real GDP growth is 

projected to average about ¾ percent at an annual rate over the second half of 2008, 

but to pick up to 2 percent next year and to 2¾ percent in 2010, a bit above the staff’s 

estimate of the growth rate of potential GDP of 2½ percent.  This trajectory for 

growth is slightly weaker on average than forecasted last time, owing partly to the 

recent strength of the dollar.  The unemployment rate is projected to average 6¼ 

percent in 2009 – ¼ percentage point higher than in the previous forecast and 

significantly above the staff’s estimate of the NAIRU – and then to edge down in 

2010.  Higher-than-expected readings on inflation for July led the staff to increase its 

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 21 of 41



forecast of overall PCE inflation in the current quarter nearly a percentage point to 

5½ percent, but the recent decline in crude oil prices is expected to pull headline 

inflation down to ½ percent in the fourth quarter.  The forecast for current-quarter 

core PCE inflation is 3 percent, but core inflation is projected to fall to 2½ percent in 

the fourth quarter.  Both total and core PCE inflation are projected to be a little over 

2 percent in 2009 and just under 2 percent in 2010.     

Update on Monetary Policy Strategies  

(19) As shown in Chart 6, the Greenbook-consistent measure of short-run r* 

now stands at -0.3 percent, about 40 basis points lower than in the previous 

Bluebook.  The estimates from the small structural model and the FRB/US model has 

dropped more sharply and now stand at about -1¾ percent.  These declines mainly 

reflect the higher path for the foreign exchange value of the dollar and the increase in 

the equity premium in the current forecast.  The actual real federal funds rate—

constructed using lagged core PCE inflation as a proxy for inflation expectations—

now stands at -0.4 percent, about 20 basis points lower than in the previous Bluebook 

(see the box “Estimates of the Real Funds Rate and Optimal Monetary Policy”).  

(20) Chart 7 depicts optimal control simulations of the FRB/US model using  

the long-run Greenbook forecast beyond 2010. In these simulations, policymakers 

place equal weight on keeping core PCE inflation close to a specified goal, on keeping 

unemployment close to the NAIRU, and on avoiding changes in the nominal federal 

funds rate.2  For an inflation goal of 1½ percent (the left-hand set of charts), the  

                                           
2  Consistent with the staff assumptions in the Greenbook, the value of the effective NAIRU 
used in the loss function is boosted 20 basis points in the last quarter of 2008 and 15 basis 
points in 2009 to control for the supply-side effects of recently enacted temporary extended 
unemployment insurance benefits.  In these projections, policymakers and participants in 
financial markets are assumed to understand fully the forces shaping the economic outlook

(as summarized by the extended Greenbook projection), whereas households and firms are 
assumed to form their expectations using more limited information. 

Estimates of the Real Funds Rate and Optimal Monetary Policy 
 
The estimates shown in Chart 6 for the equilibrium real federal funds rate and the 
actual real funds rate are constructed using trailing core inflation as the proxy for 
expected inflation.  As portrayed in the figure below, the estimated value of the real 
funds rate can vary substantially depending on the choice of proxy for expected 
inflation.  When computed using either trailing core inflation or projected headline 
inflation, the actual real funds rate is around zero, close to the troughs reached in each 
of the previous two downturns.  In contrast, when measured using trailing headline 
inflation, the current real funds rate stands at about -2½ percent, its lowest level in 
more than three decades.   
  

In evaluating the macroeconomic and policy implications of these real funds rate 
measures, it is important to consider the extent to which they are affected by 
transitory fluctuations in overall inflation.  For example, the staff projects a sharp 
decline in headline PCE inflation from 3½ percent in 2008 to about 2¼ percent  
in 2009.  Under this projection, the corresponding measure of the real funds rate will 
rise by roughly 125 basis points next year even if the nominal funds rate remains at its 
current level. 
 
Regardless of the choice of proxy for expected inflation, no measure of the actual  
real funds rate can, by itself, provide an adequate metric for assessing the stance of 
monetary policy without reference to other factors influencing the outlook and to the 
Committee’s objectives.  Such an assessment must take account of expected future 
policy rates; term premiums; the risk premiums embedded in mortgage rates, 
corporate yields, and equity prices; and bank lending terms and standards.  It must 
also take account of shocks to variables such as residential investment and commodity 
prices, as well as other financial and nonfinancial influences on the overall economic 
outlook.  Indeed, staff analysis indicates that the economic and financial 
developments since last summer have shifted down the optimal-control path of the 
federal funds rate since that time by a magnitude similar to the decline in the actual 
funds rate.1 
1 See the September 9 memo to the Committee, “Gauging the Effective Stance of Monetary Policy,”  
by Jean-Philippe Laforte, Dave Reifschneider, John Roberts, and Tom Tallarini.  The estimates of the real 
federal funds rate in this memo are based on the July/August Greenbook.

optimal funds rate stays near 2¼ percent through early 2010; this trajectory is about 

20 to 50 basis points lower than in the previous Bluebook.  With an inflation target of 

2 percent (the right-hand set of charts), the funds rate declines to around 1 percent by 

late 2009 and then rises gradually to 4¾ percent by 2013.  These prescriptions mostly 

reflect the reduction in the Greenbook consistent measure of r*.  For either inflation 

goal, the optimal-control policy generates outcomes for the unemployment rate over 

the next several years that are about ¼ percentage point higher than the last 

Bluebook, while the outcomes for core inflation are little changed beyond mid-2009.  

(21) As depicted in Chart 8, the outcome-based monetary policy rule prescribes a 

funds rate path that rises steadily to about 3 percent by the middle of 2009 before 

flattening out.  This trajectory is noticeably higher than currently embedded in 

financial market quotes, which imply a roughly unchanged funds rate until the middle 

of next year.  Stochastic simulations of the FRB/US model indicate a 70 percent 

probability that the prescriptions of the outcome-based rule will fall in a range of  

1¾ to 4¼ percent at the end of 2009; this confidence band is about 50 to 100 basis 

points higher than that implied by interest rate caps.  The near-term prescriptions 

from the Taylor (1993, 1999) rules are a notch higher than in the previous Bluebook, 

reflecting a modest increase in recent readings on core inflation.  As has been the case 

for some time, the rates implied by these rules are relatively high because they do not 

take into account the effects of financial market pressures, the persisting weakness of 

the housing market, and other forward-looking information captured by market 

expectations and the staff forecast.  The first-difference rule under an inflation goal of 

1½ percent prescribes no change from the current target for 2008Q4 and a quarter-

point tightening for 2009Q1.  In contrast, under an inflation goal of 2 percent, it calls 

for about one quarter percentage point of easing over the next two quarters.

Policy Alternatives 

(22) This Bluebook presents three alternatives for the Committee’s 

consideration, summarized by the draft statements in Table 1.  Under Alternatives A 

and B, the target federal funds rate would be maintained at 2 percent at this meeting.  

Alternative C includes a 25 basis point tightening.  Compared with the statement 

released after the August meeting, all three alternatives would still note that inflation 

has been high, but the focus of the discussion of economic activity has shifted from 

the expansion in the second quarter to the slowdown evident in recent months.  In 

addition, a slowing in export growth is included as a factor likely to weigh on the pace 

of economic activity over the next few quarters.  Apart from these changes, 

Alternative B is little different from the Committee’s statement in August.  Alternative 

C expresses the Committee’s “significant concern” that inflation may not moderate as 

anticipated, and states that the policy action was intended to better promote 

acceptable progress toward price stability.  Alternative A indicates greater confidence 

that inflation will moderate and suggests that downside risks to growth and upside 

risks to inflation are now roughly balanced.  

(23) If the Committee views the staff forecast, which is conditioned on 

unchanged policy through the middle of next year, as reasonable and acceptable in the 

circumstances and sees no compelling reason to change the statement materially, it 

may wish to leave the policy rate unchanged and issue a statement along the lines of 

that in Alternative B.  Although inflation is currently high, the Committee may 

expect inflation to decline to acceptable levels given the recent appreciation of the 

dollar, the decline in oil prices, and the outlook for persistent economic slack.  And 

even though members may believe that the next policy move is likely to be a 

tightening, they may also judge that holding the funds rate steady for now is 

appropriate given the Committee’s dual objectives.  Indeed, the optimal policy 

simulations based on a 1½ percent inflation goal has the target federal funds rate just

2. Economic activity expanded in 
the second quarter, partly reflecting 
growth in consumer spending and 
exports.  However, labor markets 
have softened further and financial 
markets remain under considerable 
stress.  Tight credit conditions, the

elevated energy prices are likely to 
weigh on economic growth over the 
next few quarters.  Over time, the 
substantial easing of monetary 
policy, combined with ongoing 
measures to foster market liquidity, 
should help to promote moderate 
economic growth.

Rationale 

3. Inflation has been high, spurred 
by the earlier increases in the prices 
of energy and some other 
commodities, and some indicators 
of inflation expectations have been 
elevated.  The Committee expects 
inflation to moderate later this year 
and next year, but the inflation 
outlook remains highly uncertain. 

Inflation has been high, but the 
Committee expects that the recent 
decline in energy and other 
commodity prices and increased slack 
in resource utilization will foster a 
moderation of inflation later this year 
and next year.  Nevertheless, the 
inflation outlook remains highly 
uncertain.

Inflation has remained high, and

expectations have been elevated.  
Although the Committee expects 
inflation to moderate later this year 
and next year, the possibility that 
inflation may fail to decline as 
anticipated is of significant concern. 

Assessment of 
Risk 

4. Although downside risks to 
growth remain, the upside risks to 
inflation are also of significant 
concern to the Committee.  The 
Committee will continue to monitor 
economic and financial 
developments and will act as needed 
to promote sustainable economic 
growth and price stability. 

The downside risks to growth and the 
upside risks to inflation are both of 
significant concern to the Committee.

remain, the upside risks to inflation 
are also of significant concern to the

The Committee took this action to 
provide additional assurance that 
inflation will abate as desired.  The

economic and financial developments 
and will act as needed to promote 
sustainable economic growth and 
price stability.

a bit above its current level until the second half of 2010 (Chart 7).  Moreover, the 

risks to the outlook remain considerable on both sides.  Financial strains have 

continued over the intermeeting period, and, while business spending has held up, the 

recent indications of exceptionally low consumer confidence, sharply declining auto 

sales, and deteriorating labor market conditions may suggest continued significant 

downside risks to growth.  At the same time, inflation has persisted at levels well 

above those consistent with price stability, and the Committee may remain very 

concerned that inflation will not moderate as forecast.  In these circumstances, the 

Committee may consider it prudent to leave policy unchanged while waiting for more 

information bearing on the outlook for economic activity and inflation. 

(24) In the statement under Alternative B, the rationale begins by noting that 

“Incoming information suggests that growth in economic activity has slowed in recent 

months,” which is changed from “Economic activity expanded in the second quarter” 

to shift the discussion to the current quarter and reflect the significant, albeit 

expected, deceleration that appears to be under way.  In light of the continued 

deterioration in labor market conditions, the statement then indicates that labor 

markets have “weakened” further, rather than “softened” as in August.  The 

statement again notes that “financial markets remain under considerable stress” and 

then states that “Tight credit conditions, the ongoing housing contraction, some 

slowing in export growth, and past increases in energy prices are likely to weigh on 

economic growth.”  “Some slowing in export growth” is included to recognize that, 

after surging about 11 percent over the four quarters ending in Q2, exports are 

projected to decelerate to a rate more in line with historical norms, and “past increases 

in” energy prices are referenced rather than “elevated” energy prices because the net 

rise in energy prices over the past year or so continues to restrain growth despite the 

recent marked decline in prices.  The remainder of the statement under Alternative B 

is unchanged from that released by the Committee in August, indicating that the 

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 30 of 41



substantial easing of monetary policy will promote economic growth; that the 

Committee expects inflation to moderate, but the outlook is uncertain; and that, 

although downside risks to growth remain, upside risks to inflation are also of 

significant concern.   

(25) Futures and options quotes as well as the Desk’s survey of primary dealers 

suggest that market participants do not expect any change in policy until the third 

quarter of next year.  Investors read the statement released in August as consistent 

with an outlook for unchanged policy, so Alternative B, which is very similar, would 

probably not lead them to revise their views.  Market participants will note the shift in 

focus of the discussion to the weaker economic activity in the current quarter, but 

they will probably take more direction from the forward-looking parts of the 

statement, which are unchanged.  In sum, short- and longer-term interest rates, equity 

prices, and the exchange value of the dollar would probably be little changed in 

response to an announcement along the lines of Alternative B. 

(26) If the Committee both thinks that it is important that it be seen to be 

responding to the continued high levels of inflation and has fairly high confidence in 

the resilience of financial markets and economic activity, it may prefer to tighten 

policy by 25 basis points at this meeting as in Alternative C.  PCE inflation in the 

third quarter is projected to be its highest since the first quarter of 1990 – and above 

2 percent for its eleventh consecutive quarter – and some measures of longer-term 

inflation expectations remain above their levels of recent years.  Against this 

backdrop, the Committee may feel that failing to tighten policy could lead market 

participants and households to question its commitment to price stability, as in the 

“Unanchored inflation expectations” alternative scenario in the Greenbook.  

Moreover, most simple policy rules call for a federal funds rate that is considerably 

above its current level (Chart 8).  Although financial market conditions remain 

strained, members may judge that the financial situation is being adequately addressed 

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 31 of 41



by the various measures that the Federal Reserve has put in place to support market 

liquidity and by the Treasury’s actions to stabilize Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.  As a 

result, the Committee may see the slowdown in growth as transitory, along the lines 

of the “Financial rebound” Greenbook alternative scenario, and be concerned that 

holding the federal funds rate at its current level would impart excessive momentum 

to the economy going forward, undercutting efforts to bring inflation down.   

(27) The discussion of economic activity in the statement proposed in 

Alternative C is similar to that in Alternative B.  However, Alternative C cites the 

“accommodative stance of monetary policy” rather than past policy easings as a factor 

that should support growth in the future because policy would be tightened under this 

alternative.  The inflation paragraph in Alternative C indicates that “inflation has 

remained high.”  The statement goes on to emphasize that “the possibility that 

inflation may fail to decline as anticipated is of significant concern” to the Committee, 

and then notes that the policy firming at this meeting was intended to “provide 

additional assurance that inflation will abate as desired.”  This indication that the 

move was taken as a type of anti-inflation insurance, along with the earlier discussion 

of the current period of economic weakness, may suggest that the tightening would 

not necessarily be followed by a series of upward adjustments to the funds rate.  

(28) Market participants are very confident in their outlook for no change in 

policy at this meeting and would be quite surprised by the adoption of Alternative C.  

The expected trajectory of the federal funds rate for the next several months would 

likely be marked up at least 25 basis points, and might move up further if investors 

thought the Committee was more likely to raise rates going forward.  Other short-

term interest rates would rise accordingly.  Longer-term rates would probably increase 

as well.  Inflation compensation would likely decline a bit, as investors concluded that 

the Committee was taking a more aggressive stance toward inflation.  Equity prices 

would fall, perhaps sharply, while the exchange value of the dollar would probably 

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 32 of 41



appreciate.  The policy surprise, along with the potentially large and unexpected 

movements in asset prices, would likely intensify strains in financial markets, perhaps 

significantly.   

(29) If the Committee sees recent developments as pointing to a weaker 

economic outlook and less pronounced inflation pressures, members may instead be 

attracted to the statement language of Alternative A.  The substantial decline in 

energy prices in recent months, if not reversed, will pull down top-line inflation, 

which may prevent elevated inflation rates from becoming embedded in expectations.  

Indeed, near-term inflation expectations have come down appreciably over the 

intermeeting period, as has five-by-five inflation compensation.  Moreover, the 

passthrough of the lower energy prices, coupled with a higher level of unemployment, 

should add to downward pressure on core inflation.  Members may also see the recent 

marked rise in the exchange value of the dollar as likely to contribute to a reduction in 

inflation while restraining overall economic growth.  In addition, financial strains 

appear to have extended to a wider range of financial institutions over the 

intermeeting period, in some cases creating severe pressures on their balance sheets 

and even uncertainty about their solvency.  The ongoing pullback in credit availability 

has the potential to weigh on economic growth for a considerable period, as in the 

“More-persistent headwinds” scenario discussed in the Greenbook.  The real federal 

funds rate (based on lagged four-quarter core PCE inflation) is roughly in line with its 

Greenbook-consistent equilibrium value, which the Committee may see as an 

appropriate policy stance in the present circumstances (Chart 6).  Still, the Committee 

may now see risks to both inflation and output as considerable and roughly equal and 

may wish to adjust the language in the statement to treat them symmetrically.  

(30) The statement under Alternative A differs from that under Alternative B 

only in its discussion of the inflation outlook and the assessment of risks.  In 

particular, while still noting that inflation has been high, the alternative indicates the 

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 33 of 41



Committee’s expectation “that the recent decline in energy and other commodity 

prices and increased slack in resource utilization will foster a moderation of inflation.”  

The statement again notes that the outlook for inflation is uncertain, but adopts 

language that suggests the Committee sees the risks to growth and inflation as roughly 

equal – “The downside risks to growth and the upside risks to inflation are both of 

significant concern to the Committee.”  Taken together, the adjustments suggest a 

greater degree of confidence that inflation will moderate as well as a more balanced 

outlook with regard to any future policy moves.  

(31) Despite the changes in the statement language in Alternative A, the market 

reaction may not be very large.  The observation that the substantial decline in oil 

prices is likely to contribute to a moderation in inflation will come as no surprise to 

market participants.  Furthermore, investors already expect policy to be unchanged 

for several quarters and reportedly read the August statement as essentially signaling a 

shift to a balanced assessment of risks, so a more explicit indication in that regard may 

not spark much reaction.  Indeed, the Desk’s survey found that primary dealers expect 

the statement to be changed slightly to indicate a somewhat weaker outlook for 

growth and reduced inflationary pressures.  Still, the greater confidence expressed in 

the statement that inflation will moderate may be seen as freeing up the Committee to 

ease policy if necessary should the outlook for the economy worsen.  In consequence, 

short-term interest rates may decline somewhat following such an announcement.  

Long-term rates would likely edge down only a bit if at all, while inflation 

compensation could tick higher if investors see the FOMC as having become less 

vigilant with respect to inflation risks.  Equity prices may increase moderately, and the 

exchange value of the dollar might decline a little.

Money and Debt Forecasts 

(32) Because M2 growth has continued to be surprisingly sluggish in recent 

months, the forecast for M2 growth for 2008 has been revised down 1¼ percentage 

points, to 5 percent, despite an upward revision to the staff’s outlook for nominal 

GDP growth and a downward revision to the opportunity cost of holding money.  

M2 growth is projected to fall to 3½ percent in 2009 and 3 percent in 2010 in 

response to a projected increase in M2 opportunity cost as monetary policy firms. 

(33) Growth of domestic nonfinancial sector debt is projected to remain quite 

moderate:  After slowing from 8½ percent growth in 2007 to 4¼ percent in 2008, it 

stays at around 4½ percent in 2009 and 5 percent in 2010.  In the projection, 

borrowing by households continues to be held down by falling home prices and 

tighter bank lending standards.  Tightening by banks also contributes to a slowdown 

in business borrowing, which is restrained in addition by elevated corporate bond 

spreads.  In contrast, federal government debt is expected to accelerate this year and 

next as a variety of factors, including this year’s fiscal stimulus payments, slower 

growth in tax receipts, and expected federal outlays for deposit insurance and 

assistance for the GSEs contribute to wider federal deficits.

Appendix A: Measures of the Equilibrium Real Rate 

The equilibrium real rate is the real federal funds rate that, if maintained, would be projected to return 
output to its potential level over time.  The short-run equilibrium rate is defined as the rate that would 
close the output gap in twelve quarters given the corresponding model’s projection of the economy.  The 
medium-run concept is the value of the real federal funds rate projected to keep output at potential in 
seven years, under the assumption that monetary policy acts to bring actual and potential output into line 
in the short run and then keeps them equal thereafter.  The TIPS-based factor model measure provides 
an estimate of market expectations for the real federal funds rate seven years ahead.

The actual real federal funds rate is constructed as the difference between the nominal rate and realized 
inflation, where the nominal rate is measured as the quarterly average of the observed federal funds rate, 
and realized inflation is given by the log difference between the core PCE price index and its lagged 
value four quarters earlier.  For the current quarter, the nominal rate is specified as the target federal 
funds rate on the Bluebook publication date.  For the current quarter and the previous quarter, the 
inflation rate is computed using the staff’s estimate of the core PCE price index. If the upcoming FOMC 
meeting falls early in the quarter, the lagged inflation measure ends in the last quarter.   

Confidence intervals reflect uncertainties about model specification, coefficients, and the level of 
potential output.  The final column of the table indicates the values published in the previous Bluebook. 
   

Measure Description 

Single-equation
Model

The measure of the equilibrium real rate in the single-equation model is based on an 
estimated aggregate-demand relationship between the current value of the output gap and 
its lagged values as well as the lagged values of the real federal funds rate. 

Small Structural 
Model

The small-scale model of the economy consists of equations for six variables: the output 
gap, the equity premium, the federal budget surplus, the trend growth rate of output, the 
real bond yield, and the real federal funds rate. 

Large Model 
(FRB/US)

Estimates of the equilibrium real rate using FRB/US—the staff’s large-scale econometric 
model of the U.S. economy—depend on a very broad array of economic factors, some of 
which take the form of projected values of the model’s exogenous variables. 

Greenbook-
consistent 

The FRB/US model is used in conjunction with an extended version of the Greenbook 
forecast to derive a Greenbook-consistent measure.  FRB/US is first add-factored so that its 
simulation matches the extended Greenbook forecast, and then a second simulation is run 
off this baseline to determine the value of the real federal funds rate that closes the output 
gap.

TIPS-based
Factor Model 

Yields on TIPS (Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities) reflect investors’ expectations of 
the future path of real interest rates, but also include term and liquidity premiums.  The 
TIPS-based measure of the equilibrium real rate is constructed using the seven-year-ahead 
instantaneous real forward rate derived from TIPS yields as of the Bluebook publication 
date.  This forward rate is adjusted to remove estimates of the term and liquidity premiums 
based on a three-factor arbitrage-free term-structure model applied to TIPS yields, nominal 
yields, and inflation.  Because TIPS indexation is based on the total CPI, this measure is 
also adjusted for the medium-term difference—projected at 40 basis points—between total 
CPI inflation and core PCE inflation. 

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 38 of 41



Appendix A: Measures of the Equilibrium Real Rate (continued) 

Estimates of the real federal funds rate depend on the proxies for expected inflation used.  The table 
below shows estimated real federal funds rates based on lagged core PCE inflation, the definition used 
in the Equilibrium Real Federal Funds Rate chart; lagged four-quarter headline PCE inflation; and 
projected four-quarter headline PCE inflation beginning with the next quarter.  For each estimate of the 
real rate, the table also provides the Greenbook-consistent measure of the short-run equilibrium real rate 
and the average actual real federal funds rate over the next twelve quarters.

Appendix B: Analysis of Policy Paths and Confidence Intervals

Rule Specifications:  For the following rules, it denotes the federal funds rate for quarter t, while
the explanatory variables include the staff’s projection of trailing four-quarter core PCE inflation 
( t), inflation two and three quarters ahead ( t+2|t and t+3|t), the output gap in the current period 
and one quarter ahead ( y y *t t  and y y *t t1| t 1|t ), and the three-quarter-ahead forecast of annual 
average GDP growth relative to potential ( 4 4y y *t t3| t 3|t ), and *  denotes an assumed value 
of policymakers’ long-run inflation objective.  The outcome-based and forecast-based rules were 
estimated using real-time data over the sample 1988:1-2006:4; each specification was chosen 
using the Bayesian information criterion. Each rule incorporates a 75 basis point shift in the 
intercept, specified as a sequence of  
25 basis point increments during the first three quarters of 1998.  The first two simple rules were 
proposed by Taylor (1993, 1999).  The prescriptions of the first-difference rule do not depend on 
assumptions regarding r* or the level of the output gap; see Orphanides (2003).

FRB/US Model Simulations:  Prescriptions from the two empirical rules are computed using 
dynamic simulations of the FRB/US model, implemented as though the rule were followed 
starting at this FOMC meeting.  The dotted line labeled “Previous Bluebook” is based on the 
current specification of the policy rule, applied to the previous Greenbook projection.
Confidence intervals are based on stochastic simulations of the FRB/US model with shocks 
drawn from the estimated residuals over 1986-2005.
Information from Financial Markets:  The expected funds rate path is based on forward rate 
agreements, and the confidence intervals for this path are constructed using prices of interest rate 
caps.
Near-Term Prescriptions of Simple Policy Rules:  These prescriptions are calculated using 
Greenbook projections for inflation and the output gap. Because the first-difference rule involves 
the lagged funds rate, the value labeled “Previous Bluebook” for the current quarter is computed 
using the actual value
of the lagged funds rate, and the one-quarter-ahead prescriptions are based on this rule’s 
prescription for the current quarter.
