of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was created 
through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned 
versions text-searchable.2   Though a stringent quality assurance process was 
employed, some imperfections may remain.

MONEY MARKET CONDITIONS

Recent developments

(1) The narrowly-defined money supply grew at a 6 per cent annual

rate in September, little more than in August and well below the 11 per cent

annual rate projected in the Blue Book at the time of the last Committee

meeting. It turned out that half of the $2 billion bulge in M1 that

developed over the two statement weeks ending September 6--which included

the long Labor Day weekend--was immediately reversed, and the level of M1

remained reduced throughout the month. Because of the marked shortfall in

M1, growth of M2 in September was also below expectations, although less so

than M1 due to a slightly stronger than anticipated growth in time deposits.

(2) For much of the inter-meeting period RPD growth also appeared

to be running below the 9-1/2 to 13-1/2 per cent September-October target

range. Most recently, however, unexpectedly large excess reserves have

raised the indicated RPD growth rate for the two months to 10-1/2 per cent

(with about two percentage points representing larger excess reserves than

assumed at the time of the Committee meeting).

(3) In view of the Committee's desire to attain a lower rate of

growth in M1 and other aggregates than had been projected, and with credit

market conditions calming, the Federal funds rate was allowed to edge up a

little over the inter-meeting period. On a weekly average basis, the range



-2-

of movement was from 4.93 per cent in the week of the last meeting to a high

of 5.15 per cent. This latter rate was on the high side of the Desk's aim,

and in the most recent statement week the funds rate averaged 5.09 per cent.

(4) Most other short-term interest rates have also risen somewhat

since the last meeting of the Committee. The 3-month bill rate has been most

recently quoted at 4.85 per cent, up about 20 basis points since

the last meeting. The prevailing bank prime rate moved up to 5-3/4 per cent,

and two banks with a floating prime rate went to 5-7/8 per cent today.

Most long-term rates, on the other hand, have shown little change since the

last Committee meeting, except that municipal bond yields have declined

fairly substantially. Stability in bond markets in part reflected recent

rumors of an imminent peace settlement in Vietnam and possibly also hopes

for favorable Congressional action on an expenditure ceiling. In these

circumstances, the Treasury elected to meet its October cash needs by

auctioning a $2 billion two-year note. The average rate in the auction

was 5.86 per cent, but following allotment the price of the issue dropped

by about the estimated value of the tax and loan account credit and the

market yield rose to 5.95 per cent.

(5) The table on the following page shows seasonally adjusted

annual rates of change in monetary aggregates over recent periods.

Prospective developments

(6) The approach taken in this blue book differs in some respects

from previous practice--the principal difference being to puc more stress on

targets and less on projections. The table on the following page shows possible

longer-run targets for key monetary aggregates which the Committee may wish to

consider in setting its financial objectives. The longer-run relationships

among monetary aggregates and interest rates are discussed in paragraphs (7) to

(9). Suggested shorter-run operating targets that are thought to be generally

consistent with the longer-run objectives are presented in paragraphs (10) to

(14).

(7) The longer-run targets under alternative A are indexed by an

M1 annual growth rate of 7 per cent in each of the fourth and first quarters.

We would expect that there may be only a modest further rise in short-term

interest rates in the fourth quarter under this alternative. In the first

quarter, with the rate of increase in nominal GNP projected to continue strong

and with large contra-seasonal Treasury cash borrowing anticipated, short-term

rates seem likely to rise more rapidly. The timing of interest rate movements

cannot, of course, be predicted with any certainty. It is always possible,

for example, that sizable foreign central bank transactions may affect the bill

market. Also, interest rates could rise substantially late this year as the

market anticipated heavy Treasury first quarter credit demands. On balance, one

might anticipate a 3-month Treasury bill rate rising to a 5-1/2--5-3/4 per cent

area by the end of the first quarter.

(8) Under alternatives B and C (indexed by 6 per cent and 5 per

cent annual rates of growth in M1, respectively) the staff would expect upward

pressure on short-term interest rates to emerge sooner and to carry rates to

higher levels than under alternative A. It is likely that Treasury bill rates

by some time in early 1973 would move above ceiling rates on consumer-type

time deposits (for which the highest rate is 5-3/4 per cent on 2-year and over

maturities), thus raising the odds on a substantial slowing in time deposit

inflows to banks by late in the first quarter. As a result, M2 growth,

particularly under alternative C, is targeted to slow more than M1 growth.

Net inflows to nonbank savings institutions, whose ceiling rates on time

certificates are 1/4 percentage point higher than banks, would also come

under pressure, though not importantly perhaps until the second quarter.

(9) In long-term markets, credit demand pressures from private

sectors are expected to remain moderate into the winter. However, given its

large cash needs, the Treasury seems likely to tap all possible sources,

including the bond market, to satisfy its financing requirements. In general,

though, long-term markets are most vulnerable to upward rate pressures from

the supply of funds side. The institutional supply of funds would likely be

constrained under alternative C, and to a smaller degree under B. And as

interest rates began to rise, there might be some temporary investor withdrawal

from long-term commitments of funds.

(10) Suggested short-run operating targets for the two month

October-November period are shown below for the various alternatives

described above:



Alt. A Alt. B Alt. C

Nonborrowed RPD 8--12 5-1/2--9-1/2 3-1/2--7-1/2

RPD 8-1/2--12-1/2 7-1/2--11-1/2 6--10

M1 6-1/2--7-1/2 5-1/2--6-1/2 4-1/2--5-1/2

M2  8--9 7--8 6-1/2--7-1/2

Federal funds rate 4-1/2--5-1/2 4-3/4--6 5--6-1/2

Borrowings 350--600 400--700 450--800

(11) The suggested operating targets indicate ranges for the

two month October-November period for the average growth rates of reserves,

for average growth rates for money supply as variously measured, and for

money market conditions as represented by the Federal funds rate. The mid-

points of the RPD ranges are thought to be consistent with the mid-points

of M1 and M2 growth rates for each of the alternatives. All of the Federal

funds rate ranges encompass current money market conditions, with the range

being wide enough to make it reasonably probable that aggregate objectives

under the various alternatives would be attained. Under alternative A, the

Federal funds rate range centers on recently prevailing conditions, and the

staff would expect that realization of the targeted growth rates in the aggre-

gates would produce little movement in the average funds rate. Under

alternative B, the funds rate range is skewed above prevailing rate levels,

indicating our expectations that restraining monetary growth to the rates

targeted would induce a rise in the funds rate. Under alternative C, the

range is skewed even more in an upward direction.



-8-

(12) While the Committee could direct the Account Manager to utilize

the operating targets shown above in any one of several ways, it may wish to

consider the following approach which is similar to the procedure followed by

the Committee in recent meetings. Under the proposed approach if RPD appears

to be moving toward the high end of the indicated range, for example, the Desk

would become somewhat more grudging in supplying nonborrowed reserves and

still more grudging if RPD seemed to be exceeding the range--but not to the

extent of forcing the funds rate above whatever upper limit the Committee might

specify. But in judging whether to take reserve action that tightens (or

eases) the money market, the Desk would be guided also by developments in the

monetary aggregates. For instance, if the monetary aggregates appear to be

remaining within the Committee's targeted range, the Manager would not have to

take any reserve action that tightens or eases the money market, even though

RPD is running high or low in its range. (Under such circumstances, it would

be presumed that unanticipated changes in the multiplier relationship between

reserves and monetary aggregates had occurred.) If, on the other hand,

monetary aggregates should move outside the Committee's targeted range, the

Desk would modify reserve-supplying operations in the appropriate direction,

subject to the federal funds rate constraint. The funds rate ranges shown

in paragraph (10)can, of course, be modified by the Committee on policy

grounds, depending upon how much emphasis it wants to place on limiting

possible variations in interest rates, the degree to which it wishes to stress

growth rates for the aggregates, and the extent to which it wants to take

account of special circumstances of the moment such as "even keel".



-9-

(13) In the interval between now and the next meeting, the

3-month Treasury bill rate may drift up, assuming a Federal funds rate

around prevailing levels. The Treasury may again add about $200 million per

week to its weekly bill auctions beginning in November. In addition, it

appears now that the Treasury, because of a tight cash position, will have

to lower its cash balance at the Fed in the first half of November, forcing

the System to undertake offsetting operations. Given the improved technical

position of the market, however, we would not expect sizable upward rate

pressures in the near-term--for example, the 3-month bill rate is not likely

to move much above 5 per cent--unless the funds rate were to move up

appreciably. Similarly, near-term pressures in long-term markets would

likely be quite modest, given the moderation of private credit demands, if

prevailing money market conditions are maintained.

(14) The recent Treasury cash offering and the forthcoming

financing to be announced on October 25 would, however, augment the

sensitivity of long- and short-term credit markets to a persistent firming

of money market conditions. In addition to refinancing a small amount of

securities maturing in mid-November, the forthcoming Treasury operation

may also raise new cash, perhaps about $2 billion.



-10-

Proposed directives

(15) Presented below are three alternative formulations for the

operational paragraph of the directive, which might be taken to correspond

to the similarly lettered policy alternatives discussed in the preceding

section:

Alternative A

"To implement this policy, while taking [DEL: special] account of

the effects of possible bank regulatory changes, TREASURY FINANCING

OPERATIONS, AND developments in credit markets, [DEL: and international

developments,] the Committee seeks to achieve bank reserve and money

market conditions that will support SOMEWHAT more moderate growth

in monetary aggregates over the months ahead THAN RECORDED IN THE

THIRD QUARTER."

Alternative B

"To implement this policy, while taking [DEL: special] account of

the effects of possible bank regulatory changes, TREASURY FINANCING

OPERATIONS, AND developments in credit markets, [DEL: and international

developments,] the Committee seeks to achieve bank reserve and money

market conditions that will support more moderate growth in monetary

aggregates over the months ahead THAN RECORDED IN THE THIRD QUARTER."



-11-

Alternative C

"To implement this policy, while taking [DEL: special] account of

the effects of possible bank regulatory changes, TREASURY FINANCING

OPERATIONS, AND developments in credit markets, [DEL: and international

developments,] the Committee seeks to achieve bank reserve and money

market conditions that will support [DEL: more] moderate growth in monetary

aggregates over the months ahead."

(16) In all three alternatives, it is proposed to retain the

references to possible bank regulatory changes and credit market developments;

to add a reference to Treasury financing, particularly because of the November

refinancing to be announced in late October; and to delete the reference to

international developments, in view of the recent strength of the dollar.

Also, it is proposed to delete the word "special" in the phrase "while

taking special account. . . ." because of the recently improved technical

condition of credit markets.

(17) In alternatives A and B, which call, respectively, for

"somewhat more" and "more" moderate growth in monetary aggregates over the

months ahead, it is proposed to add the phrase "than recorded in the third

quarter." This addition is proposed in the interest of clarity, since the

long-run monetary growth rates specified under these alternatives, while

below the third-quarter rates, are equal to or above those recorded in

August and September.
