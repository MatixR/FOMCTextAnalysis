STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL (FR) CLASS II FOMC

MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

PREPARED FOR THE FEDERAL OPEN MARKET COMMITTEE

BY THE STAFF OF THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM



Strictly Confidential (F.R.) March 17, 2000
Class I -- FOMC

MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Recent Developments

(1) Over the intermeeting period, private nominal interest rates and the foreign

exchange value of the dollar showed small mixed changes on balance, but most major equity

price indexes moved appreciably higher. The announcement of the Committee's decision to

raise the intended level of the federal funds rate 1/4 percentage point, to 5.75 percent, and of

its view that the risks are weighted toward heightened inflation pressures was widely

anticipated and had little impact on market yields.1 Market rates subsequently moved up in

response to generally strong incoming economic data and to the Chairman's Humphrey-

Hawkins testimony. Since then, however, rates on private intermediate-maturity instruments

have more than rolled back those increases. Perhaps taking their cue from the testimony,

market participants seemed particularly sensitive to the gyrations of equity prices, and many

of the declines in market yields occurred on days of substantial setbacks in the Dow Jones

Industrial Average. The drop in money market futures rates over the intermeeting period

would seem to suggest that those setbacks, along with subdued readings on inflation,

prompted reductions in expectations of Federal Reserve policy tightening. Still, those futures

rates continue to indicate that market participants see a 1/4 percentage point tightening at

1. The federal funds rate averaged 5.74 percent over the intermeeting period. In its open
market operations over this period, the Desk employed long-term RPs in lieu of coupon
passes in order to avoid exacerbating liquidity strains in the Treasury market. The Desk
arranged a $9 billion ninety-day transaction and a $6 billion sixty-day transaction. Treasury
securities collateralized $4 billion of this borrowing, while agency securities and mortgage-
backed securities accounted equally for the remainder.

this meeting as virtually certain, and two more moves of this size by September almost as

assured. However, participants appear to have reduced the odds of a move to a 6-3/4

percent federal funds rate by year-end. Underlying rate pressures also may have been

reduced somewhat by continued signs of improvement on the fiscal front. Even so, rates on

longer maturity and lower quality corporate bonds were up a bit over the intermeeting

period, while mortgage rates were unchanged. By contrast, thirty-year Treasury yields have

fallen over 40 basis points on net, in part reflecting the sharp response of market participants

to comments by the Treasury that were interpreted as implying substantial reductions in

bond supply going forward (chart 1). In equity markets, the Wilshire 5000 has risen 6-1/2

percent on balance over the intermeeting period, but narrower segments have registered

unusually diverse movements: In volatile markets, the Nasdaq moved up another 18 percent,

while the DJIA declined 4 percent.

(2) The foreign exchange value of the dollar is little changed over the

intermeeting period against a basket of major currencies and a touch weaker against the

currencies of other important trading partners. Monetary authorities in most other

industrial countries raised interest rates about in line with the Federal Reserve. Still, the

dollar has gained almost 1/2 percent against the euro, 1-3/4 percent against the Canadian

dollar, 2-3/4 percent against the British pound, and 4 percent relative to the Australian

dollar, as investors apparently revised down their expectations of the extent of monetary

tightening in many of these countries. Consistent with these revisions to expectations,

longer-term yields on government bonds have fallen 20 to 45 basis points. The evidence on

the Japanese economy released over the intermeeting period was mixed and suggests, on

balance, that recovery has yet to gain a firm foothold in that country. Longer-term yields in

Japan drifted higher, equity prices stalled, and the yen appreciated about 1-1/2 percent

against the dollar. The strength of the yen prompted Japanese authorities to intervene,

purchasing dollars on two occasions and euros once, but those actions left no lasting

imprint on market prices. A brightening of prospects in Latin America--highlighted by

Moody's upgrade of Mexican foreign debt to investment grade--lent support to the

currencies of emerging markets. The dollar depreciated more than 2-3/4 percent against the

Mexican peso and 3-1/4 percent vis-a-vis the Brazilian real, and sovereign bond risk spreads

narrowed considerably further. Indeed, most Brady bond spreads have retreated to near

levels last seen around the time of Russia's default in August 1998. U.S. monetary

authorities did not intervene over the intermeeting period.

(3) Growth of the monetary aggregates decelerated in February, owing in part to

an unwinding of Y2K effects and the greater attractiveness of yields on credit market

instruments as a consequence of recent policy firmings (chart 2).2 In addition, surging prices

of technology-related equities may have encouraged shifts out of M2 into long-term mutual

2. The monetary base declined at a 38 percent annual rate in February as Y2K-related
holdings of currency retreated. By early March, the late 1999 run-up in the base associated
with the century date change had been reversed. From September 1999 through March
2000, which largely abstracts from Y2K effects, the base is expected to grow at an annualized
rate of 7-1/2 percent, in line with sweep-adjusted growth in recent years.

funds.3 M2 growth, at an annual rate of only 2-1/4 percent in February, was slower than

projected at the time of the Committee's last meeting. In contrast, growth of M3, at a 4-1/4

percent rate, was a good bit faster than forecast at that time. With private credit demands

quite brisk, bank credit growth was stronger than forecast and was largely funded by stepped

up issuance of liabilities in M3. Moreover, contrary to expectations, U.S. branches and

agencies of foreign banks failed to unwind the shift to U.S. funding evident in advance of the

century date change.

(4) Growth of nonfinancial debt appears to have been slowed in the early months

of the year by a resumption of large federal debt paydowns following the sharp build-up of

Treasury balances prior to year-end. State and local borrowing also has been restrained, as

high interest rates have cooled advance refunding activity, and borrowing for new capital has

moderated, for now at least, apparently in response to strong tax inflows. Growth of private

debt, by contrast, appears to have remained brisk of late and has kept the expansion of total

nonfinancial debt in the upper end of its range. Increases in consumer loans and residential

mortgage debt have stayed particularly strong, financing a robust pace of household

expenditures and a still-elevated level of home purchases. Strong corporate funding needs

have been met in both equity and debt markets. Indeed, gross equity issuance has been

heavy enough of late to offset retirements through mergers and buyback programs for the

first time in several years.

3. Net inflows to long-term mutual funds picked up appreciably in January and February,
particularly at equity funds emphasizing capital appreciation.

Policy Alternatives

(5) The staff has responded to indications of stronger-than-expected

consumption and investment demand as well as faster productivity growth by boosting its

projection of economic expansion for the first half of this year. However, with policy

assumed to firm a bit more this year than in the January Greenbook, and private long-term

rates rising to a somewhat higher level than foreseen in January, growth over the rest of the

forecast period is projected to be a touch lower. As a consequence, resource utilization in

the forecast is little changed from January, with the unemployment rate staying around 4

percent this year and edging up in 2001. A higher path for oil prices leads to an appreciable

upward revision in total consumer inflation projected this year, but only to a small mark up

of core consumer inflation over the two years. Core measures are still seen to be on an

upward track, owing to the effects of the tight labor market and the recent rebound in energy

and import prices, and they would seem poised to move higher in 2002. Compared with the

central tendency of Committee members' forecasts last month, the staff sees appreciably

faster growth of real GDP in 2000, though with the same unemployment rate at year-end as

the Committee, and a bigger pickup in overall PCE inflation, with the latter presumably

mostly reflecting higher oil prices.

(6) While the recent increases in oil prices do not leave much of a lasting imprint

on the staff outlook, should those prices persist near current levels--rather than decline

substantially as in the staff forecast--their possible effects would presumably become more

important in monetary policy deliberations. Sustained higher energy prices would tend to



-7-

boost inflation, not only through their direct near-term contribution to overall price indexes

but also through secondary ripple effects on core price indexes over time. However, the rise

in oil prices also would tend to damp aggregate demand as higher expenditures on imported

energy cut into domestic spending and foreign oil exporters recycle only part of their

additional receipts from the United States as purchases of U.S.-produced goods and services.

Consequently, in the context of Taylor-type monetary policy responses that give weight to

deviations of both output and inflation from long-term levels, the direction of the effect on

the desired real federal funds rate depends on the relative sizes of the changes in the two

gaps. In FRB/US simulations, the core inflation rate rises by more in percentage point terms

than the output gap declines if the path of real interest rates is kept unchanged.4 Under the

standard specification of the Taylor rule, this outcome would call for an increase in the real

federal funds rate. However, the size of the effects on inflation and output from even a

sustained higher level of oil prices are small, in part because oil now has a relatively modest

weight in the economy. Thus, the path of the real funds rate may not need to be much

different from the one the Committee would otherwise have followed. There are substantial

risks on either side of this result, however. On the one hand, real rates would need to be

4. In the staff model, however, an exception to this outcome occurs if longer-term
inflation expectations are essentially unaffected by the rise in oil prices, perhaps because they
are anchored by the credibility of the central bank's inflation objective. In that case, the rise
in the output gap is sufficient eventually to restrain inflation at unchanged real interest rates.
These results are also sensitive to the specification of foreign monetary policy responses to
higher oil prices. In the simulations underlying this discussion, foreign monetary authorities
follow a Taylor rule and the rise in real interest rates abroad puts downward pressure on the
dollar, cushioning the decline in U.S. output and increasing the pressure on domestic
inflation.



-8-

lowered if the surge in oil prices persists and erodes consumer and business confidence and

equity values, thereby exerting a more substantial negative effect on output than in the

simulations. On the other hand, higher real rates would be indicated should elevated oil

prices trigger a more appreciable rise in inflation expectations than in the simulations--a

possibility that might be thought more likely given that prices and unit labor costs already

come under pressure from tight labor markets in the staff forecast. Even if higher energy

prices do not add appreciably to long-term inflation expectations, short-term expectations

could well be increased by the higher realized overall inflation. If they are, holding the real

funds rate along a given path would require a higher nominal federal funds rate than

otherwise. Indeed, this was an important reason for the upward adjustment in the federal

funds rate path assumed in the Greenbook.

(7) The Committee may agree that the risks to the inflation outlook are on the

upside, but still wish to stand pat on policy for the time being, as in alternative B. Such a

choice could allow it to better judge whether more near-term tightening is needed or whether

the restraining effects on aggregate demand of previous tightening actions will prove to be

sufficient to bring growth in aggregate demand into reasonable balance with that of potential

supply. Indeed, the amount of slowing required in the growth of output may not be large if

more of the extraordinary growth of productivity over the last few quarters persists than has

been allowed for in the staff forecast--the very rapid growth of activity since mid-year

produced only small declines in the unemployment rate and in the pool of available labor.

Even if the growth of aggregate demand fails to come into balance with that of potential



-9-

supply quickly enough to avoid some intensification of strains on resources, the costs of

waiting in terms of faster price increases still might be minimal if structural productivity

continues to accelerate over the next couple of years. The acceleration of structural

productivity would hold down unit labor costs and, with profits running high, competition

would continue to contain business "pricing power." Thus, inflation would remain damped

for some time even with a constant nominal federal funds rate, although, to be sure, a higher

real funds rate would ultimately be required to align market interest rates with improved

returns on capital investments and greater wealth-induced consumption. In effect, the

Committee would be allowing the economy to realize the gains from the extra productivity

growth mainly in temporarily higher output rather than lower inflation.

(8) Keeping the federal funds rate unchanged at 5-3/4 percent would come as a

considerable surprise to financial markets, in that both incoming data and the statements of

the Federal Reserve have reinforced market participants' previous expectation that the

Committee would firm by 1/4 percentage point at this meeting. The resulting rally in bond

and stock markets and decline in the exchange rate would likely be tempered by retention of

language in the press release pointing to the risk of higher inflation. Although keeping

policy unchanged would prompt some confusion about the Committee's intentions and its

strategy, it is likely that market participants would see the next tightening action as merely

postponed, although they also would tend to trim their expectations of the cumulative

amount of tightening in prospect.



-10-

(9) Any unwinding of the current degree of restraint in financial markets, which

incorporates 25 basis points of tightening at this meeting, might be viewed by the

Committee as exacerbating the risk of economic overheating. With little evidence in hand

that spending is moderating appreciably, aggregate demand still seems to be expanding more

rapidly than even optimistic estimates of the growth of potential aggregate supply. In these

circumstances, the Committee's assessment of the inflation risks may be such that it favors

an immediate tightening of policy, perhaps by raising the federal funds rate another 1/4

percentage point as in alternative C. The Committee might believe it especially important

to provide continuing evidence of its vigilance as the effect on inflation of the recent surge

in oil prices plays out in coming months. Even if the Committee anticipates that

considerably more policy firming will be needed eventually to contain inflation pressures, it

may still favor the gradual approach embodied in alternative C in light of the considerable

uncertainty about aggregate supply and about the effect of the substantial run-up in short-

and long-term interest rates in recent quarters on aggregate demand. Such gradualism also

may hold appeal because financial markets have been edgy and are potentially vulnerable to

an unexpectedly large policy move.

(10) If the Committee were to choose alternative C, it presumably would also want

to convey to market participants that the balance of risks remains tilted toward inflation.

Such a combination, because it is widely expected, would tend to have little effect on fixed-

income yields and the exchange value of the dollar. Very broad measures of equity prices

over the intermeeting period would be expected to fluctuate near recent levels.



-11 -

Preannouncements and announcements of corporate earnings will pick up steam in the

weeks ahead, likely keeping volatility in equity markets elevated, which could possibly feed

back on interest rates in a manner similar to recent experience.

(11) The Committee may believe that financial markets have underestimated the

full extent of the policy firming required to keep inflation from picking up. Alternative D

would raise the federal funds rate 50 basis points. Such an action, particularly if

accompanied by an announcement conveying the Committee's view that the balance of risks

remains tilted toward inflation, would prompt a substantial realignment of financial prices

that might be seen by the Committee as more likely to be consistent with a sustainable

trajectory of economic activity. Market participants probably would expect more cumulative

policy firming, boosting interest rates across the maturity spectrum, especially at the front

end of the yield curve. Such prospects for tighter monetary policy and greater restraint on

spending should raise credit risk premiums on corporate bonds and weaken equity prices.

The argument for a substantial tightening in financial conditions would have particular force

if the Committee, like the staff, viewed labor utilization rates as too high to be sustained.

Indeed, in the staff forecast, the assumption of even more tightening than currently evident

in futures rates is still inadequate to keep core inflation from trending higher. Moreover, a

steeper path for the real funds rate might be seen as necessary to counter a risk of a

ratcheting up of longer-term inflation expectations owing to the recent surge in oil prices.

Even if the Committee only wanted to ensure that it was preserving the upward path for the

real federal funds rate that a number of Committee members seemed to have been



-12-

contemplating in February, the possible effects of the further jump in oil prices on short-

term inflation expectations suggest that something more than a 1/4 percentage point rise in

the nominal rate might be needed.

(12) The monetary aggregates are projected to accelerate a little from their growth

rates early this year, when they were depressed by the unwinding of Y2K effects.

Nonetheless, expansion of the aggregates, particularly M2, should be restrained by the

influence of earlier policy tightenings, even under the unchanged federal funds rate of

alternative B. Growth rates of M2 in coming months are likely to be erratic, owing to the

effects of the shifting timing of tax refunds and the likely surge in payments, but on average

this aggregate is projected to expand at a rate of 6-1/4 percent over the February-to-June

period under alternative B. With nominal GDP expanding faster than M2, M2 velocity

would increase at a 1-3/4 percent pace in both the first and the second quarters. By June,

M2 would be 5-1/2 percent at an annual rate above its fourth-quarter 1999 base, somewhat

above the upper end of its annual range. Buoyed by rapid bank credit growth, expansion of

M3 is projected at an 8 percent rate over the February-to-June period, keeping this aggregate

well above the upper end of its annual range. Indeed, by June, M3 would be 8 percent at an

annual rate above its fourth-quarter base, compared with the 6 percent upper end of its

range.

(13) Meanwhile, domestic nonfinancial debt is projected to expand at a 5 percent

annual rate over the January-to-June interval, down from the 6 percent pace around year-

end. Paydowns of federal debt are expected to increase, aided by projected large individual



-13-

tax receipts in April. Some cooling off in growth of consumer outlays is projected to

restrain expansion in household debt, though the advance of such debt will continue to

outpace that of disposable personal income. With the financing gap remaining elevated,

growth in business debt is expected to persist at a fairly brisk pace even though strong

issuance of equity by firms will be acting to hold down business borrowing. Under the

conditions embodied in the staff forecast, lenders and investors are likely to be a little more

cautious in providing credit but not enough to make much of a dent in spending or

borrowing. By June, total domestic nonfinancial debt would stand just above the midpoint

of its 3 to 7 percent annual range.

Directive and Balance of Risks Language

(14) Presented below for the members' consideration is draft wording relating to

(1) the new abbreviated directive and (2) the "balance of risks" sentence to be included in

the press release issued after the meeting (not part of the directive).

(1) Directive Wording

The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that

will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output. To further its

long-run objectives, the Committee in the immediate future seeks conditions in

reserve markets consistent with MAINTAINING/increasing/DECREASING the

federal funds rate AT/to an average of around ___ [DEL: 5-3/4] percent.

(2) "Balance of Risks" Sentence

Against the background of its long-run goals of price stability and sustainable

economic growth and of the information currently available, the Committee believes

that the risks are [balanced with respect to prospects for both goals] [weighted

mainly toward conditions that may generate heightened inflation pressures]

[weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate economic weakness] in the

foreseeable future.
