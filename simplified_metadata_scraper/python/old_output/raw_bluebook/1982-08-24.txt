Prefatory Note 

 
 

The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain. 
 

Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a redaction process that removed information obtained on a 
confidential basis.  All redacted passages are exempt from disclosure under applicable 
provisions of the Freedom of Information Act.    

 

                                                 
1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked 
and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not 
reliably recognized by the OCR process and were not checked or corrected by staff.

MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Recent developments

(1) M1 was about unchanged in July. While data thus far available

for the first half of August suggest a strengthening, the aggregate has been

running below the Committee's 5 percent annual rate growth objective for

the June to September period. Relative to the expectations built into

the intermeeting path for M1, the shortfall in growth has been in currency

and demand deposits. NOW accounts through the first half of August have

increased on balance by somewhat more than expected, with most of the

growth taking place in late July and the first half of August.

(2) M2 growth in July--at 9.4 percent--was consistent with

the targeted path for the June-to-September period as stronger growth in

its nontransaction component offset the weakness in M1. In the first half

of August, however, M2 strengthened and moved above the Committee's near-

term objective, reflecting the pickup in M1 growth and a further acceleration

in the nontransaction component of M2. Money funds and small time deposits

have been the primary sources of strength in M2 in July and early August.

Savings deposits, in contrast, have declined sharply, after growing moderately

over the first half of the year. The strengthening of M2, and the recent

pick-up of M1 paced by NOW accounts, raises the possibility that somewhat

more of the tax cut is being saved than earlier anticipated, or at least

saved in more liquid forms.

(3) M3 growth has accelerated markedly since the last Committee

meeting, reflecting more rapid expansion in both large CDs and institutional

money funds. Large CD issuance has been boosted in response to cost advan-

tages in the domestic market versus the Eurodollar market and, reportedly,

by a desire of some banks to build liquidity in an uncertain environment

by issuing longer-term CDs. The recent surge in institutional money fund

inflows has been prompted by attractive returns in comparison to faster

declining market rates.

(4) Bank credit grew at about a 6-1/2 percent annual rate in

July, somewhat faster than in June but still below the pace of the first

half as a whole. Business loan growth tapered off in July and large bank

figures suggest a further weakening in early August. Other forms of

short-term borrowing offset the weakness in business loans in July, as

loans booked at foreign branches of U.S. banks and commercial paper

issuance by nonfinancial corporations accelerated, but data for early

August suggest a slowing in these forms of short-term borrowing as well.

Corporate bond issuance in domestic markets strengthened moderately in

July and,impelled by the recent rally in debt markets, appears to be

strengthening further.

(5) After showing virtually no growth in June, nonborrowed re-

serves expanded at about a 20 percent annual rate through the first half

of August. A relatively substantial growth was implicit in the higher

targeted growth rate for money decided at the last Committee meeting and

the initial borrowing assumption of $800 million that was lower than the

actual June level. Nonborrowed reserves grew even more than the initial

path implied mainly because of adjustments to accommodate greater than

anticipated expansion of large time deposits as well as adjustments in



response to the considerable shortfall of M1 from the short-run money

target. 1/ Meanwhile, with actual borrowing at the discount window (other

than extended credit) declining to about $335 million in the first two

full statement weeks of August, total reserve growth from June through

the first half of August was at about a 7-1/2 percent annual rate.

(6) With bank reserve positions easing and the discount rate

reduced in three steps to 10-1/2 percent, the federal funds rate fell from

the 14-3/4 percent area in early July to around 10 percent on average in

the last full statement week; however, trading in very recent days has

been around 9 percent, perhaps in sympathetic reaction to the general

market ebullience. Since the July Committee meeting, other short-term

market rates have declined 4-1/2 to 6-1/2 percentage points. Even as

rates have declined, there has been a marked widening of quality spreads

on commercial paper and a more pronounced tiering in the CD and RP

markets, in the aftermath of the Penn Square failure, the recent bank-

ruptcy of Lombard-Wall, and rumors about bank problems with Mexican

loans.

(7) Bond rates declined about 1-3/4 percentage points on balance

over the intermeeting period. A substantial part of these declines occurred

in the unusually sharp bond market rally on August 17, when record price

increases were also established in the stock market, spurred in good part

by a greatly revised forecast of interest trends by prominent market

analysts. Interest rates on new conventional mortgages have as usual

lagged the decline in market rates, falling about 50 basis points since

1/ Reserve paths and intermeeting adjustments are shown in Appendix I.



the July meeting. With the federal deficit expanding, the Treasury has

stepped up its borrowing in the note sector, as well as in the bill

market; statutory authority to issue new bonds is included in the new tax

legislation just passed. Tax-exempt offerings have continued at about

the same rapid pace seen over the first half of the year.

(8) The weighted average value of the dollar fell in July,

rose again to a new peak in mid-August, and is now just below the high

level recorded at the last FOMC meeting. The net decline in U.S. short-

term interest rates over the intermeeting period greatly exceeded the

moderate rate declines in major foreign countries. Thus, the continued

strength of the dollar seems to reflect investors' preference for dollars

at a time of widespread political and financial strains.



Alternative near-term targets

(9) The upper panel of the following table presents alternative

targets for M1 and M2 for the third quarter. The middle panel indicates

the implied two-month July-to-September growth rates for each alternative,

and the last row suggests possible associated intermeeting ranges for the

federal funds rate. More detailed data for the alternatives are shown in

the table and charts on the next few pages, and the quarterly interest

rate path underlying the staff's GNP projection is contained in Appendix II.

September

M1 5 4
M2 10 9-1/2

Implied growth from
July to September

M1 7-3/4 6-1/4
M2 10-1/4 9-1/2

Federal funds rate range 7 to 12 8 to 13

(10) Alternative A represents the Committee's current third-

quarter M1 target of 5 percent, but with an upward revision of the M2 target

from 9 to 10 percent in reflection of the strength of this aggregate

currently. To attain the 5 percent target, M1 would have to accelerate to

a 7-3/4 percent annual rate of growth on average in August and September.

This is likely to be consistent with short-term rates over the intermeeting

period at around recent levels, or perhaps a little higher--with the funds

rate in the 9 to 9 1/2 percent area. Such growth in M1 would imply a rise

on a quarterly average basis of only about 2 percent at an annual rate,

as compared with the 7-1/2 percent annual rate of expansion in nominal

GNP projected for this quarter by the staff.

(11) Total reserves under alternative A would expand at about

a 4-3/4 percent annual rate over the balance of the quarter. This probably

would be associated with somewhat more rapid growth in nonborrowed than

in total reserves, assuming borrowing drops to around $250 million,

a nearly frictional level after taking account of seasonal borrowing.

For this level of borrowing to be consistent with no more than a modest

back-up in short-term rates may, however, require a drop in the discount

rate from the current 10-1/2 percent level.

(12) Persistence of short-term interest rates at around recent

lower levels would tend to be associated with growth in M2 and M3 at a

relatively rapid pace, largely in consequence of an exceptionally strong

August advance. A considerable slowing in growth rates is likely in

September as returns on money market fund shares move closer to alignment

with market rates, and perhaps as investors shift into stocks and bonds.

On September 1, the new 7-to-31 day consumer time deposit will become

available, but this is not expected to have a very significant effect on

the overall demand for M2.

(13) Under this alternative corporate bond rates might remain

around 14 percent or fall somewhat lower, depending in part on how large

a surge in corporate bond issuance develops. Most of the proceeds from

expansion in bond issues would be used to pay down bank loans and to redeem

commercial paper. The weakening of business loan demand and sustained



-11-

relatively low market rates would likely cause banks to cut the prime rate

to less than 13 percent over the next few weeks. The mortgage markets

would benefit from the decline in interest rates generally and from im-

proved prospects for thrift institution profitability. Mortgage rates are

unlikely to fall below the 15 percent level, however, so that the boost to

housing would be modest. Short-term U.S. interest rates at around recent

levels would give foreign authorities greater scope to ease their interest

rates further, which would probably forestall any appreciable weakening of

the dollar on exchange markets over the near-term.

(14) Alternative B, which calls for 4 percent growth in M1 over

the third quarter, likely would be consistent with a federal funds rate in

the vicinity of the current 10-1/2 percent discount rate. M1 would be

expected to grow at about a 6-1/4 percent annual rate on average in August

and September, with total reserves expanding at a 3-3/4 percent annual

rate over the balance of the quarter. Borrowing at the discount window

may be in the $350 to $400 million area.

(15) The firming of the funds rate from very recent levels

contemplated in this alternative would seem to run counter to the expec-

tations of a good many market participants. As a result, it is quite

likely that short-term rates would back up, with the 3-month bill rate

moving back toward 9 percent. Bond yields would retrace some of their

recent declines, though any reaction in credit markets could be mild in

the context of M1 remaining below the 5-1/2 percent upper bound of the



-12-

Committee's 1982 target range (which is assumed in the path) and if incoming

economic data continue weak. Because money market fund yields would more

quickly come into alignment with market rates, M2 and especially M3 growth

would probably be a bit slower than under alternative A. The very recent

downward pressures on the dollar in exchange markets probably would abate,

and may be reversed.

(16) Given the staff's GNP projection, the outstanding debt of

domestic nonfinancial sectors is projected to expand at about an 8-1/2

percent annual rate over the third quarter, the same pace as in the first

half of the year, but down from the 9-1/2 to 9-3/4 percent increases of

1980 and 1981. Total funds raised would amount to about 12-1/2 percent

of the projected third quarter GNP, up from 12 percent on average in the

first half. This rise reflects a sharp increase from 3-1/2 to 5-1/4 per-

cent in the ratio of federal government borrowing to GNP, while private

credit demands abate. The strength of federal government borrowing,

reflecting in part a marked shift toward greater fiscal stimulus as

evidenced by a larger high employment deficit, is working to hold up in-

come and interest rates.

(17) In the fourth quarter of the year, interest rates may be

under upward pressure as compared with levels anticipated between now and

September in either alternative A or B. Nominal GNP growth is expected to

be maintained at close to the third-quarter rate in part because of lagged

effects of the recent tax cut. And in the degree that the quantity of

money demanded is also increased from the lagged effects of recent short-

term rate declines there will be a greater likelihood that a rebound in

short-term rates would result from efforts to constrain money growth to



-13-

the upper end of the longer-run M1 range, with the odds on a rebound

greater under alternative A than alternative B. To the extent that the

Committee is willing to tolerate growth for the year above the 5-1/2 per-

cent limit--say, at around 6 percent--the chances of a rate rebound would

be diminished. The table below shows fourth quarter M1 growth rates for

alternative 1982 M1 outcomes, given the two current short-term policy

alternatives. In any event growth in M2 and M3 for the year seems likely

to be fractionally above the Committee's ranges.

Directive language

Given below is a suggested operational paragraph for the

directive. The specifications adopted at the meeting on June 30 -

July 1 are shown in strike-through form. Deletion of the second

qualifying sentence is proposed since it no longer seems relevant.

However, the first qualifying sentence still appears to be germane,

particularly in light of the current strength of M2.

OPERATIONAL PARAGRAPH

In the short run, the Committee seeks behavior of reserve

aggregates consistent with growth of M1 and M2 from June to September

at annual rates of about [DEL:5] ____ percent and about 9 ____ percent

respectively. Somewhat more rapid growth would be acceptable depending

on evidence that economic and financial uncertainties are leading to

exceptional liquidity demands and changes in financial asset holdings.

[DEL: It was also noted that seasonal uncertainties, together with increased

social security payments and the initial impact of the tax cut on cash

balances, might lead toa temporary bulge in the monetary aggregates,

particularly-M1.] The Chairman may call for Committee consultation if

it appears to the Manager for Domestic Operations that pursuit of the

monetary objectives and related reserve paths during the period before

the next meeting is likely to be associated with a federal funds rate

persistently outside a range of [DEL: 10 to 15] ____ TO ____ percent.

NOTE: Government securities dealer cash positions consist of securities already delivered, commit-
ments to buy (sell) securities on an outright basis for immediate delivery (5 business days or less), and
certain "when-issued" securities for delayed delivery (more than 5 business days). Futures and forward
positions include all other commitments involving delayed delivery; futures contracts are arranged on
organized exchanges. Underwriting syndicate positions consists of issues in syndicate, excluding
trading positions.

Weekly data are daily averages for statement weeks, except for corporate and municipal issues in
syndicate, which are Friday figures. Monthly averages for excess reserves and borrowing are weighted
averages of statement week figures. Monthly data for dealer futures and forwards are end-of-month
figures for 1980.
