text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain. 
 

Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These

Recent developments

(1) The narrow monetary aggregates, M-1A and M-1B, expanded

in May-June at annual rates marginally above the minimum target growth

rates set by the Committee for the period. Continued weakness in May

was offset by a considerable resurgence of growth in June. However, as

shown in the last two columns of the table below, in the first half of

the year both of these aggregates have grown at rates significantly below

the lower end of the Committee's longer-run ranges for the QIV '79 to

QIV '80 period. The Committee's longer-run targets imply that ATS/NOW

accounts would add about percentage point to M-1B growth relative to M-1A;

so far in 1980 relatively faster growth of interest-bearing transactions

accounts has added close to 1½ percentage points to M-1B.

(2) M-2 increased in May and accelerated sharply in June,

expanding well above the Committee's minimum target rate for the two

month period. With market interest rates declining and the public

apparently placing a greater premium on liquidity, in the face of

uncertainty about the economic outlook, MMMFs resumed their strong growth

and savings deposit registered a reduced outflow in May and a significant

inflow in June for the first time in almost a year. Inflows of small-

denomination time deposits weakened over the two months as a large part

of the sharply stronger growth in the 30-month variable-ceiling certifi-

cate was offset by the first net decline in MMCs since their introduction

in mid-1978. M-3 expanded less rapidly than M-2, as banks continued

to reduce their reliance on managed liabilities, partly because of

continued weakness in bank loan demand. Over the first half of the year,

M-2 and M-3 expanded at just above the lower bound of the Committee's

longer-run ranges, but bank credit grew at a rate considerably below

the Committee's targets for the year.

(3) The Desk has fostered more ample availability of non-

borrowed reserves to member banks since the Committee meeting in May to

encourage and support growth of the monetary aggregates. Adjustment

borrowing at Federal Reserve Banks was reduced to less than $100 million

throughout most of June. Total reserves declined slightly, however,

over the past two months, largely because required reserves were reduced

by the substantial drop in recent weeks of large time deposits of



member banks and by deposit shifts that reduced the average required

reserve ratio for other time deposits and demand deposits.1/

(4) Conditions in the money market continued to ease following

the May Committee meeting, as the Desk moved toward more plentiful provi-

sion of nonborrowed reserves. Around the time of the meeting, the federal

funds rate was generally about 11 percent, but subsequently funds began

trading at substantially lower levels. In the two weeks ending June 25

the federal funds rate averaged around 9 percent, but most recently the

funds rate has averaged 9¼ to 9½ percent. The discount rate was lowered

in two steps from 13 to 11 percent over the intermeeting period in

recognition of the easing in money markets.

1/ This blue book does not contain an appendix comparing reserve paths
set following the May FOMC meeting and actual results. At that time
the Committee indicated that an overshoot of money growth above its
minimum targets should be accommodated by a commensurate increase
in reserve paths. Thus, when projected reserves became stronger
than the original path, as happened in the intermeeting period, the
projections of reserves became the targets. For instance, the
original target for total reserves for the last three weeks of the
intermeeting period was $43,377 million (after adjustment for changes
in the multiplier), whereas actual total reserves for the period were
$43,293 million. For the first four weeks of the intermeeting period,
actual reserves at $43,549 million were just about equal to the
original target of $43,554 million.

(5) The decline in other short-term market rates that began in

late March continued following the May Committee meeting, and by mid-June

these rates had declined another 1½ to 2 percentage points. However,

more recently private yields and Treasury bill rates have backed up sub-

stantially. Market participants reportedly have become more cautious in

their expectations for further easing by the Federal Reserve, particularly

as stronger growth of the monetary aggregates became evident in the

published weekly figures. On balance, bill rates and private short-term

rates are about ½ to 1 percentage point lower than their levels at the

time of the May Committee meeting. Over the intermeeting period, the

bank prime rate was lowered 4½ to 5 percentage points to 11½ and 12 per-

cent, but it still remains far out of line with borrowing costs in the

money market for prime-rated firms.

(6) The rally in long-term debt markets also lost much of its

force in recent weeks. Treasury bond yields had declined a further one

percentage point by mid-June before backing up 30 to 40 basis points more

recently. The corporate bond market, digesting a record volume of issues

brought to market as yields fell, experienced a similar pattern of rate

movements as market sentiment changed. With their deposit outlook

stronger and other long-term rates declining, the average commitment rate

on mortgages at S&Ls declined from over 14 percent in late May to 12-3/8

percent most recently.

(7) In foreign exchange markets, the dollar is down 3 percent

on a weighted average basis from its level at the time of the last

Committee meeting. Most of this decline occurred shortly after the May

meeting, as U.S. interest rates fell further and the credit control program



-5-

was eased. When U.S. interest rates turned steady to firmer in the

following weeks, the dollar steadied and traded in generally very quiet

markets. In the intermeeting period, the United States purchased $1 1/2

billion to support the dollar mainly with DM,

Longer-run targets and strategy

(9) At this meeting the Committee will be reconsidering its

growth ranges for the monetary aggregates for 1980 and coming to a

preliminary view about ranges for 1981, as is required under the

Humphrey-Hawkins Act. As noted in paragraphs 1 and 2 of the preceding

section, thus far this year expansion in narrow money measures has been

well below the lower limit of the growth ranges for the QIV '79 to

QIV '80 period established in February, while growth in broader measures

has been just above the bottoms of their ranges. Partly for this reason,

the staff has assumed that the practical alternatives before the Committee

are retention of the present ranges or some lowering of them. In addition,

announcement of a higher range may well have an adverse impact on inflationary

expectations, since interest rates have declined so sharply over the past

few months and since a higher range would appear inconsistent with an

intention gradually to curtail money growth.

(10) Given the behavior of monetary aggregates in the first

half of 1980, the need for adjustment in the present longer-run ranges

depends, among other things, on an assessment of factors affecting the public's

demand for narrow money and the relationship between the narrow and broader

money measures. M-1 growth in the second quarter of 1980 was much slower

than would have been predicted by either our quarterly or monthly econo-

metric models, given actual income growth and interest rates. This raises

the question of whether there has been once again a downward shift in the

level of the money demand function, perhaps as a response to the unusually

high level of interest rates in the first quarter, or whether the public will



find that it is short of cash relative to nominal income and will seek to

rebuild balances. The staff has assumed that the public will

make some effort to enlarge depleted cash balances in the second half of

the year, partly because we believe that some of the decline in cash

balances may have been a transitory result of the large short-term debt

repayments that followed the March credit control program. If that

assumption proves to be correct, the demand for money in the second half

of the year should be stronger than in the first half, even with the

projected weakness in nominal GNP. Thus, the considerable acceleration

in growth of narrow money in the second half of the year needed to bring

M-1A to the lower limit of, or even within, its present range may well

be feasible. However, we would expect M-1B to grow at a still stronger

pace over the year in view of the recent evidence that the public has

shown a greater preference for interest-bearing transactions accounts

over demand deposits than the staff earlier anticipated. We would now

project M-1B to grow about 1-1/4 percentage points faster for the year

than M-IA, rather than the 1/2 percentage point projected in February.

(11) As noted above, growth in the broader aggregates has been

running strong relative to both M-1A and M-1B. Not only have money market

funds again been growing rapidly, but also the contraction in savings

deposits has been reversed. Furthermore, the recent upward adjustment in

ceiling rates on variable ceiling certificates has strengthened the attrac-

tiveness of these instruments. While a slowing in growth of money market

fund shares from the recent exceptionally rapid pace should be expected,

it still appears probable that growth in the nontransactions interest-



-9-

bearing component of M-2 in the second half of the year will be relatively

rapid. Thus, in the staff's judgment it seems likely that M-2 will tend

to grow more rapidly relative to M-1A than had been assumed when the

longer-run ranges were origially set in February. On the other hand,

M-3 growth may be a bit weaker as modest demands for bank loans reduce

banks' need to issue large CDs.

(12) The table below shows, for Committee consideration,

two alternative sets of longer-run ranges for 1980. Alternative I is the

current longer-run ranges. But to take account of changing relationships

among M-1A and M-1B, we have assumed that an unchanged objective for

the narrow money aggregates over the year 1980 would mean growth in M-1A

at about a 4-1/2 percent rate from QIV '79 to QIV '80--which would be a

little below the midpoint of the Committee's present range--and growth in

M-1B at around 5-3/4 percent--somewhat above the midpoint of its current

range. Consistent growth in M-2 appears likely to be somewhat above, and

expansion of M-3 somewhat below, the midpoints of their ranges; bank

credit growth is likely to be below the lower end of its present

6 to 9 percent range. Alternative II reflects a lowering of the ranges

for M-1A and M-1B, as well as bank credit, but retains the present ranges

for M-2 and M-3 in view of their performance thus far this year.

M-2 6 to 9 6 to 9

M-3 6½ to 9½ 6½ to 9½

Bank Credit 6 to 9 4½ to 7½

(13) To assist the Committee in evaluating the proposed ranges

for 1980 and in forming a preliminary view about monetary growth targets

in 1981, specific alternative assumptions for money growth in 1980 and

the subsequent two years, with their implications for economic activity,

prices, and interest rates, are presented in the table on page 11.

Strategy 1 in that table continues growth in narrow money measures at the

same rate in 1981 and 1982, as in 1980-that is, at a rate of about 4½ per-

cent for M-1A and 5-3/4 percent for M-1B. Of course, the ranges for M-1A

and M-1B may have to be adjusted next year for the introduction of

nationwide NOW accounts.1/ In addition, the staff's analysis suggests

that, even with the same effective M-1A growth as in 1980, M-2 and M-3 may

grow near the upper limits of the current year's ranges, or possibly

above them, as income flows and credit demands strengthen. To provide

the Committee with a basis for assessing a monetary policy that calls for

1/ The Monetary Control Act of 1980 authorizes nationwide NOW accounts
effective at the beginning of 1981. Shifts out of demand deposits
will lower measured M-1A growth, and shifts out of savings or other
deposits will strengthen measured M-1B growth while leaving M-2 and
M-3 essentially unchanged. Preliminary estimates of quantitative
effects on the aggregates are contained in Appendix I. Such shifts
are estimated to lower measured M-1A growth by 1 to 5 percentage
points in 1981 and to raise measured M-1B growth by ½ to 2½ percentage
points. However, for clarity in presentation, monetary policy assump-
tions in the Bluebook are based on monetary growth rates that abstract
from the impact of deposit shifts because of nationwide NOW accounts.

Strategy 3 represents 3-1/27. M-1A growth in each year. In each of
these three' strategies a tax cut of $25-to $30 billion is assumed to
occur in early-1981. Strategy 4 represents strategy 1 without such a
tax cut.



-12-

a gradual reduction in money growth rates, strategy 2 employs the

monetary assumptions of the first strategy for 1980, but then assumes

that growth in M-1A is reduced to 4 percent in 1981 and 3½ percent in

1982. Strategy 3 examines the implications of lowering growth in M-1A

to 3½ percent in 1980 and maintaining that rate over the next two years.

All these strategies assume a tax cut of $25 to $30 billion that takes

effect in early 1981. Strategy 4 excludes a tax cut and assumes money

growth as in strategy 1.

(14) Strategy 1--which is consistent with the basic staff

green'book projection--suggests a quite modest economic recovery beginning

next year and continuing into 1982. The rate of price increase decelerates

next year, and more markedly in 1982, while the unemployment rate edges

down from a high of near 9 percent at the end of 1980 to 8.5 percent two

years later. Policy strategies 2 and 3 imply a slower economic recovery,

and a slightly improved price performance. The deceleration in price

increases from these strategies becomes more evident after 1982 in view

of the rather long lags between money growth and prices that characterize

most econometric models, including the Board's quarterly model. Strategies

2 and 3 could, however, yield a more significant deceleration in price

increases earlier if expectations of participants in labor and product

markets have become more sensitized to the ultimate implications of

monetary restraint. It should be emphasized that implicit in all of these

projections is a large increase in the income velocity of M-A in 1981-

indeed, the largest annual rise since 1955 (in the case of strategies 1

through 3). This reflects our assumption that there will be continued

weakness in money demand relative to historical experience. Should this

assumption prove wrong, upward interest rate pressures may be stronger



-13-

than projected, serving to reduce nominal GNP growth below projections--

with some beneficial impact on prices but with probably the greatest

impact in the short-run on real activity.

Shorter-run targets

(15) Shown below, and depicted on the charts on the following

pages, are three alternative targets for the monetary aggregates over the

next several months, together with suggested federal funds rate ranges

for the intermeeting period. Growth rates shown are for the three-month

period from June to September. (Detailed data for these alternatives are

contained in the tables on pp. 14 and 15.)

(16) Alternatives A and B are consistent with longer-run

alternative I and are indexed by M-1A growth of 4½ percent from QIV '79

to QIV '80. Alternative A assumes that such a 4½ percent growth line is

reached relatively soon-by September; it therefore would also assume a

slowdown in M-1A growth to 4½ percent after September. Alternative B

targets a more gradual rebound in M-1A from the first half pace. It

assumes an 8¼ percent M-1A growth rate for June-September which, if

continued through December, will yield growth of 4½ percent over the year.

Alternative C is based on a slower long-run growth of M-A of 3 percent

from QIV '79 to QIV '80, which would be more consistent with longer-run

alternative II. Under alternative C, M-1A growth would be 6 percent from

June to September, and growth would need to continue at that rate in the

fourth quarter.

(17) Of the three short-run alternatives, alternative B would

probably have the least effect on market rates of interest over the forth-

coming intermeeting period. Even under this alternative, however, there

might be some further upward pressure on interest rates if the market

comes to feel that monetary policy will have to begin restraining money

growth or that fiscal policy will be turning more expansionary. In any

event, Treasury borrowing needs appear rather substantial over the months

ahead. Mortgage rates are likely to decline only a bit further, particu-

larly if short rates stabilize or back up some and thrift institutions

become concerned about the cost and magnitude of future deposit inflows.

Looking toward the fall of the year, it appears more likely that interest

rates would be under some upward pressure, as nominal GNP growth-and

accompanying money and credit demands-accelerates. If, however, the

public's transactions demand for money remains on the low side relative

to GNP, upward interest rate pressures could be quite minimal.

(18) The specifications of alternative B call for a considerable

slowing in M-2 from its May-June pace. MMMF growth, while remaining large,

is expected to slacken from its recent exceptionally rapid rate as previous

market yield declines are reflected in returns posted by the funds. Not

all of this slowdown is expected to be reflected in gains for the depository

institutions, although the 30-month small saver certificate is projected

to grow strongly. With domestic bank loan demands remaining weak, CD and

Eurodollar borrowing will continue to decline, and there will probably be



-17-

further advances from U.S. banks to their foreign branches in response

to relatively strong credit demands in Eurodollar markets.

(19) To achieve the growth in the aggregates specified under

alternative B, total reserves would have to expand at about an 8¼ percent

annual rate from June to September. Assuming a level of member bank

borrowings (excluding special borrowings) of about $50 to $100 million,

nonborrowed reserves would expand at about an 8 percent.annual rate.

(20) Alternative A, which is designed to hit the 4½ percent

path for M-1A by September, calls for a 10 percent rate of growth of

that aggregate from June to September, followed by a sharp slowing to 4½

percent in the September to December period. Reserve supplying operations

to achieve this target would call for growth in both total and nonborrowed

reserves at about a 10¼ percent annual rate in the next three months. It is

anticipated that money market rates would decline under this alternative

over the next few weeks, with the federal funds rate moving towards the 7

percent lower end of its proposed range and the 3-month bill rate moving

back into the 6 to 7 percent range. Such a decline in rates would bring

increased pressure on banks and thrift institutions to cut their lending

rates and would very likely cause a further erosion in the exchange value

of the dollar unless accompanied by drops in interest rates abroad. A

significant decline in short rates is likely to lead to some sympathetic

response in capital markets as well. However, the substantial volume of

oncoming issues from both the private and public sectors, as well as

investor concerns about inflation, would tend to limit declines in bond

yields. Staff projections suggest that short-term rates would have to

rise sharply by late summer or early fall to lower growth in the aggregates

if the midpoints of the longer-run targets for the year are to be achieved.



-18-

(21) Alternative C contemplates a 6 percent rate of growth

in M-1A from June to September and continuation of that rate for the

balance of the year in order to achieve a 3 percent growth in that

aggregate from QIV '79 to QIV '80. Total reserves would have to expand

at a 6¼ percent rate. Assuming member bank adjustment borrowings of about

$200 million during the forthcoming intermeeting period-given the current

discount rate--nonborrowed reserves would increase at a 5¼ percent rate.

These reserve specifications suggest that the funds rate would increase

to around the midpoint of the 9 to 14 percent range suggested for this

alternative. And an even higher funds rate would be likely to emerge by the

fourth quarter. The policy stance of alternative C would intensify the

recent weakness in money and capital markets, and interest rates would be

expected to rise throughout the maturity spectrum. These interest rate

developments would probably lead to a strengthening of the dollar in foreign

exchange markets.



-19-

Directive language

(22) Given below are suggested operational paragraphs for the

directive consistent with the form of recent directives, except for the

one adopted in May. The language calls for expansion of reserve aggregates

at a pace consistent with the desired rates of monetary growth over the

third quarter of 1980, provided that the federal funds rate on a weekly

average basis remains within a specified range. The range for the

federal funds rate adopted at the May meeting is shown in strike-through

form.

In the short run, the Committee seeks expansion of reserve

aggregates consistent with growth of M-1A[DEL: ,] and M-1B [DEL: , and M-2 at rates

high enough to promote achievement of the Committee's objectives for

monetary growth over the year] OVER THE THIRD QUARTER OF 1980 AT ANNUAL

RATES OF ____ PERCENT AND ____ PERCENT RESPECTIVELY, provided that in

the period before the next regular meeting the weekly average federal

funds rate remains within a range of [DEL: 8½ to 14] ____ TO ____ percent.

TEE COMMITTEE BELIEVES THAT, CONSISTENT WITH THIS SHORT-RUN POLICY,

M-2 SHOULD GROW AT AN ANNUAL RATE OF ABOUT ____ PERCENT OVER THE

THIRD QUARTER.

If it appears during the period before the next meeting that

the constraint on the federal funds rate is inconsistent with the

objective for the expansion of reserves, the Manager for Domestic

Operations is promptly to notify the Chairman who will then decide

whether the situation calls for supplementary instructions from the

Committee.



APPENDIX I

Estimated Impact of Nationwide NOW Accounts on the Monetary
Aggregates in 1981

The Depository Institutions Deregulation and Monetary Control Act

of 1980 extends NOW account authority nationwide to all depository institu-

tions except credit unions as of December 31, 1 9 8 0 .
1 / In addition, it makes

permanent the authority of insured commercial banks and mutual savings banks

to offer ATS accounts and of federally insured credit unions to offer share

drafts.2- As the public adjusts to these new circumstances, growth in M-1A

will be slowed by shifts from household demand deposits to other check-

able deposits (OCDs), while growth in M-1B will be enlarged by shifts

of funds from savings deposits and other liquid assets to OCDs. No

significant impact is expected on M-2 because it includes virtually all

of the funds likely to shift to NOW or ATS accounts.

Table I-1 shows the estimated distribution of household trans-

action deposits between demand deposits and OCDs. In the bottom line it

may be seen that roughly 30 percent of the estimated $19 billion of household

1/ NOWs have been authorized for all depository institutions except credit
unions in Massachusetts and New Hampshire since January 1, 1974, in the other
four New England states since February 27, 1976, in New York since November 10,
1978, and in New Jersey since December 28, 1979. NOWs may be held only by
individuals and nonprofit organizations.
2/ ATS were authorized nationwide at banks and thrifts on November 1, 1978
and share drafts first became available at federal credit unions on October 1,
1974. ATS may be held only by individuals, and share drafts only by credit
union members.
3/ Because ceiling interest rates on NOWs are likely to be below those on
other savings deposits, it may seem implausible that a substantial amount
of savings-type balances would shift to NOWs. However, in New England-
where the ceiling rates on savings deposits exceed those on NOWs (at com-
mercial banks these two ceiling rates were equal until July 1979)-more than
one-fifth of existing NOWs have no draft activity, suggesting that the funds
in such accounts were diverted from savings or other liquid assets. Shifts
are also likely to occur to meet the generally higher minimum balances re-
quirements associated with NOWs compared to demand deposits. Overall, staff
estimates indicate that roughly one-third of NOW balances were diverted from
other than demand deposit accounts.

-22-

transaction balances in the 8 northeastern states where NOW accounts

already exists have shifted to OCDs, while about 6-1/2 percent of the

$92 billion of household transaction accounts in the rest of the nation

have so shifted. It is the $86 billion of personal transaction deposits

still held in demand deposits in the 42 states not currently having NOWs

that are likely to be most affected by the new legislation.

Some inferences about the amount of demand deposits in the 42

states likely to be converted to NOWs may be drawn from the earlier

experience with NOW and ATS accounts. (Table I-2.) In Massachusetts and

New Hampshire, less than 10 percent of household demand deposits are esti-

mated to have shifted to NOWs by the end of the first year during which

all institutions in those states could offer these instruments; about

half of such shifts had occurred during the previous 1-1/2 years when

only state-chartered MSBs could offer NOWs. The slow transition in

these states reflected the novelty of the NOW concept as well as the un-

certainty about their future status. In 1976, when NOWs were first authorized

in the four other New England states, the growing awareness and acceptance

of NOWs resulted in much faster adjustment, and about 20 percent of house-

hold demand deposits shifted in the first year. Similarly, in New York,

about 20 percent of household demand deposits shifted to NOWs during

the first year. Finally, the ATS experience in the rest of the nation

indicates a rather slow transition, reminiscent of the experience in the

original two NOW states. After the first year, only about 5 percent of

consumer demand deposits had shifted to ATS accounts. As in the original

two NOW states, the slow response to ATS likely reflected in part

uncertainty about the future status of the new accounts.1/ In addition,

the sluggish growth of ATS may reflect the absence so far of strong inter-

institutional competition for interest-bearing transaction accounts,

since S&Ls have generally not been authorized to offer ATS accounts.

The varied NOW and ATS experience suggests a fairly wide range

for the possible proportion of demand deposits shifting to NOWs in 1981.

Projections of consumer demand deposits indicate that, in the absence of

nationwide NOWs, household demand deposits in the 42 states would have

grown to an estimated $93-1/2 billion by the end of 1981.2/ If the adjust-

ment is relatively fast, a diversion to NOWs of 20 percent, or $18-3/4

billion, of these household demand deposits may occur during 1981. On

the other hand, if it is relatively slow the shifts may be only about

5 percent, or $4½ billion. These figures translate into reduction of

M-A growth of from 1 to 5 percentage points in 1981 (see Table I-3).

Roughly one-third of existing NOW deposits are estimated

to have been diverted from assets other than demand deposits. Thus,

adding a $2-1/4 billion shift from savings and other liquid assets to the

low estimate of $4-1/2 billion from demand deposits produces a $6-3/4

total growth in NOWs during 1981. Similarly, adding $9-1/2 billion to the

high estimate of $18-3/4 billion from demand deposits yields $28-1/4 billion

in total NOW growth. These figures imply an estimated boost to M-1B growth

ranging from 1/2 to 2-1/2 percentage points during 1981.

1/ ATS accounts at commercial banks grew to over $6 billion during the first
half year they were offered. Then, in April 1979 a court ruling set aside
regulations authorizing ATS accounts, and placed their ultimate status in
doubt until the Monetary Control Act was passed; during the 10 month interim,
ATS grew by only around $2 billion.
2/ This figure assumes 6 percent growth in consumer transaction deposits in
1980 and 1981 and is consistent with the growth in OCDs implied by Alternative
B and Strategy 1 in this Bluebook, i.e., a 6 percent growth in consumer trans-
actions deposits is consistent with a 4-1/2 percent growth in M-1A.

The width of these ranges reflects the high degree of un-

certainty regarding the speed of adjustment to nationwide NOWs in light

of the diversity of experience with NOW and ATS accounts. Several

factors argue for expecting a rate of growth in the vicinity of the

lower bound:

(1) At year end 1979, one-third of commercial banks, holding an estimat-
ed 70 percent of household demand deposits, already offered NOW
or ATS accounts. Since NOW and ATS accounts are close sub-
stitutes from the viewpoints of both offering institutions and
depositors, the nationwide NOW authority does not seem to be
the sort of innovation that should cause massive shifts of funds.

(2) Thrift competition is not as intense in most parts of the country
as in the states currently permitting NOW accounts, and there-
fore banks in the 42 states may be less aggressive in merchan-
dising NOWs than were institutions in New England.

(3) Money market mutual funds-which are still growing in public
acceptance--may divert some of the more interest-sensitive funds
from NOWs.

On the other hand, there are bases for arguing for a relatively fast

rate of conversion:

(1) Recent high market interest rates have heightened consumer aware-
ness of the value of interest-bearing transaction deposits,
thus increasing the marketability of NOWs. Moreover, from the
point of view of depository institutions, relatively high market
interest rates during 1981 might increase incentives to market
NOW accounts more aggressively in an effort to retain or attract
funds.

(2) The Monetary Control Act has removed uncertainty regarding the
future status of interest-bearing household transaction accounts--
which could well stimulate faster growth of ATS over the remainder
of 1980, as well as in 1981, especially if banks attempt to late
take an early lead in the competition for OCDs.

(3) While NOW and ATS accounts are functionally equivalent, the
simplicity of the NOW account concept likely may make it easier
to market than ATS.



-27-

(4) NOWs afford most S&Ls nationwide their first opportunity to
compete in the household transaction deposit market, and
there are reports that these institutions are preparing to
market NOWs aggressively.

As a preliminary working assumption, the staff believes that the

midpoints of the ranges are the most likely estimates for the NOW account

effects in 1981, namely a 3 percentage point reduction in M-1A growth and a

1½ percentage point boost in M-1B growth. The staff believes that the

ultimate shift to NOW/ATS accounts will be quite large; indeed, after

more than six years of NOW accounts at all depository institutions in

Massachusetts and New Hampshire, roughly two-thirds of household demand

deposits are estimated to have shifted.
