Prefatory Note 

 
 

The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain. 
 

Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a redaction process that removed information obtained on a 
confidential basis.  All redacted passages are exempt from disclosure under applicable

1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked 
and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not 
reliably recognized by the OCR process and were not checked or corrected by staff.

Recent developments

(1) M-1 contracted in November at a 4.6 per cent annual

rate and appears to be growing at only about a 2 per cent annual

rate in December. Thus, over the two months, M-1 is projected to

decline at a 1¼ per cent annual rate. Demand for M-1 has been

tempered by the recent substantial increases in market interest

rates, as well as by the introduction of automatic transfer services

(ATS), but the recent weakness appears greater than can be explained

by these factors. Shifts to ATS accounts are estimated to be reducing

M-1 growth by about 3 percentage points at an annual rate over November

and December. M-2 growth is projected to slow to about a 5 per

cent rate over November and December, below the low end of the FOMC's

range. The interest-bearing component of M-2 grew slightly more

rapidly in November than in October, reflecting growth of money market

certificates and the large time deposits in this aggregate. Small

time deposits subject to fixed rate ceilings declined in November, as

did savings deposits despite the introduction of ATS. Given the

weakness in savings deposits, M-l+ is projected to decline at a 4 per

cent annual rate over November and December. Inflow of deposits to

thrift institutions in November slowed somewhat, even though sales

of money market certificates continued to be robust.

(2) Following the November FOMC meeting, the Account

Management raised its Federal funds rate target to the 9-7/8 per cent

midpoint of the 9 3/4 to 10 per cent range set by the Committee. As the

weakness in the monetary aggregates developed, the FOMC voted on

December 8 to maintain the 9-7/8 per cent Federal funds target until

the next meeting, unless the monetary aggregates weakened significantly

further. Member bank borrowing has varied between $600 and $800 million

in recent weeks, a normal level for the prevailing spread between the

discount and Federal funds rate.

(3) The trade-weighted exchange value of the dollar has

declined by 1 per cent since the November FOMC meeting, but is currently

about 9 per cent above its October 31 low. The dollar's declines

against the German mark and Swiss franc have more than offset a small

rise against the Japanese yen.

private short-term interest rates have changed little, on balance,

from peak levels reached in the week preceding the November FOMC

meeting. However, CD rates, as indicated by the highest offering

quotes, are currently below their mid-November peaks, when banks

were issuing CD's in large volume, partly to finance credit exten-

sions to their own foreign branches and to foreign banks. The 3-

month Treasury bill has risen substantially since the period just

prior to the November meeting, and as a result the unusually wide

spread of private short-term rates over the bill rate has narrowed.

The market supply of these bills for private investors has been

enlarged by the Treasury's decision to shift part of its weekly

bill offerings from the 6-month to the 3-month area, while demand

for bills by foreign institutions has been lower as a result of their

reduced exchange market intervention. The bank prime rate has

increased 50 basis points since the last FOMC meeting in response

to earlier advances in market rates.

(5) Bond yields rose 10 to 30 basis points in the inter-

meeting period as a bearish tone developed in capital markets when

published data suggested that economic activity has continued at

a stronger than anticipated pace and inflationary pressures have

remained intense. Agency and municipal bond new issue volume rose

in November, while the corporate calendar remained moderate. With

its dollar balances augmented by earlier sales of obligations directly



-4-

to foreign official accounts, the Treasury raised no new money from

private investors in domestic markets in the intermeeting period.1/

(6) Loan demands at commercial banks appear to have

remained relatively strong in November. Business loans expanded at

about their October pace, while real estate and probably consumer

loans increased more rapidly. To finance loan expansion, banks

issued a substantial volume of large negotiable and nonnegotiable

CD's, and in addition, liquidated security holdings. The increase

in use of managed liabilities was particularly sharp earlier in the

month when private demands for dollar credits seem to have been

augmented by borrowing in anticipation of possible dollar depreciation.

(7) The demand for residential mortgage credit apparently

has remained quite strong, as indicated by a further rise in mortgage

commitments at S&L's to a record level in October and an estimated

vigorous expansion of mortgage credit in November at both banks and

thrift institutions. In the face of this continued strong demand,

and with deposit flows slowing, the average rates on new commitments

for conventional mortgages at S&L's have risen 15 basis points to 10.35

per cent since the FOMC meeting.

1/ The Treasury did raise around $550 million of new money from
foreign official accounts through sale of nonmarketable issues
and add-ons to regular auctions. The Treasury also sold $1.6
billion equivalent of M1-denominated securities on December 12.
The proceeds of this issue are being warehoused with the Federal
Reserve with the Treasury's dollar proceeds being added to its
general balance. As the Treasury balance at the Federal Reserve
is reduced, the Desk will, all other things equal, sell Treasury
securities to the public to neutralize the reserve impacts--in
effect substituting Federal Reserve sales of securities for
Treasury issuance of securities in U.S. markets.

Prospective developments

(9) Shown below for Committee consideration are two alternative

specifications for the monetary aggregates and the Federal funds rate for

the December-January period. Alternative A calls for no near-term change

in the Federal funds rate, while alternative B increases policy restraint

marginally in coming weeks. (More details and longer-term data are

contained in the tables on pp. 8 and 9.)

what in December, on a daily average basis, but the evident growth of

income and expenditures suggests that a substantial increase in M-1 is

likely in January. Consequently, growth in this aggregate over the

M-l growth will be reduced 3 percentage points by ATS. In projecting GNP, monetary
aggregates, and interest rates the staff has carried forward the assumption in most
recent Bluebooks that M-l, in the absence of ATS, would increase at a 6k per cent annual
rate over the longer-run. Thus, the observed growth of M-l is expected to be 3k per cent
over the QIII '78 to QIII '79 period.

December-January period is projected to be in a 2½ to 7½ per cent

annual rate range. Transfers from demand to ATS accounts are expected

to depress M-1 growth over the two-month period by 2 to 4 percentage

points, a bit less than previously assumed.

(11) If December projections materialize, M-1 growth in

the current quarter will be only about 4 per cent, with ATS effects

reducing growth by about one percentage point. Thus, even adding

back the effects of ATS, M-1 growth will be the slowest for a quarter

in over two years.1/ The staff's econometric model suggests that,

given the estimated almost 13 per cent rate of increase in nominal

GNP in the fourth quarter, interest rates can explain only part of the

slowdown in M-1. It is too early to be certain if this shortfall is

transitory or represents the onset of another downward drift in

money demand associated with more aggressive adoption of cash

management techniques. The staff's projection for the near term

assumes that underlying money demand will lead to a strengthening of

M-1 growth, but that over the longer run policy period there will

be some continued downward drift in money demand.

(12) The supplementary aggregate M-1+ is expected to

expand in a 1 to 5 per cent range over December-January, noticeably

less than M-1, as weakness in non-ATS savings continues to limit

growth in this aggregate. While the staff is projecting that regular

1/ With the exception of the second quarter of 1978--when nominal GNP

accelerated to over a 20 per cent annual rate as the economy

rebounded from the adverse weather and coal strike during last

winter--the implied V-1 for the current quarter will increase at

its most rapid rate in almost three years. Appendix II displays

projected rates of growth of velocity.



-11-

passbook accounts at commercial banks will begin to rise in December,

following their unusually large recent contraction, the average level

of such accounts is expected to grow only modestly, if at all, over the

period.

(13) Under alternative A, M-2 is projected to expand in a

6 to 10 per cent annual rate range in December-January, a somewhat

more rapid pace than in recent weeks. This acceleration reflects

mainly the expected strengthening of M-1 and the anticipated end of

the recent decline in outstanding savings deposits. Growth in the

interest-bearing component of M-2 is expected to be at about a 9 to

10 per cent annual rate, with growth almost wholly attributable to

expansion in large time deposits that are not subject to interest

rate ceilings.

(14) Projected credit demands suggest that banks will be

forced to continue to rely on managed liabilities to supplement their

lendable funds. Further issuance of large CD's, though at a reduced

rate, is in prospect, as is a resumption of growth in domestic non-

deposit liabilities and net Eurodollar borrowing. Banks thus will

experience mounting balance sheet pressures as borrowing ratios

continue to rise and as further run-offs of bank holdings of

Treasury securities cause liquidity ratios to decline further.



-12-

(15) At thrift institutions some further moderation in the

rate of deposit inflows from the pace of the late summer and early fall

is probable in light of higher market yields and the completion of the

stock adjustment of financial assets that accompanied the introduction

of the new 6-month certificates. Nevertheless, virtually all of the

growth of deposits at S&L's and MSB's is expected to continue to

come from sales of MMC's. Sample data for early December indicate

that S&L's are not only rolling over their maturing 6-month certificates,

but continuing to issue a substantial net volume of these instruments.

Aggressive marketing of MMC's is being induced by competitive pressures,

by a need for funds to meet mortgage loan commitments, and by FHLB

advances policies.1/

(16) If the Federal funds rate remains within the 9¾ to 10

per cent range over the intermeeting period, as envisioned under

alternative A, interest rates on short-term market instruments will

likely fluctuate within a narrow range. Private short-term rates

appear to have fully adjusted to the current funds rate level, and

no significant change in private short-term credit demands appears in

prospect for the weeks immediately ahead. The relative movement of

Treasury bill rates will, of course, be influenced by the level of

foreign exchange market intervention and the portfolio policies of

foreign official institutions.

1/ The FHLBB has indicated that advances will not be liberally available
to institutions that do not make reasonable efforts to roll over
maturing 6-month certificates.



-13-

(17) Yields on longer-term bonds are likely to remain

basically stable into the early weeks of January, barring unexpected

strength in the monetary aggregates or in current economic indicators.

The financing activity of corporations and municipalities is expected

to be seasonally light over the holiday period. In December, Treasury

financing activities will be confined to roll-overs of maturing 2-

and 4-year notes. Net borrowing by the Treasury in the domestic

market over the next several weeks is expected to be limited to a

$1¼ to $1¾ billion auction of 15-year bonds to be conducted around the

turn of the year; since participants are anticipating this offering,

they have presumably already discounted it.1/ With deposit flows

slowing somewhat, yields on commitments for new conventional mortgages

may continue to edge higher.

(18) Under alternative B, the Federal funds rate would

rise by mid-January to the midpoint of a 9¾ to 10½ per cent range.

M-1 growth would likely be in a 2 to 7 per cent annual rate range over

December-January, and M-1+ and M-2, respectively, in a ½ to 4½ and

5½ to 9½ per cent range. The resulting increase in short-term market

rates of interest would further slow the growth of deposits subject

to fixed rate ceilings, induce more aggressive offerings of MMC's

and large denomination time deposits, and a tightening of bank lending

terms--with the prime loan rate moving up to 11¾ or 12 per cent.

1/ The Treasury is also expected to issue Swiss franc denominated
notes, amounting to about $1.2 billion equivalent, in the first
part of January.



-14-

Long-term yields would also probably move up, but the light financing

calendar and further evidence of the System's determination to con-

strain monetary growth would tend to limit such movement.

(19) If M-1, as expected, expands at a 4 per cent annual

rate in the fourth quarter, the longer-run growth range for this

aggregate implies an M-1 growth over the first three quarters of 1979

at a 2¾ per cent annual rate.1/ Assuming the staff's current GNP

projections and some downward shift in money demand, the staff believes

that such growth in M-1 is generally consistent with the Federal funds

rate ranges shown in Appendix I. Reflecting monetary restraint already

in train, the midpoint of alternative A would call for no further rise

in the funds rate over the longer-run policy period. The alternative

B pattern contemplates that an increase in the funds rate to a little

over 10 per cent in the intermeeting period would be maintained through

the first quarter of 1979. This additional restraint on monetary

expansion would imply that the funds rate could be lower than the

alternative A path by next summer, while still achieving the same

growth in the aggregates over the QIII '78 to QIII '79 period.

However, if the expected downward drift in money demand does not occur,

higher interest rates than indicated by either Federal funds path would

be required to achieve the desired growth in the aggregates.

1/ This assumes, as did previous Bluebooks, that, in the absence of
ATS, the Committee would desire M-1 growth of 6¼ per cent over the
QIII '78 to QIII '79 policy period. The staff has assumed ATS
will reduce M-1 by 3 percentage points over this period and that
therefore observed M-1 growth is expected to be 3¼ per cent over
this QIII '78 to QIII '79 policy period.

Directive language

(20) Given below are suggested operational paragraphs

for the directive. The language added last month "giving due

regard ... to the program for supporting the foreign exchange value

of the dollar" has been retained along with the reference, added in

October, "to uncertainties associated with the introduction of ATS."

Alternative language consistent with the short-run specifications of

the alternatives discussed in the preceding section is shown for the

Committee's objective for the Federal funds rate early in the period.

At a later point, alternative language is also provided for placing main

emphasis either on monetary aggregates or, as was agreed at the

November meeting, on money market conditions. The specifications

adopted last month are shown in strike-through form.

In the short-run, the Committee seeks to achieve

bank reserve and money market conditions that are broadly con-

sistent with the longer-run ranges for monetary aggregates

cited above, while giving due regard to the program for

supporting the foreign exchange value of the dollar, to

developing conditions in domestic financial markets, and to

uncertainties associated with the introduction of ATS. Early

in the period before the next regular meeting, System open

market operations are to be directed at attaining a weekly

average Federal funds rate

(A) AT ABOUT THE CURRENT LEVEL.
(B) slightly above the current level.



-16-

Subsequently, operations shall be directed at maintaining the

weekly average Federal funds rate within the range of {DEL: 9¾-to-10]

____ TO ____ per cent. In deciding on the specific objective

for the Federal funds rate, the Manager is to be guided mainly

by a range of tolerance for the annual rate of growth over the

[DEL: November-December] DECEMBER-JANUARY period of [DEL: 6-to-9½] ____ TO

____ per cent in M-2, provided that the rate of growth in M-1

does not appear to exceed [DEL: 5] ____ per cent.

Money market emphasis

The objective for the funds rate is to be raised or

lowered within its range if the rate of growth of M-2 appears

to be close to or beyond the upper or lower limit of its range.

Weight is to be given to M-1 if it appears to be growing at

a rate close to or above its limit.

If the rates of growth in the aggregates appear to be

falling outside the limits of the indicated ranges at a time

when the objective for the funds rate has already been moved

to the corresponding limit of its range, the Manager will

promptly notify the Chairman, who wil then decide whether the

situation calls for supplementary instructions from the

Committee.

Monetary aggregates emphasis

The objective for the funds rate is to be raised or

lowered in an orderly fashion within its range if the rate



-17-

of growth of M-2 appears to be significantly above or below

the midpoint of the indicated range. Weight is to be given

to M-1 if it appears to be growing at a rate close to or above

its limit.

If the rates of growth in the aggregates appear to be

falling outside the limits of the indicated ranges at a time

when the objective for the funds rate has already been moved

to the corresponding limit of its range, the Manager will

promptly notify the Chairman, who will then decide whether the

situation calls for supplementary instructions from the

Committee.

APPENDIX IV

Alternative Short-run Growth Rates and Federal Funds
Rate Ranges

The table below shows growth rate ranges for M-1 and M-2

expressed as the growth from the average of the three months ending

in October to the average of the three-months ending in January.

These ranges are based on the same staff projections of December and

January as appear in the present two month ranges shown in paragraph 9

of the text. This three-month averaging procedure is proposed by the

Subcommittee on the Directive, in its December 13 memorandum to the

FOMC

Alt. A Alt. B

Ranges for average of three-
months ending in January
over three-months ending
in October

M-l 1-1/4 to 3-1/4 1 to 3

M-2 6 to 7-1/2 6 to 7-1/2

Addendum

M-1+ -3/4 to 3/4 -1 to 1/2

Federal funds rate
(Intermeeting period) 9-1/2 to 10-1/4 9-3/4 to 10-1/2

As may be seen in the table, the difference in method of

specifying growthrates in aggregates for the short-run operating period

changes these growth rates, narrows the ranges, and reduces the

difference in growth rates between alternatives. This reflects the



IV-2

combined effect of the reduction in the annualization factor from
1/

6 to 4, the reduced weight of revisions in the terminal month

(which in the proposed procedure gets only 1/3 of its present weight),

and the partly offsetting effect from including revisionsin the month

preceding the terminal month (i.e., the month of the FOMC meeting)

in the end-period.

The above factors, including a review of historical relation-

ships between revisions of monetary aggregates in the month of the FOMC

meeting and the succeeding month, suggest that projected growth rates

of both M-1 and M-2, calculated on a three-month average over a three

month average,would have been revised over the intermeeting period

by about 37 per cent of the revisions that occurred in the projected

growth rates over the present two-month policy period. Thus, experience

suggests that the tolerance ranges under the proposed procedure should

be about two-fifths as wide as at present in order to assure no change

in FOMC responses in adjusting the Federal funds rate to unanticipated

movements in the aggregates from one FOMC meeting to the next.

1/ The proposed procedure has an end-period that is centered three-
months from the center of the base period, while the present pro-
cedure has a one month end-period that is two months beyond the
base month.

2/ These revisions in the month prior to the terminal month have been
positively correlated with the terminal month revisions, and
thus are a factor tending to add to the variability of the pro-
jected growth rate under the proposed procedure.

NOTE: Government security dealer trading positions are on a commitment basis. Trading positions, which exclude Treasury securities financed by
repurchase agreements maturing in 16 days or more, are indicators of dealer holdings available for sale over the near-term. Underwriting syndicate
positions consist of issues still in syndicate, excluding trading positions. The basic reserve deficit is excess reserves less borrowing at Federal
Reserve less net Federal funds purchases. Weekly data are daily averages for statement weeks, except for corporate and municipal issues in syndicate
which are Friday figures.

NOTE: Weekly data for columns 1, 2, 3, 6, and 7 are statement week averages of daily data. Weekly data in column 4 are average rates set in the auctions of

6-month bills that will be issued on the Thursday following the end of the statement week. Data in column 5 are 1-day Wednesday quotes. For columns 8 through
11, the weekly date is the mid-point of the calendar week over which data are averaged. Columns 12 and 13 are 1-day quotes for Friday and Thursday, respec-
tively, following the end of the statement week. Column 14 is an average of contract interest rates on commitments for conventional first mortgages with 80

per cent loan-to-value ratios made by a sample of insured savings and loan associations on the Friday following the end of the statement week. Column 15 gives

FNMA auction data for Monday preceding the end of the statement week. Column 16 is a 1-day quote for Monday preceding the end of the statement week. The FNMA
auction yield is the average yield in bi-weekly auction for short-term forward commitments for Government underwritten mortgages. GNMA yields are average net

yields to investors on mortgage-backed securities for immediate delivery, assuming prepayment in 12 years on pools of 30-year FHA/VA mortgages carrying the
coupon rate 50 basis points below the current PHA/VA ceiling.
