The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version available 
based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the Board 
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was created 
through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned 
versions text-searchable.2   Though a stringent quality assurance process was 
employed, some imperfections may remain.

format.  All scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced 
tilting) and lightly cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other 
blemishes caused after initial printing). 
 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optical character recognition computer program (OCR) 
first created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, 
staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.  Please note that the numbers and text in charts and

Recent developments

(1) M-1 grew at an annual rate of 5.5 per cent in August, and

for the August-September period is projected to increase at a 6.1 per

cent annual rate, about one percentage point above the upper end of the

Committee's range. Savings deposit inflows to banks strengthened in

August and early September, but the time deposit component of M-2 weakened

considerably. Accordingly, the M-2 growth projection for the August-

September period--at 6.7 per cent--is within the Committee's range, but

in the upper half. Deposit growth at thrift institutions was maintained

in August at the very rapid July pace. Nonborrowed reserves fell substan-

tially in August, as member banks met a greater portion of their reserve

requirements by borrowing at the System's discount window. Following the

rise in the discount rate from 5-1/4 to 5-3/4 per cent in late August,

member bank borrowing dropped back to around its July level, and nonborrowed

reserves are projected to increase rapidly in September.

(2) In the weeks immediately following the August FOMC meeting,

incoming data indicated that M-1 and M-2 were, respectively, growing at

rates in the upper half and near the mid-point of their ranges. Conse-

quently, the Desk continued to seek a Federal funds rate of around 6 per

cent. More recently, however, as M-1 growth appeared to be exceeding the

upper limit of its range, and with M-2 in the upper half of its range, the

Desk has sought a firming in the Federal funds rate to around 6-1/8 per cent.

(3) Credit demands generally have been maintained at a high level

in recent weeks. In the short-term area, business borrowing in August was

somewhat stronger than in July, and the Treasury tapped the bill sector for

a substantial sum of new money for the first time since late last year.

The Federal Government also has continued to be an active borrower in the

coupon market, and bond offerings by corporations and State and local

governments--encouraged in part by favorable market conditions--have

remained sizable. Moreover, households apparently have continued to raise

a large volume of funds in mortgage and consumer credit markets.

(4) The strengthening in short-term credit demands, market

response to the large increase of M-1 in the last week of August, and a

rise in the Federal funds rate have contributed to an increase in short-

term interest rates amounting to as much as 30 basis points since the

August FOMC meeting. Long-term rates, on the other hand, have been

unchanged or have declined somewhat on balance since mid-August, as

demands for bonds from institutional investors have remained strong.

Stock prices have edged lower over the intermeeting period.

Prospective developments

(6) Summarized below for Committee consideration are three

alternative specifications for the Federal funds rate and the monetary

aggregates for the forthcoming intermeeting period. (More detailed and

longer-run data on the aggregates are shown in the tables on pp. 6 and 7).

Alt. A Alt. B Alt. C

Ranges for September-October

M-1 5½-9½ 5-9 4½-8½

M-2 6-10 5½-9½ 5-9

Federal funds rate 5¼-6 5¾-6½ 6¼-7
(intermeeting period)

(7) Assuming a Federal funds rate centered in the 5¾-6½ per

cent range specified for alternative B, M-1 over the September-October

period is expected to expand in a 5-9 per cent annual rate range. Incoming

data suggest that M-1 will grow at about a 6½ per cent annual rate in

September, and the staff would anticipate a slight acceleration to about

a 7½ per cent annual rate in October. Strength in the demand for M-1 is

likely to be sustained in the fall, given the pick-up in growth of nominal

GNP that is projected and recent indications that the public may be

reducing the extent to which it is shifting out of M-1 into other liquid

assets.

(8) Growth in M-1 from the second to the third quarter will be

at about a 9¼ per cent annual rate. To restrain M-1 growth over the one

year QII '77-QII '78 period to around the mid-point of the 4-6½ per cent

range adopted by the Committee in July would require a considerable slowing

in M-1 growth in the fourth and subsequent quarters. The required

constraint on reserves would entail further increases in the funds rate.

If the funds rate were to begin rising by mid-October, and reached 7¼

per cent by the end of the year, M-1 growth in the fourth quarter may be

at around a 6 per cent annual rate. The effects on monetary growth would

be more pronounced in the first half of next year, given the lagged

relationship between interest rates and money demand. We have assumed

that the 7¼ per cent funds rate would lead to the 2½-3 per cent annual

rate of growth in M-1 during the first half of 1978 that is necessary to

meet the mid-point of the FOMC's current longer-run range, but it is

quite possible we may be underestimating the strength of money demand,

given GNP, and that higher interest rates would be required.

(9) Under alternative B, in the September-October period M-2

is expected to expand in a 5½-9½ per cent annual rate range, assuming

that short-term market interest rates show little change from currently

prevailing levels in the period between now and the next meeting. Net

inflows of time and savings deposits other than negotiable CD's are

expected to be relatively low in September, but to pick up to a pace

more consonant with existing interest rate relationships later in the

fall. Some of the recent weakness in the time deposit component of M-2

appears to have reflected shifts of funds from maturing "wild card" certi-

ficates at banks to higher rate certificates at thrift institutions.

Indeed, at nonbank thrift institutions deposit inflows expanded sharply

over the summer, as these institutions became more aggressive in seeking

deposit funds in view of their large mortgage commitments and in light

of uncertainties about their own substantial "wild card" maturities.



-9-

(10) But with higher short-term interest rates projected by

year-end, and in the first half of 1978, it is likely that growth of

interest-bearing deposits at banks and thrift institutions will slow.

Assuming a 3-month bill rate of around 7¼ in the early part of next

year, and no adjustment in Regulation Q ceiling rates, such deposits may

increase at about an 8-9 per cent annual rate during the first two quarters

of 1978. This rate of inflow is somewhat higher than might be expected

on the basis of past experience with similar interest rate relationships;

it reflects the continued sizable rate of expansion in nominal income that

is projected for next year. Nonetheless, even with savings inflows

reasonably well maintained, large demands for mortgage credit, including

takedowns of the very high level of outstanding commitments, would tend

to exert substantial pressures on the position of thrift institutions.

They would be forced to reduce liquidity and increase short-term borrowing.

Under such circumstances, an upward adjustment in the Q ceiling rate might

have to be considered.

(11) Alternative C involves a more prompt rise in interest

rates than alternative B and somewhat slower monetary growth rates over

the balance of this year. It contemplates an increase in the Federal

funds rate to the mid-point of a 6¼-7 per cent range between now and

the next Committee meeting. With additional monetary restraint in place

somewhat sooner, the staff would expect interest rates to rise a little

less over the longer-run than under alternative B.

(12) Between now and the next Committee meeting an upward

adjustment in the funds rate to around the 6-5/8 per cent mid-point



-10-

of the alternative C range would probably be associated with an increase

in the 3-month Treasury bill rate to the 6¼-6½ per cent area. Other

short-term rates would adjust commensurately, member bank borrowing from

the discount window may once again rise substantially, and pressures

for another upward adjustment of the discount rate would build. Long-

term rates would probably rise for a time in response to the advance

in short rates, but in the absence of indications of stronger economic

activity or of a worsening of inflationary pressures such rate increases

are not likely to be sustained.

(13) An easing in the funds rate to the mid-point of a 5¼-6

per cent range is encompassed under alternative A. The lower interest

rates and more rapid near-term growth in the monetary aggregates would

require more upward interest rate pressure, and less monetary growth, in

early 1978--as compared with alternatives B and C--if growth in the

monetary aggregates over the QII '77-QII '78 period is to remain within

the FOMC's longer-run ranges. The projected funds rate pattern for

alternative A, as well as the other alternatives, is presented in

Appendix I.



-11-

(14) Given below are alternatives for the operational paragraphs

of the directive. The first formulation, like the directive adopted at

the last meeting, places main emphasis on near-term rates of growth in

monetary aggregates; it shows--in strike-through form--the specifications

adopted at the last meeting. The second formulation places main emphasis

on money market conditions. As suggested below, the particular language

needed in the opening lines of the money market formulation would depend

on the specific conditions sought; the three alternatives shown--calling,

respectively, for somewhat easier, prevailing, and somewhat firmer money

market conditions--are intended to be associated with the specifications

discussed in the preceding section under alternatives A, B, and C.

"Monetary Aggregates" Formulation

The Committee seeks to encourage near-term rates of growth in

M-1 and M-2 on a path believed to be reasonably consistent with the

longer-run ranges for monetary aggregates cited in the preceding

paragraph. Specifically, at present, it expects the annual growth

rates over the [DEL: August-September] SEPTEMBER-OCTOBER period to be within

the ranges of [DEL: 0 to 5] ____ to ____ per cent for M-1 and [DEL: 3 to 8] ____

to ____ per cent for M-2. In the judgment of the Committee such

growth rates are likely to be associated with a weekly-average

Federal funds rate of about [DEL: 6] ____ per cent. If, giving approx-

imately equal weight to M-1 and M-2, it appears that growth rates

over the 2-month period will deviate significantly from the midpoints

of the indicated ranges, the operational objective for the Federal



-12-

funds rate shall be modified in an orderly fashion within a range

of [DEL: 5-3/4 to 6-1/4] ____ to ____ per cent.

If it appears during the period before the next meeting that

the operating constraints specified above are proving to be signif-

icantly inconsistent, the Manager is promptly to notify the Chairman

who will then decide whether the situation calls for supplementary

instructions from the Committee.

"Money Market" Formulation

At this time, the Committee seeks to maintain about the prevail-

ing money market conditions (or to achieve somewhat easier or some-

what firmer money market conditions) during the period immediately

ahead, provided that monetary aggregates appear to be growing at

approximately the rates currently expected, which are believed to

be on a path reasonably consistent with the longer-run ranges for

monetary aggregates cited in the preceding paragraph. Specifically,

the Committee seeks to maintain the weekly-average Federal funds rate

at about ____ per cent, so long as M-1 and M-2 appear to be growing

over the September-October period at annual rates within ranges of

____ to ____ per cent and ____ to ____ per cent, respectively.

If, giving approximately equal weight to M-1 and M-2, it appears that

growth rates over the 2-month period are approaching or moving beyond

the limits of the indicated ranges, the operational objective for

the weekly-average Federal funds rate shall be modified in an orderly

fashion within a range of ____ to ____ per cent.



-13-

If it appears during the period before the next meeting that

the operating constraints specified above are proving to be signif-

icantly inconsistent, the Manager is promptly to notify the Chairman

who will then decide whether the situation calls for supplementary

instructions from the Committee.

The table above shows growth rates for reserve aggregates

over the second half of 1977 that are thought to be consistent with

the alternatives presented to the Committee. Estimates for the third

quarter as a whole indicate that nonborrowed reserves appear to

have expanded from the second quarter at a 4.4 per cent annual rate,

total reserves at a 9.3 per cent rate, and the monetary base at a

9.6 per cent rate. Thus a considerable slowing in growth of reserves

will be needed in the fourth quarter.

NOTE: Government security dealer trading positions are on a commitment basis. Trading positions, which exclude Treasury securities financing by repurchase

agreements maturing in 16 days or more, are indicators of dealer holdings available for sale over the near-term. Underwriting syndicate positions consist
of issues still in syndicate, excluding trading positions. The basic reserve deficit is excess reserves less borrowing at Federal Reserve less net Federal

funds purchases. Weekly data are daily averages for statement weeks, except for corporate and municipal issues in syndicate which are Friday figures.

* Strictly confidential.

** Monthly averages for excess reserves and borrowings are weighted averages of statement week figures.

NOTE: Weekly data for columns 1 to 4 are statement week averages of daily data. Columns 5 and 6 are 1-day Wednesday quotes (prior to 1976, figures shown

are for 60-89 day and 90-119 day ranges, respectively). For columns 7 through 10, the weekly date is the mid-point of the calendar week over which data

are averaged. Columns 11 and 12 are 1-day quotes for Friday and Thursday, respectively, following the end of the statement week. Column 13 is an average

of contract interest rates on commitments for conventional first mortgages with 80 per cent loan-to-value ratios made by a sample of insured savings and loan

associations on the Friday following the end of the statement week. Column 14 gives FNMA auction data for Monday preceding the end of the statement week.

Column 15 is a 1-day quote for Monday preceding the end of the statement week. The FNMA auction yield is the average yield in bi-weekly auction for short-

term forward commitments for Government underwritten mortgages. GNMA yields are average net yields to investors on mortgage-backed securities for immediate

delivery, assuming prepayment in 12 years on pools of 30-year PHA/VA mortgages carrying the coupon rate 50 basis points below the current FHA/VA ceiling.
