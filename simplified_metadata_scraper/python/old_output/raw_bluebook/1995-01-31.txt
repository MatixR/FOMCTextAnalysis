Prefatory Note 

 
 

The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain. 
 

Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a redaction process that removed information obtained on a 
confidential basis.  All redacted passages are exempt from disclosure under applicable 
provisions of the Freedom of Information Act.    

 

                                                 
1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked 
and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not

MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Recent Developments

(1) The federal funds rate averaged close to the intended

level of 5-1/2 percent during the intermeeting period. In the

days approaching year-end, the Desk met heavy reserve demands by re-

peatedly arranging overlapping term System RPs. In the event, the

federal funds rate averaged a little below 5-1/2 percent on the last

trading day of the year, and year-end pressures in the money markets

were not atypical. Reserve demands remained substantial into the

first few days of the new year, and the Desk continued to arrange

System RPs in size.

(2) Economic data released since the last FOMC meeting were

broadly in line with market participants' expectations of high and

rising levels of resource utilization and continued robust growth in

output. However, some unexpected softening in indicators of final

demand, surprisingly good price performance, and Mexico's difficulties

prompted market participants to push back and trim somewhat the

trajectory of expected monetary tightening, as shown in Chart 1.

Consequently, many short- and long-term rates declined 15 to 20 basis

points over the intermeeting period.2 Nonetheless, markets con-

tinued to anticipate further substantial monetary tightening, and the

1. The allowance for adjustment and seasonal borrowing was reduced
in two steps during the intermeeting period from $125 million to $75
million to accommodate seasonal declines in the demand for discount
window credit. Actual borrowing averaged a little above its allowance
during the intermeeting period.

2. The rate on three-month Treasury bills jumped about 25 basis
points over the period, partly reflecting the shifting "specialness"
of bills as collateral in the RP market. In addition, with year-end
premiums disappearing after the first of the year, rates on very
short-term private paper fell 10 to 25 basis points over the
intermeeting period.

yield curve remained steeply upward sloped through the first few

years. Political discussion of sharp cuts in outlays to conform with

the requirements of a balanced budget amendment appears to have had

little effect to date in markets.

(3) Skittishness in domestic financial markets seemed to

diminish during the intermeeting period. In the tax-exempt market,

concerns waned about the implications of the Orange County problems

for the financial condition of other municipal governments, abetting a

considerable decline in tax-exempt yields. Some quality spreads on

private paper had widened slightly before year-end as investors sought

to move toward safer instruments in anticipation of the publication of

their year-end financial statements; after the turn of the year,

spreads retraced that movement, leaving them generally quite narrow.

Spillover effects from Mexico's difficulties into U.S. financial

markets to date have been quite limited. Outflows from emerging-

market stock and bond mutual funds picked up for a while. But U.S.

banks with exposure to Mexico generally have experienced little net

change in their share prices and no unusual difficulties in raising

funds on wholesale markets. Expected bond market volatility inferred

from options prices fluctuated around the lower levels established

late last fall: on balance, measures of volatility have rolled back

most of their runup since February. Boosted by strong earnings re-

ports for the fourth quarter, broad stock price indexes rose 2 to 5

percent over the intermeeting period, bringing most within a few

percent of record highs.

(4) The dollar's weighted average exchange value against

G-10 currencies declined 2-1/2 percent over the intermeeting period.



The dollar may have been held down by uncertainty about the implica-

tions for the U.S. economy of the Mexican economic and financial tur-

moil, perhaps including the possibility that the Federal Reserve would

feel constrained in responding to U.S. inflation pressures. The dol-

lar declined nearly 4 percent against the mark, which was also buoyed

by safe-haven demand against weaker European currencies. Against the

yen, the dollar depreciated only 1 percent, with the strength of the

yen limited by the negative effects of the earthquake damage, which

also sent Japanese stocks 6-1/2 percent lower. Interest rates in

foreign industrial countries were little changed, on average. The

Mexican peso depreciated about 40 percent against the U.S. dollar,

Mexican interest rates soared, and the stock market declined 10 per-

cent in peso terms; in Argentina and Brazil, equity indexes declined

around 20 percent. The Canadian markets were also under pressure

because of concerns about the fiscal situation and Quebec separatism:

Canadian short- and long-term rates rose 125 and 20 basis points,

respectively, as the Canadian dollar fell a further 1-3/4 percent

against the U.S. dollar.

(5) The monetary data in this bluebook incorporate new

benchmark and seasonal adjustments. These data confirm that M2

grew 1.0 percent from 1993:Q4 to 1994:Q4, at the lower end of its

4
1-to-5 percent annual range. M3 expanded 1.4 percent last year,

3. Data incorporating the new benchmark and seasonal adjustments
are scheduled to be published in early February and are strictly
confidential until that time. The revisions are discussed in
appendix A.

4. M1 increased 2.3 percent during 1994, down sharply from the
double-digit rates of expansion in the previous two years. Demand
deposits were about flat last year, and other checkable deposits fell
2 percent. Both components were pulled down by substantial increases
in their opportunity costs as short-term market rates rose. Demand

a little more than previously estimated, leaving this aggregate well

within its 0-to-4 percent annual range. With both aggregates continu-

ing to expand sluggishly relative to nominal income, their velocities

increased substantially again in 1994. In contrast to the previous

few years, the increase in velocities appears attributable primarily

to rising opportunity costs resulting from the increases in short-term

market rates rather than to portfolio shifts into bond and stock

mutual funds. Over the year as a whole, flows into such funds were

far smaller than in 1992 and 1993. With bond prices falling during

the year, M2 plus the value of bond and stock mutual funds rose an

estimated 1 percent in 1994, well below its average of 5-1/4 percent

in the previous two years, and its velocity surged after exhibiting

little change on balance over the previous several years.

(6) Growth in the monetary aggregates was stronger over

December and January than had been anticipated at the time of the last

FOMC meeting, with M2 and M3 expanding at 3-1/4 and 4-3/4 percent

rates, respectively, over the two months.5 Much of the pickup in

M2, however, was in its most volatile components--demand deposits,

overnight RPs, and overnight Eurodollars; no factors have been iden-

tified to explain these increases. Excluding the contribution from

(Footnote continued from previous page)
deposits were also restrained by declining mortgage refinancing
activity, and other checkable deposits by the introduction of sweep
account programs by two large regional bank holding companies. To-
gether, these two factors are estimated to have depressed M1 growth by
around 3 percentage points in 1994. Acting to strengthen M1 were
continued strong demands from abroad for U.S. currency, which helped
maintain overall currency growth at 1993's rate of 10-1/4 percent.

5. Monetary estimates for January are based on complete data

those instruments, M2 eked out a 1-1/4 percent gain. Underlying pat-

terns of monetary growth extended those seen over 1994. The more

liquid accounts remained anemic, consistent with the very sluggish

increases in their interest rates, while small time deposits expanded

briskly. Data on bond and stock funds, although difficult to

interpret owing to large cash distributions around year end, suggest

continued weakness in demand for these investment vehicles. 7 This

weakness does not appear to have boosted the growth of the monetary

aggregates, but rather was reflected in direct investment in market

instruments, as indicated by continued strong noncompetitive tenders

at Treasury auctions. Institution-only money funds jumped in January,

contributing to the acceleration of M3. With the slow expansion in

retail deposits, depository institutions continued to bid for whole-

sale funding to finance relatively robust growth of bank credit.

(7) As in much of 1994, the debt of nonfinancial sectors in

recent months is estimated to have grown at a moderate pace--below

that of nominal GDP--and borrowers have continued to rely signifi-

cantly on shorter-term sources of funds. In the business sector, C&I

loans have expanded at a brisk pace in each of the last two months,

buoyed in part by lending to support merger and acquisition activity.

Supply conditions for business credit at banks have become even more

favorable: Senior loan officers at a significant number of banks

reported a further easing of terms on business loans over the three

months ending in December, although only a few institutions reduced

6. With transaction deposits depressed over the last two months,
total reserves rose at an average rate of only 1 percent. Currency
was unusually weak in December, perhaps reflecting shifting payment
patterns during the holiday shopping season, but has snapped back this
month. For the two-month period, the monetary base rose at a
6-1/2 percent rate.

7. M2 plus stock and bond funds is estimated to have contracted at
a 1-1/2 percent rate on balance over December and January.



their standards further. Issuance of commercial paper has also stayed

strong in the last two months. With longer-term rates near their

recent peaks, however, gross offerings of corporate bonds have been

light. Issuance of tax-exempt bonds has been slow and, and owing to

sizable retirements, municipal debt outstanding appears to have con-

tracted in the last two months. In the household sector, data on bank

loans suggest that growth in consumer installment and mortgage credit

was strong in December and January. With a lull in federal borrowing,

overall domestic nonfinancial sector debt expanded at a 4 percent

annual rate in December, bringing the increase for 1994 to 5-1/4 per-

cent, in the lower half of the 4-to-8 percent monitoring range for

this aggregate.

Long-Run Scenarios

(8) This section addresses several issues related to longer-

run strategies for monetary policy and their interaction with underly-

ing macroeconomic conditions. The first set of scenarios examines two

alternative strategies for monetary policy. The strategies embed

different assumptions about the economic outcomes that the Committee

would find acceptable but assume the same underlying macroeconomic

forces and relationships. The baseline strategy begins with the

Greenbook's baseline projection for 1995 and 1996; it envisions a

gradual rise in the unemployment rate to its natural rate by 2000 to

cap inflation, which levels off at about 3-1/2 percent. The tighter

strategy extends the Greenbook's "alternative simulation" and puts

inflation on a downward path consistent with achieving price stability

early in the next decade. The next two sets of scenarios involve

alternative assumptions about fiscal policy and the level of the

natural rate of unemployment.

(9) A key assumption behind most of the scenarios, including

the baseline, is a sharp turn toward fiscal restraint to put the bud-

get in balance by the year 2002. Based on current-service projections

that show the deficit rising above $300 billion early in the next

decade, such a fiscal policy would require average incremental cuts

of roughly $45 billion per year over the next seven years (we have

assumed $20 billion in FY 1996 and slightly more than $45 billion

8. The charts show the federal funds rates, CPI (excluding food
and energy) and unemployment rates that go with each strategy. The
table below gives nominal and real GDP growth as well. The money
growth projections were put together on the premise that as households
complete their adjustments to the improved accessibility of bond and
stock mutual funds, increasingly offered through banks themselves,
money growth will gradually return to its traditional relationships
with growth in income and changes in opportunity costs.



thereafter). The effect of this fiscal restraint is to trim equili-

brium real interest rates over time by about 1-1/2 percentage points.

In the baseline, the reduction in long-term rates in response to fis-

cal restraint occurs gradually over time, consistent with a view that

the deficit reduction process will gain credibility only as cuts in

outlays are actually legislated. Such an assumption is consistent

with market uncertainty about the eventual ratification of the

balanced budget amendment by the states or skepticism that adequate

steps actually will be taken to implement it. Of course, it is pos-

sible that long-term rates might move sooner and by more in anticipa-

tion of substantial forthcoming fiscal restraint, with potential im-

plications for the conduct of monetary policy that are discussed

below.

(10) The staff econometric model of the U.S. and foreign

economies was used to derive the effects relative to the baseline of

the differing assumptions about monetary policy, fiscal policy, and

the labor market. That model embodies neither a productivity bonus in

the long run from permanently reducing inflation nor forward-looking

expectations. Thus, it does not allow for special effects from mone-

tary or fiscal policy credibility. On the supply side of the model as

well as in the baseline, the natural rate of unemployment is assumed

to be 6 percent and the growth rate of potential GDP to be just under

2-1/2 percent. For each year unemployment exceeds its natural rate by

one percentage point, the slack in the labor market tends to reduce

the inflation rate by about 1/2 percentage point.

(11) Under the baseline strategy, the Committee maintains

the federal funds rate at 5-1/2 percent until mid-1998 (Chart 2 and

the table below). With the unemployment rate currently 1/2 percentage

point below its natural rate, the increases in inflation believed to

be already in train would lower real short-term interest rates 75

basis points by mid-1998. But this decline in the real funds rate

does not stimulate activity because the model's estimated equilibrium

real rate falls even faster from the effects of ongoing deficit

reduction. In the latter part of the simulation period, actual and

equilibrium real rates move into rough alignment and the unemployment

rate stabilizes at 6 percent. Meanwhile, the protracted overshoot of

output beyond its potential pushes the inflation rate to 3-1/2 percent

late in the decade. The drop in real interest rates lowers the

9foreign exchange value of the dollar, raising real net exports.

Should financial market participants come to be convinced of the ul-

timate scope of fiscal restraint more promptly than is assumed in the

baseline, long-term interest rates could come under substantial down-

ward pressure in the near term. Absent cutbacks by households and

businesses in anticipation of prospective income losses, output would

be boosted further beyond its potential and inflation would rise

unless policy tightened.

(12) Progress toward price stability under the tighter

policy involves raising the federal funds rate to 7 percent by 1995:Q3

and holding it there through the first half of 1996. This rise in the

federal funds rate appears to be about what is built into the current

term structure of market yields, but its effects on unemployment and

inflation are greater than market participants appear to be anticipat-

ing. The relatively weaker economic activity reflects both the

staff's assumption of tighter fiscal policy and its assessment of less

strength in underlying private demands than appear to be embodied in

market forecasts. Against the backdrop of these underlying forces,

policy action raises the real federal funds rate substantially above

its equilibrium level, producing sufficient slack in the economy to

bring the inflation rate down toward price stability by the end of the

simulation period. In an effort to limit overshooting, the Committee

eases the nominal funds rate beginning in mid-1996 to keep pace with

9. However, the improvement in net exports comes to only a frac-
tion of the reduction in government dissaving, as lower real interest
rates also stimulate domestic fixed investment and discourage some
private saving.



-12-

the decline in inflation and with the ongoing effects of fiscal con-

traction. By the end of the simulation period, the inflation rate has

declined to 1-3/4 percent. The initial degree of tightening required

to achieve this inflation outcome would have to be even greater if

long-term rates tended to decline in anticipation of deficit reduction

without offsetting decreases in private demands.

(13) The alternative scenario presented in Chart 3 considers

some of the consequences if the fiscal restraint implied by the

balanced-budget program never materializes. In these circumstances,

the Committee would have to raise the federal funds rate about a per-

centage point over coming years just to keep the inflation rate from

rising beyond the 3-1/2 percent endpoint of the baseline. Federal

funds rates appreciably above 7 percent for a time would be required

to make significant progress on inflation.

(14) The lack of a pickup of inflation yet, even though the

unemployment rate has dropped to 5-1/2 percent, raises some question

about whether the natural rate of unemployment is lower than 6 per-

cent. Chart 4 considers the implications for monetary policy of a

5-1/2 percent natural rate of unemployment. In these circumstances

the Committee can maintain a 5-1/2 percent funds rate for some time

and still make as much progress toward price stability as with much

higher interest rates when the natural rate is 6 percent. The higher

level of aggregate supply implies that real interest rates don't have

to be as high to restrain aggregate demand relative to the economy's

potential. Consequently, a given degree of slack in the economy and

pace of disinflation can be achieved with lower real interest rates.

Long-Run Ranges

(15) As background for discussion by the Committee of money

and debt ranges for 1995, the table below presents staff projections

of key money and debt aggregates and nominal GDP. Projections are

given for both the Greenbook baseline forecast, which assumes no

change in the federal funds rate through 1996, and for the Greenbook

alternative simulation based on a 150 basis point increase in the

federal funds rate by the end of the third quarter. These also cor-

respond to the baseline strategy and the tighter strategy in the pre-

vious section of this bluebook.

M1 2.3 1-1/2 0 3-1/2 1
Nominal GDP 6.4 4-3/4 4-1/2 5 3-1/2

(16) Under either strategy the growth in nominal GDP moder-

ates substantially in 1995. The higher short-term rates of the

tighter strategy are associated with an elevated path for long-term

rates as well, but much of their effects on spending is not felt until

1996. The different projections for interest rates in 1995 do have

relatively larger effects on the composition of financial flows this

year, and hence on some of the monetary aggregates under the two

strategies.

(17) Despite the appreciable slowing in nominal GDP,

aggregate measures of nonfinancial debt are expected to increase at



-14-

roughly the same pace as in 1994 under the baseline forecast. Debt

velocity would flatten after several years of small increases (chart

5). On the supply side, although competition to extend credit should

remain intense given healthy lender capitalization, banks and other

institutional lenders are not likely to continue to ease standards and

shave already thin lending margins much further. Moreover, many

administered rates, such as those on consumer loans, will continue to

adjust higher in lagged response to earlier increases in market rates

and rising retail deposit costs. This may contribute to a slackening

in household borrowing, which will also be responding to sluggish

housing activity and a slowdown in growth in purchases of consumer

durables as a consequence of past increases in interest rates. But in

the business sector, borrowing should be well maintained, as advances

in capital outlays remain healthy while a flattening in profits con-

strains internal funds, and as stock retirements from mergers and

acquisitions and share buy-back programs continue to be financed in

part by debt. Even though bond issuance should pick up in 1995 as

bond rates move lower under the baseline forecast, the financing needs

of businesses are expected to remain focused on banks and the paper

market. And growth in the debt of state and local governments should

strengthen somewhat, owing primarily to fewer retirements of advance

refunded bonds. Debt of the federal government is projected to grow

about in line with that of nonfederal sectors as government spending

cuts hold down the size of the deficit. The higher interest rates and

moderation in spending associated with the tighter alternative should

damp the growth of private debt and focus borrowing even more on

short-term sources of funds. However, the federal government deficit

could be a little higher under this scenario, limiting the slowing of

overall debt growth.

(18) Continued strong lending at commercial banks and a

resumption of asset expansion at thrifts should show through to faster

M3 growth in 1995 under the Greenbook baseline. Indeed, M3 is pro-

jected to grow 3 percent in 1995, its most rapid rate of expansion

since 1989, producing the smallest rise in velocity since 1988. Re-

ductions in FDIC insurance premiums for commercial banks should lead

to lessened use of nondeposit funding sources outside M3, such as bor-

rowing from foreign offices. Also acting to boost M3 under the base-

line should be institution-only money funds, which are expected to

expand after running off sharply in 1994 in the wake of rising market

interest rates. Under the tighter alternative strategy, the increase

in rates would cause these money funds to drop further, damping M3

growth. Moreover, as in 1994, rising rates may cause banks and

thrifts again to rely more heavily on managed liabilities--including

nondeposit sources of funds--though to a lesser extent than in 1994

owing in part to lower FDIC premiums. As a consequence, with growth

in bank credit strong, growth in M3 would still strengthen from 1994--

to about 2-1/2 percent.

(19) With regard to M2, the effects of slower growth in

nominal spending are more than offset by a narrowing of opportunity

costs in the baseline, and expansion of this aggregate is expected to

pick up to 2-1/2 percent. Velocity would still increase, but at the

slowest rate since 1991 (chart 6). The relative attractiveness of

deposits should be enhanced by a continuing rise in their yields--in

lagged response to the increase in market rates last year--while

short-term market rates in 1995 hold steady. In an environment of

stable or declining long-term rates and a still-steep yield curve

under the baseline case, bond mutual funds will again become attrac-

tive investment options for some savers. After the experience of

1994, however, the staff would not expect a major shift into these

instruments. Consequently, projected growth of M2 would be below the

rates from conventional money demand models--but only by about a per-

centage point, far less than in the 1990-1993 period. The rising

rates of the alternative scenario would significantly damp M2 demand,

as returns on M2 assets continued to lag those available on market

instruments. Under these conditions, M2 might increase only 1-1/2

percent in 1995, registering another sizeable increase in its

velocity.

(20) M1 is forecast to grow only 1-1/2 percent in 1995 with

flat short-term interest rates. The moderation of nominal income

growth contributes to slower currency expansion as well as to damped

demand for transactions balances. Opportunity costs on demand depos-

its and other checkable deposits remain high, and continued adjustment

to this configuration restrains growth of M1 deposits relative to in-

come. M1 velocity increases 3-1/4 percent in 1995, down from 4 per-

cent last year. M1, of course, will be even weaker (about flat) and

its velocity higher under the rising rates of the alternative

strategy.

(21) Shown below for consideration by the Committee are

three alternative sets of 1995 ranges for money and debt.10 While

the Committee has in recent years deemphasized the money and debt

aggregates in its policy deliberations and public statements, choice

of ranges may facilitate the Committee's efforts to communicate to the

in previous years.

public its expectations for financial conditions consistent with

desired economic performance. The first, alternative I, contains the

provisional ranges established last July. Alternative IA makes a

technical upward adjustment to the provisional ranges to account for

the more normal M3 behavior that seems to be evolving. Alternative II

contains a lower range for M2 and maintain the provisional range for

M3.

Alternative Money and Debt Ranges for 1995
(Percent)

Alt. I
(provisional Memo: Staff

ranges) Alt. IA Alt. II Projection
Baseline Tighter

M2 1 to 5 1 to 5 0 to 4 2-1/2 1-1/2
M3 0 to 4 1 to 5 0 to 4 3 2-1/2
Debt 3 to 7 3 to 7 3 to 7 5-1/4 5

(22) Under alternative I, staff baseline projections for

growth of M2 and debt are reasonably well centered. The staff projec-

tion for M3, though, is in the upper end of its alternative I range.

The Committee might wish to consider raising the M3 range for techni-

cal reasons. Now that the contraction in the thrift industry has

ended and bank credit is displaying more typical behavior, M3 is no

longer expected to grow less rapidly than M2, implying an M3 range

more in line with that for M2. This is given as alternative IA.

(23) Being reasonably well centered on projected M2 growth

under the baseline, the alternative I range allows for a good bit of

unpredictability in M2 velocity, as might be implied particularly by

uncertainties regarding the appeal of mutual funds, without breaching

the upper or lower ends of the range. Moreover, this range contains a



-18-

fair amount of scope for the effects of a more restrictive policy

stance; thus, it would accommodate some further policy tightening

should the Committee find the upward drift in inflation in the staff

economic forecast to be unacceptable. Taking a longer perspective,

alternative I might provide a benchmark under the Federal Reserve Act

for long-run growth of M2 "commensurate with the economy's long run

potential to increase production so as to promote effectively the

goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term

interest rates" if it were believed that the unusual factors depress-

ing M2 growth might be abating. This would imply a return to essen-

tially trendless M2 velocity and growth of both M2 and nominal GDP

averaging in the neighborhood of 3 percent over time. In these cir-

cumstances, selection of a lower range for M2 could well require a

reversal later, with attendant possibilities for confusion on the part

of market participants regarding the Committee's intentions.

(24) The lower ranges for M2 growth under alternative II

would be better centered around the slower rate of expansion fore-

cast by the staff under the tighter strategy. Thus, choice of this

alternative might be favored if the Committee wished to underscore its

commitment to resisting higher inflation in the near term and bringing

inflation down over time. The experience of 1994--in particular, M2

growth of only 1 percent--suggests that considerable further policy

tightening, along with some slowing of nominal income growth from the

brisk pace of last year, could result in a shortfall from the 1 per-

cent lower bound of the provisional M2 range. The M2 range of alter-

native II also would better accommodate substantial shortfalls in M2

demand relative to historical patterns, as have characterized a number

of recent years.



-19-

Short-Run Policy Alternatives

(25) Two policy alternatives are presented below for con-

sideration by the Committee. Under alternative B, federal funds would

continue to trade around 5-1/2 percent, in association with keeping

the allowance for adjustment plus seasonal borrowing at $75 million.

Under the tighter alternative C, the federal funds rate would be

raised 1/2 percentage point, to 6 percent, either by an equivalent

rise in the discount rate to 5-1/4 percent with the same borrowing

allowance or by an increase in the borrowing allowance to $125 million

with the same discount rate.

(26) Choice of alternative B might be viewed as appropriate

if the Committee desired additional readings on the extent of the

economy's forward momentum and of underlying inflationary pressures to

provide a firmer basis for judging whether incremental restraint will

be required to damp aggregate demand sufficiently. In the staff

economic forecast, real GDP growth slips below 2 percent in the second

half of this year, even with an unchanged federal funds rate. Some

recent signs of hesitancy in consumer spending and a considerable rise

in inventories might be seen as pointing to a risk in the economic

outlook that, especially with more monetary policy tightening, an

undesirable degree of economic weakness could emerge later this year.

Current levels of real short- and long-term interest rates are some-

what above secular averages and trend growth of money and debt has

been relatively slow, suggesting that monetary policy restraint is

already in place. Moreover, fiscal policy over the next few years may

turn even more restrictive than the staff has built into its forecast,

spurred on by political initiatives to make more visible progress

toward balancing the federal budget early in the next century. The



-20-

effects on U.S. exports of the Mexican crisis, and its possible fur-

ther spillover to other economies represent potential additional de-

pressants on aggregate demand; the current situation could be exacer-

bated by another U.S. monetary policy tightening, which could render

the currencies of those countries even less attractive to interna-

tional investors. Postponing any action would allow time for the

fiscal and Mexican situations to become clearer. Finally, the recent

surprisingly quiescent U.S. price reports may also be signalling that

pressures on domestic productive capacities are not as intense as

conventionally estimated, so that a slowing in economic growth even

along the lines projected by the staff could keep inflation in check.

(27) While market participants currently anticipate a 50

basis point increase in the federal funds rate at this meeting, their

response to the Committee's selection of alternative B would depend on

how the decision were interpreted. On the one hand, the market reac-

tion could be muted if the decision were seen as only a delay in tak-

ing the inevitable next step, perhaps until the Mexican situation

settles down somewhat. In that circumstance, delay might be seen as

the prudent response to a potentially volatile situation, and little

adverse concern about potential inflation would be engendered. Some

edging lower of short-term interest rates might transpire, but bond

yields and the value of the dollar could remain near recent quotes.

On the other hand, the unexpected delay in policy tightening could

create some confusion about the Federal Reserve's intentions and

strategy. If market participants viewed the delay as unwarranted by

the domestic economic situation and as signalling a possible change in

Federal Reserve priorities, heightened inflation concerns could cause

an adverse reaction in the fixed income and foreign exchange markets.



-21-

Such a reaction could be compounded by data suggesting continued

strength in employment and a pickup in inflation--both of which are

expected over the near term in the Greenbook forecast.

(28) Concern about the possibility of an adverse market

reaction, combined with a view that the economic situation still

pointed to significant risk of accelerating inflation, would argue for

the 50 basis point firming in the federal funds rate associated with

alternative C. In a situation in which the economy already has over-

shot its potential, the robust advance of economic activity through

last quarter might well signify the likelihood that monetary policy

still has not put in place sufficient restraint to slow the growth of

future aggregate demand enough to forestall a sustained upward drift

in inflation. Moving up the federal funds rate to 6 percent would

more clearly place real short-term interest rates in a range that

could be characterized as moderately restrictive. Even if slower real

GDP growth emerges than in the staff economic forecast, which assumes

unchanged short-term interest rates, such an outcome would aid in

bringing resource use over time back to less potentially inflationary

and, hence, more sustainable levels.

(29) The 1/2 percentage point rise in the federal funds rate

embodied in alternative C, by matching current financial market expec-

tations, would have few initial repercussions on market interest rates

or exchange rates against our other G-10 trading partners. However,

some strengthening of the dollar against the peso cannot be ruled out.

Banks likely would hike the prime rate by a commensurate amount and

might become somewhat more cautious in their other lending terms and

standards as they saw a slowing in economic growth as more clearly in

train.



-22-

(30) Projected growth of the monetary aggregates from

January to June under the two alternatives is given in the table be-

low, along with implied growth from the fourth quarter of last year.

(31) Under the unchanged federal funds rate of alternative

B, M2 growth would be supported by some narrowing of its opportunity

cost, as offering rates on retail deposits rise further in partial

catch-up to earlier increases in short-term interest rates. Even so,

this aggregate's expansion would remain well below that of nominal

GDP--projected to grow at a 5-1/2 percent rate over the first half of

the year--reflecting continued flows of saving into alternative in-

vestment outlets. The expected M2 growth of 2-1/4 percent from

January to June would place this aggregate in the lower half of its

provisional 1 to 5 percent growth range for 1995. Growth in M3,

forecast at a 2-1/2 percent rate from January to June under alterna-

tive B, would leave this aggregate above the midpoint of its tentative

0 to 4 percent 1995 range. Managed liabilities in the broader ag-

gregate again would help to finance bank credit expansion, which is

projected at a 5 percent rate over the same period. Paced by federal

debt growth of 5-1/2 percent from December to June, domestic nonfinan-

cial debt is foreseen as growing at a 5-1/4 percent rate over the six

months, near the midpoint of its provisional 3 to 7 percent monitoring

range for 1995. Nonfederal debt likely would continue to grow near

the 5 percent pace of last year, with some slowdown in consumer credit

expansion offsetting a probable cessation of the runoff of state and

local debt.

(32) Under alternative C, the 1/2 percentage point higher

funds rate would induce less rapid expansion of M2 and M3 than under

alternative B as opportunity costs resumed their upward movement.

Growth rates of 1-1/2 percent and 2 percent, respectively, from

January to June are anticipated by the staff under alternative C.

11. M1 growth is projected at 1 percent from January to June; the
expansion of the monetary base would be at a 7-1/2 percent rate, with
its total reserves component contracting at a 3-3/4 percent pace.

Directive Language

(33) Presented below for Committee consideration is draft

wording relating to the Humphrey-Hawkins ranges for 1995 and the

operating paragraph for the intermeeting period.

The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and

financial conditions that will foster price stability and

promote sustainable growth in output. In furtherance of

these objectives, the Committee at THIS its meeting in July

reffirmed the ranges it had established RANGES in February

for growth of M2 and M3 of ____ TO ____ 1 to 5 percent and

TO ____ 0 to 4 percent respectively, measured from the fourth

quarter of 1994 [DEL: 1993] to the fourth quarter of 1995 [DEL: 1994].

The Committee anticipated that [DEL: developments contributing

to unusual velocity increases could persist during the year

and that] money growth within these ranges would be consis-

tent with its broad policy objectives. The monitoring range

for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt was SET

(LOWERED TO) maintained at ____ TO ____ [DEL: 4 to 8] percent for the

year. [DEL: For 1995, the Committee agreed on tentative ranges

for monetary growth-, measured from the fourth quarter of

1994 to the fourth quarter of 1995, of 1 to 5 percent for M2

and 0 to 4 percent for M3. The Committee provisionally set

the associated monitoring range for growth of domestic

nonfinancial debt at 3 to 7 percent for 1995.] The behavior

of the monetary aggregates will continue to be evaluated in



-26-

the light of progress toward price level stability, move-

ments in their velocities, and developments in the economy

and financial markets.

OPERATIONAL PARAGRAPH

In the implementation of policy for the immediate

future, the Committee seeks to DECREASE SOMEWHAT/main-

tain/INCREASE SOMEWHAT the existing degree of pressure on

reserve positions, TAKING ACCOUNT OF A POSSIBLE INCREASE IN

THE DISCOUNT RATE. In the context of the Committee's long-

run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic

growth, and giving careful consideration to economic,

financial, and monetary developments, somewhat (SLIGHTLY)

greater reserve restraint would (MIGHT) or (SOMEWHAT)

slightly lesser reserve restraint (WOULD) might be accept-

able in the intermeeting period. The contemplated reserve

conditions are expected to be consistent with MODERATE

modest growth in M2 and M3 over coming months.

APPENDIX A

MONEY STOCK REVISIONS

Measures of the money stock have been revised to incorporate

the results of the annual benchmark and seasonal factor review. The

attached tables compare growth rates of the old and revised series.

These data should be regarded as strictly confidential until their

release to the public in early February.

Benchmark Revisions

Data for the monetary aggregates have been benchmarked using

call reports through September 1994 and other sources. The benchmark

and seasonal review revisions did not affect the annual growth rate of

M2 over 1994. However, they lowered the 1994 growth rate of M1 by 0.1

percentage point and raised the 1994 growth rate of M3 by 0.2 percent-

age point.

The benchmark incorporates historical data for a number of

money market mutual funds that began reporting for the first time

during 1994, raising the levels of M2 and M3 over the years by amounts

that cumulate to $15 billion and $22 billion respectively by late

1994. The benchmark also incorporates new estimates of large time

deposits held by banks. (This item is one of several that are sub-

tracted from gross large time deposits to measure the quantity of such

time deposits held by the nonbank public.) As a result of the new

estimates, this large time deposit netting item revised upward over

the past thirteen years, by as much as $14 billion in the mid-1980s,

thereby reducing the level of M3 by the same amount.



The benchmark also incorporates new estimates of money funds'

holdings of both RPs and Eurodollars, which are netted out of the

aggregates at both the M2 and M3 levels. These revisions, which ex-

tend back to 1984, shifted up the level of M2 by as much as $5 billion

and the level of M3 by as much as $8 billion over the last decade.

The benchmark includes other revisions as well, such as the incorpora-

tion of deposits data taken from the call reports of banks and thrifts

that do not report on one of the more detailed deposits reports.

Seasonal Factor Revisions

Seasonal factors for the monetary aggregates have been re-

vised using the X-11 ARIMA procedure applied to the benchmarked data

through December 1994. The seasonal adjustment procedure used this

year is identical to that employed for the past few years.

Overall, the revisions to seasonal factors slightly shifted

the growth of M1 and M3--but not of M2--from the second half to the

first half of the year 1994. The growth rates for the first half of

1994 were raised 0.2 percentage point for M1 and 0.1 percentage point

for M3, with corresponding downward revisions in the second half of

the year.

1. Targets are for bank credit until 1983; from 1983 onward targets are for domestic nonfinancial sector debt.

2. The figures shown reflect target and actual growth of M1-B in 1980 and shift-adjusted M1-B in 1981. M1-B was relabel-
led M1 in January 1982. The targeted growth for M1-A was 3-1/2 to 6 percent in 1980 (actual growth was 5.0 percent); in
1981 targeted growth for shift-adjusted M1-A was 3 to 5-1/2 percent (actual growth was 1.3 percent).

3. When these ranges were set, shifts into other checkable deposits in 1980 were expected to have only a limited effect on
growth of M1-A and M1-B. As the year progressed, however, banks offered other checkable deposits more actively, and
more funds than expected were directed to these accounts. Such shifts are estimated to have decreased M1-A growth and in-
creased M1-B growth each by at least 1/2 percentage point more than had been anticipated.

4. Adjusted for the effects of shifts out of demand deposits and savings deposits. At the February FOMC meeting, the tar-
get ranges for observed M1-A and M1-B in 1981 on an unadjusted basis, expected to be consistent with the adjusted ranges,
were -4-1/2 to -2 and 6 to 8-1/2 percent, respectively. Actual M1-B growth (not shift adjusted) was 5.0 percent.

5. Adjusted for shifts of assets from domestic banking offices to International Banking Facilities.

6. Range for bank credit is annualized growth from the December 1981-January 1982 average level through the fourth quar-
ter of 1982.

7. Base period, adopted at the July 1983 FOMC meeting, is QII'83. At the February 1983 meeting, the FOMC had adopted
a QIV'82 to QIV'83 target range for M1 of 4 to 8 percent.

8. Base period is the February-March 1983 average.

9. Base period, adopted at the July 1985 FOMC meeting, is QII'85. At the February 1985 meeting, the FOMC had adopted
a QIV'84 to QIV'85 target range for M1 of 4 to 7 percent.

10. No range for M1 has been specified since the February 1987 FOMC meeting because of uncertainties about its underly-
ing relationship to the behavior of the economy and its sensitivity to economic and financial circumstances.

11. At the February 1990 meeting, the FOMC specified a range of 2-1/2 to 6-1/2 percent. This range was lowered to 1 to 5
percent at the July 1990 meeting.

12. At the February 1993 meeting, the FOMC specified a range of 2 to 6 percent for M2, 1/2 to 4-1/2 percent for M3, and
4-1/2 to 8-1/2 percent for domestic nonfinancial debt. These ranges were lowered to 1 to 5 percent for M2, 0 to 4 percent
for M3, and 4 to 8 percent for domestic nonfinancial debt at the July 1993 meeting.
