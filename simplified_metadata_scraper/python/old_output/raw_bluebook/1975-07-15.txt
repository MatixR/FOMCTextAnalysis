Prefatory Note 
 
 
The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version available 
based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the Board 
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was created 
through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned 
versions text-searchable.2   Though a stringent quality assurance process was 
employed, some imperfections may remain. 
 
Please note that some material may have been redacted from this document if that

1  In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic 
format.  All scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced 
tilting) and lightly cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other 
blemishes caused after initial printing). 
 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optical character recognition computer program (OCR) 
first created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, 
staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.  Please note that the numbers and text in charts and

MONETARY AGGREGATES AND
MONEY MARKET CONDITIONS

Recent developments

(1) Growth of M1 accelerated further from May to June, on

average, to about an 18 per cent annual rate, but data for the two

statement weeks ending July 9--a period after Federal tax rebates and

special social security payments had ended--indicate a significant

decline in the level of the money stock. For June and July combined,

therefore, growth in M1 is now projected at an annual rate of about 8½

per cent--well within the Committee's two-month range of tolerance.

While growth of bank time and savings deposits other than large CD's

has also slowed recently, expansion of M2 still appears likely to run

somewhat above its two-month range of tolerance, as the table shows.

Committee on June 26, with the understanding that the added leeway
would be used only if another week's data confirmed excessive strength
in the monetary aggregates.



(2) Until the early days of July, incoming data on the monetary

aggregates were running well ahead of earlier staff projections, implying

growth in M1 and M2 at rates substantially in excess of the Committee's

ranges of tolerance. The Desk responded to this evidence of excessive

monetary growth, first by seeking a Federal funds rate moving up to

around 5¾ per cent, and then by raising the target to the 6 per cent

upper limit of the Committee's range. On June 26 a majority of the

Committee concurred with the Chairman's recommendation to increase the

upper limit of the funds rate range to 6¼ per cent, on the understanding

that the additional leeway would be utilized "only in the event that

another week's data confirm excessive strength in monetary aggregates".

In the early days of July, however, incoming data indicated a weakening

of the monetary aggregates relative to staff projections; thus, the

additional leeway was not used.

(3) Special factors affecting the Federal funds market did

force the average funds rate above 6 per cent, however, in late June

and early July. On the two trading days that preceded the Monday,

June 30 bank statement date, the daily funds rate rose to 6.31 and 6.61

per cent, respectively, as banks positioned themselves to minimize

borrowing on the statement date itself. As a result, even though the

rate then dropped back to around 6 per cent, the average for the week

was 6.31 per cent. On Thursday, July 3, banks scrambled to bolster

their reserve positions before the long holiday weekend. This forced

the funds rate up to about 6¼ per cent. After the holiday weekend,



however, the funds rate fell back, fluctuating generally between 5¾ and

6 per cent. Member bank borrowing at Federal Reserve Banks rose to

nearly $1.5 billion just prior to the end-of-June statement date and

averaged $871 million in that week. In the statement week just ended

member borrowing averaged $223 million, still somewhat on the high side

of recent experience.

(4) Advances in short-term rates during the intermeeting

period were most pronounced in the Treasury bill market. The 3-month

bill--after reaching a peak rate of 6.20 per cent in last Monday's

auction--has traded most recently at around 6 per cent, which compares

with a level just above 5 per cent prevailing at the time of the last

meeting. The advance in bill rates was particularly large because

dealers had previously built up positions in anticipation of the

seasonal contraction in bill supply during the latter half of June.

When the funds rate then began to rise after mid-June, dealers pressed

aggressively to reduce their swollen positions. The impact of this

shift in dealer strategy was augmented when foreign buyers at the

same time began cutting back on demands for bills and the Treasury

shortly resumed its net additions to supply in bill auctions. Other

short-term rates responded to the rise in Federal funds and Treasury

bill rates--showing net advances of 75 to 100 basis points over the

intermeeting period.

(5) In longer-term securities markets, yield advances for

the intermeeting period amounted to about 20-30 basis points on Treasury

and new high grade corporate issues. Most recently, however, these

markets have stabilized, and new issues have been readily distributed.



-4-

Rates on State and local government securities showed little net change

for the period, but they were already close to their 1974 highs. Mortgage

rates have been generally stable, although the volume of mortgage offerings

accepted in FNMA secondary market auctions has grown.

(6) The table on the following page shows (in percentage

annual rates of change) selected monetary and financing flows over

various time periods. Appendix table III compares money supply growth

rates computed on a quarterly-average basis with those computed on a

last-month-of-quarter basis.

Prospective developments

(7) Summarized below for Committee consideration are three

alternative short-run operating specifications for policy. More detailed

figures, including associated longer-run growth rates, are presented in

the tables on pp. 6a and 6b. Alternative operating guides expressed

in terms of nonborrowed reserves, as well as other related reserve

measures, are shown in appendix table IV.

(8) The short-run specifications of alternative B involve

maintenance of prevailing money market conditions between now and the

next Committee meeting. Thus, the Federal funds rate range shown is

centered on 6 per cent. It is expected that growth in M1 and M2 over

the two-month July-August period will slow considerably from the recent

extreme pace. M1 is likely to expand in a 3½-5½ per cent annual rate

range, and M2 in an 8½-10½ per cent range. Preliminary data for M1 in

late June and early July indicate an unwinding of the recent deposit

expansion and support the view that the upsurge in good part reflected

temporary factors (tax rebates and one-time payments to social security

recipients). For July, M1 growth is expected to be slightly negative,

while growth in August is expected to resume at a pace more consonant

with underlying transactions demands, given prevailing money market

conditions.

(9) While alternative B calls for maintenance of prevailing

money market conditions in the short-run, given the temporary slowing

expected in M1 growth, it appears likely that money market conditions will

need to be tightened further later on in order to achieve growth in the

aggregates as indexed by expansion in M1 over the next year at around

the center of the 5-7½ per cent range adopted by the Committee at its

last meeting. The staff at this point believes that the funds rate

might need to rise to the neighborhood of 8 per cent by fall, if the

projected 13 per cent annual rate of increase in nominal GNP for the

second half of 1975 materializes. On that assumption we would expect

M1 growth in the second half of 1975 to be at about a 7 per cent annual

rate; a lower growth rate in the first half of 1976 would hence be

required if the Committee's longer-run M1 target is to be achieved.

(10) In the table on p. 6a, under alternative B, the one-year

growth rate for M1 from June '75 to June '76 is shown as 5¾ per cent--

which is ½ point below the mid-point of the 5-7½ per cent target range.

The staff used such a rate in the alternative B calculations because

the substantial overshoot in M1 growth during June raised the base



level for that month by about $1.7 billion above the estimate made

at the previous FOMC meeting. Over the 12-month period from June 1975 to

June 1976, M1 would therefore have to grow about per cent less than

indicated earlier if the Committee wished to ensure that the June overshoot

did not permanently raise the money supply. The long-run growth rate under

alternative B measured on a quarterly average basis--that is, from the

average level for M1 in the second quarter of 1975 to the average level in the

second quarter of 1976--is around 6¾ per cent, as is also shown in the table.

(11) The same one-year growth rates are shown for alternative C

as for alternative B--with alternative C implying a somewhat different pattern

of monetary growth rates and interest rate movements over the two six month

periods, as will be noted below. Alternative A includes a growth rate for

the June '75-June '76 period of 6¼ per cent from the current estimate of the

June '75 base. Thus, it is keyed to the mid-point of the 5-7 per cent

range adopted by the Committee for that period at its last meeting and, in

effect, "forgives" the June overshoot. This alternative implies M1 growth

from QII '75 to QII '76 of around 6-3/4 per cent.

(12) The short-run specifications for alternative C contemplate

some further near-term tightening of the money market, involving a Federal

funds rate range of 6¼-7¼ per cent for the period until the next meeting.

Adoption of this alternative would introduce an increased monetary restraint

earlier than under alternative B. As a result, the staff would expect that

less additional pressure would have to be exerted on the Federal funds rate



later on to achieve targeted growth in the monetary aggregates over

the next year. Over the July-August period M1 growth under this

alternative would be expected to be at about a 3-5 per cent annual rate,

with growth over the last half of 1975 at around a 6 per cent annual

rate, or one percentage point less than under alternative B.

(13) If the Federal funds rate were to rise in coming weeks

to the 6¾ per cent mid-point of the alternative C range, a very sub-

stantial upward adjustment in other short-term rates would likely ensue.

The 3-month bill rate would probably move up to around 7 per cent, the

commercial paper rate to around 7 per cent, and the general level of

the prime loan rate would adjust upwards. However, if the Federal funds

rate were stabilized at around 6 per cent, as is contemplated under

alternative B, no more than minor upward market rate adjustments, if

any, would seem likely in the weeks immediately ahead. The Treasury

will be adding substantial amounts to weekly and monthly bill auctions,

but private short-term credit demands still appear weak enough so that

Treasury bills can probably be readily marketed to banks and other

investors.

(14) On July 23, the Treasury will announce the terms of its

mid-August refunding of $4.8 billion of maturing publicly-held coupon

issues and will probably also raise some new cash at that time. While

specific maturity areas of the new offerings are still uncertain, it

seems clear that intermediate-term issues will be involved and possibly

a longer-term option as well. In the corporate bond market, a continued

large volume of new issues is expected this summer, though less than in



-10-

June. The municipal volume will also be large, including another

$1 billion from the Municipal Assistance Corporation for New York City,

in late July or August and a third $1 billion by early fall. Given

these near-term demands on bond markets, any appreciable further tightening

of the money market in the weeks ahead would be likely to exert some

additional upward pressure on longer-term interest rates. Such pressures

could be moderated, of course, by postponements of corporate bond issues--

as might happen if borrowers thought that inflation was coming under

control and,therefore,that higher bond yields were not sustainable over

the longer run.

(15) Alternative A involves an easing of money market conditions

over the near-term, which in effect reverses the recent tightening.

Market interest rates would tend to decline in sympathy, but declines

might be quite modest as many market participants may assume that the

easing in money market conditions will be transitory, given the consensus

forecast of a strengthening in economic activity. Indeed, the staff

believes that under this alternative, short-term rates would have to

begin rising again by late summer or early fall to achieve longer-term

objectives for the monetary aggregates.

(16) Under all three alternatives net inflows of time and

savings deposits (other than large money market CD's) to banks and to

thrift institutions are expected to slow from their recent unusually

rapid pace that included the effects on savings of tax rebates and

one-time social security payments. The slowdown would be greatest over

the near-term under alternative C, which involves the probability of a



-11-

significant further rise in short-term market interest rates. Never-

theless, net inflows of consumer-type time deposits are still likely to

be good-sized during the summer. Later this fall reduced inflows might

be expected to exert more pronounced pressures on banks to raise

additional funds in the CD market and on thrift institutions to borrow

from Home Loan Banks and commercial banks under either alternatives B

or C.

Proposed directive

(17) Presented below are four alternative formulations for the

operational paragraph of the directive. The first three are intended to

correspond to the similarly lettered policy alternatives discussed in the

preceding section, while the fourth may be associated with any of the policy

alternatives. In all of the alternatives, it is proposed to include a

reference to Treasury financing because of the regular mid-August financing

that will be announced on July 23.

Alternative A

To implement this policy, while taking account of

THE FORTHCOMING TREASURY FINANCING AND OF developments in

domestic and international financial markets, the Committee

seeks to achieve SOMEWHAT EASIER bank reserve and money

market conditions OVER THE PERIOD IMMEDIATELY AHEAD, [DEL: con

sistent with moderate] PROVIDED THAT growth in monetary

aggregates APPEARS TO BE SLOWING SUBSTANTIALLY [DEL: over the

months ahead].

Alternative B

To implement this policy, while taking account of

THE FORTHCOMING TREASURY FINANCING AND OF developments in

domestic and international financial markets, the Committee

seeks to [DEL: acheive] MAINTAIN ABOUT THE PREVAILING bank reserve

and money market conditions OVER THE PERIOD IMMEDIATELY AHEAD,

[DEL: consistent with moderate] IN THE EXPECTATION THAT growth in

monetary aggregates WILL SLOW SUBSTANTIALLY [DEL: over the months

ahead].



-13-

Alternative C

To implement this policy, while taking account of

THE FORTHCOMING TREASURY FINANCING AND OF developments in

domestic and international financial markets, the Committee

seeks to achieve SOMEWHAT TIGHTER bank reserve and money

market conditions OVER THE PERIOD IMMEDIATELY AHEAD, [DEL: consistent

with moderate] IN ORDER TO ENCOURAGE A SUBSTANTIAL SLOWING OF

growth in monetary aggregates [DEL: over the months ahead].

Possible substitute wording for all alternatives

To implement this policy, while taking account of

THE FORTHCOMING TREASURY FINANCING AND OF developments in

domestic and international financial markets, the Committee

seeks to achieve bank reserve and money market conditions

consistent with moderate growth in monetary aggregates over

the months ahead.
