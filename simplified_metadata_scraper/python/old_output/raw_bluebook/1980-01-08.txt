Prefatory Note 

 
 

The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain. 
 

Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a redaction process that removed information obtained on a 
confidential basis.  All redacted passages are exempt from disclosure under applicable 
provisions of the Freedom of Information Act.    

 

                                                 
1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked 
and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not 
reliably recognized by the OCR process and were not checked or corrected by staff.

Recent developments

(1) M-1 in November and December expanded at annual rates of

1 and 5-1/2 percent,respectively.1/ Over the three months from September

to December, this aggregate grew at.a 3 percent annual rate, below

the objective of just over 4 percent that was consistent with the Committee's

decision at the November FOMC meeting.2/ (Actual and targeted growth rates

for the fourth quarter and the year 1979 are shown in the table below.)

The 7 percent rate of expansion of M-2 for the three-month policy period was

also below its targeted growth rate of 8-1/2 percent, with growth in the

interest-bearing component of this aggregate slowing as the quarter progressed.

and are discussed in appendix A.

2/ At the November meeting, the FOMC decided on a 5 percent growth for M-1
from October to December. Since October had grown by 2½ percent, this
implied growth from September to December of 4.2 percent.

3/ Represents the original 1½ to 4½ percent range specified by the FOMC,
adjusted upward by staff's estimate that ATS effects will reduce measured

M-1 growth by about 1½ percentage points over the longer-run policy period

rather than the 3 percentage points originally estimated in February.
4/ Targeted reserve aggregate paths reflect adjustments made subsequent to the

November FOMC meeting for apparent sustained changes in deposit mix and
higher than anticipated levels of excess reserves.



-2-

Inflows to MMC's and large denomination time deposits accounted for all of

the growth. M-3 registered a 6-1/4 percent rate of growth during the last

three months of the year as thrift institutions--particularly credit unions

and mutual savings banks--were less successful than banks in attracting

deposits in the current environment of high interest rates. As shown in

Charts 1 and 2, the deceleration of growth in the monetary aggregates over

recent months kept the growth of M-1 and M-3 within the Committee's

desired longer-run ranges for the year ending with the fourth quarter of

1979. However, M-2 was somewhat above the upper end of its longer-run

range and--even with the sharp fourth quarter deceleration--bank credit

exceeded its longer-run growth range.

(2) Over the fourth quarter, growth in total reserves was

close to the target path developed by the staff to be consistent with

the Committee's desired growth for the key monetary aggregates, while

growth in nonborrowed reserves was above path, as may be seen from the

bottom panel of the table on the preceding page. Growth in the monetary

base was below target as the public's desire to increase holdings of

currency--the principal component of the base--turned out to be below

even the relatively slow growth that the staff had anticipated. The

total reserves supplied could have been sufficient to offset

the impact on M-1 of weak currency growth since more reserves than

expected were being released in December by shortfalls relative to

expectations in non-money liabilities of banks. However, banks in December

held an unusually and unexpectedly high level of excess reserves, thereby

absorbing the reserves that might otherwise have been used to support money.

(3) In addition, the relation between reserve and money growth

over any particular time span can diverge because of lagged reserve account-

ing. Demand deposits were weak relative to path in December, thereby affect-

ing the demand for total reserves in late December and early January (and

tending to reduce the rate of growth in total reserves on average from

December to January). Given the recent weakness in reserve demand, the

level of borrowings declined from the $1.7 billion level initially set at

the FOMC meeting. Most recently, the Desk had expected a level of borrow-

ings in the $1.1 to $1.3 billion range, reflecting both weakness in required

reserves and an upward adjustment of some $150 million in the nonborrowed

reserve path for the three weeks ending January 9 in view of the projected

weakness in total reserves.

(4) The drop in member bank borrowing since the Committee meet-

ing has not been associated with any decline in the federal funds rate, as

may be seen in the table below. In part, the unusually strong demand by

banks for excess reserves in recent weeks may have held up the funds rate.

But in addition, in December banks may have shied away from use of the

discount window, thereby exerting somewhat pressure on the funds market,

following relatively active use of the window in late October and November.

(5) On balance, since the November FOMC meeting, most short-

term market rates--apart from the funds rate--declined about 20 to 50 basis

points, and yields on Treasury bonds have fallen about 10 basis points.

Yields on high grade corporate and municipal banks, in contrast, have been

essentially unchanged. Mortgage rates have edged higher since the last

Committee meeting, and commitments and lending declined sharply at S&Ls in

November. The Treasury borrowed heavily during the intermeeting period,

raising $3.5 billion of new cash at its regular bill auctions, $5.3 bil-

lion in cash management bills, and another $4.8 billion of new cash in

note auctions. Business borrowing in securities markets, on the other

hand, was relatively light.

(6) The dollar's exchange value has dropped by almost 3 percent

on a weighted-average basis since the last FOMC meeting, reflecting market

reaction to political developments in the Middle East and to a relative

increase in foreign interest rates.

. U.S. authorities purchased, net,

$300 million equivalent of marks toward repayment of Federal Reserve swap

indebtedness through year-end, but in early January U.S. authorities

sold about $220 million equivalent of foreign currencies, mainly DM.

Exchange markets have been thin and volatile--day-to-day fluctuations in

rates and the size of bid-asked spreads have been unusually wide. Gold

resumed its feverish rise, most recently being quoted at $590 per ounce,

up $200 from the last Committee meeting.

Alternative longer-run targets and strategy

(8) This section of the bluebook presents material to provide

a basis for preliminary Committee discussion of longer-run target ranges

for the aggregates for 1980, and perhaps beyond--preparatory to making

a decision on these matters at the February meeting. The table below

shows two alternative sets of ranges for 1980 (QIV '79 to QIV '80) as a

starting point for discussion. The ranges shown in the upper panel are

in terms of monetary aggregates as currently defined, while preliminary

estimates of consistent target ranges based on new definitions of the

aggregates are presented in the lower panel. These new definitions will

be ready for publication in February, and the Committee would presumably

make its decision at the February meeting in terms of the newly defined

measures. (The monetary targets for the current and new series are

reconciled in appendix B.)

(9 ) Alternative I represents a continuation of current policy

with respect to growth of M-1 after adjustment is made for shifts out of

existing demand deposits into ATS accounts. In recent months, it has

been assumed that such shifts would reduce M-1 growth for 1979 as a whole

by about 1-1/2 percentage points, with the bulk of the shift having

occurred in the first half of the year. The staff's judgment at present

is that the initial stock adjustment to the introduction of the new pay-

ments service has been virtually completed and therefore that growth in

ATS accounts in the future will not reflect significant shifts out of
1/

existing demand deposit accounts. Thus, the 4-1/2 to 7-1/2 percent

M-1 growth under alternative I for 1980 would be equivalent--after

allowance for estimated ATS effects--to the 3 to 6 percent target for

1979. The consistent M-2 range for 1980, given the staff's projection

of the time and savings deposit components of M-2, would be 6 to 9 per-

cent. If the present 5 to 8 percent range for M-2 were retained, growth

would probably again be near the upper end of the range.

(10) Alternative II presents a set of monetary growth ranges

for 1980 indexed by a 3 to 6 percent rate of growth for M-1. The

sizable difference in growth rates of M-1 between alternatives I

and II--a difference of 1-1/2 percentage points--has been chosen

to help clarify differential economic impacts of policy alternatives.

Of course, the Committee may wish to choose growth rates between I

1/ Legislation has been enacted that authorizes ATS accounts and
credit union share drafts until March 31 and that also authorizes
NOW accounts in New Jersey. It is expected that the impact of
NOW accounts in New Jersey on measured M-1 growth will be very
small. However, if NOW accounts are extended nationwide later in
1980, this would probably entail large shifts out of existing demand
deposits and a re-evaluation of FOMC targets.



-10-

and II, or even higher than I or lower than II. Economic effects of various

longer-run strategies are noted in the ensuing paragraphs.

(11) The implications for the economy of alternative I, which

assumes a 6 percent M-1 growth over the projection period, are laid out in

detail in the Greenbook. A summary of effects of this assumption on

nominal GNP, real GNP, prices, and unemployment is shown in the first row

of each panel of the table on the next page. The second row of each panel

shows the projected effects of holding M-1 growth to 4½ percent--the mid-

point of the alternative II range--over each of the next three years. As

compared with the higher money growth rate, the lower M-1 growth rate

reduces the rate of increase in prices by about a percentage point after

three years (the end of 1982), but retarding effects on real GNP through-

out the period are substantial. The differential impacts of alternative M-1

strategies assume the rather long lag between monetary policy changes and

price effects that has characterized past experience and that is reflected

in our quarterly econometric model. If price expectations in labor and

product markets have become more directly sensitive to announced monetary

policy, the damping effects on price from a slowing in money growth might

well be more pronounced, and the retarding effects on output less so.

Announcement of a 4½ percent M-1 target may also have a favorable effect

on the exchange value of the dollar since it would probably be taken to

signify stronger efforts to contain inflation. But any benefits achieved

by announcement of a relatively low money growth target would be quickly

dissipated if sustained inflationary momentum, in combination with a need

to moderate economic weakness, made it impractical for the Committee to hold

money growth to the target.

NOTE: Strategy I represents 6% M-1 growth in each year; II represents

4k% growth in each year; III represents 6% M-1 growth in 1980,

5% in 1981, and 4% in 1982; IV represents the same strategy

as III with regard to M-l, but also includes a federal tax

cut. The tax cut amounts to about $30 billion, half of

which reflects a reduction in corporate income tax rates,
effective mid-1980,and the other half a rollback of social

security rate and base increases scheduled for 1981.



-12-

(12) A faster rate of growth in M-1 than the midpoint of

alternative I--say one near the 7 percent upper end of the range--would

raise output and prices,with impacts roughly equal in magnitude to the

constraining effects of alternative II. While such an accelerated rate of

M-1 growth for 1980 could be construed as a temporary accommodation to the

increase in energy prices imposed by OPEC, it is also likely that its

announcement would further fuel inflationary expectations and adversely affect

the dollar in exchange markets. Thus, it could result in an even more

rapid increase in prices, less stimulative impacts on output, and,over

time,further upward pressures on interest rates.

(13) The third row of each panel in the table indicates the

probable results of a strategy of maintaining a 6 percent rate of growth

in M-1 for 1980, but reducing this growth rate gradually over the next two

years to 5 percent and then to 4 percent. This strategy would be

associated with less output loss over the period than strategy II and

would restrain inflation more than strategy I. Whether such a policy

can be undertaken with even less adverse effects on output and employment

depends, of course, on success of the policy in reducing inflationary

expectations, particularly as such expectations affect decisions in labor

and product markets. Announcement of a firmly held intention to lower

growth rates might tend to reduce such expectations more than would

announcement of only, for example, a one-year goal of 6 percent M-1 growth.

On the other hand, announcement of multi-year targets leaves the System

more exposed to the possibility that unforeseen events will require adjust-

ments in the announced targets, and therefore heightens the risk that the

credibility of the targeting process may be impaired.



-13-

(14) While there is not yet any clear Administration or

Congressional impetus for a discretionary fiscal policy change, the fore-

casted weakness of the economy does suggest the distinct possibility of

a tax cut initiative later this year. To provide the Committee with some

idea of how such an action--particularly one designed to have a relatively

favorable price impact--might affect the environment for monetary policy,

a tax cut projection has been included in the fourth row of each panel.

The rate of price increase is reduced by a rollback of social security

tax increases now scheduled for the beginning of 1981. Thisand an assumed

general corporate tax cut taking effect in the third quarter of 1980,also

would tend to increase real spending.

Policy alternatives for the short-run

(15) Shown below for Committee consideration are three alternative

growth rates for the monetary aggregates covering the first three months

of 1980 and associated federal funds rate ranges for the period between

now and the February meeting. Aggregates in the upper panel are based

on the current definitions, which would provide the basis for operations

until the next meeting. Preliminary estimates of consistent rates of

growth on the new definitions are shown in the second panel to help

prepare the transition to such measures at the February meeting. More

detailed data for current definitions, including growth rates on a quarterly

average basis related to alternative longer-run paths, are shown in the

tables on pp. 15 and 16 .

(16) The Committee's choice of a shorter-run monetary growth

path for the first three months of 1980 may depend in part on the longer-

run target it chooses and in part on the pattern of money growth it wishes

to see over the course of the year. (The relation of the proposed shorter-

run targets to the midpoints of longer-run alternatives I and II is displayed

in chart 3, following page 16). Growth through the year can be

targeted at a pace roughly equal to the longer-run objective, or growth

can be higher (lower) early in the year and offsettingly lower (higher)

later in the year. Given the projected pattern of money demand, various

target paths during the year selected by the Committee would have differing

effects on interest rates, on exchange markets, and on the probability of

success in attaining particular long-run targets. In the ensuing analysis

the transactions demand for money is assumed to be weakest in the first

half of the year, when economic activity and nominal GNP growth are

projected to be weakest, and then to strengthen, along with nominal GNP,

in the second half.

(17) The recent relatively slow growth of M-1 raises the possi-

bility that the record level of interest rates following the October 6

program may have induced another round of one-time shifts out of existing

money balances. Even if any such shift has about run its course,

demands for cash in the first quarter of 1980 may still be fairly weak,

given the less than 5 percent annual rate of increase in nominal GNP that

is projected for that period. Thus, achievement of the 6 percent annual

growth rate for M-1 over the first quarter in alternative A--which appears to

involve increases of about 8 and 3 percent in the monetary base and total

reserves, respectively--may be accompanied by relatively substantial

declines of interest rates from current levels.

(18) The federal funds rate may drop to, or conceivably below,

the bottom of the 10½ to 15½ percent range specified for alternative A

over the next few weeks, and the 3-month bill rate could be in a 9 to 10

percent area. If the discount rate were not changed from the present

12 percent level, borrowings would decline to minimal levels of about

$200 to $300 million, and nonborrowed reserves would expand by about 15

percent over the quarter. Of course, if the discount rate were reduced

significantly under the circumstances, member bank borrowing would be

somewhat higher.

(19) A sizable rally in bond markets would seem likely under

this alternative, even though some pick-up in bond offerings may be expected

as corporations take the opportunity to fund large short-term indebtedness.



-18-

Mortgage rates also would decline, as spreads widen against bond yields

and thrift institutions become more confident about the availability of

lower cost deposits to fund mortgage acquisitions.

(20) The substantial decline in short rates that appear to

be implied by alternative A probably would be accompanied by significant

downward pressures on the international value of the dollar, especially

if the dollar also remains under pressure because of the crises in the

mid-East. Downward pressures would be strongest if market participants

come to expect a further decline in U.S. interest rates and interpret the

decline of interest rates as a sign that the Fed's resolve to combat

inflation has weakened.

(21) However, assuming that the decline in economic activity

has begun to abate by summer, but that the rate of inflation has not slowed

significantly, interest rates would probably begin rising during the spring

or summer if M-1 growth over the year 1980 were held to 6 percent or less,

as shown in the first and fourth columns of appendix C. For a given longer-

run growth rate, interest rates would be at higher levels by year-end under

this alternative than under alternatives B and C, partly because it will

provide a little greater stimulus to economic activity and partly because

the larger expansion of M-1 in the first quarter will allow less scope to

accommodate the subsequent increase in the transactions demand for money as

nominal GNP expands in the second half.

(22) In order to achieve the 5 percent rate of growth of M-1

in the first quarter specified under alternative B, a decline in interest

rates from current levels would also be likely. The funds rate, for example,

would probably drop over the next few weeks into the lower half of the 11½

to 15½ percent rate range shown for this alternative, with the 3-month bill

rate declining to the 10 to 11 percent area. Over the first quarter the



-19-

monetary base and total reserves might have to increase at about 7½ and 2½

percent rates, respectively, and with member bank borrowings falling to

around $800 to $900 million, nonborrowed reserves would expand by about

8 percent over the 3-month period.

(23) Even the more modest decline in money market rates

associated with alternative B is likely to induce a rally in bond markets

as it becomes clear that interest rates have peaked. The decline in

mortgage rates would probably be moderate, though. Net inflows of funds

to thrift institutions are likely to pick up only modestly from their

second half of 1979 pace, and costs of such funds would not decline as

much as under alternative A. The exchange value of the dollar under

alternative B is likely to decline somewhat as market participants focus

on the decline of interest rates, but there would be less downward pressure

than under alternative A, in part because any interest rate declines under

alternative B would be associated with slower money growth.

(24) The more modest money growth over the next few months under

alternative B provides more scope for expansion in M-1 in the second half

of 1980 than does alternative A. Moreover, the smaller reduction of interest

rates, as compared with alternative A, would provide less stimulus to nominal

GNP and money demand later this year. Thus, under this alternative interest

rates may drift downward through summer under longer-run alternative I,

shown in the second column of appendix C. However, under the more restrictive

longer-run policy of alternative II, interest rates would probably begin

rising by spring as the quantity of money demanded tended to expand more

rapidly than the supply that would be provided consistent with the 4½ percent

midpoint of the alternative II path.



-20-

(25) Alternative C contemplates a rate of growth of M-1 of

about 4 percent in the first three months of 1980, which, given the

staff's GNP outlook, would probably involve little, if any, decline in

interest rates from current levels in that period. The funds rate may be

a bit below the 13 percent midpoint of the 11½ to 16 percent federal funds

rates specified for this alternative, with the 3-month bill rate around

11½ to 12 percent. The first quarter rate of increase in the monetary base

and total reserves is likely to be about 7 and 1½ percent, respectively;

assuming borrowings of about $1¼ billion or a bit higher, nonborrowed

reserves might increase at about a 4 percent rate. Longer-term interest rates

probably would decline no more than modestly from current levels over the

next few weeks, as it became clear to market participants that, despite

relatively slow growth in M-1, very little ease was developing in money

market conditions. Alternative C would tend to help support the exchange

value of the dollar since it would be associated with maintenance of a

relatively high level of interest rates.

(26) The relatively high level of interest rates of alternative C

in the first quarter would probably not be long sustained, however, if the

Committee sought a 6 percent growth rate for M-1 for the year 1980. The

funds rate would be expected to decline by early spring, and reach levels

by year-end lower than under alternative B. However, should the Committee

seek to restrain M-1 growth to a 4½ percent rate during 1980, interest

rates would probably change little over the balance of the year.



-21-

Directive language

(27) Given below are suggested operational paragraphs for

the directive consistent with the form of the directive adopted at

the October and November meetings. It calls for expansion of reserve

aggregates at a pace consistent with the desired rates of growth in

M-1 and M-2 over the first quarter of 1980, provided that the federal

funds rate on a weekly average basis remains within a specified range.

The range for the funds rate adopted on November 20 is shown in strike-

through form.

In the short run, the Committee seeks [DEL: to restrain

expansion of reserve aggregates [DEL: to a pace] consistent with

[DEL: deceleration in] growth of M-1, AND M-2 [DEL: , and M-3 in] OVER the

[DEL: fourth] FIRST quarter of [DEL: 1979 to] 1980 AT ANNUAL rates OF ABOUT

____ AND ____ PERCENT RESPECTIVELY [DEL: that would hold growth

of these monetary aggrgegates over the whole period from the

fourth quarter of 1978 to the fourth quarter of 1979 within

the-Committee's longer-run ranges], provided that in the period

before the next regular meeting the weekly average federal

funds rate remains within a range of [DEL: 11½ to 15½] ____ TO ____

percent.

If it appears during the period before the next

meeting that the constraint on the federal funds rate is

inconsistent with the objective for the expansion of reserves,

the Manager for Domestic Operations is promptly to notify the

Chairman who will then decide whether the situation calls for

supplementary instructions from the Committee.

Appendix A

BENCHMARK REVISIONS TO THE MONETARY AGGREGATES

Money stock measures and related data have been benchmarked to the

final December 1978 and preliminary March 1979 call reports. The December

1978 M-1 benchmark was minor, raising the level of the series about $300

million in that month. The March adjustment was somewhat larger and raised

the level of M-1 an additional $700 million. By the end of 1979 the

benchmarked M-1 is about $1.5 billion higher than the old series.

The December 1978 benchmark adjustment raised the level of M-2

about $3.2 billion. Most of this adjustment reflected strong growth in

time deposits at foreign related institutions in late 1978. The March

benchmark raised the M-2 series an additional $1.2 billion and by the end

of 1979 the level of the revised series was about $4 billion higher than

the old series.

The attached table shows the impact of the benchmark revisions

on annual, quarterly and monthly M-1 and M-2 growth rates. M-1 growth was

unchanged for the year 1978, but M-2 growth was raised about a quarter of

a percentage point from 8.4 to 8.7 percent. In 1979 the growth rates of

both measures were raised slightly--M-1 from 5.1 to 5.4 percent and M-2

from 8.0 to 8.3 percent.

The benchmarked series will be published on January 10 and are

confidential until then.
