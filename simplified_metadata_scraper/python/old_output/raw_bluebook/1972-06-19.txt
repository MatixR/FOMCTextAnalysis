Prefatory Note 
 
 
The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version available 
based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the Board 
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was created 
through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned 
versions text-searchable.2   Though a stringent quality assurance process was 
employed, some imperfections may remain. 
 
Please note that some material may have been redacted from this document if that

1  In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic 
format.  All scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced 
tilting) and lightly cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other 
blemishes caused after initial printing). 
 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optical character recognition computer program (OCR) 
first created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, 
staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.  Please note that the numbers and text in charts and 
tables were not reliably recognized by the OCR process and were not checked or corrected by staff.

MONETARY AGGREGATES AND
MONEY MARKET CONDITIONS

Recent developments

(1) Through mid-June reserves available to support private

nonbank deposits (RPD) have been running below the mid-point of the

path specified at the last meeting of the Committee. Partially pro-

jected data for required reserves for the last half of June suggest a

somewhat larger shortfall unless excess reserves rise substantially.

If excess reserves in the last two weeks of the month were to average

no more than the $150 million expected at the time of the last FOMC

meeting, the May-June RPD growth would be 7 per cent at an annual rate,

slightly below the Committee's 7-1/2 to 11-1/2 per cent target range,

as shown in the attached Table 1.

(2) Growth in all of the key money and credit aggregates fell

a little short of expectations in May but, as the attached Table 2 shows,

deviations were not very significant. M1 increased at about a 4 per

cent annual rate, M2 at nearly a 9 per cent rate, and the adjusted credit

proxy at about a 15 per cent rate. Shortfalls appear to have continued

in the first half of June.

(3) The Federal funds rate haS averaged just under 4-1/2 per

cent in the two most recent statement weeks. This is close to 25 basis

points above the level prevailing at the time of the last meeting, and

still in the low end of the 4-1/4 to 5-1/2 per cent range that was

thought to have been consistent with growth in RPD at the mid-point of

its targeted range. Borrowings from the discount window--averaging about



-2-

$135 million during the past three statement weeks--have also been moderately

below levels thought necessary to restrain growth in the aggregates within

targeted ranges. In the absence of any indications of a slowing in economic

growth, it seems probable that there has been an only temporary shortfall in

private demand for cash balances relative to GNP. However, the possibility

that there has been some overestimation of the basic intensity of demands for

cash associated with GNP growth cannot be ruled out.

(4) The increase that had developed in the Federal funds rate

following the last Committee meeting was not immediately reflected in short-

term rates generally. The relative absence of upward pressures on short rates

was probably attributable largely to the combination of sizable Federal debt

repayment in June and market expectations that the Treasury would not borrow

new funds until the latter part of July. However, most recently bill rates

have risen, with the 3-month bill rate around 3.95 per cent.

(5) This outlook on Treasury financing along with some lightening

of new issue calendars in both markets, contributed to a general strengthening

of corporate and municipal bond markets during May. Encouraged by this im-

proved atmosphere, underwriters bid rather aggressively for new issues, and

bond yields declined generally. These May declines have since been erased,

however, as investor resistance to aggressive underwriting pricing forced

snydicate terminations.

(6) The following table compares seasonally adjusted annual

rates of change in major financial aggregates for recent periods.

Prospective developments

(7) The three alternative patterns of monetary aggregates and

money market conditions summarized below differ little from those presented

at the time of the last FOMC meeting. Given recent deposit flows, growth

in M1 for the second quarter is less than earlier indicated, but the

alternatives proposed for third quarter rates of growth in M 1 are unchanged.

We have reduced the range of member bank borrowings and lowered the bottom

end of the Federal funds rate range,since pressures on the money market and on

the discount window in the past several weeks have been less than anticipated

for given increases in the monetary aggregates. But we have not lowered the

top end of the funds rate ranges because we still feel that basic money demands

will be strong, given the vigorous GNP growth projected, and that, therefore,

there are some odds--not trivially small--that restraint of growth in the

aggregates can require a considerable tightening of the money market. More

detailed monthly and quarterly figures, including data for total reserves and

RPD, are shown on the next two pages.

(8) The first two alternatives encompass recently prevailing

money market conditions, taken to be typified by a Federal funds rate

aroung 4-3/8--4-1/2 per cent. But under alternative A, the staff would

expect the funds rate to edge down from current levels, while under

alternative B it is likely to edge up as reserve provision through open

market operations is held back in the face of strengthening demand for money.

M1 growth is expected to be largest early in the third quarter--with the

July rise estimated at around a 9 per cent annual rate--as U. S. Government

deposits decline sharply on balance.

(9) For several weeks the 3-month bill rate has been seasonally

low relative to the Federal funds rate. Over the course of July the bill

rate normally rises relative to the funds rate. The seasonal rise--or at

least the full extent of it--may be delayed this year if the Treasury does

not begin its third quarter cash borrowing until late July or early August.

We have assumed a fairly sizable cash borrowing around mid-July. And we

would expect significant upward pressures on the bill rate to begin emerging

it least by the latter part of July, with the full force of such pressures

possibly not developing until later in the summer. Between now and the

July 18 FOMC meeting, a 3-month bill rate in a 3-3/4--4-1/2 per cent range

might be anticipated, assuming money market conditions around those currently

prevailing, but with the rate moving higher if the funds rate were to move

above 4-3/4 per cent.

(10) As the third quarter progresses, growth in time deposits

other than large CD's is expected to slow, reflecting rising short-term

market interest rates. The slowdown does not look as if it will be as

sharp as we had earlier expected in view of the strong performance of



such deposits in recent weeks and the failure of short-term market rates

thus far to show significant increases. Even so, M2 is projected to grow

more slowly in the third quarter than in the second under alternatives B

and C, and at just about the same rate under alternative A.

(11) The recent strong business loan demand at banks is

expected to persist in the summer. And with diminished net inflows of

time deposits other than large CD's, banks can be expected to bid fairly ag-

gressively for large negotiable CD funds. Nevertheless, bank credit

expansion--as measured by the proxy--may be very slow in June and July

as continued declines in U. S. Government deposits divert funds from

banks. Over the third quarter as a whole, bank credit growth is likely

to be somewhat slower than in the second quarter.

(12) Between now and the next meeting of the Committee,

there is unlikely to be much upward pressure on long-term interest

rates, given the moderate credit demands in prospect, unless money

market conditions become significantly firmer. If the Treasury should

elect to undertake an advance refunding in the latter part of June,

some modest near-term increase in Treasury yields might be expected,

but the spill-over of such yield increases to other long-term markets

would probably not be very large. Taking a somewhat longer view, as

the summer progresses the expected rise in short-term rates, fueled by

the increased cash needs of the Treasury, will probably lead to some

increase in long-term interest rates generally.



-9-

Proposed directive

(13) Three alternative formulations for the operational

paragraph of the directive are presented below. They might be associated

with the correspondingly lettered patterns of growth in the aggregates

described in the preceding section.

(14) Alternative A.

"To implement this policy, while taking account of

[DEL: capital market developments and] possible Treasury [DEL: refunding]

FINANCING, the Committee seeks to achieve bank reserve

and money market conditions that will support [DEL: somewhat slower]

growth in monetary aggregates over the months ahead AT SOMEWHAT

FASTER RATES THAN IN RECENT MONTHS."

(15) Alternative B.

"To implement this policy, while taking account of

[DEL: capital market developments and] possible Treasury [DEL: refunding]

FINANCING, the Committee seeks to achieve bank reserve and

money market conditions that will support [DEL: somewhat slower]

MODERATE growth in monetary aggregates over the months ahead."

(16) Alternative C.

"To implement this policy, while taking account of

capital market developments and possible Treasury [DEL: refunding]

FINANCING, the Committee seeks to achieve bank reserve and

money market conditions that will support [DEL: somewhat slower]

growth in monetary aggregates over the months ahead AT

SOMEWHAT SLOWER RATES THAN IN RECENT MONTHS."



-10-

(17) Deletion of the reference to capital market develop-

ments is proposed for alternatives A and B in view of the recent and

prospective moderation of credit demands in capital markets. However,

the Committee might wish to consider including such a reference in

association with alternative C because of the stronger upward pressures

in long-term markets that could develop under that alternative.

(18) The other differences in language among these alter-

natives are in the descriptions of desired growth in monetary aggre-

gates. In alternative A the words "at somewhat faster rates than in

recent months" are designed to place an accent on the objective under

this alternative of achieving some pick-up from the average rates of

May and June. In B the term "moderate" is suggested in place of the

previous "somewhat slower" to avoid any implication that the Committee

seeks a continued slowing of monetary growth from the rates recently

achieved. As indicated, it is proposed to retain the phrase "somewhat

slower" in alternative C.
