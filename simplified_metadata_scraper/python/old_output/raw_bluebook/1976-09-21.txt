The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version available 
based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the Board 
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was created 
through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned 
versions text-searchable.2   Though a stringent quality assurance process was 
employed, some imperfections may remain.

MONEY MARKET CONDITIONS

Recent developments

(1) M1 in the August-September period appears to be increasing

at a rate slightly below the mid-point of the Committee's 4-8 per cent

operating range. However, expansion at banks of time and savings deposits

other than money market CD's has been considerably stronger than anticipated,

and growth in M2 appears to be running above the mid-point of its two-month

range. Deposit inflows at nonbank thrift institutions also picked up in

August, and this higher rate of growth appears to have continued in early

September.

(2) Nonborrowed reserves appear to have increased at about a

1-1/4 per cent annual rate in the August-September period.1/ A continued

decline in outstanding large CD's released reserves to support expansion

in other deposits. Moreover, much of the growth in deposits has occurred

in categories--such as savings deposits--with relatively low reserve

requirements.

(3) Given the behavior of the aggregates, the Desk has continued

to aim at a Federal funds rate around 5-1/4 per cent throughout the

inter-meeting period. Short-term credit demands have been generally weak

since the last meeting of the Committee, as businesses paid down bank debt

and the volume of commercial paper and Treasury bill issues remained

unchanged. Most short-term rates declined somewhat over the inter-meeting

period, but most of the downward adjustment occurred today following

publication of the latest weekly M1 figure yesterday.

(4) Long-term rates have declined 10 to 20 basis points since

the last Committee meeting, in part because many investors seemed to

believe that the flow of economic data suggested a further moderation in

the prospective pace of economic expansion and inflation. The largest

declines were in the corporate sector, where the volume of new bond issues

was relatively light. Issues of state and local government securities

reserves in the weeks between the August and September meetings rela-

mittee's short-run ranges for monetary growth.

remained relatively large, and the U.S. Treasury raised a substantial

additional volume of new money through sales of intermediate-term coupon

issues.

Prospective developments

(6) Alternative short-run specifications for the monetary

aggregates and the Federal funds rate are summarized below for Committee

consideration. (More detailed data, as well as longer-run projections,

are shown in the tables on pp. 5a and 5b).

M2  10-14 9-13 8-12

Federal funds rate 4¼-5¼ 4¾-5¾ 5¼-6¼
(inter-meeting period)

(7) With economic activity projected to expand at a moderate

rate over the next few months, M1 is also expected to continue rising

over the September-October period at a rate little different from that

of recent months. Under alternative B, given prevailing money market

conditions--as indexed by a Federal funds rate around 5¼ per cent--

M1 will probably grow in a 4-8 per cent annual rate range.

(8) M2 may rise in a 9-13 per cent annual rate range under

alternative B over the September-October period. In recent weeks, expansion

of time and savings deposits other than large money market CD's has been

substantially more rapid than expected. Although we have assumed that

the rate of expansion will slow somewhat over the course of the inter-

meeting period, we still expect such deposits to rise at about a 15 per cent

annual rate on balance from August to October. Much of this reflects our

assumption that the rate of increase in savings deposits at banks and--

also at thrift institutions--will remain sizable so long as the 3-month

Treasury bill rate remains in the neighborhood of 5-1/8 per cent.

(9) Business loan demands on banks are likely to remain

sluggish over the next few weeks, although they may strengthen later

in the fall if and as the rate of business inventory accumulation once

again accelerates. Over the near-term, banks are likely to continue

utilizing large inflows of funds into time and savings deposits other than

large CD's to increase holdings of relatively high-yielding Treasury coupon

issues, including the two-year Treasury note to be auctioned on September 21

and a just announced 5-year note to be auctioned on September 28 (raising

$2 billion of new cash). Banks will also probably permit the outstanding

volume of large negotiable CD's to decline somewhat further over the

weeks immediately ahead, and the bank credit proxy over the September-

October period may rise at about a 4 per cent annual rate.

(10) Private credit demands on the open market may strengthen

a little from the summer pace. In particular, substantially more new

corporate bond offerings appear to be scheduled for October than had been

marketed during the summer months, although part of the increase is

seasonal. A sizable volume of new state and local government issues

continues to be projected for early fall. Treasury credit needs are likely

to be relatively moderate in the early fall, given the large end-of-

September cash balance now in prospect, but such needs will probably

pick up as the quarter progresses.

(11) Alternative A involves an easing of the money market,

with the funds rate range centered on 4¾ per cent. Such an easing would



probably be accompanied by a decline in the Treasury bill rate to the

4¾ per cent area also and by a drop in the 3-month commercial paper

rate to around 5 per cent. In response to these market rate declines, the

bank prime loan rate would probably adjust downward. Longer-term market

rates probably also would move down somewhat further, but the declines

could be limited as borrowers accelerate offerings in anticipation

of a later reversal in yields. Primary mortgage market rates--which have

changed little in recent weeks despite declines in corporate bond yields--

would probably begin to drop noticeably.

(12) The easing in short-term rates under alternative A

would likely be accompanied by a slightly stronger expansion in M1 over

the short-run--with the M1 growth range estimated to be 4 -8 per cent

for the September-October period. There would be some strengthening

in inflows of time and savings deposits other than large CD's, particularly

savings deposits. However, if credit demands on banks remain relatively

weak over the next few weeks, banks are likely to become less active in

soliciting consumer-type time deposit funds. Banks would probably continue

to run-off large money market CD's, while at the same time taking advantage

of the lower level of market rates to lengthen maturities on those new CD's

that they do issue.

(13) The tightening of money market conditions contemplated

under alternative C--with the funds rate range centered on 5¾ per cent--

might well lead to fairly sharp upward adjustments in market rates over

the next few weeks. Dealer bill positions are currently very large, and

the 3-month bill rate could move up to the 5 -6 per cent area. Holdings



of coupon issues are also fairly sizable, and strong efforts to secure

the paper profits on such positions could lead to an appreciable rise

in longer-term Treasury yields, with spill-over effects on other

longer-term markets.

(14) A little slower growth in the monetary aggregates would,

of course, be likely to develop over the September-October period under

alternative C than under either of the other two alternatives. In

particular, growth in savings deposits may well come to a halt, at least

temporarily, as depositors shift to higher-yielding market instruments.

Banks may seek to compensate for this to some extent by more aggressive

offerings of time deposits, including large CD's. On balance, under this

alternative we would expect M1 over the forthcoming two-month period to

expand in a 3½-7½ per cent annual rate range and M2 in an 8-12 per cent

range.

(15) All of the short-run alternatives shown would be consistent

with the Committee's current longer-run growth ranges for the monetary

aggregates covering the period from QII '76 to QII '77. The staff still

believes that interest rates will probably have to rise--perhaps

beginning late in the year--to achieve a longer-run M1 growth rate of 5¾

per cent, the mid-point of the Committee's range. In view of the apparent

strengthening of time and savings deposit flows, and allowing for a some-

what lower average level of interest rates during the year ending mid-'77,

the staff now expects longer-run growth rates for M2 and M3 to be near the

tops of their ranges. The longer-run Federal funds rate patterns implied

by the alternatives are shown in appendix Table II.



Proposed directive

(16) Given below is a proposed operational paragraph for the

directive if the Committee should wish to return to language that

emphasizes desired growth in monetary aggregates. No alternatives are

presented for this formulation, in the expectation that the reference

to desired growth will be taken to apply to the longer-term targets and

that at this meeting the Committee will not reconsider those targets.

"Monetary Aggregates" Proposal

To implement this policy, while taking account of

developments in domestic and international financial markets,

the Committee seeks to [DEL: maintain prevailing] ACHIEVE bank reserve

and money market conditions CONSISTENT WITH MODERATE GROWTH IN

MONETARY AGGREGATES over the period [DEL: immediately] ahead [DEL: provided

that monetary aggregates appear to be growing at about the rates

currently expected].

(17) Should the Committee desire to continue placing main

emphasis on bank reserve and money market conditions, the language needed

would depend on the specific conditions sought. Three alternative "money

market" directives, intended to correspond to the similarly lettered

policy alternatives, are given below.



-10-

Alternative "Money Market" Proposals

Alternative A

To implement this policy, while taking account of develop-

ments in domestic and international financial markets, the Com-

mittee seeks to [DEL: maintain prevailing] ACHIEVE SOMEWHAT EASIER bank

reserve and money market conditions over the period immediately

ahead, provided that monetary aggregates appear to be growing at

about the rates currently expected.

Alternative B

To implement this policy, while taking account of develop-

ments in domestic and international financial markets, the Com-

mittee seeks to maintain prevailing bank reserve and money market

conditions over the period immediately ahead, provided that mone-

tary aggregates appear to be growing at about the rates currently

expected.

Alternative C

To implement this policy, while taking account of develop-

ments in domestic and international financial markets, the Com-

mittee seeks to [DEL: maintain prevailing] ACHIEVE SOMEWHAT FIRMER bank

reserve and money market conditions over the period immediately

ahead, provided that monetary aggregates appear to be growing at

about the rates currently expected.



APPENDIX A

Comparison of Actual and Targeted Reserves

The table below compares the actual average level of reserves

for the five-week period ending September 22 with the "targeted level

that had been thought consistent with the mid-points of the short-run

ranges for the monetary aggregates adopted at the last FOMC meeting.

Actual1/ Targeted Difference

1. (2+3) Nonborrowed reserves 34,321 34,333 -12

2. Required reserves 34,138 34,241 -103

3. (4-5) Free reserves 183 92 91

4. Excess reserves 251 200 51

5. Member bank borrowing 68 108 -40

6. (1+5) Total reserves 34,390 34,441 -51

7. Currency 81,655 81,537 118

8. (6+7) Monetary base 116,045 115,978 67

s

As can be seen from the table, actual nonborrowed reserves turned

out to be very close to the "targeted" level. Banks held more free

reserves than the staff had expected, reflecting both a lower level of

borrowing and greater demand for excess reserves by banks than anticipated.

Meanwhile, actual required reserves were about $100 million below expecta-

tions. Somewhat more money growth than anticipated took the form of currency,

which required no reserves, and the average reserve ratio against deposits

also turned out to be lower than expected.

1/ Includes week of September 22, which is partly estimated.



A- 2

With borrowing lower than expected, total reserves were also

somewhat below their targeted level, while the monetary base was stronger

than targeted. The strength in the monetary base reflected greater

currency expansion than expected at the time of the last FOMC meeting.

**Monthly averages for excess reserves and borrowings are weighted averages of statement week figures.

NOTE: Government security dealer trading positions are on a commitment basis. Trading positions, which exclude Treasury securities financed by repurchase
agreements maturing in 16 days or more, are indicators of dealer holdings available for sale over the near-term. Underwriting syndicate positions consist
of issues still in syndicate, excluding trading positions. The basic reserve deficit is excess reserves less borrowing at Federal Reserve less net Federal
funds purchases. Weekly data are daily averages for statement weeks, except for corporate and municipal issues in syndicate which are Friday figures.

are for 60-89 day and 90-119 day ranges, respectively). For columns 7 and 10, the weekly date is the mid-point of the calendar week over which data are
averaged. Columns 8 and 9 are 1-day quotes for Friday and Thursday, respectively, following the end of the statement week. Column 11 gives FNMA auction
data for Monday preceding the end of the statement week. Column 12 is a 1-day quote for the Monday preceding the end of the statement week. The FNMA
auction yield is the average yield in bi-weekly auction for short-term forward commitments for Government underwritten mortgages. GNMA yields are average
net yields to investors on mortgage-backed securities for immediate delivery, assuming prepayment in 12 years on pools of 30-year FHA/VA mortgages carry-
ing the coupon rate 50 basis points below the current FHA/VA ceiling.
