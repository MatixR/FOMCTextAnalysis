Prefatory Note 

 
 

The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain. 
 

Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a redaction process that removed information obtained on a 
confidential basis.  All redacted passages are exempt from disclosure under applicable 
provisions of the Freedom of Information Act.    

 

                                                 
1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked 
and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not 
reliably recognized by the OCR process and were not checked or corrected by staff.

Recent developments

(1) Rates of expansion of M-1A and M-1B were relatively rapid

in October, though below rates of the previous two months. Growth in M-2

and M-3 accelerated slightly as inflows of time deposits at banks and thrifts

strengthened and withdrawals from money market mutual funds slowed. The

recent growth of M-1A-which was well above the Committee's target path

for the last three months of the year--puts it within one-half percentage

point of the upper end of its long-run range for the year, while growth rates

of the other aggregates are now almost one percentage point above longer-run

upper limits (in the case of M-1B and M-2) or equal to the upper limit (in

the case of M-3). Though business lending continued to expand rapidly, growth

of bank credit declined somewhat from the September rate and the year-to-date

growth in this aggregate remains in the lower half of its longer-run range.

(2) Total reserve growth moderated in October,reflecting

a slowing of demand deposits. Nevertheless, over the intermeeting period

required reserves outran the System's provision of nonborrowed reserves,

leading to increasing member bank borrowings and firming conditions in

the funds market.1/ In the most recent statement week, borrowings reached

a level of about $2 billion, somewhat higher than expected (a $1.6 billion

level of borrowing had been implied by the nonborrowed path). The federal

funds rate rose from around 12½ percent in mid-October to an average of 14-5/8

percent in the most recent full statement week. In recent days, funds have

traded around 14 percent.

(3) Since the last meeting, short-term interest rates have

risen about 1 3/4 to 2 1/4 percentage points on balance, while bond yields

increased about 3/4 of a percentage point. Municipal bond yields have

now returned to their all-time highs set last spring, and corporate and

Treasury bond yields are also close to their earlier peaks. A one per-

centage point increase in the basic discount rate to 12 percent, and a

surcharge of 2 percentage points applicable to large frequent borrowers

of adjustment credit, were announced after the markets closed on Friday.

(4) The Treasury continued to be a large borrower in the inter-

meeting period, raising about $5 1/4 billion in cash through bills and another

$4 1/4 billion through coupon issues. Short-term credit demands of business

remained strong as rate relationships continued to induce shifting of business

credit demands from the capital market. Such demands continued to be

focussed on commercial banks, with commercial paper run-offs accelerating in

response to aggressive bank loan pricing. Reflecting both rising bond rates

and the increasing cost of deposit funds, the average commitment rate on

conventional mortgages at S&L's rose by 30 basis points over the inter-

meeting period to 14.08 percent; even at that rate the spread of the mortgage

rate over the corporate bond. rate remained narrow by historical standards.

In some areas of the country mortgage rates of 15 to 16 percent have been

posted.

(5) Reflecting the further increase in U.S. interest rates, while

rates abroad were essentially unchanged, the weighted average foreign

exchange value of the dollar has risen by more than 2 percent, on balance,

since the last FOMC meeting.

Prospective developments

(7) The upper panel of the following table shows three alternative

sets of targets for the monetary aggregates for the current quarter; for

comparative purposes, the last column indicates the targets for this period

established at the last Committee meeting. The lower panel of the table dis-

plays the growth rates for the last two months of the quarter implied by

these targets. Associated federal funds rate ranges for the intermeeting

period are also shown. (Detailed and longer-run data for the monetary

aggregates are contained in the table on the next two pages.)

end of their respective longer-run ranges. Growth of M-1A would be some-

what above the midpoint of its longer-run range. However, as may be seen in

the charts following this page, the alternatives have different implica-

tions for the level of the aggregates relative to growth cones by year-end,

particularly for the narrow aggregates. Moreover, the choice among these

policy options could have a significant effect on inflationary expectations

and real economic activity over the months ahead, and thus on the pattern of

economic and financial developments associated with achieving next year's

monetary targets.

(9) Alternative B continues the Committee's current targets for

the fourth quarter, as indexed by M-1A and M-1B. Given what has already

occurred in October, to achieve these targets M-1A would have to contract

over the remaining weeks of the year. The staff still believes that a

significant slowing in the growth of transactions balances is likely, partly

because of the sharp run-up in interest rates of the last three months and

partly on the assumption that the recent very rapid month-to-month growth

in economic activity slows significantly. However, achieving the negative

growth in M-1A over the balance of the year implied by alternative B would

probably require further near-term increases in short-term interest rates.

(10) To achieve the specifications of alternative B, total reserves

would have to increase at about a 6 percent annal rate over the October

to December period.1/ Nonborrowed reserves would have to contract by about

a 1 percent annual rate if the level of adjustment borrowing is around

1/ About 4 percentage points of this increase reflect the additional

required reserves associated with the substantial reduction of weekend
Eurodollar arbitrage activities.

$1¾ billion and by more if the level of borrowing rises further. However,

the exact setting on the nonborrowed reserve operating path will depend

in part on bank responses to the new discount rate structure. If past

experience with the surcharge is any guide, banks are likely to become

less willing borrowers, thereby reducing the level of borrowing for any

given spread of the funds rate over the basic discount rate. However,

earlier experience with the surcharge was within the context of a bank

credit restraint program,and bank behavior may differ under current circum-

stances. Thus, there is more than usual uncertainty about the demand for

borrowing, and therefore about the level of the nonborrowed reserve path

consistent with money supply and total reserve targets of alternative B.

(11) Under alternative B, a funds rate in the 15 to 16 percent

range is likely to emerge over the weeks immediately ahead, and possibly

higher before the year is out. The 3-month bill rate may move up into a

14 to 15 percent range and the 3-month CD rate about a point higher,

reflecting in part continued relatively strong demands on short-term credit

markets over the balance of the year. The Treasury is expected to raise

about $4½ billion in cash in the bill market and $7.5 billion in coupon

offerings of 2, 4, and 5 years. Business credit demands may fall most

heavily on short-term markets, especially if, as seems likely, long-term

rates rise further under this alternative, inducing added restraint

on corporate bond offerings. Finally, continued intervention by the U.S.

to slow the appreciation in the foreign exchange value of the dollar--which

is likely to continue rising under alternative B--could generate additional

pressure on Treasury yields as the Federal Reserve or Treasury offers

securities to the market to finance foreign currency purchases.



-11-

(12) The further increase in interest rates under alternative

3 would intensify pressures on mortgage markets and thrift institutions.

Deposit flows are projected to decelerate, but to remain relatively ample.

Nonetheless, mortgage rates would be expected to rise considerably in

reflection of the increases in the cost of deposit funds and yields on

alternative assets. With mortgage rates already at levels that have begun

to choke off demand, new commitment activity for longer-term residential

mortgages at thrift institutions would probably become quite depressed.

(13) The further rise in interest rates under alternative B--the

underlying assumption for the Greenbook projection-is an element in the

staff's anticipation that real GNP will decline in early 1981. The dampening

of the transactions demand for money in lagged response to the run-up in

interest rates and to the projected weakening in economic activity suggest

that interest rates could temporarily ease in early 1981, assuming 1981

monetary targets as reported to the Congress in July.1 / However, for all

of next year, the effects of inflation on the transactions demand for money

are expected to require historically high interest rates in order to restrain

growth in the monetary aggregates to the preliminary FOMC targets.

(14) Alternative A encompasses somewhat higher money targets for

the fourth quarter than alternative B--targets that are thought to be

achievable with little change in interest rates from current levels. Assuming

a level of member bank borrowing of around $1½ billion, nonborrowed and

total reserves under this alternative would be expected to increase at

annual rates of 4 and 7 percent, respectively, over the October to December

period, and the federal funds rate may be around the 14 to 15 percent area.

Other market interest rates also would be expected to remain at about their

current levels. However, some short-term rates might adjust up slightly

1/ See Appendix II for the projected quarterly pattern of interest rates
under alternative B.



-12-

further due to the strength in short-term credit demands and, in the case

of the prime and mortgage rates, to lagged adjustments to the tightening

that has already occurred. With interest rates lower over the balance of

the year than under alternative B, money growth and economic activity would

be expected to be less weak in early 1981.

(15) Alternative C contemplates a reduction in the Committee's

current fourth quarter money growth target, and implies a substantial

reduction in money growth over the balance of the year that brings the level

of M-1B into the FOMC's target zone by December. To achieve the alternative

C specifications would probably require a reduction in nonborrowed reserves

at about a 5 percent annual rate over the last two months of the year, if

a borrowing level of $2 billion, or a bit higher, is assumed. The funds

rate may move up to around the 16 to 17 percent area over the next few

weeks, and possibly higher by year-end. This alternative increases the risk

of a more significant drop-off in money growth and economic activity in

early 1981, and consequently increases the likelihood that interest rates

will be lower in the first quarter of the year than under the other two

alternatives. However, the staff would anticipate that, even under this

alternative, interest rates over the next year would still have to be high

by historical standards to constrain money growth to the Committee's

preliminary targets.



-13-

Directive language

(16) Given below are suggested operational paragraphs for

the directive consistent with the form of the directive adopted at

the October meeting. The language continues to call for expansion of

reserve aggregates at a pace consistent with the desired rate of monetary

growth over the last three months of the year, provided that the weekly

average federal funds rate remains within a specified range. The specifi-

cations adopted at the October meeting are shown in strike-through form.

In the short run, the Committee seeks behavior of reserve

aggregates consistent with growth of M-1A, M-1B, and M-2 over the

PERIOD FROM September to December [DEL: period] at annual rates of about

[DEL: 2½] ____ percent, [DEL: 5] ____ percent, and [DEL: 7¼] ____ percent respectively,

[DEL: or somewhat less,] provided that in the period before the next regular

meeting the weekly average federal funds rate remains within a range

of [DEL: 9 to 15] ____ TO ____ percent.

If it appears during the period before the next meeting

that the constraint on the federal funds rate is inconsistent with

the objective for the expansion of reserves, the Manager for Domestic

Operations is promptly to notify the Chairman, who will then decide

whether the situation calls for supplementary instructions from the

Committee.

NOTE: These rate projections are based on the assumption that M-LA will
grow 5 percent in 1980 (consistent with Bluebook alternative B), and 4%
percent in 1981 abstracting from the impact of nationwide NOW/ATS accounts.
Such growth would imply M-LA velocity increases in the two years of 4 and
5% percent, respectively. The Board's quarterly econometric model indicates
that historical money demand relationships would require roughly 34 percen-
tage points greater growth of M-lA in 1981 to achieve the GNP and interest
rates in the staff's judgmental Greenbook projection. Thus, these interest
rate projections assume a further so-called downward shift in money demand
as judged from the prediction error in the Board's model.
