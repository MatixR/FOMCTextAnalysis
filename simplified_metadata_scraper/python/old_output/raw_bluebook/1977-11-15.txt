through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned 
versions text-searchable.2   Though a stringent quality assurance process was 
employed, some imperfections may remain.

Recent developments

(1) M-1 growth accelerated to a 12 per cent annual rate in

October, but recent data suggest that growth in November will slow sub-

stantially to about a 1 per cent annual rate. Thus, over the October-

November period, M-1 is now expected to expand at an annual rate of about

6 per cent, as compared with the Committee's 3 to 8 per cent range for

this period. Growth of time deposits other than negotiable CD's has

picked up in recent weeks, about offsetting a slowing in the expansion

of passbook accounts. M-2 growth for October and November is projected at

near a 7¾ per cent annual rate, just above the mid-point of its range.

Deposit flows into thrifts moderated in October, but remained at historically

high levels. Nonborrowed reserves declined in October, reflecting increased

volume of member bank borrowing from the System. However, borrowing has

fallen somewhat since the increase in the discount rate to 6 per cent in

late October, and, given the recent strength in deposits, nonborrowed

reserves are expected to expand at a 2¾ per cent average annual rate for

October and November combined.

(2) Following the October FOMC meeting, the Desk continued to

aim for a Federal funds rate of around 6 per cent. However, at the end

of October, as available data suggested that the aggregates were growing

at rates near to, or above, the upper ends of their ranges, the Desk sought

slightly firmer money market conditions. Most recently, with additional

data indicating a more moderate growth of the aggregates, the Desk has

once again been aiming at a funds rate around 6 per cent. Over the inter-

meeting period, the funds rate has generally fluctuated between 6 and 6-5/8

per cent.

(3) With the Federal funds rate showing little change on balance

since the October meeting--at a time when a number of market observers

had expected it to rise further--short-term market interest rates have

declined somewhat. This small decline in rates occurred even though credit

flows in short-term markets increased. Business loan growth at banks

accelerated in October--perhaps reflecting in part a change in seasonal

borrowing patterns. In addition, outstanding commercial paper of nonfinancial



-3-

firms remained unchanged after declining in September. Banks met a portion

of the rise in loan volume by running off Treasury securities, as they

have been doing since June of this year, and by issuing negotiable CD's

at the fastest rate in over three years.

(4) Rates on Treasury and corporate bonds have edged slightly

higher since October, while yields on municipal issues have dropped some-

what. Corporate and municipal bond offerings moderated in recent weeks,

especially relative to normal seasonal patterns. The Treasury, however,

has auctioned a substantial volume of intermediate- and longer-term debt

in conjunction with its mid-quarter refunding operation. Also, household

demands for mortgages and consumer credit appear to have remained strong.

Despite some slowing in their deposit growth, savings and loan associa-

tions apparently have maintained a very active stance in mortgage markets,

in part by augmenting deposit inflows with borrowings from Home Loan Banks.

(5) In its refunding operations, the Treasury auctioned

$3.3 billion of 3-year notes at an average rate of 7.24 per cent, $2 billion

of 10-year notes at 7.69 per cent and $1.3 billion of 30-year bonds at

7.94 per cent, to raise $4.1 billion of new money and redeem $2.4 billion

of maturing debt. The 3-year note auction was marked by a very large

volume of noncompetitive tenders. In trading after the auction, the

price of this note fell following the System's temporary firming move,

but subsequent price increases have erased this early decline; the other

issues have been consistently trading at premiums relative to their

respective auction averages. Dealers distributed the bulk of their awards

of each issue quite rapidly.

Prospective Developments

(7) Shown below for the Committee's consideration are three

alternative sets of specifications for the monetary aggregates and the

Federal funds rate for the forthcoming intermeeting period. (More

detailed and longer-term data for the aggregates are shown in the tables

on pp. 7 and 8).

M-2 5½ to 9½ 5 to 9 4½ to 8½

Federal funds rate
(Intermeeting period) 5¾ to 6¼ 6¼ to 6¾ 6¾ to 7¼

(8) Under alternative B, the Federal funds rate would be

expected to remain near the mid-point of the 6¼ to 6¾ per cent rate range

specified by the Committee at its last meeting. M-1 growth over the

November-December period likely to be associated with such a funds rate

would be in a 2-7 per cent annual rate range. While data available so

far this month suggest that M-1 will expand only slightly in November,

the staff would anticipate an acceleration in December--perhaps to about

an 8 per cent annual rate--given the projected strengthening of nominal

GNP and the associated underlying transactions demands for cash. Such an

expansion would produce a 7½ per cent annual rate of growth of M-1 from the

third to the fourth quarter, somewhat below the 9 per cent average annual

rate of growth of this aggregate in the second and third quarters of 1977.

(9) If staff expectations are realized for November-December,

M-1 in the first three quarters of 1978 would have to expand at a 4 to

4 per cent annual rate to achieve the mid-point of the Committee's

longer-run range of 4-6 per cent for the QIII '77-QIII '78 period. This

is likely to require further increases in interest rates, given our view

that money demand will continue to be stronger relative to economic

activity than was the case in 1975 and 1976, and also given the projected

11 per cent annual rate of increase for nominal GNP over the first three

quarters of next year. The Federal funds rate may have to begin rising

by late December and reach a level of about 7¾ per cent in the spring,

as shown in Appendix I. The increases in money market rates would, of

course, be accompanied by a return to higher rates of velocity growth, as

shown in Appendix II.

(10) Growth in M-2 over the November-December period is likely

to be in a 5 to 9 per cent annual rate range under Alternative B. The

time and savings deposit component of M-2 under this alternative is

expected to continue to expand at near its recent pace. Although savings

deposits at commercial banks are likely to continue growing relatively

slowing over the near-term as interest sensitive depositors shift to

higher yielding assets, time deposits at banks, especially those not

subject to Regulation Q ceiling, are expected to grow at a relatively

rapid rate. In addition, shifting of maturing wildcard accounts from

banks to thrifts will no longer be a depressant on commercial bank time

deposit growth, as seems to have been the case during the third quarter.



-10-

(11) Even with the higher rates of interest expected in 1978,

the time and savings deposit component of M-2 is likely to grow next

year at a pace only marginally below that expected for November-December.

Historically, very low rates of growth of savings deposits at banks have

been short-lived--as the most interest sensitive depositors tend to shift

out of such assets quickly. Inflows of consumer-type time deposits to

banks are likely to weaken significantly. However, given the staff's

projection of continued sizable bank credit demands, banks can be expected

to step up their offerings of large denomination time deposits included

in M-2 but not subject to Regulation Q ceilings.

(12) Inflows to thrift institutions moderated somewhat in

October. Such inflows may moderate somewhat further over the next few

weeks under alternative B, and can be expected to decelerate markedly in

1978 if the projected rise of interest rates materializes. However, the

deceleration at thrifts--and at banks as well--is not likely to be as

marked as might be expected from interest rate considerations alone

because of the high level of nominal income growth projected for 1978

and the large volume of longer-term time certificates now outstanding at

depository institutions. This would tend to moderate the extent to which

thrifts will have to increase their borrowing and reduce liquidity in

order to meet outstanding mortgage commitments.

(13) If the Federal funds rate remains near its present 6-1/2

per cent level over the intermeeting period, as envisioned under Alterna-

tive B, short-term interest rates will probably show little net change

during the next few weeks, even though demands for short-term funds are likely



-11-

to be rather strong over this period. The Treasury is expected to sell

a large block of cash management bills in early December and the moderate

forward calendar of corporate bond offerings suggests that business demands

for credit may be relatively strong in the short-term area over the balance

of the year. Under these circumstances, it appears likely that yields on

long-term bonds will be relatively stable over the near term and could

even edge down a bit.

(14) Alternative C contemplates an increase in the Federal funds

rate to the mid-point of a 6¾ to 7¼ per cent range between now and the

next Committee meeting. With additional monetary restraint in place some-

what sooner, the staff would expect growth in the monetary aggregates to

be somewhat slower over the next few months than under Alternative B. Con-

sequently, somewhat less monetary restraint would be needed later in 1978,

and interest rates would rise a little less next year under alternative C

than under B.

(15) A near-term increase in the Federal funds rate to around

7 per cent would probably be associated with an increase in money market

rates of about one-half percentage point. Member bank borrowing from the

discount window would probably once again rise substantially, and pressures

for another increase in the discount rate would soon develop. The bank

prime rate also could be expected to increase by at least one-fourth of

a percentage point. Long-term rates would probably rise considerably

less, on balance, than short-term market rates, particularly in view of

the large volume of investable funds available from insurance companies

and pension funds.



-12-

(16) An easing in the funds rate to the mid-point of a 5¾ to

6¾ per cent range, as envisioned under Alternative A, could stimulate sub-

stantial downward adjustments in interest rates. Such rate movements, how-

ever, would probably be short-lived, since the added impetus to growth in

the monetary aggregates would soon require a sharp reversal in interest

rates in order to constrain the aggregates to the Committee's longer-run

ranges. With M-1 likely to expand at about a 7 per cent average annual

rate over the fourth quarter of 1977 and the first quarter of 1978 under

this alternative, interest rates would have to rise sufficiently to hold

M-1 growth in the second and third quarters of 1978 to a 3½ per cent

annual rate. The projected Federal funds pattern for this alternative

calls, therefore, for sustained increases to around 8¼ per cent in the third

quarter of 1978. Under such circumstances, some adjustment in Regulation Q

ceilings may have to be considered by next summer.



-13-

Directive language

(17) Given below are alternatives for the operational paragraphs

of the directive. The first formulation places main emphasis on near-term

rates of growth in monetary aggregates. The second formulation, like the

directive adopted at the last meeting, places main emphasis on money market

conditions; it shows--in strike-through form--the specifications adopted at

the last meeting. As suggested below, the particular language needed in

the opening lines of the money market formulation would depend on the

specific conditions sought; the three alternatives shown--calling, respec-

tively, for somewhat easier, prevailing, and somewhat firmer money market

conditions--are intended to be associated with the specifications discussed

in the preceding section under alternatives A, B, and C.

"Money Aggregates" Formulation

The Committee seeks to encourage near-term rates of growth in

M-1 and M-2 on a path believed to be reasonably consistent with

the longer-run ranges for monetary aggregates cited in the preceding

paragraph. Specifically, at present, it expects the annual growth

rates over the November-December period to be within the ranges of

____ to ____ per cent for M-1 and ____ to ____ per cent

for M-2. In the judgment of the Committee such growth rates are

likely to be associated with a weekly-average Federal funds rate of

about ____ per cent. If, giving approximately equal weight to

M-1 and M-2, it appears that growth rates over the 2-month period

will deviate significantly from the midpoints of the indicated



-14-

ranges, the operational objective for the Federal funds rate shall

be modified in an orderly fashion within a range of ____ to

____ per cent.

If it appears during the period before the next meeting that

the operating constraints specified above are proving to be signif-

icantly inconsistent, the Manager is promptly to notify the Chairman

who will then decide whether the situation calls for supplementary

instructions from the Committee.

"Money Market" Formulation

At this time, the Committee seeks to maintain about the prevail-

ing money market conditions (OR TO ACHIEVE SOMEWHAT EASIER OR SOME-

WHAT FIRMER MONEY MARKET CONDITIONS) during the period immediately

ahead, provided that monetary aggregates appear to be growing at

approximately the rates currently expected, which are believed to

be on a path reasonably consistent with the longer-run ranges for

monetary aggregates cited in the preceding paragraph. Specifically,

the Committee seeks to maintain the weekly-average Federal funds

rate at about [DEL: 6-1/2] ____ per cent, so long as M-1 and M-2 appear

to be growing over the [DEL: October-November] NOVEMBER-DECEMBER period

at annual rates within ranges of [DEL: 3 to 8] ____ TO ____ per cent and [DEL: 5-1/2

to 9-1/2] ____ TO ____ per cent, respectively. If, giving

approximately equal weight to M-1 and M-2, it appears that growth

rates over the 2-month period are approaching or moving beyond the

limits of the indicated ranges, the operational objective for the



-15-

weekly-average Federal funds rate shall be modified in an orderly

fashion within a range of [DEL: 6-1/2 to 6-3/4] ____ to ____ per cent.

If it appears during the period before the next meeting that

the operating constraints specified above are proving to be signif-

icantly inconsistent, the Manager is promptly to notify the Chairman

who will then decide whether the situation calls for supplementary

instructions from the Committee.

On average thus far in the fourth quarter, nonborrowed reserves

have expanded at a 3¼ per cent annual rate, total reserves at a 5 per

cent rate, and the monetary base at an 8¼ per cent rate. These rates

are above the growth rates for the 1977 QIII to 1978 QI period shown in

the table above that are thought to be consistent with the alternatives

presented to the Committee. Thus, a slowing in the growth of reserves,

and a considerable slowing in nonborrowed reserves, will be needed over

the months ahead. (The estimates for nonborrowed reserves shown in the

table assume no change in the discount rate from its current level of 6

per cent. Increases in the discount rate would, of course, shift the

composition of total reserves more toward nonborrowed than borrowed

reserves).

NOTE: Government security dealer trading positions are on a commitment basis. Trading positions, which exclude Treasury securities financing by
repurchase agreements maturing in 16 days or more, are indicators of dealer holdings available for sale over the near-term. Underwriting syndicate
positions consist of issues still in syndicate, excluding trading positions. The basic reserve deficit is excess reserves less borrowing at Federal
Reserve less net Federal funds purchases. Weekly data are daily averages for statement weeks, except for corporate and municipal issues in syndicate
which are Friday figures.

NOTE: Weekly data for columns 1 to 4 are statement week averages of daily data. Columns 5 and 6 are 1-day Wednesday quotes (prior to 1976, figures shown

are for 60-89 day and 90-119 day ranges, respectively) . For columns 7 through 10, the weekly date is the mid-point of the calendar week over which data

are averaged. Columns 11 and 12 are 1-day quotes for Friday and Thursday, respectively, following the end of the statement week. Column 13 is an average

of contract interest rates on commitments for conventional first mortgages with 80 per cent loan-to-value ratios made by a sample of insured savings and

loan associations on the Friday following the end of the statement week. Column 14 gives FNMA auction data for Monday preceding the end of the statement
week. Column 15 is a 1-day quote for Monday preceding the end of the statement week. The FNMA auction yield is the average yield in bi-weekly auction

for short-term forward commitments for Government underwritten mortgages. GNMA yields are average net yields to investors on mortgage-backed securities
for immediate delivery, assuming prepayment in 12 years on pools of 30-year FHA/VA mortgages carrying the coupon rate 50 basis points below the current

FHA/VA ceiling.
