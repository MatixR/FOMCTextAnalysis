MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Prepared for the Federal Open Market Committee

By the staff Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System



Strictly Confidential (FR)
Class I - FOMC July 2, 1993

MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Recent Developments

(1) Over the intermeeting period, the degree of reserve pres-

sure remained unchanged and the federal funds rate averaged quite close

to its intended level of 3 percent. Other short-term rates were

little changed on balance. Money market rates were pushed up early in

the period on media reports indicating that the FOMC had shown an

increased willingness to tighten policy at its May meeting. This con-

cern particularly pressed on market sentiment after the publication of

surprisingly robust employment figures for May. Subsequent data, how-

ever, suggested slower inflation and a hesitancy to spending, fostering

the view that policy, while tilted toward restraint, was unlikely to

tighten soon. With the outlook for the economy somewhat weaker, and in

light of progress in the Congress on a package of deficit cuts, inves-

tors apparently revised down their expectations for credit demands well

into the future, pulling longer-term interest rates down 15 to 40 basis

points. Long-term Treasury yields reached the lowest levels in more

than 20 years, as did fixed-rate mortgage rates. Bolstered by these

rate declines, major equity indexes rose 1 to 3 percent.

(2) Despite the outlook for weaker credit demands in the

United States, the dollar's weighted average exchange value has risen

about 2-3/4 percent on balance since the May FOMC meeting. Apprecia-

tions of 4-1/2 percent against the mark and somewhat less against other

European currencies more than offset a 2-3/4 percent depreciation

1. To accommodate an upswing in its seasonal component, the
allowance for adjustment and seasonal borrowing was doubled to $200
million in two increments of $25 million and one of $50 million.
Except at quarter-end, there was little borrowing other than seasonal
at the discount window.



against the yen. Weakness in the mark generally reflected a further

deterioration of the economic outlook in Germany that strengthened

expectations of lower German interest rates; on July 1 the Bundesbank

reduced its discount rate by 1/2 percentage point and its Lombard rate

by 1/4 percentage point. With this action largely anticipated, German

3-month interest rates were about unchanged over the period, but inter-

mediate- and longer-term rates fell somewhat. The mark was weak enough

in the European Exchange Rate Mechanism to allow several other ERM

countries to lower official lending rates by more than in Germany.

Despite a momentary setback engendered by the fall of the Miyazawa

government, the yen continued to strengthen on the basis of huge

Japanese trade and current account surpluses and market perceptions that

the United States and Japan's other G-7 partners favored yen apprecia-

tion. Japanese short-term interest rates were about unchanged, while

long-term rates declined about 25 basis points. The Desk intervened to

buy dollars against yen on several occasions in late May and early June,

for total yen sales of $1.1 billion equivalent, split evenly between the

System and Treasury.

(3) From April to June, M2 rose at a 7 percent rate, about

1-1/4 percentage points more than expected in the previous bluebook.

The bulk of this increase was recorded in its Ml component, which posted

growth rates of 27-1/2 percent in May and 7-1/2 percent in June.2

The growth in liquid deposits owed in part to the latest wave of mort-

gage prepayments, which set a record in May and are expected to remain

high in June. Additionally, with individual nonwithheld tax payments

2. The rapid runup in M1 pushed total reserves up at a 21 percent
rate over the April-to-June period. With currency growing at a 11
percent pace over those two months, the monetary base expanded at a
12-1/2 percent rate.



well below last year's pace, there was less buildup in liquid deposits

to meet tax liabilities in April and, consequently, less runoff in May.

Seasonal factors, expecting a more abrupt swing, transformed the modest

drawdowns in late April and May into seasonally adjusted strength in

May. These identifiable special factors probably account for a con-

siderable portion of the two-month growth, suggesting that the underly-

ing trend to the aggregate has remained subdued, though perhaps a little

less so than over the first four months of the year. Capital market

instruments have retained their allure, with inflows to stock and bond

funds in May remaining near their record April pace and anecdotal

reports suggesting continued strength in June. In June, M2 remained

below the lower bound of its target cone.

(4) From the fourth quarter through June, M2 growth on balance

was about in line with staff projections at the time of the February

FOMC meeting, despite what now appears to be lower growth of nominal

income. Special factors have apparently contributed more to M2 growth

than had been expected; in particular, the bulge in mortgage refinancing

activity, touched off by the late-winter rally in the bond market,

boosted M2 in the second quarter. Underlying demand for M2 relative to

income during the first half appears to have remained weak. M2 velocity

is estimated to have increased at a 2-3/4 percent rate in the second

quarter and a 4-1/2 percent rate in the first half.

(5) M3 increased at a 4-3/4 percent rate over the April-to-

June period, about 3/4 percentage point faster than was projected at the

time of the May meeting. The strength in M3, which increased at a 9-1/4

percent rate in May but was about unchanged in June, was mostly account-

ed for by its M2 component. From the fourth quarter to June, M3 has

contracted slightly, leaving it below the 1/2 percent lower bound of its



growth cone. The decline in M3 over the first half was about that

anticipated by the staff in February. While bank credit growth was a

little stronger than foreseen, banks relied to an unexpected extent on

nondeposit sources of funds; bank capital probably provided a large

volume of funds, as banks likely retained a substantial proportion of

robust earnings and continued to issue new equity shares and subordi-

nated debt at a brisk pace.

(6) Bank credit grew at a 9 percent rate in May and appears

to have about maintained that pace in June. This pickup includes a

substantial rise in bank lending, which has averaged about 9 percent

over the past two months after having declined at a 2 percent rate over

the preceding months of the year. The rise in total loans was wide-

spread, with all the major components of bank loans posting higher

growth rates in the second quarter. This improved performance seems

mainly to evidence some stirring in loan demand, as well as the

increased willingness to lend, as shown in survey responses.

(7) The strengthening in bank credit was part of a pickup in

the growth of overall domestic nonfinancial debt in recent months.

April growth is now seen as 5-3/4 percent and probably moved higher

still in May. With tax receipts on the skimpy side and the Treasury

seeking to build its cash balance, federal debt grew at a double-digit

pace in April and May. Nonfederal debt growth also increased. Continu-

ing rapid issuance by state and local governments to take advantage of

low rates, while mostly to refinance older issues, has probably raised

some new cash as well. Meanwhile, the string of increases in consumer

credit provides some evidence that consumers have become more willing to

take on debt. However, gross issuance of corporate bonds slowed a bit

in the second quarter as it appears that internal funds remained about



-5-

sufficient to fund the spending of the nonfinancial corporate sector.

From the fourth quarter of 1992 through May, domestic nonfinancial debt

expanded at a 5 percent rate, placing it near the lower end of its 4-1/2

percent to 8-1/2 percent monitoring range; this growth was about in line

with projections early in the year.

Alternative Long-Run Strategies

(8) The table on the following page shows three alternative

monetary policy strategies and the associated implications for infla-

tion, output, and resource utilization. Strategy I, the baseline, is a

judgmental extension of the Greenbook forecast for 1993 and 1994. It is

characterized by very gradual decreases in both inflation (2.7 percent

by the end of the simulation) and unemployment (6 percent). Under the

tighter strategy, denoted by II, the Committee is assumed to put greater

emphasis on its price stability objective, bringing inflation below

2 percent near the end of the period. In the easier strategy, denoted

by III, the Committee is assumed to put more weight on reducing unem-

ployment over the next few years.

(9) The stance of monetary policy in each of the scenarios is

indexed by the federal funds rate path and the growth rate of M2. There

is considerable uncertainty about the rate of M2 growth associated with

a given funds rate path and nominal income. The paths for money growth

were determined judgmentally, relying in part on a variety of models of

M2 demand. In the extended forecast, M2 remains subdued for a while as

the depository sector continues to downsize somewhat relative to other

sectors supplying credit and as investors continue to enlarge their

holdings of capital market instruments. Eventually, however, these

adjustments are completed, and the expansion of M2 comes into better

alignment with growth in nominal GDP--albeit at a higher level of veloc-

ity.

(10) All of the strategies assume that fiscal policy remains

moderately restrictive throughout the period, as the structural fiscal

deficit declines from 4-1/4 percent of GDP in 1993 to less than 3 per-

cent by 1998. Such a decline is in line with the Administration's

budget proposal and with the bills moving through the Congress.

On the supply side of the economy, potential real GDP is assumed to grow

a little more than 2 percent per year. The various scenarios incor-

porate the staff's judgment that the natural rate of unemployment will

remain around 6 percent. In the extension of the baseline and in the

alternative strategies, the response of inflation to variations in the

unemployment rate around the natural rate is in line with historical

experience. That is, a 1 percentage point unemployment gap sustained

for one year lowers inflation by about 1/2 percentage point.5 Thus,

we have made no allowance past the Greenbook forecast for adverse shifts

in the short-run inflation/output tradeoff that might result from such

things as added regulation, trade protection, or increases in taxes to

pay for health care.

(11) The baseline policy entails some continuing slack in

resource utilization over the simulation period. Current real long-term

rates are still relatively high, especially in light of the fiscal

policy assumed by the staff, and they decline somewhat over the simula-

tion period, which brings output to potential. Real short-term rates,

on the other hand, appear too low to be sustained, and in the baseline

these rates rise, though to a level below that incorporated in market

rates. As a result of persisting slack, inflation edges down gradually

to 2.7 percent by the end of the simulation period.

(12) The stronger anti-inflation stance of Strategy II is

implemented by increasing the funds rate to 4 percent by the fourth

quarter of 1993 and holding it there, while accepting the resulting

reduction in money growth. Real short-term rates rise promptly under

this scenario and remain elevated, keeping real long-term rates high.

The tighter stance of policy prevents the unemployment rate from falling

appreciably, and the higher level of slack maintains noticeable downward

pressure on inflation. Ultimately, the nominal long rate falls below

that in the baseline strategy, as inflation expectations abate.

5. The simulation does not incorporate any credibility effects of
monetary policy announcements in this "sacrifice ratio."



-10-

(13) To achieve more rapid gains in employment, Strategy III

cuts the nominal funds rate to 2 percent by the fourth quarter of this

year and maintains a lower rate than the baseline in the following year.

Money growth generally runs somewhat higher than in the baseline path.

The unemployment rate drops through the natural rate half-way through

the simulation period. As a result, no progress is made on reducing

inflation, which indeed accelerates later in the period. To limit the

overheating in the economy, the initial policy move must be quickly

reversed and ultimately nominal short-term rates end up the highest

under this strategy.

Long-Run Ranges

(14) Presented below are the staff's projections for money and

debt growth in 1993 and 1994, along with actual growth through June and

the ranges for 1993 adopted by the Committee in February. (Appendix A

gives projections for M2+.)

Nominal GDP 4-3/4 4-3/4 5

1. Q4:1992 to May.
2. Q4:1992 to Q2:1993.

(15) M2 growth consistent with Greenbook income and interest

rates is projected to average about 1 percent from June through the

fourth quarter, leaving the increase for 1993 at 1 percent, below the

current 2 to 6 percent annual range. Income is projected to grow at the

same rate in the second half of this year as in the first. Moreover,

interest rates also are expected to have about the same influence on M2

growth over the second half as the first. In the Greenbook projection,

longer-term rates drift down further as inflation worries recede, short-

term rates remain on a lower trajectory than anticipated by the market,

and fiscal restraint in the deficit-reduction package is implemented. A

lower level of longer-term rates should make shifts into longer-term

debt instruments a bit less attractive, once the transitory effects of

capital gains wane. However, rates on NOW and other very liquid depos-

its have not yet fully adjusted to lower money market rates, and further



-12-

declines in these rates will damp M2 demand. With mortgage refinancing

projected to decline from record levels, temporary factors will be

depressing M2 growth over the second half of the year.6 With improv-

ing balance sheets of borrowers and lenders, underlying M2 growth is

expected to strengthen a bit. Nevertheless, credit demands are pro-

jected to remain focused on longer-term markets, limiting institutions'

needs to bid for retail deposits. On balance, the velocity of M2 is

expected to rise 3 percent during the second half, slower than the 4-1/2

percent rise over the first two quarters. (See charts on following

pages for actual and projected velocity for the monetary aggregates and

debt.)

(16) M3 is projected to expand at a very subdued pace over the

second half of 1993; even subdued expansion, however, would represent a

strengthening from the declines registered through June. The aggregate

is projected to be flat for the year, leaving it 1/2 percentage point

beneath its range. The pickup in the second half of the year does not

reflect greater asset growth at depositories; in fact, bank credit

expansion is expected to flag some from the first-half pace, and thrift

credit is likely to be weaker than in the first half, damped late in the

year by a resumption of RTC resolution activity. But banks may rely

more on deposits and less on other sources of funding than earlier this

year, having built capital to high levels.

(17) Debt of domestic nonfinancial sectors is expected to

expand a bit more slowly over the second half of the year than in the

first, as federal borrowing falls back from its rapid first-half pace.

Growth of the debt of nonfederal sectors picks up slightly further as

6. The effects of a projected run-off of deposit balances related
to prepayments of mortgage securities are expected to be only par-
tially offset by a reversal of the distortion of seasonal factors that
had depressed seasonally adjusted M2 growth early in the year.

borrowers and lenders become more comfortable with their financial situ-

ations. Growth of domestic nonfinancial sector debt should come in at

5 percent for the year, about 1/2 percentage point above the lower end

of its range and slightly less than anticipated at the time of the

February meeting. Federal debt expansion is expected to decelerate to

9 percent this year, while growth of nonfederal debt is projected at

3-3/4 percent--up from last year's 3 percent rate.

(18) The basic forces influencing the growth of money and

credit in 1994 are likely to differ only a little from those prevailing

in 1993. Nominal GDP growth is projected to expand at about this year's

pace, balance sheet constraints to ease slightly further, and long-term

rates continue to drift down. Consequently, nonfederal debt is expected

to strengthen slightly further next year, though staying below the pace

of private-sector spending. Federal borrowing, however, should slow,

reflecting the cyclical and structural forces narrowing the deficit.

Total domestic nonfinancial debt growth is projected to remain at about

this year's 5 percent rate. Bank credit is likely to accelerate

slightly along with nonfederal debt, to a 4 percent pace. In the thrift

sector, the shrinkage in credit may accelerate as new funding for the

RTC permits more resolution activity. With financing needs of deposi-

tory institutions remaining modest, M3 growth is projected to move up

only to 1 percent in 1994. Bidding for retail deposits by depositories

should again be quite muted, given their limited needs for funds, and

the still-steep yield curve likely will continue to attract deposit

balances into bond funds. M2 is projected to accelerate only to a 2

percent rate in 1994, and its velocity would rise at a 3 percent rate,

in comparison to the 3-3/4 percent rise projected for this year.



-14-

Ranges for 1993

(19) Presented below are three alternative sets of ranges for

money and debt growth in 1993. Despite the reduced emphasis on monetary

aggregates as guides to policy, the choice of ranges can convey informa-

tion about what money and credit growth would be consistent with the

economic outcomes envisioned by the Committee and can be used to signal

the Committee's longer-term intentions. Alternative I retains the

current ranges, while alternative II lowers the ranges for M2 by a full

percentage point and those for M3 and debt by 1/2 percentage point.

Alternative III would make more substantial reductions from the current

ranges to encompass the staff forecast.

Alternative Money and Debt Ranges for 1993
(Percent)

Alt. I Memo:
(current Staff
ranges) Alt. II Alt. III projection

M2 2 to 6 1 to 5 0 to 4 1
M3 1/2 to 4-1/2 0 to 4 -1 to 3 0
Debt 4-1/2 to 8-1/2 4 to 8 3-1/2 to 7-1/2 5

(20) The staff projections for M2 and M3 growth this year are

below the lower boundaries of their current ranges. A downward revision

of the ranges, as in alternative II or III, could be viewed as a recog-

nition that velocity shifts are apparently more intense than had seemed

likely in February. The lower ranges of alternative III might better

convey the Committee's expectations for money and credit and limit the

risk that money might fall short of the ranges even with expected nomi-

nal income growth. From another perspective, a reduction of the ranges

for 1993 also might signal a willingness of the Committee to accept

lower money and nominal income growth than had been projected in Febru-

ary, perhaps in an effort to lean against potential inflation pressures.



-15-

Since money growth has been so anemic thus far this year, the upper ends

of these ranges would permit considerable strengthening of the monetary

aggregates: M2 could grow at a 10 percent rate from June to December

and still be within the upper end of the alternative III range.

(21) Alternative I ranges might be chosen if contrary to

the staff's prediction, the Committee expected the extraordinary shift

in demand for M2 to abate soon, causing M2 velocity to level out. A

higher track for M3 might be appropriate if bank and thrift credit do

not fall back to the extent that the staff envisions or if the unusual

use of non-M3 funding were expected to subside. The current ranges also

might be retained were the Committee concerned that the weak performance

of M2 and M3 had been associated with unacceptably sluggish economic

growth and would continue to be in the future.7

Ranges for 1994

(22) Shown below are options for preliminary ranges for money

and debt growth in 1994. They are the same as those shown for 1993.

Alternative Money and Debt Ranges for 1994

Alt. I Alt. II Alt. III projection

M2 2 to 6 1 to 5 0 to 4 2
M3 1/2 to 4-1/2 0 to 4 -1 to 3 1
Debt 4-1/2 to 8-1/2 4 to 8 3-1/2 to 7-1/2 5

(23) Many of the arguments for the alternatives in 1993 carry

over into the choice of ranges for 1994. In particular, lower ranges

might give a more realistic view of expected money growth. In addition.

7. In the judgment of the staff, short-term interest rates would
need to decline about 1-1/2 percentage points fairly promptly to move
M2 and M3 up to the bottom of their current ranges for this year by
December.



-16-

if uncertainty about the future behavior of velocity is seen as motivat-

ing retention of the current ranges for 1993, those same ranges might be

proposed for 1994 on the strength of the same considerations. Alterna-

tively, next year's ranges could be lowered, even if the current ranges

for 1993 were retained, to signal the Committee's intention to continue

on a disinflation path. A lower range for 1993 would seem to argue for

the same or possibly an even lower range in 1994.



-17-

Short-Run Policy Alternatives

(24) Three policy alternatives are given below for Committee

consideration. Under alternative B, federal funds would remain in a

trading range around 3 percent, in association with an initial allowance

for adjustment plus seasonal borrowing of $250 million, an increase of

$50 million from the current allowance to accommodate the normal pattern

in seasonal borrowing at this time of the year. Under alternative A,

the funds rate would be reduced to the area of 2-1/2 percent, either by

choosing a $225 million borrowing allowance or by cutting the discount

rate 1/2 percentage point, to 2-1/2 percent, while retaining a $250

million borrowing allowance. Under alternative C, which could be imple-

mented through a $275 million borrowing allowance, the funds rate would

vary around 3-1/2 percent.

(25) Although market participants believe that the next mone-

tary policy action is more likely to be a tightening than an easing,

they do not expect any move to occur over the coming intermeeting

period. Consequently, market interest rates would not respond initially

to the implementation of alternative B. Rates would tend to remain

near current levels or edge lower over subsequent weeks should data on

economic activity and prices prove to be about in line with the staff

projection and should the Congress continue to make progress on passage

of a deficit reduction package. Interest rates would back up across the

maturity spectrum, however, if adverse information on price pressures

generates expectations of a near-term tightening of monetary policy, or

if a major snag occurs in the process of deficit reduction. The

exchange value of the dollar is expected to fluctuate around recently

established levels; staff forecasts for continued monetary policy easing



-18-

abroad are broadly consistent with expectations already embedded in

interest and exchange rates.

(26) The immediate tightening of reserve market conditions

under alternative C is not built into financial market quotes and would

induce a rise in short-term market interest rates that about matched the

1/2 percentage point increase in the federal funds rate. In response to

higher funding costs, banks likely would boost the prime rate, perhaps

by the same amount. (In light of the currently wide spread of the prime

rate over banks' cost of funds and their professed greater willingness

to make loans, banks will be less inclined to raise the prime in reac-

tion to an increase in the federal funds rate of only 1/4 percentage

point.) Longer-term market rates also would likely rise, though by

considerably less than short-term rates, as the policy action worked to

relieve the market's residual inflation concerns and to put a damper on

household and business spending and credit demands. Buoyed by more

attractive relative interest returns in the United States, the dollar

would tend to strengthen on foreign exchange markets.

(27) The easing of reserve conditions embodied in alternative

A would represent an unexpected direction for policy, especially in

light of the market's understanding of the Committee's recent policy

predilection. The Federal Reserve would be seen as putting more

emphasis on supporting economic growth, perhaps in light of the recent

weaker economic data and the possible restraining effects of the fiscal

package. Market participants would expect short-term rate declines to

be reversed eventually, but still would anticipate that rates would

trade around lower levels over the coming year than currently built into

the term structure. Consequently, the downward adjustment of short- and

intermediate-term market rates would be close to the 1/2 percentage



-19-

point drop in the federal funds rate. As usual, bond yields would not

fall by nearly as much, partly because investors might become a little

more worried about future inflation. The exchange value of the dollar

would be depressed. Implementing this alternative would reduce

financial intermediaries' costs of funds, encouraging them to relax

their terms and conditions for business and consumer loans.

(28) Expected growth rates of the monetary aggregates from

June to September under the three alternatives are shown in the table

below, together with anticipated growth from the fourth-quarter base

through September. (More detailed data are presented in the table and

charts on the following pages.) Under all the alternatives, the broader

aggregates are expected to grow from June to September, but at markedly

slower rates than over the second quarter. The deceleration of M2

predominantly reflects some unwinding of the second-quarter bulge in

mortgage refinancings. This effect, which derives largely from the

associated prepayments of mortgage-backed securities, is projected to

retard M2 growth by about 1 percentage point over the next three months,

after having augmented it by 1-1/2 percentage points over the previous

three. M3 expansion is anticipated to be held back by a slowing in bank

credit from its rapid rate in the second quarter to a pace more consis-

tent with the attractiveness of capital market alternatives to borrow-

ers. Under all the alternatives, the broader aggregates would remain

below the lower bounds of their annual ranges through September, with M2

somewhat, and M3 a bit, below the bottom edges of their parallel bands.

(29) Projected M2 growth over the third quarter diverges rela-

tively little across the three alternatives, ranging from 1/2 percentage

point under alternative C to 1-1/2 percentage point under alternative A.

The similar growth rates reflect the diminished sensitivity on balance

of M2 demand to short-term market interest rates in recent years, as

capital market instruments have become closer substitutes for M2 bal-

ances in household portfolios. If, for example, short-term market rates

are reduced. M2 is boosted as deposit rates fall by less. This effect,

which attracts funds from money market instruments, is partly offset by

shifts into capital market instruments, whose realized returns are

boosted temporarily by capital gains and whose yields over time drop by

less than deposit rates. Given this damped interest rate response, even

if the money market conditions of alternative A continued through year-

end, M2 growth over the year would still be only 1-1/4 percent, notice-

ably below the 2 percent lower bound of the Committee's current annual

range. By contrast, M1 seems to have retained its greater sensitivity

to changes in the funds rate that emerged after the nationwide introduc-

tion of NOW accounts in the early 1980s. Projected growth of this nar-

row aggregate from June to September ranges from 4-3/4 percent under

alternative C to 6-3/4 percent under alternative A. From the fourth

quarter of 1992 through December, projected M1 growth would range from 8

to 9 percent across the three policy alternatives.

(30) Across the three policy alternatives, M3 is expected to

grow from 0 to 1/2 percent over the third quarter. Bank credit expan-

sion is foreseen to abate from its elevated pace of May and June, cur-

tailing funding needs of depositories; moreover, these needs will con-

tinue to be met from nondeposit sources, including retained earnings and

issuance of equity and subordinated debt. The contraction of thrift

credit and funding requirements probably will be sustained. For the

year, M3 would be little changed under all the alternatives.

(31) The debt of domestic nonfinancial sectors is anticipated

to expand at a 4-3/4 percent rate over the four months ending in Septem-

ber, bringing its growth rate from the fourth quarter about 1/2 percent-

age point above the 4-1/2 percent lower bound of its monitoring range.

The growth of nonfederal debt is expected to strengthen to a 4 percent

rate over this interval, but federal debt, after sizable growth in June,

is poised to slow in the third quarter, as the Treasury meets a portion

of its funding needs by drawing down its bloated cash balance.

8. Total reserves and the monetary base are projected to grow from
June to September at 5-3/4 and 8-1/4 percent rates, respectively,
under alternative B.



-23-

Directive Language

(32) Presented below are draft paragraphs relating to the

ranges for 1993 and 1994. For 1993, Option 1 would reaffirm the current

ranges, while Option 2 would cover a decision to reduce those ranges.

Within Option 1, language is suggested in brackets if the Committee

wanted to indicate that money growth could be around the lower ends of

the ranges.

(33) With regard to the tentative 1994 ranges, Option A would

cover a Committee decision to extend to next year whatever 1993 ranges

the Committee adopts at this meeting, while Option B proposes wording

for changes from the 1993 ranges.

Paragraphs for 1993 and 1994 Ranges

The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and

financial conditions that will foster price stability and

promote sustainable growth in output.

Alternatives for 1993

Option 1--Reaffirm Ranges

In furtherance of these objectives, the Committee RE-

AFFIRMED at THIS its meeting THE RANGES IT HAD ESTABLISHED in

February [DEL: established ranges] for growth of M2 and M3 of 2 to 6

percent and 1/2 to 4-1/2 percent respectively, measured from

the fourth quarter of 1992 to the fourth quarter of 1993. The

Committee expects that developments contributing to unusual

velocity increases are likely to persist during the year.

[AND IN THAT EVENT M2 AND M3 GROWTH AROUND THE LOWER ENDS OF

THEIR RANGES WOULD BE CONSISTENT WITH ITS BROAD POLICY OBJEC-

TIVES.] The monitoring range for growth of total domestic



-24-

nonfinancial debt ALSO was MAINTAINED [DEL:set] at 4-1/2 to 8-1/2

percent [WAS LOWERED TO ____ TO ____ PERCENT] for the year.

Option 2--Reduce Ranges

IN FURTHERANCE OF THESE OBJECTIVES, THE COMMITTEE AT

THIS MEETING LOWERED THE RANGES IT HAD ESTABLISHED IN FEBRUARY

FOR GROWTH OF M2 AND M3 TO ____ TO _____ PERCENT AND ____ TO ____ PER-

CENT RESPECTIVELY, MEASURED FROM THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 1992 TO

THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 1993. THE COMMITTEE ANTICIPATED THAT

DEVELOPMENTS CONTRIBUTING TO UNUSUAL VELOCITY INCREASES WOULD

PERSIST OVER THE BALANCE OF THE YEAR AND THAT MONEY GROWTH

WITHIN THESE LOWER RANGES WOULD BE CONSISTENT WITH ITS BROAD

POLICY OBJECTIVES. The monitoring range for growth of total

domestic nonfinancial debt was MAINTAINED [DEL:set] at 4-1/2 to

8-1/2 percent [(ALSO) WAS LOWERED TO ___ TO ___ PERCENT] for the

year.

Alternatives for 1994

Option A--Retain 1993 Ranges

FOR 1994, THE COMMITTEE AGREED ON A TENTATIVE BASIS TO

RETAIN THE 1993 RANGES (AS REVISED AT THIS MEETING) FOR GROWTH

OF THE MONETARY AGGREGATES AND DEBT, MEASURED FROM THE FOURTH

QUARTER OF 1993 TO THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 1994. The behavior

of the monetary aggregates will continue to be evaluated in

the light of progress toward price level stability, movements

in their velocities, and developments in the economy and

financial markets.

Option B--Change 1993 Ranges

FOR 1994, THE COMMITTEE AGREED ON TENTATIVE RANGES FOR

MONETARY GROWTH, MEASURED FROM THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 1993 TO



-25-

THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 1994, OF ___ TO ____ PERCENT FOR M2 AND ____

TO ____ PERCENT FOR M3. THE COMMITTEE PROVISIONALLY SET THE

MONITORING RANGE FOR GROWTH OF TOTAL DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL

DEBT AT ____ TO ____ PERCENT FOR 1994. The behavior of the mone-

tary aggregates will continue to be evaluated in the light of

progress toward price level stability, movements in their

velocities, and developments in the economy and financial

markets.

(34) The draft operational paragraph would continue the prac-

tice first adopted at the March meeting of not indicating specific

growth rates for M2 and M3 over the shorter run.

OPERATIONAL PARAGRAPH

In the implementation of policy for the immediate

future, the Committee seeks to DECREASE SOMEWHAT/maintain/IN-

CREASE SOMEWHAT the existing degree of pressure on reserve

positions. In the context of the Committee's long-run objec-

tives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and

giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and mone-

tary developments, slightly (SOMEWHAT) greater reserve re-

straint would (MIGHT) or slightly (SOMEWHAT) lesser reserve

restraint (WOULD) might be acceptable in the intermeeting

period. The contemplated reserve conditions are expected to

be consistent with [DEL:appreciable] MODEST growth in the broader

monetary aggregates over the THIRD [DEL:second] quarter.



APPENDIX A
PROJECTIONS FOR M2+

The table below presents staff projections for growth of M2+

(M2 plus bond and stock mutual funds) over 1993 and 1994 consistent with

Greenbook forecasts of income and interest rates. The projections of

3-3/4 percent M2+ growth in 1993 and 3-1/4 percent in 1994 represent a

slowing from a 4-1/2 percent pace over 1992 and 4-1/4 percent this year

through May. The slowdown in M2+ growth anticipated over the remainder

of 1993 and during 1994 reflects the effects of the more gradual decline

projected in long-term rates over coming quarters. This trajectory for

rates implies a decline in realized capital gains, which are included

directly in the value of the measured aggregate and indirectly affect the

demand for it.

1. Targets are for bank credit until 1983: from 1983 onward targets are for domestic
nonfinancial sector debt.
2. The figures shown reflect target and actual growth of M1-B in 1980 and shift-adjusted
M1-B in 1981. MI-B was relabeled Ml in January 1982. The targeted growth for M1-A was
3-1/2 to 6 percent in 1980 (actual growth was 5.0 percent); in 1981 targeted growth for
shift-adjusted Mi-A was 3 to 5-1/2 percent (actual growth was 1.3 percent).
3. When these ranges were set, shifts into other checkable deposits in 1980 were expected
to have only a limited effect on growth of M1-A and MI-B. As the year progressed,
however, banks offered other checkable deposits more actively, and more funds than
expected were directed to these accounts. Such shifts are estimated to have decreased Ml-
A growth and increased MI-B growth each by at least 1/2 percentage point more than had
been anticipated.

4. Adjusted for the effects of shifts out of demand deposits and savings deposits into
other checkable deposits. At the February FOMC meeting, the target ranges for observed
M1-A and M1-B in 1981 on an unadjusted basis, expected to be consistent with the adjusted
ranges, were -4-1/2 to -2 and 6 to 8-1/2 percent, respectively. Actual M1-B growth (not
shift adjusted) was 5.0 percent.
5. Adjusted for shifts of assets from domestic banking offices to International Banking
Facilities.
6. Range for bank credit is annualized growth from the December 1981-January 1982 average
level through the fourth quarter of 1982.
7. Base period, adopted at the July 1983 FOMC meeting, is QII'83. At the February 1983
meeting the FOMC had adopted a QIV'82 to QIV'83 target range for M1 of 4 to 8 percent.
8. Base period is the February-March 1983 average.
9. Base period, adopted at the July 1985 FOMC meeting, is QII'85. At the February 1985
meeting the FOMC had adopted a QIV'84 to QIV'85 target range for M1 of 4 to 7 percent.
10. No range for M1 has been specified since the February 1987 FOMC meeting because of
uncertainties about its underlying relationship to the behavior of the economy and its
sensitivity to economic and financial circumstances.
11. At the February 1990 meeting the FOMC specified a range of 2-1/2 to 6-1/2 percent.
This range was lowered to 1 to 5 percent at the July 1990 meeting.
12. Annualized growth rate from the fourth-quarter to June.
