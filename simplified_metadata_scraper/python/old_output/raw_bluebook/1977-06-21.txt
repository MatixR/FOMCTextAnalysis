through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned 
versions text-searchable.2   Though a stringent quality assurance process was 
employed, some imperfections may remain.

Recent developments

(1) M-1 increased at a 1.1 per cent annual rate in May

following April's record rise, and over the May-June period it appears

to be growing at around a 1¾ per cent annual rate, slightly below the

mid-point of the Committee's desired range. M-2 appears to be increasing

at nearly a 6 per cent annual rate in May-June, a little above the

mid-point of the Committee's range. Nonborrowed reserves apparently

will decline on balance over May-June--with a small June increase not

quite offsetting a May decline--primarily because of a flattening of

growth in demand deposits and an increase in member bank borrowing since

mid-April.

1/ These figures do not incorporate the regular quarterly benchmark
revisions of monetary aggregates that will be published on Thursday,
June 23. The revisions (based on the December Call Report) are
generally quite small. The level of M-1 was lowered somewhat by
these revisions, while the level of M-2 was raised slightly.
Quarterly growth rates for M-1 for the last quarter of 1976 and the
first quarter of 1977 were lowered about ½ of a percentage point.
M-2 growth was raised by about the same amount. All tables on sub-
sequent pages of this report (with the exception of Tables 1 and 2
following the charts) are based on the new series. The new and old
series are compared in Appendix IV.

(2) In accordance with the Committee's directive, following

the May meeting the Account Management aimed at a Federal funds rate of

about 5-3/8 per cent. Subsequently, with incoming data suggesting that

growth rates in the monetary aggregates would be within the Committee's

desired ranges, the Desk has continued to seek a funds rate around that

level.

(3) Short-term market interest rates generally increased about

10 to 15 basis points in the latter part of May, but subsequently they

declined and are now little different from their levels at the time of



the May meeting. The recent tendency for such rates to decline appears

to be attributable in part to the steadiness of the Federal funds rate

and to the slowing of growth in the aggregates. Short-term credit demands

also have eased somewhat in recent weeks. The Treasury has continued to

redeem bills in its regular weekly and monthly auctions, and short-term

borrowing by State and local governments has dropped back to relatively

moderate levels following a bulge in April. In addition, business demands

for short-term funds at banks and in the commercial paper market moderated

in May, after showing exceptional strength in April. Most major banks

recently raised the prime rate in two steps from 6¼ to 6¾ per cent, although

most recently one large bank posted a 6½ per cent prime rate. Even with

the prime rate at 6¾ per cent, the spread over the cost of open market

funds has narrowed by about ¼ of a percentage point since the previous

prime rate adjustment in mid-December.

(4) Most long-term yields have declined about 10 to 20 basis

points since the time of the last FOMC meeting, in part because short-term

rates did not rise in the manner expected by many market participants.

These yield declines also reflected reduced offerings of long-term

Treasury and corporate debt and strong institutional demands for municipal

securities. Yields on primary mortgages, on the other hand, have changed

little.

percentage annual rates of change) related monetary and financial flows

(7) Assuming the Federal funds rate remains around the

5-3/8 per cent mid-point of the alternative B range, the staff expects

M-1 growth in the June-July period to strengthen to an annual rate in

the range of 3 to 7 per cent. Available weekly data suggest that M-1

growth will remain relatively slow in June. By July, however, most

of the adjustment to the April bulge should have already occurred, and

M-1 is expected to grow more rapidly in response to the projected expansion

in GNP and the associated increases in transactions demands for money.

The July expansion in M-1 is likely to be buoyed further by an earlier-

than-usual distribution of social security checks, leading to more than

normal amounts of funds held in demand deposit accounts over the long

holiday weekend.1/

(8) Under alternative B growth in M-2 over June-July would

be expected to pick up somewhat, due mainly to the anticipated

strengthening in M-1. However, growth in the time and savings deposit

component of M-2 also should recover somewhat from the reduced pace of

recent months. The stimulative effects on time and savings deposit

inflows of a continued rise in personal income and advances in offering

rates at some banks are expected to be about counterbalanced by the

delayed impact of earlier increases in short-term market rates.

(9) Over the next few weeks aggregate demands on credit

markets may change little. Households probably will continue borrowing

substantial amounts in the residential mortgage and consumer credit

markets, and business demands for short-term credit may strengthen from

May's temporarily reduced pace. However, offerings of long-term bonds

by businesses are expected to remain light into the summer, and offerings

by State and local governments are likely to decline somewhat.

1/ Since the usual distribution date for social security checks (the
third of the month) falls on a Sunday in July, the checks will be
delivered on the preceding Friday. In October 1976 and April 1977,
the two previous occasions when checks were delivered early, the money
stock bulged in the first week of the month and remained relatively
high throughout the first half of the month. The staff projection
of July M-1 growth reflects an assumption that this pattern will
reoccur. If this assumption were not made, the projected M-1 growth
rate would be reduced by about 2 percentage points in July and
about 1¼ percentage points in the 2-month June-July period.



-9-

Furthermore, the Treasury may continue redeeming bills on into July.

Although it is widely expected that the Treasury will market about

$1.5 billion of 15-year bonds in the last week of June, it appears that

this will be the only new money it will raise in the coupon market until

early August.

(10) Given this background, and assuming that Federal funds

continue to trade at around 5-3/8 per cent as contemplated under

alternative B, it seems probable that short-term rates will remain

close to current levels in the near term. However, there might well be

some backup in long-term rates in the aftermath of the recent rally that

carried corporate and municipal yields to around their lowest levels in

several years.

(11) Over the longer run, interest rates, particularly in

short-term markets, are likely to come under upward pressure. The

Treasury's need for new money will be expanding substantially. Business

demands for funds may strengthen in the latter part of the summer and in

the autumn as rising expenditures on plant and equipment and inventories

outpace growth in internal sources of funds. Also, credit demands of

households and State and local governments are likely to remain strong.

(12) The staff projections suggest that under alternative B

the Federal funds rate would have to advance to an average of about 6

per cent in the first quarter of next year if M-1 growth in the QI '77-

QI '78 period is to be held near the mid-point of the Committee's

4 -6 per cent range. This funds rate level is somewhat lower than that



-10-

shown in the last blue book, reflecting both the slower second-quarter

growth of the aggregates than projected then and the slightly slower

growth of nominal GNP now expected in late 1977 and early 1978. Inflows

of interest-bearing deposits are still expected to slow sufficiently to

keep growth in M-2 and M-3 in the lower part of their respective one-year

ranges.

(13) The alternative C specifications involve an increase of

the funds rate over the next few weeks to the mid-point of a 5½-6½ per

cent range. This may be accompanied by growth in M-1 in the June-July

period at an annual rate in a range of 2½ to 6½ per cent. Money market

firming of the degree contemplated under this alternative probably would

produce a prompt, appreciable rise in short-term interest rates and some

increase in bond yields. The rise in short-term market rates probably

would induce more depository institutions to raise offering rates on

savings and time deposits to ceiling levels. Short-term rates might rise

far enough to trigger sizable outflows of savings funds to market

instruments and to induce banks to bid aggressively for negotiable CD's and

for the types of large-denomination time deposits included in M-2. If

ceiling rates are unattractive relative to market rates, beginning in July



-11-

some institutions may experience substantial withdrawals in connection

with heavy maturities of "wild card" accounts.1/

(14) The immediate tightening of the money market under

alternative C would tend to lessen the degree of restraint that would be

needed later to achieve growth in M-1 over the QI '77-QI '78 period near

the mid-point of the Committee's one-year range. The funds rate under

this alternative would be expected to reach 6½ per cent in the fourth

quarter of this year and to remain around that level in early 1978.

Because short-term market interest rates also would be expected to be

lower than under alternative B or A, banks and thrift institutions

should be able to maintain stronger inflows of interest-bearing

deposits at that time. Although growth in M-2 and M-3 would consequently

be stronger in late 1977 and early 1978 than under the other alternatives,

even under alternative C the growth rates projected for M-2 and M-3

over the year ending QI '78 are in the lower part of their respective

ranges.

(15) An easing of the Federal funds rate over the near term

to the mid-point of a 4½ to 5¼ per cent range--as called for under

alternative A--and the associated decline in short-term rates might

well be accompanied, at least temporarily, by significant declines in

1/ From July to October 1973 interest ceilings were removed on time
deposits with minimum denominations of $1,000 and maturities of
at least four years. Commercial banks accumulated about $9 billion,
and thrift institutions $18 billion, in such "wild card" accounts.
About one-third of these deposits at commercial banks are estimated
to have been issued at rates above now-prevailing ceilings on four-
year accounts. Although information concerning thrifts is much less
complete, it is estimated that about the same proportion of their
"wild card" certificates were issued at rates above current ceilings
on four-year accounts.



-12-

long-term rates. At present dealer positions in Treasury coupon issues

are relatively low and forward calendars for long-term Treasury and

corporate debt are quite light. In order to achieve growth rates in M-1

at the mid-point of the Committee's one-year range, however, the Federal

funds rate would have to begin to rise relatively soon and to reach a

level above those envisioned under alternatives B and C. Thus, under

alternative A, the Federal funds rate would be expected to average around

7¼ per cent in the first quarter of 1978.



-13-

Directive language

(16) Given below are alternatives for the operational para-

graphs of the directive. The first formulation, like the directive

adopted at the last meeting, places main emphasis on near-term rates of

growth in monetary aggregates; it shows--in strike-through form--the

specifications adopted at the last meeting. The second formulation places

main emphasis on money market conditions. As suggested below, the

particular language needed in the opening lines of the money market

formulation would depend on the specific conditions sought; the three

alternatives shown--calling, respectively, for somewhat easier, prevail-

ing, and somewhat firmer money market conditions--are intended to be

associated with the specifications discussed in the preceding section

under alternatives A, B, and C.

"Monetary Aggregates" Formulation

The Committee seeks to encourage near-term rates of growth

in M-1 and M-2 on a path believed to be reasonably consistent with

the longer-run ranges for monetary aggregates cited in the preceding

paragraph. Specifically, at present, it expects the annual growth

rates over the May-June JUNE-JULY period to be within the ranges of

[DEL: 0-to-4] ____ to ____ per cent for M-1 and [DEL: 3½ to 7½] ____ to

____ per cent for M-2. In the judgment of the Committee such

growth rates are likely to be associated with a weekly average

Federal funds rate of [DEL: 5-3/8] ____ per cent. If, giving approximately

equal weight to M-1 and M-2, it appears that growth rates over the



-14-

2-month period will deviate significantly from the mid-points of

the indicated ranges, the operational objective for the Federal

funds rate shall be modified in an orderly fashion within a range

of [DEL: 5¼ to 5¾] ____ to ____ per cent.

If it appears during the period before the next meeting that

the operating constraints specified above are proving to be

significantly inconsistent, the Manager is promptly to notify the

Chairmanwho will then decide whether the situation calls for

supplementary instructions from the Committee.

"Money Market" Formulation

At this time, the Committee seeks to maintain about the

prevailing money market conditions (or to achieve somewhat easier

or somewhat firmer money market conditions) during the period

immediately ahead, provided that monetary aggregates appear to

be growing at approximately the rates currently expected, which

are believed to be on a path reasonably consistent with the

longer-run ranges for monetary aggregates cited in the preceding

paragraph. Specifically, the Committee seeks to maintain the

weekly average Federal funds rate at about ____ per cent, so long

as M-1 and M-2 appear to be growing over the June-July period at

annual rates within ranges of ____ to ____ per cent and

to ____ per cent, respectively. If, giving approximately equal

weight to M-1 and M-2, it appears that growth rates over the

2-month period are approaching or moving beyond the limits of the



-15-

indicated ranges, the operational objective for the weekly average

Federal funds rate shall be modified in an orderly fashion within

a range of ____ to ____ per cent.

If it appears during the period before the next meeting

that the operating constraints specified above are proving to be

significantly inconsistent, the Manager is promptly to notify the

Chairman who will then decide whether the situation calls for

supplementary instructions from the Committee.

From the first to the second quarter the reserve aggregate

measures shown above are estimated to have grown at the following annual

rates: nonborrowed reserves, 1.9 per cent; total reserves, 2.9 per

cent; and the monetary base, 7.2 per cent. These growth rates are

generally below the longer-run rates shown in the table above. Growth

in reserve aggregates is projected to accelerate from the second to the

third quarter, as member bank deposits--including CD's--expand more rapidly.

The growth rate in nonborrowed reserves would still be quite moderate,

however, as the System provides less reserves through open market

operations and banks borrow more through the discount window. Demand

for borrowings is expected to be greater in the July-September period,

given the present discount rate and expectations of a rising Federal

funds rate. Growth in the monetary base in the third quarter is projected

at a rate slightly above the longer-run growth rates shown for this

aggregate.

NOTE: Government security dealer trading positions are on a commitment basis. Trading positions, which exclude Treasury securities financed by repurchase
agreements maturing in 16 days or more, are indicators of dealer holdings available for sale over the near-term. Underwriting syndicate positions consist
of issues still in syndicate, excluding trading positions. The basic reserve deficit is excess reserves less borrowing at Federal Reserve less net Federal
funds purchases. Weekly data are daily averages for statement weeks, except for corporate and municipal issues in syndicate which are Friday figures.

* STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL.
** Monthly averages for excess reserves and borrowings are weighted averages of statement week figures.

NOTE: Weekly data for columns 1 to 4 are statement week averages of daily data. Columns 5 and 6 are 1-day Wednesday quotes (prior to 1976, figures shown
are for 60-89 day and 90-119 day ranges, respectively). For columns 7 through 10, the weekly date is the mid-point of the calendar week over which data
are averaged. Columns 11 and 12 are 1-day quotes for Friday and Thursday, respectively, following the end of the statement week. Column 13 is an average
of contract interest rates on commitments for conventional first mortgages with 80 per cent loan-to-value ratios made by a sample of insured savings and loan

associations on the Friday following the end of the statement week. Column 14 gives FNMA auction data for Monday preceding the end of the statement week.
Column 15 is a 1-day quote for Monday preceding the end of the statement week. The FNMA auction yield is the average yield in bi-weekly auction for short-
term forward commitments for Government underwritten mortgages. GNMA yields are average net yields to investors on mortgage-backed securities for immediate
delivery, assuming prepayment in 12 years on pools of 30-year FRA/VA mortgages carrying the coupon rate 50 basis points below the current FHA/VA ceiling.
