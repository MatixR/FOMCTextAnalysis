MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

By the staff Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System



STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL (FR)
CLASS I - FOMC February 5, 1988

MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Recent developments

(1) In the conduct of open market operations over the intermeeting

period, the Desk increasingly placed more emphasis on reserve positions when

feasible and less on day-to-day money market conditions, in accordance with

the Committee's assessment that reductions in financial market fragility

since the crash permitted a cautious return to more normal operating

procedures. Still, informal adjustments to borrowing objectives were needed

to take account of unusual borrowing behavior. After the December 15-16

FOMC meeting, reserve paths continued to be constructed assuming $300

million of adjustment plus seasonal borrowing, and the federal funds rate

was expected to remain centered on 6-3/4 to 6-7/8 percent. Despite

difficulties in estimating demands for excess reserves near the year-end,

actual borrowing, at $355 million, turned out fairly close to path in the

first reserve period. It was substantially higher in the next period at

$1,460 million, however, owing to unusually heavy borrowing over the 4-day

New Year's weekend and to subsequent borrowing resulting from a fire at a

large bank; the Desk made allowance for both developments in its provision

of nonborrowed reserves. Late in the next maintenance period ended Janu-

ary 27, with average borrowing running very low, an informal downward

adjustment in the borrowing assumption was made to avoid forcing a bulge in

borrowing in the final days of the period, and borrowing averaged $176

million.



(2) With incoming data suggesting some weakening in economic

expansion, the borrowing assumption for the current period was formally

reduced to $250 million, with funds expected to trade in a range of 6-1/2 to

6-3/4 percent. Over the first eight days, borrowing has averaged only about

$165 million. The low borrowing in the current and previous maintenance

periods may reflect a retrenchment after heavy discount window usage at

year-end and in early January, as well as some remaining reluctance to be

seen at the window given still unsettled financial markets and sensitivity

to the financial condition especially of large banks. The funds rate

averaged 6.82 percent over the three complete maintenance periods since the

December FOMC meeting; in recent days funds have moved down toward 6-1/2

percent. Total reserves contracted in December with the continued weakness

in transactions deposits, but rebounded strongly in January as reservable

deposits grew rapidly and excess reserves increased as well.

(3) Year-end pressures in money markets proved much milder than

expected by many market participants. A greatly reduced need for funds

compared with the previous year, the timing of the statement date at the

beginning of a maintenance period rather than on the settlement date, more

advance planning by banks and others, and fairly generous reserve provision

all contributed to this outcome. When pressures failed to develop as

anticipated, rates on money market instruments of private issuers plummeted

in late December. Yields on Treasury securities of all maturities and on

longer-term debt of private borrowers changed little on balance over the

first few weeks of the intermeeting period, despite considerable weakness in

the dollar. More recently, rates have fallen as the dollar firmed on



evidence of improved trade data for November and as subsequent economic data

were interpreted as pointing to a softer economy and modest price pressures,

increasing the odds on a near-term easing of monetary policy. Short rates

have fallen about 1/4 percentage point since mid-January, and the prime rate

was reduced 1/4 point on February 2. Longer rates have dropped more, about

3/4 of a percentage point in recent weeks, leaving them at nine-month lows.

Broad equity indexes are up 1-1/2 to 3-1/2 percent on balance since mid-

December, though daily price movements still were unusually large on

occasion. Spreads between short-term private and Treasury issues narrowed

substantially with the unwinding of year-end pressures, and have fallen a

little further in recent weeks. However, these spreads remain well above

their lows of last summer.

(4) The dollar weakened sharply on foreign exchange markets in

the last half of December.

The dollar

jumped further in mid-January with the release of better-than-expected U.S.

trade figures, and since then has traded in a fairly narrow range, even as

U.S. interest rates declined relative to those abroad. On balance, the

weighted average dollar is up about 3-1/4 percent from the time of the

December Committee meeting.

The

Desk's intervention accounted for nearly $2-1/4 billion

divided about equally between System and Treasury accounts.



(5) Preliminary data show a strong rebound in money growth in

January after weakness in December. Over the two months combined, M2 and M3

grew at 6 and 5 percent rates respectively, close to the Committee's short-

run paths of 5 and 6 percent, and M1 expanded at a 5 percent pace. Demand

deposits were particularly weak late last year, reflecting in part

incentives to adjust compensating balances downward before year-end, but

other checkable deposits also fell in November and December without a

corresponding increase in other deposits in M2. The pickup of money growth

in January was widespread over various components of the aggregates.

Reasons for the extent of the weakness late last year and strength in

January are not entirely clear. However, the decline in interest rates

generally after mid-October and in private rates around year-end probably

has begun to boost money demand this year. Within M2, small time deposits

have continued stronger than the liquid components, though by a smaller

margin as their yield advantage erodes. Flows into money market mutual

funds in both M2 and M3 were especially strong in January as rates on these

funds reflected higher pre-year-end yields on short-term instruments. Even

so, for the two months combined, the non-M2 component of M3 moderated from

its rapid growth earlier in the fall, owing to slower growth in large CDs

and term RPs. Core deposit inflows quickened over the two months, and with

bank credit growth little changed on average from the previous few months,

banks reduced their reliance on managed liabilities.

1. Monetary data presented in the bluebook are based on new benchmarks
and seasonal factors and incorporate minor redefinitions of M1. A
discussion of these changes is presented in the Appendix. The revised
data should be considered confidential until their release, planned for
February 18.

(6) Domestic nonfinancial debt is estimated to have grown at a

reduced 8 percent pace on average over December and January. In January,

business offerings of bonds rose as yields fell, while shorter-term

borrowing in the form of bank loans and paper moderated. Households stepped

up consumer credit borrowing in December while their mortgage borrowing

remained moderate. Tax-exempt bond offerings continued light, despite a

pickup in refunding issues. Federal borrowing contracted in January, as the

Treasury cut back on offerings in light of a relatively high cash balance.

Long-run alternatives

(7) The table below gives three alternative specifications for

growth in the money and credit aggregates from the fourth quarter of 1987

to the fourth quarter of 1988. Alternative I would carry over to 1988 the

ranges that were in effect for 1987; the ranges for 1988 adopted on a

tentative basis in July are given in alternative II; alternative III would

involve a reduction in the ranges. The table includes ranges for M1 thought

to be consistent with those for the broader aggregates, should the Committee

wish to re-establish an objective for this aggregate.

nonfinancial sectors 8 to 11 7-1/2 to 10-1/2 7 to 10

Memo:
M1 4 to 10 3 to 9 2 to 8

(8) The growth in money and debt the staff considers consistent

with its forecast for the economy would be encompassed under any of the

alternatives. The greenbook forecast is for nominal GNP growth of around

5-3/4 percent, and is thought to involve interest rates at or only a little

lower than current reduced levels in the first half of the year when the

economy may be relatively soft, with some upward drift in the second half as

the economy strengthens. M2 velocity should decline in the first half in

response to the drop in market interest rates from October peaks and then

strengthen somewhat toward year-end. Given the pattern of interest rate

movements, changes in opportunity costs in 1988 are projected to have little



net effect on demand for M2 for the year. This aggregate would be expected

to expand about 6 percent, roughly in line with the growth in income, and

consistent with the long-run behavior of its velocity. (Charts of velocity

behavior for the various aggregates, including the velocities implied by

1988 projections, are on the following pages.) Projected M2 growth in 1988

also presumes the absence of special factors that apparently were damping

money demand in 1987. Econometric models of M2 demand tended to over-

predict growth of this aggregate in 1987, given actual income and interest

rates, by about a percentage point; the projection for 1988 assumes any such

shortfall would be smaller. The behavior of household saving may tend to

bolster M2 growth this year; saving was especially weak last year, but is

expected to increase substantially in 1988, and some of this should find its

way into liquid forms of wealth holding. In addition, IRAs and Keoghs,

whose use in the first part of 1987 to reduce taxable income in 1986 was

still unrestricted, will be less attractive this year, perhaps bolstering

demand for savings vehicles in M2.

(9) M3 would be expected to accelerate to around a 6-1/2 percent

rate of growth under the staff economic forecast, implying a small decline

in its velocity, nearly in line with its secular downtrend. Expansion of

bank and thrift credit is expected to moderate somewhat in 1988 relative to

1987. These institutions are likely to continue to securitize and sell

assets, given pressures on capital, holding down the growth of their credit

next year. However, to fund asset growth depository institutions are

expected to rely less in 1988 than in 1987 on sources of funds from outside

M3. In part, this reflects stronger expansion of core deposits in M2, and



a reduced need to rely on managed liabilities, some of which likely would be

outside M3. For example, borrowing from foreign branches in the Eurodollar

market is expected to be less than in 1987--though still above the

relatively low totals of 1985 and 1986. In addition, Treasury deposits at

commercial banks, which increased substantially in 1987, are not expected to

rise further on balance over the year.

(10) The growth of the debt of nonfinancial sectors is projected

to slow in 1988, to a rate of 8-1/2 percent, also within the ranges under

any of the alternatives. Consequently, debt growth would remain well in

excess of the expansion of GNP. Borrowing will continue to be boosted by

sizable net equity retirements by businesses, owing partly to a dropoff in

gross stock issuance at lower share prices, and business credit demands also

will be augmented by an increase in the financing gap. In the household

sector, the recent pattern of credit usage is projected to persist in 1988,

with sluggish consumer credit and robust growth of mortgages, some of which

would represent home equity borrowing to substitute for consumer debt.

Among governments, federal borrowing should decrease as the deficit falls on

a calendar year basis, and debt issuance by state and local entities is

projected to remain quite light as capital spending by many of these

governments is restrained by budget problems as well as the continuing

effects of tax reform. The foreign sector will remain an important source

of funds in 1988, as the current account deficit, while declining, stays

very high. The placement of foreign inflows in various financial assets

depends in part on the extent of intervention purchases of dollars and the

disposition of those funds. Implicit in the staff expectation of a lower

-10-

dollar by the end of 1988 is the view that dollar assets of a magnitude

corresponding to the projected current account deficit will not be willingly

accumulated by private investors at existing exchange rates and interest

rate differentials.

(11) The staff's expectations for growth in money and credit

would be around the middle of the Committee's tentative ranges, given in

alternative II. They are also near the middle of the slightly lower growth

rates associated with alternative III. But the alternative III ranges would

better allow for another shortfall in money demand in 1988, if, for example,

households finance spending more from liquid assets and less from borrowing

as the tax deductibility of consumer debt interest is phased down further,

or if banks once again tap the Eurodollar market in size. The alternative

III ranges would also leave room for greater restraint on demand should the

possibility of a strengthening of inflation pressures emerge as a

substantial risk. With the economy already at higher levels of resource

utilization, such a risk could arise in the process of continuing adjustment

of our external imbalances, especially should real net exports advance more

rapidly than projected, or domestic demand be insufficiently damped to

release the needed resources. In addition, a flight from dollar assets

could cause a sharp drop in the exchange value of the dollar, boosting

expectations of future price and resource pressures. In any of these

circumstances, with fiscal policy unlikely to move toward greater restraint,

the responsibility would fall on monetary policy to promote better balance

between internal spending and production. If, for example, circumstances

called for a rise in interest rates beginning in the first half of the year,



-11-

money growth later in the year might need to be around, or even below, the

lower end of the alternative II ranges, accelerating relatively little from

1987. Alternative III would leave open this possibility. A further

reduction in ranges would underscore the Committee's intention to resist

inflation pressures, should they arise, and continue to move toward price

stability.

(12) The more rapid growth associated with the Alternative I

ranges could be considered necessary to offset the shortfall from last year,

if that shortfall were thought to point to substantial risks on the side of

weak demands in the economy. Significantly lower interest rates might be

needed to support income growth if demands in the U.S. economy from domestic

or foreign sources were appreciably below expectations. Such a fall in

rates is likely to involve much faster M2 growth, perhaps even exceeding the

upper end of its tentative range, and a substantial decline in velocity

would be anticipated, as in 1985 and 1986. This alternative also would

allow room for a reversal of the unexplained portion of weakness in money

growth in 1987. If this were to occur, relatively high rates of money

growth might be needed to promote satisfactory economic performance.

(13) M1 would be expected to expand around 5 percent with the

staff's economic forecast. Given the projected pattern of interest rates,

OCDs should expand about in line with income, but with domestic spending

sluggish, currency expansion might be damped. The velocity of demand

deposits should rise at a moderate pace reflecting continuing efforts to

economize on zero-interest deposits and ongoing shifts from compensating

balances to fees to pay for services. Because of the higher interest



-12-

elasticities of M1, a range about twice the width of those for M2 and M3

would be needed to encompass the same set of possible outcomes for income

and interest rates. Thus a range for M1 of 3 to 9 percent would appear

consistent with alternative II, placing expected M1 growth a little below

the midpoint of its range, as would be the case for M2 under this

alternative. Alternatives I and III would seem to be consistent with M1

ranges of a percentage point more and less, respectively.2

2. M1A might increase at about 4-1/2 percent over the year. Over an
annual horizon, M1A is less interest elastic than M2, but given uncer-
tainties about the behavior of demand deposits in recent years, a 3
percentage point range might also be appropriate for this aggregate,
should the Committee choose to set one. An M1A range consistent with
alternative II might be 3-1/2 to 6-1/2 percent, with 1/2 of a percentage
point more or less for alternatives I and III respectively.



-13-

Short-run policy alternatives

(14) Three short-run policy alternatives are presented for con-

sideration by the Committee. Current reserve and money market conditions

would be maintained under alternative B while alternatives A and C would

involve somewhat easier or somewhat tighter conditions, respectively. The

level of adjustment plus seasonal borrowing associated with alternative B,

$250 million, is expected to entail federal funds trading around recent

6-1/2 to 6-3/4 percent levels. Such a relationship between borrowing and

the funds rate would be broadly consistent with recent behavior but would

involve a lower amount of borrowing than indicated by model relationships,

reflecting some continued unusual reluctance by banks to borrow from the

window. Remaining uncertainties about the borrowing relationship, as well

as lingering sensitivities in financial markets, might call for some

continued flexibility in implementing open market operations. Alternative A

would be associated with a reduction in the federal funds rate of about 1/2

percentage point--achieved by a lowering of the borrowing objective to $100

million, a near-frictional level--or by a 1/2 percentage point cut in the

discount rate. Alternative C would be associated with an increase in the

borrowing objective to about $450 million and a rise in the federal funds

rate of approximately 1/2 percentage point.

(15) Expected growth rates of the monetary aggregates from

November to March under each alternative are shown in the table below, along

with associated federal funds rate ranges. Implied December to March growth

rates, which are higher owing to the weakness in December, also are shown,

should the Committee wish to shift the base for short-run money growth from



-14-

November to December, the more usual starting point for quarterly growth

specifications. (More detailed data are shown on the table and charts on

the following pages).

(16) Alternative B contemplates a continuation of reserve

conditions now expected to prevail after the recent slight easing. Although

market participants may be uncertain as to whether a reduction in reserve

pressures has already occurred, the structure of market interest rates

suggests that some easing has already been discounted. With federal funds

around the 6-5/8 percent area, the three-month Treasury bill rate would

likely fluctuate around or a little above its recent 5-5/8 percent level.

This bill rate is unusually low relative to the expected funds rate, but

public supplies of Treasury bills continue to be reduced by Treasury

paydowns. Rates on private money market instruments also would be expected

to remain around current reduced levels prompting another 1/4 percentage

point cut in the prime rate as the spread between the prime and money market

yields still remains wide after this week's reduction. The recent rally in

the long-term credit markets appears to reflect an outlook for sluggish

economic growth, broadly consistent with the staff forecast; consequently,

long-term rates are expected to vary around current levels, absent renewed

substantial downward pressure on the dollar.

(17) Under the specifications of alternative B, M2 would be

expected to grow in February and March at nearly a 7 percent annual rate, a

little above the average pace of December and January. On a quarterly

average basis, growth would accelerate from 4 percent in the fourth quarter

to 6-1/4 percent in the current quarter as the response of demand to the

drop in interest rates since October more than offsets the effects of slower

income growth. Consequently, M2 velocity would decline at around a 1 per-

cent rate--the first drop in more than a year. From its fourth-quarter

base, M2 by March would advance at a 6-1/2 percent annual rate, the midpoint

of its tentative long-run range. Within M2, rate relationships would tend

to increase the attractiveness of the more liquid interest-earning com-

ponents owing to the stickier adjustment of their offering rates following

the recent declines in market rates. From the fourth quarter, M1 by March

would rise at a 5-3/4 percent rate.

(18) M3, under alternative B, would advance at a 6 percent annual

rate from November to March as growth over February and March strengthens

somewhat from the 5 percent average of December and January. By March, M3

would be 6-1/4 percent above its fourth-quarter base, also near the center

of the tentative range. Inflows to core deposits at banks and thrifts are

likely to fall short of credit demands, leading both types of institutions

to issue a moderate volume of managed liabilities in M3. Credit growth at



-17-

banks is expected to slow somewhat in February and March from its

exceptional January pace, which was boosted by a resurgence of security

lending. Overall credit growth is forecast to increase slightly over coming

months, reflecting primarily a pickup in borrowing by the federal government

from its recent reduced pace. A continued wide financing gap along with a

quickening pace of corporate acquisitions and restructurings are expected to

give rise to sizable business credit demands. In addition to heavier

borrowing from banks and in the commercial paper market, businesses are

expected to tap the bond markets to avail themselves of reduced long-term

borrowing costs. By March domestic nonfinancial debt is expected to be

around 9 percent above its fourth-quarter base, also in the middle of its

tentative range.

(19) Although some easing of reserve conditions is now thought by

market participants to be in train or at least in prospect, the reserve

specifications of alternative A embody a larger move by the Federal Reserve

than has been anticipated in market rates. The downward movement of rates

associated with this alternative might be especially large if it were

accomplished through open market operations, since the resultant narrow

spread of the funds rate over the discount rate could foster expectations

that a further easing through a discount rate cut was imminent. The easier

conditions of alternative A are likely to put considerable downward pressure

on the dollar, though the extent to which this would show through in dollar

declines over the near-term would be affected by the incoming trade data.

The response of bond yields to an easing of policies and possible drop in

the dollar would depend importantly on perceptions of the situation in the



-18-

economy at the time. If economic conditions were thought to be quite soft--

weaker than consistent with the staff forecast--and incoming price data

suggested no more inflationary pressures, the drop in the dollar would be

less likely to adversely affect the bond market, which could register

further substantial gains.

(20) The tightening of conditions under alternative C would be

entirely unexpected, and probably would result in substantial increases in

both short- and, at least initially, long-term interest rates. Stock prices

could drop, perhaps sharply, if the higher rates were seen as contributing

to weakness in the economy as well as raising the rate at which future

earnings are discounted, and risk premiums could widen again. The effects

on long-term rates and markets might be muted over time, however, if this

policy initiative bolstered confidence in the future purchasing power of the

dollar, in circumstances in which inflation concerns had been aggravated by

strong downward pressure on the dollar or greater economic strength than now

generally anticipated.

(21) The changes in reserve conditions under alternatives A and C

would have fairly small effects on money growth in the current quarter,

which has less than two months to run. Under alternative A, growth of the

aggregates would accelerate noticeably relative to the pace of the last two

months, leaving both M2 and M3 at or a little above the midpoints of their

tentative long-run ranges in March. The delayed effects of the declines in

interest rates contemplated under this alternative could push these

aggregates well into the upper halves of those ranges during the second

quarter, given the staff's GNP forecast. Thus, this alternative might be



-19-

considered most consistent with the higher paths for money growth envisioned

under long-run alternative I. Under the tighter reserve conditions of

alternative C, the broad aggregates would remain within the lower halves of

their tentative ranges through March. By reversing most of the interest

rate declines since October, Alternative C would tend to keep money growth

on a fairly slow path over coming months, dropping further below the

midpoint of the tentative ranges, and might be most consistent with the

growth rates in long-run alternative III.

Directive language

1988 Ranges

(23) Presented below for Committee consideration is draft

directive language relating to the decisions on the longer-run ranges

(draft language for the operating paragraph is shown in (24) below). As

is now the case, a separate paragraph would be devoted to M1. The draft

assumes in light of the discussion at the December meeting that the

Committee will continue its practice of not setting a numerical range for

M1. The proposed paragraph explaining this decision is drawn from that in

the current directive, but it has been shortened and modified somewhat.

The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and

financial conditions that will foster reasonable price

stability over time, promote growth in output on a

sustainable basis, and contribute to an improved pattern

of international transactions. In furtherance of these

objectives, the Committee [DEL: agreed] at THIS [DEL: its] meeting [DEL: in

July to reaffirm the ranges] established [DEL: in February for]

growth RANGES of [DEL: 5-1/2 to 8-1/2] ____ TO ____ percent for

[DEL: both] M2 and TO PERCENT FOR M3, measured from the

fourth quarter of 1986 1987 to the fourth quarter of 1987

1988. [DEL: The Committee agreed that growth in these

aggregates around the lower ends of the ranges might be

appropriate in light of developments with respect to

velocity and signs of the potential for some strenthen-

ing in underlying inflationary pressures, provided that



-21-

econmic activity was expanding at an acceptable pace.]

The monitoring range for growth in total domestic

nonfinancial debt WAS set [DEL: in February for the year was

left unchanged] at ____ TO ____ [DEL: 8 to 11] percent FOR THE YEAR.

[DEL: For 1988, the Committee agreed in July on tentative

ranges of monetary growth, meaured from the fourth

quarter of 1987 to the fourth quarter of 1988, of 5 to 8

percent for both M2 and M3. The Committee provisionally

set the associated range for growth in total domestic

nonfinancial debat tat 7-1/2 to 10-1/2 peercent.]

With respect to M1, [DEL: the Committee recognized that,

based on experience, the behavior of that aggregate must

be judged in the light of other evidence relating to

economic activity and prices; fluctuation in M1 have

become much more sensitive in recent years to changes in

interest rates, among other factors. Because of this

sensitivity, which had been reflected in a sharp slowing

of the decline in M1 velocity over the first half of the

year], the Committee again decided [DEL: at the July meeting] not

to establish a specific target for 1988 [DEL: growth-in-M1-over

the remainder of 1987 and no tentative range was set for

1988]. THE BEHAVIOR OF THIS AGGREGATE IN RELATION TO

ECONOMIC ACTIVITY AND PRICES HAS BECOME VERY SENSITIVE TO

CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES, AMONG OTHER FACTORS, AS

EVIDENCED BY SHARP SWINGS IN ITS VELOCITY IN RECENT YEARS.



-22-

CONSEQUENTLY, the appropriateness of changes in M1 this

year WILL would continue to be evaluated in the light of

the behavior of its velocity, developments in the economy

and financial markets, and the nature of emerging price

pressures. [DEL: The Committee welcomed substantially slower

growth of M1 in 1987 than in 1986 in the context of

continuing economic expansion and some evidence of greater

inflationary pressures. The Committee indicated in July

that in reaching operational decisions over the balance of

the year it would take account of growth in M1 in the

light of circumstances then prevailing. The-issues

involved with establishing a target for M1 will be

carefully reappraised at the beginning of 1988.]

Operational Paragraph

(24) Draft language for the operational paragraph, including the

usual options, is shown below. Should the Committee wish to retain a

sentence on its operating procedures, an updated version of the second

sentence in the current directive [shown in brackets] could be used.

In the implementation of policy for the immediate

future, the Committee seeks to DECREASE SOMEWHAT (ALT. A)/

maintain (Alt. B)/INCREASE SOMEWHAT (Alt. C) the existing

degree of pressure on reserve positions. [The Committee

agrees that [DEL: the passing of time and the year end should

permit further progress toward restoring a] THE CURRENT

MORE normal approach to open market operations REMAINS



-23-

APPROPRIATE; [DEL: although] still sensitive conditions in

financial markets and uncertainties in the economic

outlook may continue to call for some flexibility in

operations.] Taking account of conditions in financial

markets, somewhat (SLIGHTLY) lesser reserve restraint

(WOULD) (MIGHT), or somewhat (SLIGHTLY) greater reserve

restraint would (MIGHT) be acceptable depending on the

strength of the business expansion, indications of

inflationary pressures, developments in foreign exchange

markets, as well as the behavior of the monetary

aggregates. The contemplated reserve conditions are

expected to be consistent with growth in M2 and M3 over

the period from November through March at annual rates of

about [DEL: 5] ____ percent and [DEL: 6] ____ percent, respectively. Over

the same period, growth in M1 is expected to remain

relatively limited. The Chairman may call for Committee

consultation if it appears to the Manager for Domestic

Operations that reserve conditions during the period

before the next meeting are likely to be associated with a

federal funds rate persistently outside a range of [DEL: 4 to 8]

____ TO ____ percent.



APPENDIX A

MONEY STOCK REVISIONS

Measures of the money stock have been revised to incorporate annual
benchmark and seasonal adjustments as well as certain technical redefini-
tions affecting M1. This appendix discusses and presents tables comparing
growth rates of the old and new series. These revisions are to be regarded
as strictly confidential until their release scheduled for February 18.

Redefinitions
The redefinitions make the treatment of thrift institutions identi-

cal with that of commercial banks in the construction of the monetary aggre-
gates. Under the new definitions, all vault cash held by thrift institu-
tions is excluded from the currency component of M1, and all demand deposits
and other checkable deposits (OCDs) held by thrifts are excluded from the
demand deposit and OCD components, respectively. Previously, only a portion
of the vault cash and transaction deposits held by thrifts were excluded at
the M1 level--representing the estimated amount held to service their OCD
liabilities--while the remainder were subtracted at the M2 level. In
practice, however, it was impossible to estimate this allocation with any
degree of confidence since, unlike other components of the monetary
aggregates, these estimates could not be benchmarked from reported data.

In addition to the redefinitions noted above, automatic transfer
service (ATS) accounts at credit unions--like those at commercial banks and
all other thrift institutions--are now included in the OCD component of M1,
rather than in the savings deposit component of M2. This change is con-
sistent with the inclusion of all ATS accounts as transaction deposits for
purposes of reserve requirements, and reflects accumulating evidence that
under deposit deregulation credit union ATS accounts have behaved more like
OCDs than like savings deposits at these institutions.

On balance, the redefinitions lowered M1 by $6.2 billion in January
1988, but increased the growth rate of this aggregate over 1987 by 0.3
percentage point. The redefinitions had no effect on levels of M2 or M3.

Benchmark Revisions
Deposits of commercial banks and thrifts have been benchmarked using

call reports through June 1987 and incorporate revisions from other sources
as well. The benchmark revisions had negligible impacts on monetary growth
over 1987 and on the quarterly pattern of growth within the year.

Seasonal Revisions
The seasonal factor review employed the same X-11 ARIMA procedures

that were used last year. Although revisions to seasonal factors had little
effects on the broad patterns of growth in 1987, some redistributions of
growth occurred between the first and second halves. On a quarterly average
basis, the seasonal factor revisions raised M1 growth by about 0.2 percent-
age point in the second half, while lowering second half growth for M2 and
M3 by a similar amount.
