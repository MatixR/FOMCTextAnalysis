Prefatory Note 

 
 

The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain. 
 

Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a redaction process that removed information obtained on a 
confidential basis.  All redacted passages are exempt from disclosure under applicable 
provisions of the Freedom of Information Act.    

 

                                                 
1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked 
and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not 
reliably recognized by the OCR process and were not checked or corrected by staff.

MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Recent developments

(1) M1 expanded at an average annual rate of about 6-1/2 per-

cent during February and March, based on preliminary estimates for March.

For the December-to-March period M1 growth is estimated at around 8 per-

cent, above the 7 percent rate of expansion specified by the Committee

and placing this aggregate in March in the upper half of its long-run

target range. The pickup in M1 growth in the first quarter fell short

of the strengthening in GNP expansion, implying about a 5 percent in-

crease, at an annual rate, in M1 velocity, some 3 percentage points faster

than in the second half of last year.

(2) M2 grew at about 8-1/2 and 5 percent annual rates in

February and March, respectively, bringing growth from December to March

to an estimated 6-1/2 percent annual rate-somewhat below the 8 percent

path specified by the Committee--and leaving M2 in March in the lower

half of its long-run 6 to 9 percent range. The more liquid components

of M2 have grown relatively rapidly in early 1984, but small time deposit

expansion has slowed sharply; this deceleration may partly reflect shifts

of deposits to IRA and Keogh balances, which are not included in the

aggregates; such shifts may not yet be fully reflected in the M2 seasonal

factors. With the relatively slow growth of M2 early this year, its

velocity is estimated to have increased at an unusually rapid annual rate

of around 5-1/2 percent in the first quarter.

(3) M3 expanded at an estimated 9-1/2 percent average annual

rate during February and March, and growth of this aggregate since

December is estimated at 8-1/2 percent, somewhat above the rate sought

by the FOMC. M3 in March is at the upper end of its long-run range.

Issuance of large time deposits by both banks and thrifts picked up in

the first quarter reflecting strong credit growth at these institutions;

net inflows of funds to U.S. banks from their overseas offices were

relatively small through the first two months of the year.

(4) The debt of domestic nonfinancial sectors increased at an

average annual rate of 12-3/4 percent in January and February (as esti-

mated from latest available data), up from around a 10-3/4 percent pace

in the fourth quarter as federal government borrowing surged (with an

associated large build-up in Treasury cash balances). Nonfederal debt

expanded, on average, at about a 10 percent rate, close to the pace of

the fourth quarter, as business firms have stepped up both short- and

long-term borrowings and credit demands to finance housing and consumer

durables have remained strong. In February, growth in nonfederal debt

is estimated to have been boosted by nearly a percentage point by borrow-

ing associated with the Texaco-Getty merger. Nonetheless, even after

allowance for borrowing related to the merger, debt of domestic nonfinan-

cial sectors appears to be running above the FOMC's 8 to 11 percent band

set for 1984.

(5) A somewhat more cautious approach to reserve management

by depository institutions has been evident in the period following the

advent of contemporaneous reserve requirements. Excess reserves were

very high in the first full maintenance period under CRR, when the final

phasedown to lower reserve requirements also occurred, but they have

since dropped toward average levels prevailing prior to CRR. Moreover,



-4-

at least until recently, depository institutions also appeared to have

been somewhat more reluctant to turn to the discount window particularly

over the first part of the two-week reserve period. The nonborrowed

reserve paths during the intermeeting period were constructed assuming

$650 million of borrowing at the discount window. Through mid-March

borrowing averaged around $600 million, but has risen to about $1 bil-

lion in the first part of the current reserve maintenance period, as

large banks appeared to show somewhat more willingness to borrow early

in a period, perhaps reflecting the tendency for federal funds to trade

at somewhat higher rates than previously. Owing to the high volume of

excess reserves in February, and to strength in required reserves

accompanying growth in transaction deposits, total and nonborrowed

reserves expanded rapidly in February, but appear to be decreasing in

March as excess reserves have declined.

(6) Market interest rates have moved sharply higher over the

intermeeting period, generally by about 3/4 to 1 percentage point in

both short- and long-term sectors, in light of incoming data indicating

strong economic expansion and credit demands, little concrete evidence

that federal deficits will be substantially reduced, and growing expec-

tation of a tightening in monetary policy. Federal funds traded in a

9-1/2 to 9-3/4 percent range through most of the intermeeting period.

However, most recently, they have tended to trade around 10 percent or

over, partly in reflection of mid-March tax date pressures but also

partly in anticipation of monetary policy adjustments. With business

loan demand strong and CD rates up around 3/4 of a point over the past

six weeks, the prime rate was increased from 11 to 11-1/2 percent.

Broad stock price indexes have declined 3 to 7 percent since the January



-5-

FOMC meeting, and are down 9 to 25 percent compared with record highs

set over the past year.

(7) After dropping by 7 percent from the end of January

through early March, the weighted average exchange value of the dollar

has rebounded by 3 percent in recent weeks. Factors contributing to

the dollar's decline included an improved outlook for the German and

other European economies, some concern over a possible rise in U.S.

inflation in the face of stronger-than-expected growth in U.S. economic

activity, and questions about the sustainability of huge foreign capital

inflows to the United States at current exchange rates. Later in the

intermeeting period the dollar benefited from market participants'

perceptions that the Federal Reserve had or would soon begin to tighten

monetary policy to forestall a rekindling of inflation.

(9) The specifications of alternative B, which are those

considered most consistent with the staff's GNP outlook, call for some

slowing of M1 growth from the pace of the December-to-March period,

although this aggregate would remain above the midpoint of its longer-

run range in June. Growth of M2 would be expected to accelerate, how-

ever, placing this aggregate near the middle of its range by mid-year,

while M3 growth would continue near the upper end of its range. Given

the continuing strength of money and credit demands implicit in the

10-1/4 percent growth of nominal GNP forecast for the second quarter,

these specifications may involve some further firming of interest rates

over the intermeeting period and a relatively strong rise in velocity.

M1 velocity in the second quarter would probably expand at about a

3-1/2 percent annual rate, slower than in the first quarter and close

to what is typical in the second year of a recovery. While M1 would

still be well in the upper part of its range by June, its expansion

would be expected to moderate further toward the middle of the range

over the second half of the year partly in lagged response to further

interest rate increases and also reflecting a slowdown in GNP growth.

(10) The expansion of M2 is expected to accelerate from its

unusually slow pace of recent months under alternative B--and the other

alternatives as well--after the extraordinary 5-1/2 percent rise in

its velocity in the first quarter. Even with the pickup in M2 growth

and slowing in the rate of increase in GNP, V2 would be expected to rise

at around a 2-1/2 percent annual rate in the second quarter, a little

less than its average increase over the past four quarters. There had

been a marked drop in M2 velocity during the recession, and also in early

1983 when MMDAs were introduced; thus, the rise over recent quarters

may reflect some unwinding of balances that had been moved into M2 for

precautionary reasons or because of the initial attractiveness of MMDAs.

M3 under this alternative is not expected to slow much, if at all, from

its recent pace, with this aggregate remaining around the top of its

long-term range. While CD issuance at banks and thrifts may moderate

somewhat as growth of core deposits picks up, the need for the managed

liabilities in M3 should remain sizable given projected strength in

demands on these institutions for credit by households and businesses

(including additional financing that may be associated with merger

activity).



-9-

(11) Borrowing at the discount window of around $1 billion,

or perhaps a bit more, probably would be associated with the monetary

aggregate specifications of alternative B, and nonborrowed and total re-

serves could be expected to increase at annual rates of 3 and 6 percent,

respectively. Given the current discount rate, the federal funds rate

would probably be in the neighborhood of 10-1/2 percent, although it

could be even higher in the next several days around the quarter-ending

statement date and also around the mid-April tax date. While immediate

transitional adjustments to CRR seem to be behind us, it should be

noted in this context that there are still uncertainties about the

lasting impact of CRR and the lengthening of the reserve period on bank

reserve management policies.

(12) The market has probably not entirely discounted the

degree of reserve restraint implied by alternative B, and interest rates

generally would be expected to increase somewhat further, with the Trea-

sury bill rate possibly moving up about 1/4 percentage point to around

10 percent or a little higher, partly in anticipation of a rise in the

discount rate. Longer-term market rates should also rise a little fur-

ther, particularly as the market absorbs the recently announced $15 bil-

lion package of Treasury coupon issues (to be auctioned in the week of

the FOMC meeting). The prime rate would again come under pressure as

the spread over 3-month CDs narrowed to less than one percentage point

after allowance for reserve requirements. With thrift institution

earnings deteriorating as rates rose, the spread of mortgage rates over

bond rates might begin to widen. The dollar may continue to hold its

recent gains, and perhaps even rise somewhat further, for a time, as

investors react not only to the higher returns on dollar assets but



-10-

also to the signal of determination to combat inflation. However,

over time the dollar is expected to resume declining in light of the

large and growing current account deficit.

(13) The debt of nonfinancial sectors is projected to grow

over the second quarter at close to the advanced pace of the first

quarter, remaining somewhat above the FOMC's longer-run range. Private

borrowing likely will continue robust, augmented to a degree by merger-

related financing, but reflecting as well strength in underlying credit

demands as the economy continues to expand. Businesses' financing gap

is projected to rise, as investment spending grows rapidly in the face

of moderating profit growth, but the amount of borrowing by this sector

may not increase if the accumulation of liquid assets slows as expected.

Growth in domestic nonfinancial debt for the year as a whole is current-

ly projected to be at, or slightly above, its 8 to 11 percent long-run

range, assuming a slowdown in debt formation over the second half of

the year as economic expansion slows.

(14) The specifications of alternative A contemplate more

rapid growth of the aggregates, with M1 coming closer to the upper limit

of its longer-run range by June and M2 moving above its midpoint. M3

would probably tend to remain around the upper limit of its long-run

range. The near-term growth rates of this alternative-8 and 8-3/4 per-

cent for M1 and M2 respectively over the March-to-June period--would

probably involve a little less pressure on reserve positions over the

intermeeting period than has been evident most recently.



-11-

(15) Borrowing at the discount window under alternative A

would be around $550 to $650 million, and nonborrowed reserves would

increase at about a 10 percent annual rate. The federal funds rate

would probably drop to around 9-3/4 percent. Other interest rates

also would be expected to decline from current levels, at least to the

degree that some of the recent rate increases may have anticipated

firmer monetary conditions than contemplated under this alternative.

The extent of any such rally could be quite limited, however, in the

absence of substantive progress in reducing the budget deficit and

evidence of a slowing in the pace of economic activity. Moreover, a

tendency for growth in the monetary aggregates to be relatively strong,

as is anticipated in this alternative, particularly for M1 and M3, would

probably lead to market expectations that any moderation in the degree

of pressure on bank reserve positions was not sustainable.

(16) The approach of alternative A would probably lead to

more rapid GNP growth over the spring and summer than in the staff's

current forecast. In such a case, this alternative increases the odds

that a substantial rise of interest rates later this year and into 1985

may be needed to keep money growth rates within their long-run target

bands and/or to forestall greater upward pressures than currently

projected on the average price level.

(17) Alternative C involves a more restrictive policy than

either A or B--slowing M1 growth, for example, over the March-to-June

period to about 5 percent at an annual rate, which would place it at

about the middle of its longer-run range by mid-year. M2 growth would

remain relatively restrained and this aggregate would stay in the lower



-12-

part of its long-run range. Discount window borrowing might rise to

around $1-1/2 billion over the intermeeting period, with nonborrowed

reserves falling at a 4 percent annual rate.

(18) The federal funds rate would probably rise to over 11

percent under this alternative, and other market interest rates would

be expected to advance sharply further. It is probable that growth in

economic activity would be more restrained as the year progresses than

in the current Greenbook forecast, and total domestic nonfinancial debt

would be more likely to grow within the Committee's long-run range for

that aggregate over the year. There would be less risk of an increase

in inflationary pressures under this approach, though at the same time

there would be greater risk of provoking an undesired weakening in de-

mand for goods and services. Thrift institutions would come under

substantial earnings pressures. Borrowers and creditors involved in

international lending would find their problems intensified as dollar

interest rates rose and the dollar remained under upward pressure in

exchange markets for a time. Given the degree of restraint on the

economy and on credit growth that may develop, interest rates could be-

gin to decline later in the year as needed to maintain monetary growth

around the mid-point of the long-run ranges and to sustain a reasonable

rate of economic growth.

Directive language

(19) Proposed language for the operational paragraphs of the

directive, with alternatives, is shown below. Two variants for the

first sentence are given. The first variant is based on the present

directive and presents alternative language with regard to instructions

concerning the degree of pressure on reserve positions--whether to "main-

tain", "increase somewhat", or simply "increase". Alternative A would be

consistent with language to "maintain" the existing degree of reserve

restraint (interpreted as borrowing averaging over time on the order of

$650 million). Alternatives B and C would be consistent with language

"to increase somewhat" or "to increase" reserve restraint, respectively.

Variant II differs from the first by focusing on the degree

of pressure on reserve positions that has recently emerged. Maintenance

of such pressure could be construed as consistent with the approach of

alternative B or an approach between A and B.

OPERATIONAL PARAGRAPHS

First Sentence: Variant I

anticipating that approach will be consistent with growth of M2 and M3

percent during the period from [DEL: December to] March TO JUNE.

Remaining language for either alternative

[DEL: Growth in] Nonfinancial debt is expected to GROW AT A RATE [DEL: be within]

AROUND THE UPPER LIMIT OF the MONITORING range established for the

year. Lesser restraint would be acceptable in the context of a shortfall

in monetary and credit growth from current expectations, while somewhat

greater restraint might be acceptable with more rapid expansion of the

aggregates, both viewed in the context of the strength of the business

expansion and inflationary pressures. [Possible alternative: SOMEWHAT

GREATER OR LESSER RESTRAINT WOULD BE ACCEPTABLE IN THE EVENT OF A

SIGNIFICANT DEVIATION IN GROWTH OF THE MONETARY AGGREGATES FROM CURRENT

EXPECTATIONS, viewed in the context of the strength of the business

expansion and inflationary pressures.]

[DEL: implementing policy in the weeks ahead, the Manager was

instructed to take account of the uncertainties associated with the

introduction of the system of more contemperaneous reserve requirements,

particularly including the possibility that depository institutions,

during a transition period may desire to hold more excess reserves.]

The Chairman may call for Committee consultation if it appears

to the Manager for Domestic Operations that pursuit of the monetary

objectives and related reserve paths during the period before the next

meeting is likely to be associated with a federal funds rate persistently

outside a range of [DEL: 6 to 10] ____ TO ____ percent.
