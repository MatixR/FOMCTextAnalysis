The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain. 
 

Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These

CLASS I - FOMC March 23, 1990

MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Recent Developments

(1) Open market operations since the last FOMC meeting have been

aimed at maintaining reserve pressures at the level prevailing since late

last year. The federal funds rate stayed mostly around 8-1/4 percent.

Abstracting from special situation borrowing by the Bank of New England,

initially classified as adjustment borrowing, the allowance for adjustment

plus seasonal borrowing incorporated in the nonborrowed reserve objective

during the intermeeting period was $150 million. Seasonal plus adjustment

borrowing averaged $160 million in the three maintenance periods since the

February meeting. Borrowing generally has run well below this level,

except for occasional surges on settlement Wednesdays owing to unexpected

movements in the supply and demand for reserves; not only was adjustment

borrowing usually quite low, but the increase in seasonal borrowing has

been somewhat less than typical over this part of the year. Market

concerns about financial strains on some institutions evidently have made

banks even more chary of being seen at the window, and needs for liquidity

have been held down by sluggish loan demand and robust inflows of retail

deposits.

(2) Although the federal funds rate was steady over the inter-

meeting period, other short-term rates edged higher as have yields on

England in the first maintenance period. This borrowing was classified
as extended credit on February 21, the last day of that period.



intermediate-term issues, maintaining a modest upward tilt to the Treasury

yield curve out to 3 years. Somewhat mixed economic information received

over the intermeeting period evidently was interpreted as pointing, on

balance, to some firming of economic activity and the persistence of price

pressures. The Federal Reserve, consequently, is now seen as unlikely to

ease policy any further in the near term, especially against the back-

ground of its stated commitment to reducing inflation gradually, and pos-

sibly even having to tighten over a somewhat longer horizon. Treasury

bond yields, though fluctuating over a fairly wide range, fell slightly on

balance over the period, despite increases in long-term rates in other

major countries, which reflected importantly increases in inflation

expectations, as discussed below in paragraph (3). Indeed, bond yields

may have been held down to an extent by shifting demands toward dollar

assets, as evidenced also by a rise in the foreign exchange value of the

dollar. Stock prices also were firm, with major indexes rising 1 to 2

percent over the intermeeting period. The collapse of Drexel Burnham

Lambert had little impact on financial markets outside the noninvestment-

grade sectors. Its collapse, along with potential sales by some large

institutional holders, contributed to a widening of the spread between

yields on junk bonds and other long-term securities. In addition, some

corporations that had been issuing low-grade or unrated commercial paper

through Drexel were unable to roll over maturing issues.

(3) The dollar's exchange value has appreciated by about 3 per-

cent on a weighted-average basis since the last Committee meeting, rising

6 percent against the yen and sterling and 3 percent against the mark.



The dollar's strength generally seemed to reflect various political and

financial difficulties in foreign countries. Despite a favorable result

for the ruling LDP in the Japanese parliamentary elections, a generally

bearish mood continued to prevail in Japanese financial markets. Stock

prices declined by about 20 percent while long-term bond yields rose by

more than 50 basis points. Three-month interest rates in Japan also rose

by 50 basis points, all in advance of the Bank of Japan's one percentage

point increase in its discount rate on March 20. In Germany, increased

inflation expectations, related to monetary unification, propelled bond

rates more than 50 basis points higher, while 3-month German rates rose by

30 basis points. German stock prices rose slightly, on balance, over the

period. In the United Kingdom, an uncertain political situation combined

with a more pessimistic outlook for inflation and the external deficit to

depress sterling.

the Desk accounted for

nearly $1.7 billion, $1.5 billion against yen and $200 million against DM.

All of the Desk's sales of dollars after March 2--$830 million--were for

the Treasury's account.

(4) M2 accelerated to a 9-1/2 percent rate of increase in Febru-

ary but, based on partial deposit data through March 19, is estimated to

be slowing to a 6 percent rate this month. This pattern would bring the

rate of increase from December to 6-1/2 percent, a bit below the 7 percent

path specified by the Committee for the December-to-March period. Demands

for M2 this quarter likely have been boosted by strength in nominal in-

come, by some acceleration in personal income tax refunds, and, perhaps



earlier in the quarter, by a reluctance to commit funds to junk bond and

stock markets in view of unsettled conditions. However, the opportunity

costs of holding M2 instruments have risen over the first three months of

the year, as retail deposit offering rates have remained relatively flat,

especially at shorter maturities, while most market rates have risen. In

addition to the usual lag of deposit behind market rates, depository

institutions may have held down offering rates as core deposits remained

fairly strong relative to asset growth. The damping influence on M2

demand of higher opportunity costs is evidenced by the recent strength in

noncompetitive tenders at Treasury auctions, and, along with the ebbing

effects of earlier market rate decreases, has contributed to a small

estimated increase in M2 velocity in the first quarter, after two quarters

of substantial declines.2

(5) Following a 5-1/2 percent rate of expansion in February,

growth of M3 is estimated at a 1-1/2 percent rate in March. Over the

first three months of the year, M3 has grown at a 3 percent rate, 1/2

percentage point below the pace specified by the Committee for the

December-to-March period. Expansion of M3 thus far this year has been

curbed by continued contraction of the thrift industry, though apparently

the rate of decline has been slower than in the fourth quarter. In addi-

tion, a variety of influences have damped M3 growth at banks: growth of

2. Currency growth, though moderating, remained strong in March, fol-
lowing three months of expansion averaging 11 percent; foreign demands
appear to account for the unusual strength in currency. Even so, M1
growth was held down to only about 4-1/2 percent over the first three
months of the year by slow growth in transaction deposits. Reflecting
rapid increases in currency, the monetary base expanded at a 10 percent
rate from December to March.



bank credit was weak in January, while the financing of stronger asset

growth in February and March relied heavily on non-M3 managed liabilities

and government deposits. Although banks have tapped the Eurodollar

deposit market for funds this year, holdings of those deposits by U.S.

residents--a component of M3--has continued to decline, further depressing

growth of this aggregate. Apparently, U.S. residents have found these

investments less attractive at the unusually narrow spreads prevailing

relative to returns on domestic investments.

(6) Growth in the debt of nonfinancial sectors over the first

quarter is estimated to have continued at about the 7-1/2 percent pace of

the last three months of 1989, leaving this aggregate around the middle of

its monitoring range. Treasury borrowing has picked up, seasonally ad-

justed, in anticipation of funding RTC working capital needs; borrowing by

private sectors, however, evidently moderated slightly. Business borrow-

ing remained subdued. Equity retirements dropped further, reflecting

inhospitable conditions in the junk bond market and more stringent credit

standards by banks and other lenders; on the other hand, business needs

for external funds to finance increases in capital spending widened as

internal funds dropped further. A survey of large banks also suggested

they were taking a more cautious approach to lending to below investment-

grade business borrowers for other purposes; however, recent business-loan

price information does not provide any evidence of widespread increases in

spreads of loan rates over funding costs. For the first time in the cur-

rent expansion, banks showed virtually no overall increases in their wil-

lingness to extend consumer installment loans over recent months, and a



-6-

substantial proportion have tightened standards on home equity lines of

credit. Nevertheless, consumer credit extended by banks and others so far

this year appears to be expanding at around its moderate fourth-quarter

pace, maintained in part by generous auto incentive packages. Mortgage

rate spreads suggest that credit for residential first mortgages is gener-

ally available, but survey evidence coupled with Call report data indicate

that banks have reduced the availability of commercial real estate credit,

particularly for construction and land development purposes.

NOTE: Monthly reserve measures, including excess reserves and borrowing, are
calculated by prorating averages for two-week reserve maintenance periods that
overlap months. Reserve data have been revised to reflect annual revisions to
seasonal factors and to adjust for discontinuities associated with the annual
indexations of the reserve requirement exemption and low reserve tranche.



Policy Alternatives

(7) Three policy alternatives are presented for Committee con-

sideration. Under alternative B, maintaining federal funds trading around

8-1/4 percent is anticipated to be associated with about $150 million of

adjustment plus seasonal borrowing, the assumption used since the last

FOMC meeting in constructing reserve paths. Although seasonal borrowing

should increase over coming weeks, underlying demands for adjustment bor-

rowing, absent unusual settlement day pressures, are likely to remain

weak. Alternative A embodies a 7-3/4 percent federal funds rate and a

borrowing assumption of $100 million, while the 8-3/4 percent funds rate

of alternative C reflects borrowing of $200 million. Predicting the rela-

tionship between the federal funds rate and discount window borrowing

remains difficult, however, justifying continued flexibility in the Desk's

approach to the borrowing objective.

(8) Projected growth rates for the monetary aggregates from March

to June under the three policy alternatives are given in the table below.

(The table and charts on the following pages show more detailed data.)

Under all the alternatives, M2 and M3 are likely to remain within the

upper and lower halves of their respective annual growth ranges through

June. The monthly pattern of monetary growth is highly uncertain because

of normal difficulties in assessing the effects of individual tax payments

around the mid-April tax season. Last year, liquid balances were

depressed by tax payments in April and by still more in May, before

rebounding sharply over the summer. We have assumed that the element of

surprise in tax payments reflected in the behavior of money in 1989 will



-9-

be absent this year, so that deposit flows will be better captured by the

current seasonal factors and hence will be smoother, seasonally adjusted.

Still, with total individual nonwithheld tax payments expected to exceed

last year's elevated pace by a little, the possibility of above-normal

reductions in liquid balances to pay those taxes poses a downside risk to

the money paths given below. Another such risk, particularly at the M3

level, is the possibility of very large expenditures by the RTC. These

expenditures tend to depress M3 by, in effect, substituting Treasury

financing for monetary liabilities. The staff has assumed a substantial

pickup in RTC activity in the second quarter, though by less than the

announced plans of the RTC.

(9) Financial market participants evidently expect no monetary

policy change in the near term, meaning that a funds rate around the 8-1/4

percent level of alternative B is built into the current structure of

market interest rates. Even so, alternative B would involve some easing

in Treasury bill rates from most recent levels to the extent that supply

pressures in the market dissipate. That will depend to some extent on the

pace of RTC activity and associated working capital needs. Greater RTC

-11-

funding needs would be met in the first instance by a drawdown in Treasury

cash balances--since some RTC working capital usage has already been

financed--and only subsequently by augmenting Treasury borrowing. Conse-

quently, we are projecting a substantial paydown in Treasury bills over

the intermeeting period after the tax date. Moreover, central bank sales

of Treasury securities to fund their dollar sales in foreign exchange

markets could drop off at any time should intervention activity decline.

The staff anticipates relative stability in the exchange value of the

dollar under alternative B. Decisions regarding economic and monetary

union of East and West Germany, which are to be made by the end of April,

could affect the dollar's value against the mark. If those decisions

heighten expectations of German inflation, the dollar could continue under

upward pressure against the mark; increases in German interest rates owing

solely to such expectations would not necessarily affect real and nominal

interest rates in the United States. Bond prices in the U.S. will remain

most sensitive to prospects for U.S. economic growth and inflation.

Incoming data on prices and the economy about in line with staff expecta-

tions should not change market expectations that Federal Reserve policy

will remain essentially unchanged for a time, and consequently would be

associated with only minor movements in bond yields.

(10) An immediate policy easing under alternative A that brought

the federal funds rate down to 7-3/4 percent would run counter to market

sentiment and ripple through the money market, with other short-term rates

likely declining a similar amount. Lower short-term funding costs also

should engender reductions in lending rates on business and consumer

credit. The exchange value of the dollar would tend to adjust downward.



-12-

A dollar depreciation might combine with prospects for somewhat stronger

U.S. economic activity to heighten domestic inflationary expectations,

limiting the declines in longer-term yields.

(11) The rise in the federal funds rate under alternative C to

8-3/4 percent also would surprise market participants, inducing an across-

the-board increase of comparable size in other short-term rates. Recent

upward pressure on the exchange value of the dollar would continue. Bond

yields would tend to rise, though with inflation expectations lessened by

the monetary policy tightening, the increases could be muted. The addi-

tional policy restraint might reinforce current concerns about default

risk on some loan categories, and would tend to encourage a further firm-

ing in credit standards, implying additional restraint on economic

activity.

(12) Under alternative B, M2 growth from March to June is pro-

jected at a 6 percent annual rate--about 1/2 percentage point below its

average growth rate over the first three months of the year. Nominal

income growth is projected to slow next quarter. Opportunity costs may

narrow only a little from recently elevated levels. Thrifts are discour-

aging deposit inflows as part of their effort to trim balance sheets; many

of these deposits are going to banks instead, and these deposit shifts

would be augmented as the RTC steps up the rate at which it resolves

institutions. Banks may be unwilling, however, to expand their assets in

line with deposit inflows, given concerns about loan quality and the

capital requirements associated with a pickup in asset growth. In such

circumstances, offering rates on retail deposits are likely to stay some-

what depressed relative to Treasury bill rates. With opportunity costs



-13-

little changed, velocity probably will be about flat in the second quar-

ter.3 M1 is expected to continue expanding at a 4-1/2 percent annual

rate from March to June, as a slowing of currency growth is offset by a

little faster inflow to transactions deposits than over the first quar-

ter.4

(13) M3 growth under alternative B is projected at a 4 percent

pace, somewhat higher than the December-to-March rate of advance. The

acceleration primarily owes to some pickup in bank credit growth from

6-1/2 percent over the first quarter to around a 7-1/4 percent pace,

reflecting a resumption of business lending; as a consequence, the decline

in large time deposits at commercial banks should cease. In addition, the

runoff of the term Eurodollar component of this aggregate is likely to

ebb. Greater RTC activity would tend to hold down M3 growth to the extent

that such activity necessitated additional government borrowing; the

expenditure of funds previously borrowed by the Treasury would not affect

M3 because such funds are already on deposit at commercial banks. Thrifts

are assumed to continue trimming their large time deposits at about the 25

percent annual rate of the first quarter, while their runoffs of term RPs

abate a bit because the outstanding stock of these liabilities has fallen

to a rather low level.

3. Revisions to the staff greenbook forecast for 1990 have counter-
vailing effects on projected growth rates of the monetary aggregates for
the year as a whole. Projected M2 and M3 growth remains unchanged at
6-1/2 and 4 percent, respectively, as the impact of stronger GNP growth
is about offset by higher nominal interest rates.
4. Owing to the outlook for slower currency growth, the monetary base

is projected to record a 4-3/4 percent annual rate of change from March
to June, compared with the 10 percent increase from December to March.



-14-

(14) Domestic nonfinancial debt is projected to grow at a 6-1/2

percent annual rate from March to June, down from an estimated 7-1/2 per-

cent pace over the previous three months.5 The slowing is attributable

to net federal borrowing, which is projected to slacken substantially,

despite some borrowing to finance RTC working capital. The household,

business, and state and local sectors are all expected to maintain debt

growth at about their first-quarter rates. Some continued restraint on

business credit expansion is assumed to derive from a further reduction in

net equity retirements. Overall debt growth from the fourth quarter of

last year to June is foreseen at the middle of its 5 to 9 percent monitor-

ing range.

(15) Under the less restrictive policy posture of alternative A,

M2 and M3 growth from March to June would be boosted to 7 and 4-1/2 per-

cent rates, respectively. M2 would be close to the 7 percent upper limit

of its annual range, and on a trajectory that would carry it above its

upper bound in the third quarter. M3 would remain well below its midpoint

in June, reflecting both the downsizing of the thrift industry and a lower

responsiveness than M2 to movements in market interest rates. Under the

tighter financial market conditions of alternative C, M2 and M3 growth

from March to June likely would slow to 5 and 3-1/2 percent rates,

respectively. M2 growth from the fourth-quarter base of its annual range

5. Projections of debt growth for 1990 also have been left unchanged;
however, the composition of borrowing differs. Federal debt increases
significantly faster than projected in the last greenbook, owing to the
decision to finance RTC working capital through the Federal Financing
Bank. The assumed added borrowing in this calendar year of around $35
billion boosts overall debt growth in 1990 by about 1/4 percentage
point. However, anticipated growth of nonfederal debt in 1990 has been
reduced, reflecting the recent trend of lower business borrowing for
corporate restructuring and slower growth of household debt.



-15-

to June would be 6 percent. The associated growth for M3 by June would be

3-1/2 percent, compared with the 2-1/2 percent lower bound of its annual

growth cone.

usual options and updating, is shown below.

OPERATIONAL PARAGRAPH

In the implementation of policy for the immediate

future, the Committee seeks to DECREASE SOMEWHAT/maintain/

INCREASE SOMEWHAT the existing degree of pressure on reserve

positions. Taking account of progress toward price stabil-

ity, the strength of the business expansion, the behavior of

the monetary aggregates, and developments in foreign ex-

change and domestic financial markets, slightly (SOMEWHAT)

greater reserve restraint (WOULD/ MIGHT) or slightly

(SOMEWHAT) lesser reserve restraint would (MIGHT) be accept-

able in the intermeeting period. The contemplated reserve

conditions are expected to be consistent with growth of M2

and M3 over the period from [DEL: December through] March THROUGH

JUNE at annual rates of about ____ AND ____ [DEL: 7 and 3-1/2] percent

respectively. The Chairman may call for Committee consul-

tation if it appears to the Manager for Domestic Operations

that reserve conditions during the period before the next

meeting are likely to be associated with a federal funds

rate persistently outside a range of ____ TO ____ [DEL: 6 to 10] per-

cent.
