Prefatory Note 

 
 

The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain. 
 

Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a redaction process that removed information obtained on a 
confidential basis.  All redacted passages are exempt from disclosure under applicable 
provisions of the Freedom of Information Act.    

 

                                                 
1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked 
and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not 
reliably recognized by the OCR process and were not checked or corrected by staff.

MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Recent developments

(1) The average level of M1 was the same in April as it was in

March, but data thus far available for the first part of May show a con-

siderable pick-up, bringing the increase since March roughly in line with

the 6-1/2 percent annual rate growth path sought by the Committee for the

March to June period. The failure of M1 to expand in April probably re-

flected in part the inability of seasonal adjustment factors so far fully

to catch up with the effects on money holdings around the mid-April tax date

of recent shifts to alternative payment instruments and expanded flows into

IRAs. The slowing in M1 in April was concentrated in its other checkable

deposits component; growth in currency and demand deposits was at about a

6-1/4 percent annual rate.

(2) Despite the weakness in M1, expansion in M2 strengthened

to a 7-1/4 percent rate in April, only slightly below the 8 percent rate

specified by the Committee for March to June, as growth in the nontrans-

actions component of this aggregate accelerated markedly from its unusually

slow March pace. Growth of M2 appears to be strengthening somewhat further

this month.

(3) While M1 and M2 thus far appear to be running at rates

close to the Committee's short-run paths, M3 is expanding at a pace well

above its 8-1/2 percent March-to-June growth path. M3 accelerated to a

10-3/4 percent rate in April, and there appears to have been little, if

any, slowing from this pace thus far in May. The non-M2 components of

this aggregate have expanded quite rapidly, as both banks and thrifts

continued to rely heavily on large time deposits and term RPs to fund

credit extensions.

(3) The growth of domestic nonfinancial debt is estimated to

have accelerated in April to a 15 percent annual rate (preliminary esti-

mate) from the 12-1/4 percent pace of the first quarter. The pick-up was

attributable entirely to a faster pace of borrowing by the federal govern-

ment. Borrowing by the nonfederal sector also was rapid--at 11-1/2 per-

cent--with merger finance contributing very little to this expansion.

Business firms stepped up bond offerings in April as expectations of

near-term declines in bond rates apparently dissipated, but stock issuance

slid further with the weakness in stock prices. Although business borrow-

ing from banks slowed sharply in April, commercial paper issuance picked

up further. In the household sector, growth in consumer credit was at a

17 percent annual rate in the first quarter and seems to have remained

generally strong in April; mortgage borrowing also appears to have remained

vigorous.

(4) The level of total reserves showed little net change in

April, as a further decline in excess reserves offset continuing increases

in required reserves. With total reserves flat and borrowing rising on

average by about $265 million from March to April, nonborrowed reserves

declined at a 9 percent annual rate in April. In the three complete

reserve maintenance periods since the March FOMC meeting, adjustment plus

seasonal borrowing averaged just under $1.2 billion, declining from

almost $1.3 billion immediately following the meeting to $1 billion in



-4-

the most recent two-week period. Borrowing at the discount window thus

far in the current two-week statement period has increased considerably

because of advances to one large bank as a result of large deposit drains

caused by market uncertainties about the bank's underlying condition.

Credit advanced to this institution averaged about $3.8 billion through

the first eight days of the period, while adjustment and seasonal credit

to other institutions averaged around $850 million. The provision of

nonborrowed reserves has been reduced to offset reserves being provided

through this exceptional borrowing.

(5) The federal funds rate has risen from an average of around

10 percent in the weeks just preceding the March FOMC meeting to about

10-1/2 percent recently, reflecting in part a 1/2 point rise in the dis-

count rate to 9 percent in the first week of April. Most other interest

rates have increased even more sharply since the last FOMC meeting, as

market participants have reacted with mounting concern to the strength of

economic activity and private credit demands and the lack of progress in

reducing federal deficits. Widely publicized losses by an insurance

broker, the failure of a small government securities dealer, persistent

rumors that a major bank was in serious financial difficulty, and various

statements by high officials also contributed to a somewhat heightened

sense of anxiety and unusually volatile conditions in credit markets,

particularly during the period surrounding the Treasury's large mid-quarter

refunding. In general, market interest rates--both short- and long-term--

have risen 1/2 to 1-1/4 percentage points over the intermeeting period.

The commercial bank prime rate was boosted twice, by a total of one

percentage point, to 12-1/2 percent. Treasury bill yields have advanced

by less than private short-term market yields, reflecting concerns about



-5-

credit quality, as well as a substantial temporary reduction in the out-

standing amount of bills because of the debt ceiling constraint. The

spread of CD over Treasury bill rates (3 month bill at an investment

yield) rose from about 5/8 of a percentage point in late April and early

May to a high of near 1-1/2 points a few days ago, before declining

prior to the announcement by bank regulatory agencies of a comprehensive

financial assistance program for Continental Illinois Bank. There was

little initial reaction in markets to that announcement, and the current

spread appears to be around 1 to 1-1/4 percentage points.

(6) The dollar has appreciated relatively steadily over most

of the period since the last FOMC meeting, to a level currently just one

percent below its peak for the floating rate period, reached in January.

On a weighted-average basis, the dollar has risen 5-1/4 percent since the

March FOMC. An increase in dollar interest rates relative to foreign

rates--together with industrial unrest in Europe, especially Germany, and

conflict in the Persian Gulf--apparently have contributed to the dollar's

rise.

Prospective developments

(7) The upper panel of the table below shows alternative

specifications for the monetary aggregates for the March-to-June period,

along with the specifications for this period chosen by the Committee at

its March meeting. Differences among the alternatives are fairly small,

given the relatively short time remaining in the second quarter follow-

ing the meeting; somewhat greater contrast can be seen in the lower panel,

which gives the implied growth from April to June for each alternative

and for attainment of the Committee's current short-run paths, given

actual growth in April. The middle panel of the table shows associated

federal funds rate ranges. (More detailed data can be found on the

charts and table on the following pages.)

(8) The specifications of alternative B, which are expected

to be consistent with little, if any, change from the current degree of

pressure on bank reserve positions, call for growth in M1 and M2 at

rates chosen by the Committee in March. With regard to M1, this implies

a substantial rebound in growth during May and June, partly as seasonal

factor "errors" average out, but more basically reflecting underlying

demands for cash balances over the quarter as a whole from growth of

income and spending. M2 appears to be in process of expanding in

somewhat closer alignment to growth of income, following the unusual

increases in velocity in the second half of the last year and in the

first quarter. M2 velocity would still be expected to increase during

the second quarter, but at about a 2 percent annual rate, a slower pace

than it averaged over the previous three quarters. On the other hand,

M1 velocity would be expected again to increase relatively rapidly-at

around a 3-3/4 percent annual rate in the second quarter, given the

staff's GNP projection. This outlook for velocity of M1 and M2 assumes

that there is no significant increase in precautionary demands for

liquidity from uncertainties about the economic and financial outlook

that might conceivably arise from the recent problems in financial

markets.

(9) In contrast to behavior of M1 and M2, M3 over May and

June can be expected to grow above the Committee's short-run path and

also to remain above its longer-run range. Depository institutions

are likely to seek substantial amounts of funds through managed liabil-

ities. However, the rate of increase in these borrowings is expected

to diminish, partly as credit demands on institutions, though remaining

generally strong, moderate a bit from the first quarter pace. Moreover,

if the current sizable spread of CD rates over bill rates is sustained

over the next several weeks, M3 growth might be held down as depository

institutions shied away from CD issuance and became more cautious

lenders--unless they were readily able to attract an enlarged volume of

retail deposits.



-9-

(10) Total debt of nonfinancial sectors is projected to

increase in May and June at rates above the upper end of the Committee's

range, bringing growth for the first half of the year to around 12-1/2

percent at an annual rate. The federal government will remain a relatively

heavy borrower in May and June, and growth in the debt of non-federal

sectors is expected to continue brisk. Business credit demands will be

strengthening as the growth of internal funds fails to match the rise

in investment spending. The increase in household indebtedness--though

still quite substantial--is projected to moderate a bit as rising

interest rates damp demands for mortgage and consumer credit.

(11) The specifications of alternative B are expected to be

consistent with borrowing from the discount window continuing at about

$1 billion (apart from any special borrowing related to the Continental

situation), and with growth in nonborrowed and total reserves at annual

rates of 8-1/2 and 5 percent, respectively, over May and June. This

would likely be associated with a federal funds rate averaging 10-1/2

percent. Federal funds may continue to trade in a fairly wide range

around this level, reflecting in part the greater scope for expectational

and other influences in the two-week maintenance period. In addition,

banks might manage their reserve positions more cautiously (holding more

excess reserves or seeking to conserve borrowing access at the discount

window) should the banking environment become uncertain in the aftermath

of the Continental package, thereby placing upward pressure on the

funds rate unless compensating adjustments are made to reserve paths.



-10-

(12) Interest rates generally may well continue to fluctuate

around current levels under alternative B, but credit markets are in a

highly sensitive state. The behavior of quality spreads will depend in

part on the extent to which concerns about banks are allayed by the

Continental package. Long-term interest rates have been extremely

volatile recently, and they will no doubt continue to be sensitive to

incoming economic data, statements by officials, and the outlook for the

budget. Nonetheless, the severity of the decline in bond prices in

recent weeks suggests that this market--where yields have risen as much

or more than short-term rates--could have overadjusted, and, if short

rates do not rise further, some decline in long-term rates could develop.

However, even if bond rates fell, mortgage rates probably would continue

to move higher in lagged response to previous increases in market

interest rates and to emerging earnings pressures on thrift lenders.

(13) The specifications of alternative A contemplate some

easing of pressures on bank reserve positions over the coming inter-

meeting period consistent with somewhat faster growth of the aggregates

than under alternative B. M1 and M2 would be expected to grow a little

faster than the pace chosen by the Committee in March. Borrowing might

fall to around $600 to $750 million and the federal funds rate drop to

an average of around 9-3/4 to 10 percent under this alternative.

Nonborrowed reserves would be expected to increase at around a 15

percent annual rate.

(14) A considerable near-term rally would probably develop in

financial markets in response to the easing of money market conditions.

The Treasury bill rate would be likely to drop into the 9-1/4 to 9-1/2



-11-

percent area, and bond yields would also move downward. The size of the

decline in long rates might well be limited by larger corporate bond

offerings and by expectations that the lower level of money market rates

could not be sustained with economic activity still expanding rapidly and

credit growth strong relative to the Federal Reserve's range. M1 would be

in the middle of the upper half of its range by June under this alter-

native, but demand for this, and other, aggregates would be boosted in

the third quarter by the lower level of short-term interest rates that

developed as well as by a perhaps somewhat more robust expansion of economic

activity than now implied in the staff forecasts. Thus, alternative A

increases the odds that renewed tightening of money market conditions

might be necessary later in the year if the Committee wishes to hold M1

and M2 close to the midpoints of their ranges and M3 and credit to near

the upper ends of their ranges.

(15) Alternative C involves restraining growth of M1 and M2 to

rates below current FOMC short-run objectives and sets in train forces

that would work to bring M3 and credit growth back toward their longer-

run ranges. Discount window borrowing might rise toward $1-1/2 billion

under alternative C, which probably would be associated with federal

funds trading consistently somewhat above 11 percent. Nonborrowed

reserves would be expected to contract slightly on average in May and

June.

(16) Interest rates might well rise substantially further

under this alternative, especially in an environment in which markets

were still particularly sensitive to problems of the banking system.

Private rates might rise distinctly more than Treasury rates, as quality

concerns intensify, reflecting at least in part greater worries about



-12-

the willingness of developing countries to service their debt. CD rates

could rise another percentage point or so, exerting similar upward

pressure on the prime rate. Although the higher interest rates would

have only small effects on money growth in the current quarter, such a

rise would tend to hold down growth in money, credit, and income over

the summer, thus tending to raise the odds on a decline of interest

rates later this year. The dollar would probably rise considerably

further in the near term on exchange markets as interest rates rose,

though it could be expected to decline later in response to fundamental

balance of payments forces.



-13-

Directive language

(17) Proposed language for the operational paragraph of the

directive is shown below. The bracketed phrase referring to "unusual

financial strains" is suggested should the Committee wish to give explicit

recognition, in the aftermath of the Continental package and recent market

turbulence, to the possibility that operations may need to be modified, at

least temporarily, in face of unusual financial developments.

In the short run, [WHILE TAKING ACCOUNT OF ANY UNUSUAL

FINANCIAL STRAINS,] the Committee seeks to /maintain [EXISTING /

INCREASE SOMEWHAT/DECREASE SOMEWHAT/ pressures on bank reserve

positions, [DEL: judged to be] consistent with growth in M1, M2, and

M3 at annual rates of around [DEL: 6-1/2] ____, [DEL: 8] ____, and [DEL: 8-1/2] ____

percent, respectively, during the period from March to June.

Greater reserve restraint would be acceptable in the event of

more substantial growth of the monetary aggregates, while some-

what lesser restraint might be acceptable if growth of the

monetary aggregates slowed significantly; in either case, such

a change would be considered in the context of appraisals of the

continuing strength of the business expansion, inflationary

pressures, and the rate of credit growth. The Chairman may

call for Committee consultation if it appears to the Manager for

Domestic Operations that pursuit of the monetary objectives and

related reserve paths during the period before the next meeting

is likely to be associated with a federal funds rate persistently

outside a range of [DEL: 7-1//2 to 11-1/2] ____ TO ____ percent.
