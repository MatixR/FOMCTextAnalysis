Prefatory Note 
 
 
The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version available 
based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the Board 
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was created 
through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned 
versions text-searchable.2   Though a stringent quality assurance process was 
employed, some imperfections may remain. 
 
Please note that some material may have been redacted from this document if that 
material was received on a confidential basis.  Redacted material is indicated by 
occasional gaps in the text or by gray boxes around non-text content.  All redacted

1  In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic 
format.  All scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced 
tilting) and lightly cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other 
blemishes caused after initial printing). 
 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optical character recognition computer program (OCR) 
first created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, 
staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.  Please note that the numbers and text in charts and 
tables were not reliably recognized by the OCR process and were not checked or corrected by staff.

MONETARY AGGREGATES AND
MONEY MARKET CONDITIONS

Recent developments

(1) During recent weeks the monetary aggregates have continued to

show quite moderate growth. In October, expansion of the narrowly defined

money supply slowed to a 4 per cent annual rate, somewhat below growth rates

for August and September, but M2 grew at close to an 8 per cent annual rate,

little changed from August and September. More detail on the recent performance

of the aggregates is contained in Table 2 attached and Appendix Table 1.

(2) For October and November combined, data now available suggest that

growth in M1 is in the lower half of the 3-1/2 to 6-1/2 per cent range accept-

able to the Committee--as shown in the table below. M2, however, appears to

be running slightly above the mid-point of its acceptable range. In the case of

RPD's, the October-November growth rate appears to be falling substantially below

the Committee's 9-14 per cent range of tolerance, although during most of the

inter-meeting period the estimates available remained within but near the low

end of the range. The drop in RPD below the range of tolerance for the most

part reflects misspecification of the multiplier relationship between reserves

and deposits that has apparently evolved after the new Regulation D went into

effect.

(3) For the combined two-month period, the slower than anticipated

growth in M1 may in part be attributable to the fact that Government deposits

in November are running some $2 billion higher on average than assumed in the

last blue book. This change reflects the decision to defer $2.7 billion of

Federal revenue-sharing payments from the end of October to early December.

Although deferral of these payments substantially reduced early November drains

on its cash balances, the Treasury still raised new money at mid-month and

scheduled an additional cash borrowing for payment right after Thanksgiving

in order to spread out its fourth quarter financings and minimize their market

impact.

(4) With RPD and M1 both tending toward the low ends of their ranges

of tolerance over most of the inter-meeting period, Desk reserve supplying

operations resulted in an average Federal funds rate of a little over 5 per cent,

little different from the level prevailing when the Committee last met. Near

the end of the first few statement weeks within the period, however, the funds

rate tended to rise rather substantially as reserve settlement pressures on

banks unexpectedly cumulated. During the statement week just past, on the

other hand, the effective funds rate dropped sharply toward the end of the week,

as reserve management and float estimates--at both the Desk and banks--were

complicated by the changes in Regulations D and J.

(5) The continuing moderate growth of the monetary aggregates and

the underlying stability of the Federal funds rate at levels little higher than

5 per cent helped to reinforce the general improvement of securities market

sentiment already being generated by the better prospects for peace in Vietnam

and other expectational factors described in the Greenbook. While yield

declines have been widespread over the period, the largest changes--about 20-25

basis points--have occurred in bond markets. Treasury bills in the 1-year

maturity range also dropped about 20 basis points, as changing investor ex-



-3-

pectations led to a flattening of the bill yield curve. The 3-month bill has

recently traded around 4.75 per cent, down only about 5 basis points since

the last meeting. Other short-term rates are off generally about 1/8 of a

percentage point.

(6) The table on the following page compares recent changes in the

money and credit aggregates (at seasonally adjusted annual rates) with those

for selected earlier periods.

Prospective developments

(7) The table below shows three alternative sets of relationships

among aggregates and money market conditions for FOMC consideration in setting

its monetary policy targets (with figures for aggregates representing seasonally

adjusted annual rates of growth). The table on the following page contains,

for a larger number of aggregates, figures for end-of-quarter levels and annual

rates of growth for the fourth and first quarters shown separately.

that the alternative B aggregate objectives could be attained with little

change in money market conditions, while the objectives of alternative A would

entail easing and those of C tightening.

(9) The strong growth in GNP for the fourth quarter is still expected

by the staff to lead to some pick-up in money demand relative to experience

of the preceding few months, which included an October growth rate for M 1 of

4 per cent. In addition, a sharp drop in Treasury deposits is anticipated

toward year-end, and may lead to a temporary bulge in a money growth. Such

developments are reflected in the ranges for M1 and other aggregates shown

for the Nov.-Dec. period in the table in paragraph (7). These ranges represent

the staff's best judgment with respect to a path for attaining longer-run

objectives while keeping money market conditions from fluctuating unduly.

(10) The specifications for the various alternatives, including

accompanying interest rate movements, assume: (a) continued strong business

loan demands; (b) fairly aggressive bank efforts to seek funds through CD's,

but a slower rate of growth in the outstanding volume of such instruments

following the unusually rapid growth of the second and third quarters; and

(c) slight further slowing in the rate of growth of time and savings deposits

other than CD's in the fourth and first quarters under prevailing money

market conditions (although toward the end of the first quarter some of the

tax refund money could begin to show up in time deposits).

(11) As noted above, the alternative B targets appear to be con-

sistent with about prevailing money market conditions. Even with little change

in the Federal funds rate, though, the 3-month bill rate might be expected



-8-

to rise between now and the next Committee meeting. In that period, it may not

quite reach the recent 5--5-1/8 per cent funds rate range, but the bill rate

could move above that range by the end of the first quarter of 1973 as the

Treasury undertakes large contra-seasonal cash borrowing. However, recent

greatly improved market psychology, as indicated by the ease with which the

market appears to be preparing for the announced auctions totaling $4-1/2

billion of new tax bills, may continue to limit interest rate increases.

(12) Even with some limited rise in short-term rates, long-term

rates would be expected to remain generally stable between now and early

1973 in view of the moderation of long-term credit demands, particularly

corporate new issue volume, and the improved market atmosphere. The Treasury

may take the opportunity presented by favorable markets to undertake some

further debt extension around the end of the year.

(13) Under alternative A, the staff would anticipate a decline in

the funds rate, and an accompanying reduction in member bank borrowing, between

now and the next meeting of the Committee. This would very likely lead to

reductions in the bill rate, despite the increase in Treasury borrowing, and

to further declines in long-term rates.

(14) Under alternative C, the funds rate might be expected to rise

in a 5 to 6 per cent range over the next few weeks. Attainment of a 5 per

cent growth rate for M1 by the first quarter would probably imply a little

further upward movement in the funds rate in the early part of 1973. Short-

term interest rates generally would be tending to rise as the funds rate moved

consistently above 5-1/4 per cent; the rally in long-term markets would



-9-

certainly end and there could be some sympathetic rise in rates there; and

inflows of consumer-type time deposits would begin to slow more noticeably.

Under these circumstances, there would undoubtedly be renewed market

anticipations of a near-term rise in the discount rate.



Proposed directives

(15) Presented below are three alternative formulations

for the operational paragraph of the directive, which might be taken

to correspond to the similarly lettered policy alternatives discussed

in the preceding section. In all three alternatives, it is proposed

to retain a reference to bank regulatory changes in light of continu-

ing uncertainties about the multiplier relationship as banks adapt to

the new regulations. Deletion of the reference to credit market develop-

ments is suggested because of the continuance of the more favorable

climate in security markets that had emerged at the time of the last

Committee meeting. Deletion of the reference to Treasury financing

operations is proposed since the only offerings in prospect between now

and the next meeting are the two already announced tax-anticipation bill

auctions, which would not ordinarily require even-keel consideration.

If the Treasury were to offer a long-term bond over the next few weeks,

it would most likely involve an auction and probably a small issue.

Alternative A

To implement this policy, while taking account of the

effects of RECENT [DEL: possible] bank regulatory changes, [DEL: Treasury

financing operations, and developments in credit market,] the

Committee seeks to achieve bank reserve and money market con-

ditions that will support SOMEWHAT more moderate growth in

monetary aggregates over the months ahead than recorded in the

third quarter.

1/ At the FOMC meeting October 17, 1972 the Committee agreed on an RPD range of 6 to 11 per cent. Technical adjustment for the impact of

Regulations J and D, now effective on November 9, would raise this range to 9 to 14 per cent.
