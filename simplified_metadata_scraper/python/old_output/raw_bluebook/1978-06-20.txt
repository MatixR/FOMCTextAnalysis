Prefatory Note 

 
 

The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain. 
 

Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a redaction process that removed information obtained on a 
confidential basis.  All redacted passages are exempt from disclosure under applicable 
provisions of the Freedom of Information Act.    

 

                                                 
1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked 
and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not

Recent developments

(1) Growth in M-1 slowed to an annual rate of 6.3 per

cent in May, reflecting in part the unwinding of tax-related factors

that had contributed to a sharp acceleration of this aggregate in

April. However, data available by mid-June suggested that M-1 growth

may accelerate to an 8 per cent annual rate in June, bringing growth

over the May-June period to an estimated 7½ per cent rate, just

below the upper limit of the Committee's 3 to 8 per cent short-run

1/
operating range. Growth of M-2 in the May-June period is projected

at a 7 per cent annual rate, as compared with the 4 to 9 per cent

range adopted by the FOMC. Flows into savings deposits at banks slowed

in May, but this decline was offset by a sharp rise in large-denomina-

tion time deposits included in M-2. Although deposit inflows at thrift

institutions accelerated somewhat in May, they remained substantially

below the pace of last year.

1/ These figures do not incorporate the benchmark revisions based on
recently available December 1977 Call Report data for nonmember
banks; the revised aggregates will be published on June 22. As
shown in Appendix Table III, the benchmark revision increases the
growth rates for M-1 and M-2 by an average of about three-tenths
of a percentage point in the fourth quarter of 1977 and the first
two quarters of 1978. All tables on subsequent pages of this
report (with the exception of the first table following the
appendices) are based on the revised series.

(2) In accordance with the Committee's instructions, the

Account Manager sought a slight firming in the Federal funds rate to

7 per cent in the days immediately following the May meeting. The

target rate for Federal funds has been maintained at this level in

subsequent weeks as incoming data, until recently, suggested that

growth in both M-1 and M-2 would be well below the upper limits of

the Committee's ranges. While M-1 strengthened most recently, the

Committee concurred in the Chairman's recommendation to hold the funds

rate at 7 per cent in view of the proximity of the forthcoming FOMC

meeting. The rapid growth in deposits in April and early May and the

decline in average member bank borrowing since the discount rate was

raised in mid-May have increased member bank demand for nonborrowed

reserves, which are expected to rise at a 9½ per cent annual rate over

May and June.

(3) Short-term interest rates generally have increased from

15 to 60 basis points since the last meeting. The largest increases

were on CD's and commercial paper, reflecting strong short-term

business credit demands. In May, bank loans to businesses



rose at a 33 per cent annual rate. Although bond issuance by

corporations remained close to the moderate pace of earlier months

this year, long-term yields rose 5 to 20 basis points over the same

period, apparently in response to the rise in short-term rates and

renewed concern about the prospects for inflation. After paying

down debt earlier in the second quarter, the Treasury returned to the

credit markets following the May FOMC meeting to raise new cash through

the sale of $2.6 billion of 4-year notes and $6.0 billion of short-term

cash management bills timed to mature after the June tax date. In

addition, the Federally-sponsored housing agencies have stepped up

their demands on credit markets; both the FHLB and FNMA raised sub-

stantial amounts of new cash in conjunction with refundings of out-

standing debt in late May and early June. Bond issuance by State and

local governments, on the other hand, has fallen off substantially

since mid-May; nearly all this decline has been accounted for by a

reduction of advance refunding operations, which were curtailed after

the May 16 effective date of the new IRS ruling.

(4) The increase in business loan growth led to an

acceleration of total bank lending in May. However, banks kept

their holdings of investment securities about unchanged, following

a surge in April, and, consequently, growth in total bank credit slowed

somewhat in May. But, with the slowing of both the growth of demand

deposits and interest-bearing deposits subject to regulatory ceilings,

banks sharply increased their issuance of large CD's.

(5) Conditions in mortgage markets have continued to tighten,

with two-thirds of savings and loans reporting funds in short supply.

The average rates on primary conventional mortgages have risen one-



-4-

eighth of a percentage point to 9.70 per cent since mid-May and

ceilings on FHA/VA mortgages were raised to 9 per cent. In almost

half of the states, usury ceilings have been constraining origination

of conventional mortgages, prompting more stringent non-rate terms,

or giving rise to larger discounts where not prohibited by law.

rates of change in related monetary and financial flows over various

time periods.

Prospective developments

(7) The table below presents for Committee consideration

two alternative sets of specifications for the monetary aggregates

and the Federal funds rate for the forthcoming intermeeting period.1/

the tables on pp. 7 and 8.)

M-2 7 to 11 6 to 10

(8) Growth in M-1 is expected to accelerate over

the June-July period in reflection of the relatively strong under-

lying demand for money associated with the prospective increase in

nominal economic activity. Alternative A specifies a range for the

Federal funds rate around its recently prevailing level of 7½ per cent

and is expected to be associated with M-1 growth in a 7 to 11 per cent

annual rate range over the forthcoming two-month period. The staff

projection implies that growth in M-1 over the second quarter will

be at a 9½ per cent annual rate, and that in July this aggregate

1/ The ranges are based on the newly benchmarked series for the
monetary aggregates. (See Appendix III.)

will remain well above the level implied by the upper end of the FOMC's

longer-run range, as shown in Chart 1 on the following page.1/

(9) Expansion in M-2 under Alternative A is also likely to

be in a 7 to 11 per cent annual rate range over the June-July period.

Growth at the mid-point of this range would maintain M-2 near the

upper end of the longer-run range adopted by the Committee for this

aggregate, as shown in Chart 2.

(10) The increase in M-2 growth in June-July reflects not

only the strengthening of M-1 expansion, but also some pick-up in

expansion of the interest-bearing component, due entirely to the

growth of large denomination time deposits. Such deposits, as well

as negotiable CD's not included in M-2, are expected to be issued

aggressively so that banks may accommodate continued substantial

growth in credit demands. Both the expected level of market rates

of interest and shifts from savings accounts to the newly authorized

6-month money market certificate are likely to contribute to a

contraction in savings accounts at both banks and thrift institutions.

Commercial banks are expected to garner less new money from the new

instrument than thrifts, and bank inflows of time deposits subject

to rate ceilings are projected to moderate from their surprisingly

well maintained pace of the last two or three months.

1/ The QI '78 base level for the FOMC's current longer-run ranges,

shown in the chart, has been raised to reflect the benchmark
revision in the series. Thus, the longer-run ranges now imply
higher levels for the aggregates over the QI '78 to QI '79 period.

To attain the QI '79 level of M-1 implicit in the mid-point of the
long-run growth range set prior to benchmark revision would require
that growth in M-1 from the revised QI '78 base be about 5 per
cent rather than 5¼ per cent.

(11) Reflecting the 25 basis point ceiling rate advantage

enjoyed by them on the 6-month money market certificate, thrifts

are expected to be able to use this instrument more effectively

than banks. Both press and Redbook reports suggest that thrifts have

aggressively promoted the new 6-month money market certificate, and

sample data for early June indicate a moderate acceleration in

aggregate deposit growth at such institutions from the pace of recent

months. On balance, the staff is projecting that--under Alternative

A--the recent regulatory changes will permit thrifts to maintain

deposit flows this summer at near recent rates.

(12) If the Federal funds rate were maintained around the

currently prevailing levels of 7½ per cent, as envisioned under

Alternative A, most other short-term rates would likely also show

little net change over the very near term. Following their most

recent increases, both commercial paper and CD rates now are aligned

with the Federal funds rate in roughly the same relationship that

has prevailed throughout the current expansion. Although the 3-month

Treasury bill rate has risen in recent weeks, it still remains low

relative to other short-term rates. However, its spread of 75 to 100

basis points below other rates is not likely to be closed signifi-

cantly in the next few weeks. Available supplies will be depleted by

Treasury redemptions of cash-management bills and by System purchases

to offset the effects of the build-up in Treasury cash balances

following the June tax date. With staff projections



-11-

suggesting continued strength in the money stock, short-term rates

could, nevertheless, begin to move higher during the intermeeting

period if and as market participants come to anticipate further

tightening of monetary policy.

(13) Bond yields, too, could rise somewhat further if

continued strength in the monetary aggregates adversely affects

market expectations. But the volume of new security offerings

is not in itself expected to exert additional upward pressure on rates

over the weeks ahead. The volume of corporate bond offerings is

expected to be quite moderate, and State and local bond issuance is

expected to remain close to the reduced pace of recent weeks.

Federal sector demands on long-term markets, while substantial, are

unlikely to expand further from the pace of late May and early June.

The Treasury is expected to maintain its semi-annual pattern of 15-

year bond offerings with the sale of about $1½ billion of such

securities in late June, and FNMA also will be announcing an additional

issue of bonds at that time. In the mortgage market, with credit

demands remaining large, further increases in mortgage rates (and

another near-term increase in FHA/VA mortgage rate ceilings) can be

expected, even with the maintenance of thrift institution deposit

inflows at around recent levels.

(14) Alternative B calls for an increase in the Federal

funds rate to around the mid-point of a 7½ to 8 per cent range

between now and mid-July. M-1 growth would likely be in a 6½ to

10½ per cent annual rate range over June and July and M-2 growth



-12-

in a 6½ to 10½ per cent range. The additional firming of ¼ percentage

point in the funds rate under this alternative would likely be

associated with upward adjustments in short-term market rates of

the same magnitude, or perhaps a bit more since business short- and

intermediate-term credit demands are expected to remain sizable. In

addition to a probable further increase in the prime rate from the

recently established 8¾ per cent level, banks and other lenders can be

expected to continue to firm up non-rate loan terms and conditions.

Borrowing from the Federal Reserve discount window would become

even more attractive to member banks, and the resultant rise in such

borrowings would increase pressure for another adjustment in the

discount rate.

(15) Bond yields could be expected to rise by less than

money market rates, since the current level of long-term rates

already appears to discount some further tightening of monetary

policy. Moreover, pressures on the bond market would be eased by any

temporary postponement of some scheduled bond issues, and a further

shifting of financing to banks. However, upward pressures on primary

and secondary mortgage rates are likely to intensify, as rising

short rates slow thrift flows.

(16) The staff believes that further substantial increases

in interest rates will be required this summer and fall to restrain

M-1 growth to the mid-point, or possibly even to the upper end, of

the Committee's current 4 to 6½ per cent longer-run range. If

M-1 expands at a 9½ per cent rate in QII, as currently estimated,



-13-

its growth would have to slow to a 3½ per cent annual rate over

the following three quarters in order to achieve the 5¼ per cent mid-

point of the Committee's QI '78 to QI '79 range. During those three

quarters nominal GNP is expected to grow at about an 11 per cent

annual rate, implying--as shown in Appendix II--rates of growth in

velocity considerably larger than over the last two years.

(17) Projections of the Federal funds rate over the four-

quarter policy period are shown in Appendix I. Under Alternative A,

the Federal funds rate might need to rise to 9 to 10 per cent by fall

to restrain growth in the aggregates to within the longer-run ranges.

Under Alternative B, restraint would be introduced earlier and, as a

result, the level of the funds rate required in late 1978 and early

1979 would be somewhat less. As noted in recent Bluebooks, these pro-

jections assume a resumption of a downward shift in money demand.1/

(18) With the projected increase in market rates of interest,

the staff continues to believe that another adjustment in deposit

interest rate ceilings will be needed to keep M-3 growth within its

2/
7½ to 10 per cent range over the QI '78 to QI '79 period. Even

with such an adjustment, our projections of financial flows call for

continued erosion of the liquidity positions of all depository

institutions, which will be required to draw down liquid assets and

1/ No allowance has been made in this projection for the effect on
measured M-1 of automatic transfers from savings to demand deposits,
scheduled to be authorized at commercial banks on November 1.

2/ Staff projections assume a 25 basis point increase in longer-term
time deposit ceilings this fall.



-14-

increase their reliance on managed liabilities to meet credit demands.

Consequently, as the year progresses, the banks and thrifts may be

expected to become much less willing lenders.

Directive language

(19) Given below are alternatives for the operational

paragraphs of the directive.1/ The first formulation, like the

directive adopted at the last meeting, places main emphasis on near-

term rates of growth in monetary aggregates; it shows--in strike-

through form--the specifications adopted at the last meeting. The

second formulation places main emphasis on money market conditions.

In both formulations, variants are shown for particular phrases that

are intended to be associated with the specifications discussed in

the preceding section under alternatives A and B.

"Monetary Aggregates" formulation

The Committee seeks to encourage near-term rates of growth

in M-1 and M-2 on a path believed to be reasonably consistent

with the longer-run ranges for monetary aggregates cited in the

preceding paragraph. Specifically, at present, the ranges of

tolerance for the annual growth rates over the JUNE-JULY [DEL: May-June]

period will be [DEL: 3 to 8] ____ TO ____ per cent for M-1 and

[DEL: 4 to 9] ____ TO ____ per cent for M-2. In the judgment of the

Committee such growth rates are likely to be associated with a

weekly-average Federal funds rate

(A) AT ABOUT THE CURRENT LEVEL.
(B) slightly (OR SOMEWHAT) above the current level.

1/ In a memorandum dated June 7, the staff proposed modified
language for these operational paragraphs and for the preceding
paragraphs dealing with the Committee's general policy stance
and longer-run ranges for the aggregates.



-16-

If, giving approximately equal weight to M-1 and M-2, it

appears that growth rates over the 2-month period will deviate

significantly from the mid-points of the indicated ranges, the

operational objective for the Federal funds rate shall be

modified in an orderly fashion within a range of [DEL: 7¼ to 7¾]

____ TO ____ per cent. In the conduct of day-to-day operations,

account shall be taken of emerging financial market conditions.

If it appears during the period before the next meeting that

the operating constraints specified above are proving to be

significantly inconsistent, the Manager is promptly to notify

the Chairman who will then decide whether the situation calls

for supplementary instructions from the Committee.

"Money Market" Formulation

At this time, the Committee seeks (A) to maintain about the

prevailing money market conditions (or (B) to achieve slightly

or somewhat firmer money market conditions) during the period

immediately ahead, provided that monetary aggregates appear to

be growing at approximately the rates currently expected,1/

which are believed to be on a path reasonably consistent with

the longer-run ranges for monetary aggregates cited in the

preceding paragraph. Specifically, the Committee seeks (A) to

maintain the weekly-average Federal funds rate at about the

current level (or (B) to increase the weekly-average Federal

funds rate slightly or somewhat from the current level), so long

as M-1 and M-2 appear to be growing over the June-July period

at annual rates within ranges of tolerance of ____ to ____ per

cent and ____ to ____ per cent, respectively. If, giving

approximately equal weight to M-1 and M-2, it appears that

growth rates over the 2-month period are approaching or moving

beyond the limits of the indicated ranges, the operational

objective for the weekly-average Federal funds rate shall be

modified in an orderly fashion within a range of ____ to ____

per cent. In the conduct of day-to-day operations, account

shall be taken of emerging financial market conditions.

If it appears during the period before the next meeting

that the-operating constraints specified above are proving to

be significantly inconsistent, the Manager is promptly to notify

the Chairman who will then decide whether the situation calls

for supplementary instructions from the Committee.

NOTE: Government security dealer trading positions are on a commitment basis. Trading positions, which exclude Treasury securities financed
by repurchase agreements maturing in 16 days or more, are indicators of dealer holdings available for sale over the near-term. Underwriting
syndicate positions consist of issues still in syndicate, excluding trading positions. The basic reserve deficit is excess reserves less
borrowing at Federal Reserve less net Federal funds purchases. Weekly data are daily averages for statement weeks, except for corporate and
municipal issues in syndicate which are Friday figures.
