1 Although the federal funds rate was volatile and away from target on some
days following the FOMC meeting, the effective rate averaged 1.49 percent over the
intermeeting period.  The Desk expanded the System’s outright holdings of securities
by $2.7 billion, with purchases of $0.1 billion of Treasury bills from foreign official
customers and $2.6 billion of Treasury coupon securities in the market.  The volume
of outstanding long-term RPs increased $10 billion, to $22 billion, mainly reflecting a
seasonal pickup in the demand for currency.

MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Recent Developments

(1) The Committee’s decision at the August meeting to increase the target

federal funds rate 25 basis points, to 1½ percent, and to retain the assessment of

balanced risks with respect to sustainable economic growth and price stability was

widely expected in financial markets.1  The accompanying statement, however, was

read as setting a more optimistic tone about economic prospects than had been

anticipated, prompting investors to mark up their expectations for the near-term path

of policy (Chart 1).  That sentiment was reinforced over the remainder of the period

by the comments of several Federal Reserve officials and the release of the most

recent employment report, which seemed to convince market participants that the

economy was emerging from its “soft patch.”  As a result, policy rate expectations for

the next two quarters ended the intermeeting period slightly firmer.  Longer-term

policy expectations, however, moved noticeably lower as relatively benign readings on

inflation and the Chairman’s comments on the inflation outlook in testimony to the

House Budget Committee apparently eased investors’ concerns.  According to a

recent survey conducted by the Desk, dealers unanimously anticipate the upcoming

meeting to conclude with a quarter-point tightening and retention of an assessment of

balanced risks with respect to both of the Committee’s objectives.  Judging from

futures quotes, investors expect the funds rate to rise to around 2 percent by year-

end—consistent with expectations of two quarter-point hikes over the three

remaining FOMC meetings this year—and to reach about 2¾ percent by the end of

2005. 

(2) The term structure of interest rates flattened over the intermeeting

period, with the two-year Treasury yield about unchanged and the ten-year Treasury

yield losing 20 basis points.  In addition to the effects of the shift in policy

expectations, longer-term yields may have been pulled down by a reduced assessment

of risk to the interest rate outlook or a heightened willingness to take on risk.  In that

regard, forward-looking measures of price volatility in financial markets declined from

already low levels despite a wide swing in crude oil prices.  Yields on inflation-indexed

Treasury issues changed little, leaving measures of inflation compensation lower. 

While credit spreads on investment-grade corporate bonds narrowed a bit, spreads on

speculative-grade issues fell somewhat more, particularly in riskier segments,

apparently reflecting greater confidence about prospects in the business sector 

(Chart 2).  Further evidence of such confidence was visible in equity markets, where

broad indexes have advanced 5½ to 7¼ percent since the market close before the

August FOMC meeting.

(3) The exchange value of the dollar against other major currencies was

essentially unchanged on net over the intermeeting period (Chart 3).2  The dollar rose

more than 2½ percent against sterling, as the Bank of England held its policy stance

unchanged and market participants grew increasingly convinced that the cycle of

tightening in the United Kingdom was coming to an end.  The dollar rose less, about

¾ percent, vis-à-vis the euro during the intermeeting period as disappointing data

raised concerns about softer European growth.  Against the yen, the dollar moved in a

narrow range during most of the period and ended down slightly less than 1 percent. 

The dollar fell about 1¾ percent on net versus the Canadian dollar; the Bank of

Canada raised its policy rate 25 basis points on September 8, citing concerns about

inflation arising in part from higher oil prices.  Yields on long-term government bonds

declined about 15 basis points in Japan, but were little changed in most other foreign

industrial countries.  Foreign equity prices rose 2 to 5 percent over the period,

somewhat less than the rise in U.S. equities.  The dollar was also about unchanged

over the intermeeting period against an index of currencies of our other important

trading partners. 

(4) Total debt of the domestic nonfinancial sector grew at a 7¾ percent

annual rate in the second quarter and appears to be expanding at roughly the same

pace in the current quarter.  In the domestic nonfinancial business sector, debt

continued to grow at a moderate pace in August.  Corporate bond issuance picked up,

likely in part reflecting opportunistic borrowing by firms taking advantage of the

decline in longer-term interest rates early in the month (Chart 4).  Firms paid down

commercial paper modestly on net, but commercial and industrial loans at banks

increased further.  As best as can be gauged, household debt growth is continuing at a

rapid pace in the current quarter.  Mortgage debt likely is expanding briskly given

attractive mortgage rates and the continued strong pace of mortgage applications and

home sales.  Consumer credit growth rebounded in July from its slow pace in the

spring, reflecting a jump in credit card borrowing.  Debt growth in the federal sector

has remained robust.      

(5) After contracting slightly in July, M2 expanded at a 1½ percent annual

pace last month.  Money growth has been damped of late by a rise in the opportunity

cost of holding M2 assets.  (Such a rise typically accompanies policy tightenings as

increases in deposit rates lag those of short-term market rates.)  In addition, the lift to

M2 from mortgage refinancings that occurred during the spring was likely still

unwinding over the past couple of months, depressing the growth of liquid deposits. 

Overall, available data suggest M2 growth has slowed substantially in the third quarter

relative to the first half of the year, as the increase in opportunity costs has buoyed

velocity.

Policy Alternatives

(6) Over the period since the August Greenbook was put to bed, incoming

information—including the employment report for July, which was released just after

that Greenbook was distributed—suggested, on balance, that the prospects for

economic activity in the period ahead have become less favorable.  In response, the

staff has marked down both its forecast for the growth of output for the next couple

of quarters and its assumption for the path of monetary policy.  The federal funds rate

is now assumed to reach 2¼ percent by the fourth quarter of 2005 (½ percentage

point less than in the August Greenbook) and 2¾ percent by the fourth quarter of

2006 (the current forecast is the first to extend to the end of 2006).  Financial markets,

in contrast, currently price in about ½ percentage point more cumulative tightening

over the next two-and-one-quarter years.  The staff assumes that investors’

expectations will gradually fall into line with the Greenbook policy path, causing

longer-term yields to edge lower over the balance of this year and early next year and

to remain flat subsequently.  Over the projection period, equity prices rise at a pace

sufficient to yield risk-adjusted returns in line with those on fixed-income instruments,

and the real value of the dollar in terms of a broad basket of foreign currencies is

assumed to decline gradually.  Under these financial conditions, real gross domestic

product is forecast to expand at nearly a 4 percent pace from the third quarter of this

year through the end of 2006, a little above the staff’s estimate of growth in potential

GDP of just under 3½ percent.  As a result, the output gap more or less closes by the

end of the projection period and the civilian unemployment rate drops to around the



-6-

5 percent estimated NAIRU.  Still, the persistence of some slack over the next two

years, along with continued sizable gains in structural productivity and the pass-

through effects of decelerating non-oil import prices, are expected to exert downward

pressure on core inflation, with increases in the core PCE price measure slipping from

1½ percent this year to about 1¼ percent by 2006.  Total PCE inflation, after running

at 2¼ percent in 2004, drops to 1¼ percent in each of the next two years. 

(7) Table 1 presents three alternatives for near-term policy, together with

draft language for the Committee’s announcement.  Under Alternative A, the existing

federal funds rate target would be maintained at this meeting.  Alternative B would

raise the target 25 basis points, to 1¾ percent.  Under Alternative C, the funds rate

would similarly be raised 25 basis points, but the language of the statement would be

consistent with the possibility of more rapid firming than is currently built into

financial prices.  Under all of the alternatives, some updating of the language in the

rationale paragraph would seem appropriate. 

(8) The Committee, like the staff, may have read incoming data, on balance,

as on the soft side, but it still may believe that the economic expansion will remain on

track under current financial conditions, which incorporate market expectations of

gradual policy firming.  In such circumstances, the Committee might find it

appropriate to validate those expectations by tightening 25 basis points at this

meeting, as in Alternative B.  Even with the two tightening steps that the Committee

has taken to date, the real federal funds rate is still close to zero and near the bottom

of the range of equilibrium values estimated by the staff (Chart 5).   Such a low real

3. In recent months, output growth has
moderated and the pace of
improvement in labor market
conditions has slowed.  This softness
likely owes importantly to the
substantial rise in energy prices.  The
economy nevertheless appears
poised to resume a stronger pace of
expansion going forward.

Even though output appears to have
regained some traction after
moderating earlier this year, the pace of
improvement in labor market
conditions remains modest.

After moderating earlier this year
partly in response to the substantial
rise in energy prices, output appears to
have regained some traction.  The pace
of improvement in labor market
conditions, however, remains modest.

Output appears to be regaining traction, and
labor market conditions have improved
modestly.

4. Inflation has been somewhat
elevated this year, though a portion
of the rise in prices seems to reflect
transitory factors.

Despite the rise in energy prices,

have eased in recent months.

federal funds rate may be viewed as appropriate in the exceptional circumstances of

last year but no longer warranted today.  A modest further reduction in

accommodation would also be consistent with a number of monetary policy rules

included in Chart 6.  At the same time, though, some forces evidently are still

weighing on current and prospective economic performance in a manner that may

incline the Committee to be cautious about the extent and speed with which it

removes policy accommodation.  In particular, crude oil prices, while falling back

somewhat in recent weeks, remain high and could continue to limit growth in

aggregate demand.  Looking forward, fiscal policy is poised to shift from stimulus to

restraint at the end of this year as the investment expensing provision expires.  And

recent news on spending for high-tech equipment has been less upbeat.

(9) With regard to the announcement of Alternative B, the Committee could

again repeat the themes that the stance of policy remains accommodative even after

the policy move and that this stance, combined with strong trend productivity growth,

is supporting economic activity.  However, the Committee presumably will wish to

modify the next few sentences of the announcement to reflect the tenor of recent

data.  One way of updating the key points in the discussion of real-side developments

would be to hold that: “After moderating earlier this year partly in response to the substantial

rise in energy prices, output appears to have regained some traction.  The pace of improvement in labor

market conditions, however, remains modest.”  In view of the recent string of relatively

benign inflation reports, the Committee might also wish to indicate that “Despite the rise

in energy prices, inflation and inflation expectations have eased in recent months.”  Incoming data

would seem to support a renewed assessment that the risks to both sustainable

economic growth and price stability are roughly balanced.  And, as suggested above,

the newly available evidence would also seem consistent with a judgment that policy

accommodation can be removed at a measured pace. 

(10) Investors appear to have viewed incoming data over the intermeeting

period as pointing to continued moderate economic expansion and limited pressures

on inflation.  This interpretation of the data, together with statements by the

Committee and individual policymakers, has suggested to market participants that the

FOMC almost certainly will firm another 25 basis points at this meeting, will again

announce that the risks to sustainable growth and price stability are balanced, and will

reiterate the view that policy can be tightened at a measured pace.  Accordingly, an

action and an announcement along the lines of that proposed in Alternative B should

have little immediate effect in financial markets.  The conditional nature of the

statement makes it likely that investors will remain quite sensitive to key economic

readings, such as reports on payroll employment and consumer prices, in the weeks

that follow.  Should these data come in consistent with the staff forecast, interest rates

may well edge lower on the building expectation that less cumulative policy tightening

will be needed over the next few years than was previously anticipated.

(11) While the Committee may be convinced that a sustainable economic

expansion is in place, it may be concerned that the pace of output growth will not be

sufficiently vigorous to make satisfactory progress in reducing economic slack.  In the

Greenbook forecast, for instance, resource slack persists for much of the next two



-9-

years and core inflation drifts lower.  If the Committee finds this to be undesirable, it

may consider leaving the funds rate target unchanged at this meeting, as in

Alternative A.  The resulting easing of financial conditions would presumably better

ensure satisfactory growth in aggregate demand.  A relatively slow pace of firming may

be warranted by concerns that aggregate demand growth could be restrained in

coming quarters by a number of factors, including efforts on the part of households

to raise their saving rates and the drag of the widening trade deficit, and especially so

if such factors develop more quickly or forcefully than in the Greenbook outlook.  In

addition, in the staff forecast, persisting slack and lower energy and import prices

impart a slight downtrend to core inflation that could bring it to levels that the

Committee might find uncomfortably low, given the limits to conventional policy

maneuvering posed by the zero bound to nominal interest rates.  The “measured

pace” language would not seem to be an obstacle to pausing the process of firming, in

that futures rates indicate that financial market participants already anticipate inaction

at one of the next three meetings—although apparently not this one.  Indeed, a pause

at this time might be seen as having the benefit of ensuring that market participants

do not come inappropriately to view the “measured pace” language as a promise to

firm policy at every meeting.

(12) In announcing Alternative A, the Committee might wish to state that

“Even though output appears to have regained some traction after moderating earlier this year, the

pace of improvement in labor market conditions remains modest.”  This wording is broadly

similar to that proposed for Alternative B but puts more stress on the limited 



-10-

improvement in labor market conditions and less stress on energy price movements as

the source of earlier economic weakness.  As part of the rationale for leaving rates

unchanged, the Committee could employ the language for describing inflation

developments that is proposed for Alternative B, that is, “Despite the rise in energy prices,

inflation and inflation expectations have eased in recent months.”  Even if the Committee found

good reason to pause in its process of firming policy, it might still perceive the risks to

both growth and inflation as balanced.  In addition, if the Committee viewed the

hiatus as consistent with an intention to move policy over time toward a more neutral

stance, rather than representing a fundamental reappraisal of policy strategy, it might 

repeat the judgment that policy could be firmed at a measured pace.  Lastly, the

Committee might wish to indicate under this alternative that future policy adjustments

will depend on prospects for sustainable growth as well as for price stability.

(13) An absence of policy tightening at this meeting would come as a

complete surprise to market participants.  Interest rates would decline appreciably

across the yield curve, and the foreign exchange value of the dollar would probably

decline.  The effect on equity prices might depend on whether investors viewed the

absence of action as suggesting a significantly weaker economic outlook than they had

previously perceived, in which case equity prices might decline, or, instead, as a shift

by the Federal Reserve toward a more stimulative posture, in which case a rally could

ensue.  At least a portion of the recent decline in the volatilities of financial prices

might unwind as the outlooks for both the economy and monetary policy become less

clear.



-11-

(14) The Committee may be concerned that greater-than-usual uncertainty

surrounds the outlook for the economy as spending moves out of its recent soft

patch.  If the Committee put much weight on the possibility that growth will rebound

sharply, it may believe that the scope of its future action is constrained on the upside

by the “measured pace” language and may prefer to drop the last two sentences from

the statement, as is considered in Alternative C.  Monetary policy has been highly

accommodative for an extended period, and as noted, the real federal funds rate is

currently about zero and may well be considerably below its equilibrium level.  Indeed,

given the decline in longer-term yields and increases in equity prices, financial

conditions likely eased further over the intermeeting period.  Policymakers may be

concerned that this monetary stimulus could be stoking a buildup of overall

inflationary pressures or fostering misalignments of asset prices.  As to the former, if

the prospects for aggregate supply were described not by the Greenbook baseline but

by the “Less room to grow” alternative simulation (in which the NAIRU is higher and

the labor force participation rate does not rise any further to augment labor inputs),

then the Committee might envision more forceful action sometime soon.  As to the

latter concern about asset prices, some could view the rapid rise in home values,

which presumably is being fed in part by the low level of real interest rates, as a

possible manifestation of misallocation of resources and a potential threat to financial

stability (see box).  Removing the “measured pace” language would capture market

attention and result in a tightening of financial market conditions that would provide

some restraint on asset prices and inflation. 



-12-

Housing Prices and Monetary Policy

Over the last several years, real home prices in the United States have increased sharply
(left panel).  Moreover, house prices have risen well above gains in rents, indicating either an
expectation of future significant increases in rents, a lowered risk premium, or a decline in the
risk-free rate of discount.  In any case, and as shown in the right panel, the price-rent ratio has
moved well above its typical range, potentially raising some of the same challenges for monetary
policy posed by the stock market boom in the late 1990s.  With the value of homes accounting
for about a quarter of household assets, changes in their prices could well have an appreciable
effect on spending.  In addition, a significant misalignment of housing prices could prompt

resource misallocations.  Housing prices, however, are much less volatile than equity prices,
suggesting that these developments would tend to unfold slowly, if at all.

 Such concerns have led some observers to argue that the FOMC take more explicit
account of perceived deviations of house prices from fundamentals in formulating monetary
policy.  In particular, advocates of such an approach generally argue that it may be desirable to
tighten more aggressively at present than would otherwise be the case so as to contain or even
reverse the perceived asset price misalignment and thereby avoid an especially sharp and painful
asset price correction at some future date.
  

An alternative view is that monetary policy should respond to perceived asset price
misalignments only to the extent that they contain information about the outlook for inflation
and output.  Moreover, the available empirical evidence demonstrates only that asset (house)
prices are high compared with predicted values from models based on historical behavior. 
Models, however, are imperfect, and consequently it remains a judgment call whether this
deviation really represents a departure from fundamentals or is a manifestation of changed
fundamentals not fully accounted for by the model.   

Even if house prices were known with certainty to be overvalued, the appropriate policy
response is not obvious. More aggressive policy tightening might reduce the demand for real
estate and gradually bring home prices in line with fundamentals, although the appropriate degree
of tightening would be difficult to calibrate.  If the misalignment, however, were viewed as likely
to correct itself in short order, it might well be appropriate to ease policy (or tighten less
aggressively) to cushion the expected fall in demand.  Given such uncertainties, the standard
prescription is that monetary policy should be driven primarily by economic fundamentals–the
outlook for output and inflation–even when home prices or other asset prices may not be.     



-13-

(15) In the description of economic developments in the statement, the

Committee could relate that “Output appears to be regaining traction” and, reflecting the

slightly better employment report for August and the relatively low level of initial

claims for unemployment, assert that “labor market conditions have improved modestly.”  

Regarding price developments, the announcement could indicate, as in Alternatives A

and B, that “Inflation and inflation expectations have eased in recent months” but add that

“elevated energy prices continue to put upward pressure on costs and prices.”  The appropriate risk

assessment under Alternative C poses a difficult issue.  If an assessment of balanced

risks were retained, the deletion of the final two sentences of the statement would

remove any explicit sense that policy firming would continue, leaving the earlier

indication that “the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative” as the only

hint of the future direction of policy.  This concern could conceivably be remedied if

the Committee chose, as discussed at the August meeting, to condition its risk

assessment explicitly on an unchanged federal funds rate and judge that the risks to

growth and inflation under that assumption were tilted to the upside.  However,

members might be concerned that such an approach would lead to a sharp upward

revision in market participants’ expectations for the path of policy. 

(16) Adoption of Alternative C would surprise market participants and, given

the precedent of the marked reaction when the “considerable period” sentence was

modified in January, could prompt significant swings in financial prices.  The path

expected for the funds rate would rotate up, and market participants probably would

become somewhat more chary about risk-taking.  Equity prices, in all likelihood,

3  This forecast implies that the debt ceiling will be reached in the middle of
October 2004.  There are enough tricks in the bag of already-relied-upon accounting
devices to suggest that the government’s finances can continue uninterrupted until
after the election.  Those accounting devices, however, would likely prove insufficient
to the task by the end of November.

would decline.  Interest rates would jump, although the rise in bond yields could be

damped should equity prices fall steeply. 

Money and Debt Forecasts

(17) Under the staff forecast, M2 is expected to expand slowly for the

remainder of this year and begin to accelerate next year, with growth averaging about

1¾ percent from August to December.  The gradual pace of policy moves assumed in

the staff forecast slows the increase in the opportunity cost of holding M2 over the

next two quarters.  Annual growth from the fourth quarter of last year to the fourth

quarter of this year is projected to come in near 4¼ percent. 

(18) The growth of domestic nonfinancial sector debt is forecast to moderate

to 7½ percent in the second half of 2004 and then slow a bit further next year. 

Household debt decelerates as mortgage borrowing falls off in response to a less-rapid

pace of home price appreciation.  Federal debt advances at a somewhat slower rate in

2005 than in the current year, reflecting some improvement in the federal budget

deficit.3  Business sector borrowing, however, strengthens as capital spending picks up

relative to the generation of internal funds.

Directive and Balance-of-Risks Language

(19) Draft language for the directive and draft risk assessments identical to

those presented in Table 1 are provided below.

(1) Directive Wording

The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial

conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth

in output.  To further its long-run objectives, the Committee in the

immediate future seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with

MAINTAINING/increasing/REDUCING the federal funds rate

AT/to an average of around _______ 1½ percent.

(2) Risk Assessments

A. The Committee perceives the upside and downside risks to the

attainment of both sustainable growth and price stability for the next few

quarters to be roughly equal.  With underlying inflation still expected to

be relatively low, the Committee believes that policy accommodation can

be removed at a pace that is likely to be measured.  Nonetheless, the

Committee will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to

fulfill its obligation to promote price stability and sustainable growth.

B. The Committee perceives the upside and downside risks to the

attainment of both sustainable growth and price stability for the next few

quarters to be roughly equal.  With underlying inflation still expected to

be relatively low, the Committee believes that policy accommodation can



-16-

be removed at a pace that is likely to be measured.  Nonetheless, the

Committee will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to

fulfill its obligation to maintain price stability.

C. The Committee perceives the upside and downside risks to the

attainment of both sustainable growth and price stability for the next few

quarters to be roughly equal.

Notes:  P* is defined to equal M2 times V* divided by potential GDP.
            Long-run velocity (V*) is estimated from 1959:Q1 to 1989:Q4.  V* after 1992 is estimated from 1993:Q1 to present.
            For the forecast period, P* is based on staff M2 forecast and P is simulated using a short-run dynamic model relating P to P*.
            Vertical lines mark crossing of P and P*.  Shaded areas denote projection period.
