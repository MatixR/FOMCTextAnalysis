format.  All scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced 
tilting) and lightly cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other 
blemishes caused after initial printing). 
 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optical character recognition computer program (OCR) 
first created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, 
staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.  Please note that the numbers and text in charts and

MONEY MARKET AND RESERVE RELATIONSHIPS

Money markets

Recent developments. The spread between bill rates and

other short-term rates widened during recent weeks. All short-term

rates rose around the mid-March tax date, following the increase in

the prime loan rate, but since then bill rates have fluctuated in a

lower range while other short-term rates either have stabilized or

have risen slightly further. The recent peak for the 3-month bill

was reached in the mid-March auction at 4.72 per cent; subsequently,

the 3-month bill rate declined sharply to as low as 4.46 per cent

before moving back up above the discount rate.

Differences in supply situations help to account for the

differential movements of bill and other short-term rates. Increased

supplies of other short-term debt instruments -- notably, negotiable

CD's and agency issues -- continued to reach the markets at rising

yields necessitated by the conjunction of new financings and large

roll-overs. On the other hand, the bill market was temporarily

depleted of trading supply in the wake of unusually large purchases

by investors during late winter; in addition, $3 billion in March

tax bills matured without replacement and the weekly $100 million

additions to the 3-month bill were drawing to a close. Most

recently, dealers' inventories of bills have been rebuilt to sizable

levels, in part through their own aggressive bidding in auctions,

and this has led to the firming in bill yields.

Over the three statement weeks ending April 6, net borrowed

reserves averaged about $230 million and member bank borrowings about

$580 million -- in each case slightly higher than the levels of the

previous 3-week period. The Federal funds market also appeared to

tighten a shade further, with funds trading at an effective rate of

4-3/4 per cent on 10 of the 15 days in the period and with a small

amount of trading at a new high 4-7/8 per cent rate reported late

in the period. Dealer financing costs also moved higher in the

most recent week, reflecting both the pressures in the funds market

and larger dealer financing needs.

Prospective developments. On the assumption that net

borrowed reserves will continue to average close to recent levels

over the next 4 weeks, the 3-month bill rate might be expected to

fluctuate in a 4.55 to 4.70 per cent range. The recent tightening

of money market conditions may persist through the April tax period,

when Federal funds are likely to continue trading at 4-3/4 per cent

and occasionally at 4-7/8 per cent. Such pressures could abate

toward the end of April and in early May. After the mid-April tax

date funds typically shift toward the money centers. Also, seasonal

demands for bills,from public funds and other investors, may be

supplemented by demand from sellers of maturing issues in the

Treasury May refunding. But rather heavy agency issues in prospect

for the weeks ahead, including a sizable amount of new money, could

be an offsetting influence.



-3-

The course of bond yields will be importantly influenced

by Administration policy with respect to a tax increase. So long

as economic indicators remain buoyant, continued postponement of a

decision on taxes could generate a new wave of bearish investor

sentiment. The Government bond market is now particularly

susceptible since it is in a less strong technical condition

as a result of the recent build-up in dealer bond positions.

The downward movements of bond and bill yields since

early March have occurred despite some tightening of bank net

reserve positions. As noted above, continuation of the present reserve

posture is not likely to be accompanied by any further decline in

rates and probably by some upward movement. Any further tightening

of reserves -- to, for example, net borrowed reserves in a $250-$300

million range -- is likely to place bill rates in a 4.60-4.75 per

cent range and at the same time exert further upward pressure on

bond yields, particularly if market participants become convinced

that a further step-up in monetary restraint is in process.

Reserve flows, bank credit, and money

Recent developments. Increases in total deposits and

total reserves were slightly stronger in the second half of March

than anticipated at midmonth, with the daily average figures for

the month as a whole now showing annual rates of increase of 3 per

cent in both cases over the previous month. Higher member bank



borrowing accounted for all of the increase in total reserves,

as nonborrowed reserves declined for the first time since last

September.

Weekly data indicate a sharp bulge in deposits and

credit over the March tax period and into early April, following

the sluggish growth of the previous four weeks. Much of this

increase appears temporary. The more rapid expansion of time

deposits in recent weeks apparently reflects city bank attempts

to prepare for expected large credit demands later in April and

to lengthen average maturities on CD's. In addition, dealer

borrowing from banks increased substantially during the last two

statement weeks in reflection of their enlarged inventories.

Prospective developments. With increases in all cate-

gories of deposits pushing levels well above the March average

in the latest weeks and with credit demands remaining very strong

through the April 15 tax period, a sharp rise is expected in the

daily average bank credit proxy this month, with the annual rate of

increase in the 10-12 per cent range. An increase in total

reserves of about 7 or 8 per cent would appear consistent with

this expected expansion.

After April, a more moderate rate of increase in monetary

aggregates is anticipated, even if net borrowed reserves are not

deepened from recent levels. The rate of increase in bank credit

may fall back to or somewhat below the projected March-April average



of around 7 per cent. Several factors may reduce time deposit

expansion below the rate of recent weeks -- the spread between CD and

bill rates may narrow, and both growing corporate spending programs

and prospective large agency offerings may absorb funds that

would otherwise be invested in CD's. Bank credit growth is also

likely to be moderated by repayments of the enlarged borrowing during

the March 15-April 15 tax period. On the other hand, the mid-May

Treasury refunding may temporarily increase bank credit expansion,

though the effect may be relatively small in view of the expected

routine nature of the financing.

Moderation of loan demand after mid-April would also

tend to reduce the growth rate of private demand deposits to around

5 per cent over the months ahead. The rate of increase in April

may still average above that rate, although below the March average

of 12 per cent.

Explanation of Projections in Table B-1

1. Changes in Federal Reserve credit inciate reserves needed to offset projected changes in
required reserves and factors affecting the supply of reserves.

2. Projected changes in currency outside banks reflect seasonal movements plus an allowance
for growth of about $30 million per week.

3. Projected effects of Treasury operations, included in "technical factors," reflect scheduled
and assumed calls in current two weeks and thereafter, maintenance of Treasury balances with
Federal Reserve at $200 million.

4. Projected changes in gold stock reflect assumed outflow after April at the rate of about
$50 million per month.

5. Projected changes in required reserves reflect estimated seasonal movements in private
deposits, except as indicated in projections in Table B-2, and projected movements in U. S.
Government demand deposits. Government deposit projections are based on anticipated Treasury
receipts and expenditures and the following assumed financing operations: none.
