text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain. 
 

Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These

MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Recent Developments

(1) The Committee's decision at the February meeting to leave the intended federal

funds rate unchanged was expected by market participants and elicited little response.1 However,

interest rates on Treasury securities moved up significantly in the first half of the intermeeting

period, reflecting incoming data that suggested continued strong momentum in aggregate

spending and a perception, arising from market interpretations of the Chairman's Humphrey

Hawkins testimony, that the FOMC saw its next action as more likely to be a tightening than an

easing (Chart 1). Favorable inflation news later in the period, along with statements by policy-

makers conveying a sense that risks were more balanced, led to a reversal of some of the rise in

market yields. On net since the February meeting, interest rates on Treasury bills have changed

little, but intermediate- and long-term Treasury yields have backed up 30 to 50 basis points. A

substantial portion of the increase in nominal yields has probably reflected higher real interest

rates, at least judging from the upward movement in rates on inflation-indexed debt and the large

increase of intermediate-term forward rates relative to those further out the forward curve. This

backup in real Treasury yields likely owed in part to an unwinding of the earlier flight to safety

and liquidity, but, more fundamentally, market participants may now believe that a higher path of

real short-term rates over the next few years will be needed for the Federal Reserve to keep

1. Federal funds traded at an average of 4.79 percent over the intermeeting period, close to the
intended rate of 4-3/4 percent. Volatility of the funds rate was significantly lower than in recent
previous intermeeting periods; with the abatement of risk and liquidity concerns in financial
markets, banks have not been bidding so aggressively for precautionary balances early in the day.

inflation damped. Nonetheless, some of the increase in nominal yields apparently was also

accounted for by a rise in inflation expectations, perhaps partly in reaction to the recent increase

in oil prices. More favorable perceptions of and appetites for risk in private securities markets

have narrowed spreads on corporate bonds vis-a-vis Treasuries, but they remain well above the

unusually thin levels prevailing in the first half of 1998 (Chart 2). Indexes of equity prices have

been mixed: The Dow Jones and S&P 500 posted net gains, but lower earnings expectations,

especially for technology companies, led to a drop in the NASDAQ and the Russell 2000 index

of small-cap firms. Bank share prices have moved up sharply, notably for money center banks,

reversing earlier declines when a significant fallout from Brazil's difficulties was feared.

(2) The rise in interest rates in the United States has contributed to a 3 3/4 percent

appreciation of the dollar relative to an average of other major currencies since the February

FOMC meeting. The dollar has increased 7 1/4 percent on balance against the yen, as the Bank of

Japan eased monetary policy, announcing that it would guide the overnight call rate "as low as

possible." In recent weeks, the call rate has remained at or below 5 basis points, the ten-year

government yield has fallen 45 basis points, stock prices have risen substantially, and the so-

called "Japan premium" in funding costs for Japanese banks has declined markedly. The dollar

has appreciated 5 1/4 percent on balance over the period versus the euro, which was weighed down

by continued signs of weakness in German economic activity and, late in the period, by the

hostilities in the Balkans. The term structure of euro interest rate futures suggests that market

participants continue to expect a modest monetary policy easing by the ECB Council by the fall.

. The Desk did not intervene during the period for the

accounts of the System or the Treasury.

(3) Financial market conditions have continued to improve in most emerging market

economies, as investor confidence evidently has been bolstered by the limited contagion from

Brazilian developments. In Brazil itself, overall financial conditions have stabilized somewhat

and the real has tended to firm in recent weeks, owing to a number of factors: The Brazilian

Central Bank demonstrated its commitment to containing inflation by raising the overnight policy

interest rate appreciably early in the period; the government struck an agreement with the IMF,

paving the way for the release of the second tranche of multilateral financial assistance;

international banks made public commitments to maintain or increase their exposure to Brazil;

and its Congress completed passage of the major elements of the fiscal austerity program. The

Mexican peso has appreciated 5 percent since the February FOMC meeting, bolstered in part by

the snapback in oil prices. Despite financial collapse in Ecuador, yield spreads over Treasuries

of Latin American Brady bonds have continued to decline, and prices in most major equity

markets in the region are up. Monetary authorities in a number of emerging Asian economies

allowed domestic interest rates to fall somewhat over the intermeeting period. The Korean won,

the Taiwan dollar, the Indonesian rupiah, and the Thai baht have depreciated between 2 and 5

percent against the dollar over the intermeeting period. In local currency terms, share prices have

risen between 5 and 22 percent in the aforementioned countries, with the exception of Indonesia,

where equity prices have registered a 3 percent decline.

(4) The broad monetary aggregates have decelerated markedly in recent months and

by more than expected at the time of the Committee's last meeting. Data through the first half of



-4-

this month suggest that M2 growth has slowed to a 3 percent rate in March, while M3 apparently

has posted a slight decline. In part, the deceleration of M2 owed to the ebbing effects of the

policy easings of the fall, which had narrowed the opportunity cost of holding M2 assets, thereby

inducing portfolio shifts into M2. Indeed, net noncompetitive tenders for Treasury securities, an

indicator of retail demand for market securities, have been positive in March for the first time in

several months. In addition, a reduced level of mortgage refinancing activity has depressed

liquid deposits. However, slower M2 and M3 growth also likely reflected further recovery in

financial markets. Until the stock market turbulence of this week, households had resumed

substantial purchases of stock mutual funds and halted net acquisitions of money market mutual

funds. With corporations paying down bank loans out of the proceeds of security issues, banks

have had less need for the managed liabilities in M3. The velocities of M2 and M3 likely have

dropped again this quarter, but perhaps at only one-half the rates of more than 4 and 6 percent,

respectively, of the fourth quarter of last year.

(5) Private debt growth has edged lower, but has remained quite rapid. A widening

gap between capital expenditures and internal cash flows has boosted demands for funding by

corporations. With the improved receptivity of securities markets, most of this financing recently

has occurred through issuance of bonds and commercial paper. Only a moderate amount of the

new issuance has been used to finance merger activity, as most of the recent deals have involved

the exchange of equity or acquisitions by foreign firms that have not required U.S. funding.

Lower average ratings on corporate debt, an uptick in the default rate on junk bonds, and a slight

increase in delinquencies and charge-offs on business loans suggest a little erosion of credit

quality in the business sector. With sustained strength in home purchases and durables spending,



-5-

households have continued to pile up new debt, though probably at a bit slower pace than in the

fourth quarter of last year. Measures of the quality of household loans have not evidenced much

change of late: Delinquencies on consumer loans, already elevated, ticked up in the fourth

quarter, while delinquencies on home mortgages have edged down to very low levels by

historical standards. Larger surpluses in the federal budget in recent months have held down the

growth of total nonfinancial debt to a 5-1/2 percent rate in January and February.

Policy Alternatives

(6) The staff has read incoming data since the February meeting as indicating that

aggregate demand has been more vigorous and inflation better behaved than previously expected.

However, under the maintained assumption of an unchanged federal funds rate over the balance

of this year and the next, the staff still foresees economic growth slowing and inflation picking

up. Among the forces working to slow spending are financial conditions, which are not expected

to provide the impetus that they did last year given that equity prices and long-term interest rates

are anticipated to hold close to current levels. The staff forecasts that real GDP growth will

begin to cool in the second half of 1999, to average 3 percent over the year, up 1/2 percentage

point from the forecast for the February meeting, and decline noticeably further in 2000, to about

2-1/4 percent, a bit weaker than in the last Greenbook. As a result, the unemployment rate edges

lower this year, but retraces that decline next year. With the economy producing beyond its

potential, core inflation (on a methodologically consistent basis) is projected to pick up 1/2

percentage point from 1998 to 2000, to 2-1/2 percent, and is poised to rise faster thereafter. The

overall CPI accelerates by even more over the two years as a consequence of the rebound in

energy prices.2

(7) Despite the likelihood that overall inflation will rise, the Committee might choose

the unchanged policy stance of alternative B at this meeting. A good part of that rise will owe to

the recent increase in oil prices; most measures of wage and price inflation have ticked lower of

2. The central tendency of the Committee members' forecasts compiled for the last meeting
was for real GDP growth to be a touch slower over 1999 and the unemployment rate to end the
year a bit higher than in the current Greenbook. The Committee members' central tendency for
total CPI inflation was about in line with the Greenbook.



-8-

late, which should help to contain inflation expectations; and the projected rebound in core

inflation is gradual. These considerations suggest that deferring action in the near term would

not unduly worsen underlying inflation trends. The Committee might see important benefits

from that delay if it thought that only a modest policy adjustment was necessary and wanted to

use the time to build a case for such action with the public, thereby fostering a more measured

reaction in financial markets than would ensue with unanticipated action. Inaction would be

particularly attractive to the Committee if it suspected that the price outlook in the Greenbook

was more likely to be subject to further favorable surprises than to adverse ones, implying that

firmer evidence of an impending acceleration in prices would be desirable before tightening

policy. Indeed, the Committee may be of the opinion that the staff has built in too large an uptick

to inflation, perhaps by placing too little emphasis on the disinflationary force of ample industrial

capacity and the market discipline now exerted on the ability of firms to pass along price

increases, or by giving too much credence to the power of oil producers to enforce their recent

curbs on supply.

(8) Continuing the current stance of policy, as envisioned in alternative B, would

match the expectations currently embodied in financial market prices. As a result, the immediate

market reaction to no adjustment in the federal funds rate should be little movement in other

interest rates or in the exchange value of the dollar. Over time, if output were to decelerate and

underlying inflation to remain contained, as in the staff forecast, long-term interest rates should

fluctuate around their current levels, although, as Congress and the administration address budget

issues, markets might become more sensitive to developments regarding the burgeoning federal

budget surplus. With the economic environment remaining benign and concerns about near-term



-9-

monetary policy tightening mostly quiescent, major equity price indexes are likely to be little

changed on net, despite pressure on corporate profit margins.

(9) If the Committee were concerned that inflation was likely to be on an upward

path, as in the staff forecast, it might favor the 1/4 percentage point tightening in the intended

federal funds rate of alternative C. With aggregate demand remaining strong, credit conditions

improving further, and many emerging market economies showing signs of stabilizing, the

Committee might believe that the current meeting is an appropriate time to roll back the policy

easing of last November, initiating the policy action needed to contain inflation over time. Many

on the Committee had viewed the last easing action as an insurance policy taken out as a

precaution against further financial turmoil and a significant broadening of the crises in emerging

markets. While this action may have helped to forestall these eventualities, in current

circumstances they would be unlikely to surface if that action were reversed. The desirability of

immediate tightening would be enhanced to the extent that the Committee read recent data on

spending as indicating that the growth of aggregate demand would not slow as in the staff

projection but rather would remain unsustainably strong absent a tightening of financial

conditions. With the unemployment rate already low and perhaps headed lower, real interest

rates would seem to be falling short of levels required to contain inflationary pressures.

Moreover, while domestic price increases in the past few years have run at a much slower pace

than might have been expected in light of labor market conditions, recently some of the forces

that may have been responsible for this result--declines in oil prices and inflation expectations--

show signs of reversing.



-10-

(10) While financial market participants apparently believe that the Committee's next

move will be toward restraint, no measurable weight is placed on action at this meeting. As a

result, the 25 basis point hike in the intended federal funds rate of alternative C could spark a

substantial reaction in financial markets. Short-term interest rates would rise at least as much as

the policy rate, the prices of long-term debt instruments and equities could come under

considerable downward pressure, and the value of the dollar would probably rise sharply on

foreign exchange markets. If the Committee viewed inflation risks to be substantial, such a

market reaction might be desired as it would speed up the necessary adjustment of aggregate

demand. But if a more modest realignment of market prices were sought, the Committee could

attempt to shape market expectations through the wording of the announcement. In particular,

stressing that some of last fall's easing was no longer needed might limit the tendency of market

participants to extrapolate policy tightening into the future.

(11) If the Committee were chiefly concerned about the risk to inflation but saw the

case for tightening as not completely convincing, it may want to consider a directive tilted toward

restraint. In that regard, the disclosure policy reaffirmed in December reserved announcement of

a change in the tilt to those occasions when Committee viewed the new directive as reflecting a

major change in the Committee's thinking that was not recognized by the market. With respect

to market expectations, the yield curve now embodies greater odds on a tightening than an

easing, but does not build in any tightening action until next year. If the Committee perceived

the selection of an asymmetric directive at this meeting only as an incremental step in the policy

process and not so much at variance with market expectations as to seriously mislead the public,

it might want to delay announcement of the directive tilt until the release of the minutes in May.



- 11 -

In contrast, if the Committee saw a significant possibility that it might well need to raise interest

rates before too long, it might wish to alert markets to this fact. There is little precedent to gauge

how markets would react to such an announcement, but it is likely that financial prices would

embody much higher odds that the Committee would tighten policy within a few months. The

resulting increases in market interest rates would impart restraint to the inflation process more

promptly than policy tightening later absent such an announcement.

(12) Under any of these alternatives, the debt of the nonfinancial sectors will likely

continue to expand at a little more than a 5 percent rate in coming months, with rapid growth in

private indebtedness offset by the Treasury's paydown of debt resulting from ongoing federal

budget surpluses. Firms' reliance on borrowing should remain heavy, spurred by further

advances in capital spending and an erosion of internal funds. With purchases of consumer

durable goods expected to be strong, total household debt should continue to expand at a healthy

clip, although mortgage borrowing should cool some from its recent torrid pace. By September,

total nonfinancial debt is projected to have grown at about a 5-1/2 percent annual rate from its

fourth-quarter 1998 base, placing it in the upper half of its 3-to-7 percent annual range.

(13) To an important extent, commercial banks provided a significant offset to the

curtailment of credit from financial markets late last year by expanding their own balance sheets

to fund firms unwilling or unable to tap markets, albeit at wider spreads. The reversal of those

market strains this year has been mirrored in some shrinkage of bank balance sheets. But that

process is anticipated to have about played itself out, implying that bank credit should resume

expanding at a pace a bit above that of total debt. As a consequence, the growth of M3 is

projected to return to around a 7-1/2 percent rate over the next six months. Investors' varying



-12-

views of risk-taking have also left their imprint on M2. The slowing of M2 in recent weeks in

part is seen by the staff as evidence that households have become more willing to hold

instruments exposing them to capital risk that are outside of the monetary aggregates. After this

once-off realignment of portfolios is over, M2 is expected to expand a little faster than nominal

income. Growth of this aggregate is likely to be especially erratic around the coming tax date,

but is expected to average around 5-1/2 percent over the next six months. Under the unchanged

stance of monetary policy assumed in the Greenbook, the staff projects that the levels of both M2

and M3 in September will be about 1 percentage point, at an annual rate, above the upper ends of

the Committee's price-stability ranges.

Directive Language

(14) Presented below is draft wording for the operational paragraph that includes the

usual options for Committee consideration.

OPERATIONAL PARAGRAPH

To promote the Committee's long-run objectives of price stability and sustainable

economic growth, the Committee in the immediate future seeks conditions in reserve markets

consistent with maintaining/INCREASING/DECREASING the federal funds rate at/TO an

average of around ___ [DEL:4-3/4] percent. In view of the evidence currently available, the

Committee believes that prospective developments are equally likely to warrant an increase or a

decrease [MORE LIKELY TO WARRANT AN INCREASE/A DECREASE THAN A

DECREASE/AN INCREASE] in the federal funds rate operating objective during the

intermeeting period.

NOTE: Weekly data for columns 1 through 13 are week-ending averages. As of September 1997, data in column 6 are interpolated from data on certain commercial paper trades settled by the Depository Trust Company; prior
to that, they reflect an average of offering rates placed by several leading dealers. Column 14 is the Bond Buyer revenue index, which is a 1-day quote for Thursday. Column 15 is the average contract rate on new
commitments for fixed-rate mortgages (FRMs) with 80 percent loan-to-value ratios at major institutional lenders. Column 16 is the average initial contract rate on new commitments for 1-year, adjustable-rate mortgages
(ARMs) at major institutional lenders offering both FRMs and ARMs with the same number of discount points.
