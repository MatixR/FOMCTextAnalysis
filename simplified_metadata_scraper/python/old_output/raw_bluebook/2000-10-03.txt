Prefatory Note 

 
 

The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain. 
 

Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a redaction process that removed information obtained on a 
confidential basis.  All redacted passages are exempt from disclosure under applicable

1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked 
and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not

MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Recent Developments

(1) Financial conditions have registered mixed changes over the intermeeting

period.' Most short- and intermediate-term interest rates have declined as many as 30 basis

points, but most long-term yields have been about unchanged to 15 basis points higher,

major equity price indexes have shed 2-1/2 to 7 percent, and the dollar has appreciated

1-1/4 percent against a broad basket of foreign currencies (chart 1). Market participants'

expectations about the near-term course of interest rates have been revised down in light of

the Committee's statement following its August meeting, which was read as indicating that

the Federal Reserve was more confident that the growth rates of aggregate demand and

supply were coming into better alignment, and subsequent data releases, which tended to

support the view that the economic expansion had slowed. Judging from futures market

quotes, investors have lowered their expected path for the federal funds rate over the second

half of 2001 by about 1/4 percentage point and now place higher odds on the next policy

action being an easing rather than a tightening. The contrary movement of a number of

long-term yields seemed to owe in part to increased uncertainty associated with volatility in

oil prices and to heavy corporate bond issuance. Heightened skepticism about the political

will to preserve projected budget surpluses also pushed up bond yields, particularly in the

1 The effective federal funds rate averaged close to the 6-1/2 percent target over the
intermeeting period. The Desk redeemed $4.9 billion of securities, mostly Treasury bills, to avoid
exceeding its per-issue limits on holdings. It purchased $6.2 billion of Treasury coupon issues in the
market and $669 million of Treasury bills from foreign customers. The volume of outstanding long-
term RPs was unchanged at $9.9 billion.

Treasury market where some of the scarcity premiums at ten- and thirty-year maturities

appeared to unwind. Meanwhile, equity prices have been depressed by a larger-than-usual

number of warnings about corporate earnings and revenues.

(2) The foreign exchange value of the dollar has appreciated 1 1/2 percent on net

against a basket of major currencies over the intermeeting period; a gain of around 2 percent

against the euro was offset only partially by a 1/2 percent depreciation against the Japanese

yen. European interest rates changed little relative to U.S. interest rates, even though the

European Central Bank firmed policy 1/4 percentage point on August 31. Still, over most of

the period, the dollar steadily gained ground on the euro, reportedly supported by capital

flows favoring U.S. assets and conflicting statements from European officials regarding their

attitude toward a weak euro. The slide in the euro over the intermeeting period cumulated to

about 5 1/2 percent by September 20, but it was rolled back some on September 22 by

intervention in the exchange market that day, initiated by the ECB and joined by the U.S.

monetary authorities and the central banks ofJapan, the United Kingdom, and Canada.

. Purchases of euros against dollars aggregated to with

the U.S. share of that totaling $1.3 billion, split evenly between the Federal Reserve and the

Treasury. This action was the only U.S. intervention in foreign exchange markets over the

intermeeting period;

(3) The exchange value of the dollar also has posted widespread gains against the

currencies of other important trading partners, pulling the dollar's nominal value against a

basket of those currencies up about 1 percent over the intermeeting period. In general,

uncertainties associated with the effects of movements in oil prices on global economic

growth have appeared partly responsible for a weakening of emerging market asset prices.

Asian stock prices were also hurt by heightened investor concerns about progress in business

and financial restructuring. Yield spreads on emerging market debt have widened in recent

weeks, reversing a narrowing early in the intermeeting period.

(4) Growth of debt of the domestic nonfinancial sectors slowed to a 4-3/4 percent

pace on balance in July and August, about 1-1/2 percentage points less than in the second

quarter (chart 2). This slowing was more than accounted for by a downshift in private

borrowing, which was only partly offset by a less rapid paydown of federal government debt.

Nonetheless, both household and business borrowing appear to have remained brisk, in part

reflecting continued strong expenditures on consumer durables and business capital.

Improved conditions in long-term debt markets over most of the third quarter prompted

corporations to rely less on borrowing in short-term funding markets and households to

shift mortgage borrowing toward fixed-rate instruments. Lenders continued to become a bit

more selective about higher-risk borrowers. According to the August Survey of Terms of

Business Lending, spreads charged on large loans having above-average risk were snugged

some between May and August. In the bond market, credit risk spreads for junk bonds have

risen appreciably in recent months.

(5) M2 growth rebounded considerably in August and September from

surprisingly weak growth in June and July. This stronger expansion might in part reflect the

vigor of consumer spending of late. Growth on average for the third quarter held at a pace

well below that of the first half of the year. This slower growth is about in line with

projections from the staffs money demand model and in part reflects the lagged effects of

wider opportunity costs over the first half of 2000. M3 growth has continued to be brisk in

recent months, although it was a bit slower in the third quarter than over the first half of the

year.

Policy Alternatives

(6) In the staff forecast, the growth rate of aggregate demand is projected to

remain below that of potential GDP through 2002, but core inflation still is seen to be on a

slight upward trajectory. This relatively moderate pace of demand growth reflects the lagged

effects of previous monetary tightening actions, the influence of some additional firming

steps assumed for late 2001 and 2002, and a falling wealth-to-income ratio stemming from a

flat stock market. Restraint from these sources is only partly offset by a projected decline in

the foreign exchange value of the dollar. Although the unemployment rate edges up to

4-1/2 percent by the end of 2002, the path of resource utilization is foreseen to be inconsistent

with stable underlying inflation. Core PCE prices are projected to accelerate about 1/2

percentage point through 2002 from their pace over the past twelve months. The projected

path of oil prices is about $2 per barrel above that in the August forecast. The higher track

for energy prices boosts slightly the forecast for total PCE inflation in 2000 relative to the

August Greenbook, bringing the increase to 2-1/2 percent; the rate falls back to 2 percent later

in the projection as energy prices decline.

(7) While the Committee may find the pickup in core inflation in the staff forecast

to be worrisome, it may still favor keeping the stance of monetary policy unchanged at this

meeting, as under alternative B. The uptrend to core inflation in that outlook is gradual and

far from certain to come to pass. Based on incoming data, the Committee might now be

even more confident that aggregate demand growth has slowed significantly, likely to below

the growth of potential supply. Moreover, with the slippage in equity prices over the



7

intermeeting period, the prospects have improved that pressures on resources will not

intensify and could even begin to ebb. Higher energy prices would pose a threat to longer-

term price performance if they became embedded in inflation expectations or in wage

demands, as workers attempt to preserve purchasing power. However, oil prices have fallen

from their peaks, and, to date, longer-term inflation expectations have not shown a tendency

to move higher. Moreover, the risks stemming from oil market developments are not all in

one direction. In particular, higher oil prices could restrain aggregate demand beyond the

effects of transferring income to foreign oil producers if they induced an erosion of

consumer confidence or a substantial selloff in equities in light of the reduced economic

efficiency of the existing stock of capital. Market participants, taking into account oil prices

along with other incoming information since the last FOMC meeting, have marked down the

expected path of the federal funds rate for the next few years. In these circumstances, the

Committee may see little to be lost by waiting to obtain more information on trends in

output and inflation.

(8) Market prices incorporate the expectation that the target federal funds rate and

the balance-of-risks sentence will be left unchanged at this meeting. Consequently,

implementation of alternative B, along with the retention of the statement that the

Committee regarded the balance of risks as weighted toward increased inflationary pressures,

should have little effect on financial markets. The Committee might well see the revised

outlook for oil prices, coming at a time when it was already concerned about potential price

pressures from the unusually low unemployment rate, as reinforcing a judgment that the



8

balance of risks is weighted toward higher inflation. However, the Committee may now

believe that growth of aggregate demand is not likely to exceed that of potential output, that

current levels of resource utilization are sustainable, and that oil prices probably will not

leave a lasting imprint on inflation. If so, it could consider issuing a statement that indicated

balanced risks to achieving its goals for price stability and sustainable economic growth. In

this case, bond and equity markets would likely rally, as investors marked up the odds on an

easing trend in monetary policy over coming months, and the value of the dollar on foreign

exchange markets would probably edge lower.

(9) The FOMC instead might choose the 25 basis point increase in the federal

funds rate of alternative C. Core inflation has risen and may already be above rates that

Committee members find acceptable over the long run. Moreover, although underlying

trends in aggregate demand apparently have slowed, the current and projected levels of

resource utilization may imply, based on historical experience, a likelihood that core inflation

will continue to increase, as in the staff forecast. Furthermore, the Committee may see

upside risks to inflation even relative to that forecast. While the staff has trimmed the

amount of fiscal restraint in the outlook, recent news might be read as suggesting a distinct

possibility of even greater erosion in federal budget surpluses. In addition, if oil prices do

not fall as in the staff forecast and futures market quotes, short-term inflation expectations

may deteriorate further, which, absent monetary policy firming, would reduce the real federal

funds rate. In simulations of staff econometric models, such as that shown in the

international section of Part I of the Greenbook, holding the nominal funds rate along the



9

baseline path in the face of an upward shock to oil prices sets in motion a process of ever-

rising core inflation relative to the baseline outcome as lower real interest rates boost output

relative to potential.

(10) The market reaction to implementation of alternative C would likely be sharp.

With investors expecting no change in the stance of monetary policy at this meeting and

apparently anticipating that the next move will be toward easing, short-term interest rates

would probably jump by at least the 25 basis point increase in the federal funds rate.

Especially if the announcement indicated that the Committee continued to see the balance of

risks as weighted toward higher inflation, capital markets could sell off significantly, as

market participants adjusted prices to incorporate expectations of a higher path for short-

term interest rates. Any decline in inflation expectations would probably offset only part of

the effect on nominal bond yields of the higher real rates brought about by the tightening.

The value of the dollar on foreign exchange markets would firm against most currencies. An

announcement of balanced risks would likely be seen by market participants as a signal that

the Committee believed that this phase of policy tightening had been completed. In this

case, the response to a 25 basis point tightening at this meeting would be muted.

(11) Under the interest rate assumptions of the Greenbook, the average growth of

domestic nonfinancial sector debt over the next several quarters is forecast to be a bit below

the 5-1/2 percent rate of the first three quarters of 2000. In the household sector, the rate of

borrowing is projected to remain fairly brisk, although it ebbs gradually, in line with a

slowing pace of residential investment and moderating growth of expenditures on consumer



10

durables. With profit growth tailing off, business borrowing stays relatively rapid to finance

strong merger activity and robust capital spending. As debt-service burdens rise in the

household and business sectors, terms and conditions available to weaker borrowers are

likely to firm a bit further. Despite the projected relaxation of fiscal discipline, federal debt

remains on a downward trajectory over the projection period.

(12) M2 growth is projected to move lower in coming months, to an average of

around 5-3/4 percent through next March, from its unusually elevated rates of the past couple

of months. Nonetheless, the expansion of this aggregate runs at a higher rate than on

average over the third quarter, as the influence of past monetary tightenings begins to wane.

M3 growth from September to March is projected to drop back to about a 6-3/4 percent

annual. For 2000 as a whole, M2 and M3 are forecast to expand 6 and 9 percent,

respectively, compared with the 6-3/4 percent increase projected for nominal GDP.



Directive and Balance-of-Risks Language

(13) Presented below for the members' consideration is draft wording for (1) the

directive and (2) the balance-of-risks sentence to be included in the press release issued after

the meeting.

(1) Directive Wording

The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions

that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output. To further

its long-run objectives, the Committee in the immediate future seeks conditions in

reserve markets consistent with maintaining/INCREASING/DECREASING the

federal funds rate at/TO an average of around ___ [DEL: 6-1/2] percent.

(2) Balance-of-Risks Sentence

Against the background of its long-run goals of price stability and sustainable

economic growth and of the information currently available, the Committee believes

that the risks are [balanced with respect to prospects for both goals] [weighted mainly

toward conditions that may generate heightened inflation pressures] [weighted mainly

toward conditions that may generate economic weakness] in the foreseeable future.

NOTE: Weekly data for columns 1 through 13 are week-ending averages. Columns 2 through 4 are on a coupon equivalent basis. As of September 1997, data in column 6 are interpolated from data on certain commercial paper
trades settled by the Depository Trust Company; prior to that, they reflect an average of offering rates placed by several leading dealers. Column 14 is the Bond Buyer revenue index, which is a 1-day quote for Thursday.
Column 15 is the average contract rate on new commitments for fixed-rate mortgages (FRMs) with 80 percent loan-to-value ratios at major Institutional lenders. Column 16 is the average initial contract rate on new
commitments for 1-year, adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) at major institutional lenders offering both FRMs and ARMs with the same number of discount points.
