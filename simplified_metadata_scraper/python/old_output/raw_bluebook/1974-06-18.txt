of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was created 
through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned 
versions text-searchable.2   Though a stringent quality assurance process was 
employed, some imperfections may remain.

Recent developments

(1) M 1 increased at about a 5 per cent annual rate in May but

there was an acceleration in early June, so that growth for the May-June

period now appears likely to fall just under the 7 per cent upper end of

the Committee's range of tolerance. M2 has displayed a generally similar

pattern of monthly change, rising at a 5½ per cent annual rate in May and

then at a considerably stronger pace so far in June, when there has been a

larger than expected rise in large time deposits other than money market

CD's. For May and June combined, M2 appears likely to grow at a rate

roughly equal to the 7½ per cent top of its range of tolerance. And RPD

growth is near the upper end of its range.

(2) Growth in the bank credit proxy over May and June is

estimated at an average annual rate of 14 per cent, below the extra-

ordinary April pace but still strong. Banks greatly increased their

borrowings in the CD market in May in view of the continued generally

strong loan demands and in anticipation of large maturities in June. In

late May and early June, CD growth has slowed substantially, however.

Borrowing in the Euro-dollar and commercial paper markets was also

relatively strong until late May and then abated.

(3) Deposit growth at nonbank thrift institutions was at only

a 1½ per cent annual rate in May, and available data for early June

suggests that inflows have picked up only slightly. This conforms

generally to the experience of banks with respect to passbook savings

and small time deposits. Time and savings deposit accounts at banks

subject to Regulation Q ceilings have shown little, if any, growth in

recent months. Growth in bank time deposits has been in the form of

money market CD's and other time deposits over $100,000.

(4) Short- and long-term interest rates have fluctuated in

a relatively narrow range in recent weeks. At times during the inter-

meeting period, market sentiment appeared to be developing that

interest rates had reached peak levels and were about to decline.

Scattered declines in bank prime loan rates gave credence to this

view, and the stock market rallied. Market interest rates showed little

change, because the money market remained taut and the Account Management

sold a large block of bills timed so as to help dampen market

expectations of rate declines.



-3-

(5) With the potential for a resurgence in bullish sentiment

still present, however, Committee members concurred with Chairman Burns'

recommendation of June 10 that the upper limit of the funds rate range

be raised to 11¾ per cent, on the understanding that the Desk would use

this leeway if market interest rates came under downward pressure or

if the monetary aggregates began growing at rates that appeared to be

testing the upper limits of their tolerance ranges. In recent days,

given the latest estimates for the aggregates, the Desk has been aiming

at a Federal funds rate in the area of 11½-1l¾ per cent. The 3-month

bill rate was about 8.30 per cent at the close on Friday, up about 10

basis points from its level at the time of the last Committee meeting.

(6) The table on the next page shows (in percentage annual

rates of change) selected monetary and financial flows over various

recent time periods. Appendix table III compares money supply growth

rates computed on a quarterly-average basis with those computed on a

last-month-of-quarter basis. Projected figures on the two bases are

shown in appendix table IV for the three alternatives presented in

the next section.

(8) At its last meeting the Committee adopted longer-run

targets for the second and third quarters combined that included a

5½ per cent annual rate of growth in M1 from the March level. Extension

of such a growth rate to year-end is illustrated by the dashed line

in the chart on the following page. Rates of growth consistent with

that extended path are shown in alternative C. These include a 4¾

per cent annual rate of growth in M1 between June and year-end, which

would compensate for the estimated 7 per cent annual rate of growth

for Ml in the second quarter and would lead to an average 5½ per

cent growth for the last three quarters of the year.

(9) The staff expects that attainment of the alternative C

aggregates would require a further rise in the Federal funds rate between

now and the next Committee meeting to a consistent trading range around

12 per cent or a little above. Projected growth in nominal GNP for the

second half of the year is now slightly slower than at the time of the

last Committee meeting, but the growth rates for the third and fourth

quarters--annual rate of 8.8 and 10 per cent, respectively--still suggest

sizable increases in transactions demands for cash.

(10) A rise in the funds rate over the weeks ahead would be

associated with further increases in interest rates generally. The

increases could be quite marked as expectations that market interest

rates had peaked--already coming into question--turn into expectations

of further rise. If the funds rate rose to the 12 per cent area, the

3-month bill rate might well fluctuate in a 8½-9½ per cent range over

the weeks ahead, the 3-month commercial paper rate would rise above its

earlier 11 per cent peak, and the prime loan rate would again be under

substantial upward pressure. However, increases in short-term market

rates, particularly in the Treasury bill area, could be tempered if

foreign official demand for U.S. Treasury securities were to strengthen.

Rising short rates would probably be communicated to longer-term markets

also, given sizable corporate and municipal security offerings in prospect.

The increase in bond yields, at least on the highest quality issues, would

be moderated, however, to the extent that evidence of monetary restraint

tends to make investors somewhat less pessimistic about the outlook for

inflation.

(11) The rise in interest rates expected under alternative C

would further constrain inflows of consumer-type time and savings



-7-

deposits to banks and thrift institutions, given current Regulation Q

ceilings. As a result, growth in M 2 and M3 for the second half of

1974 would be reduced to about 5¼ and 4½ per cent, at annual rates,

respectively. Banks would be forced to raise interest rates offered for

CD's and Euro-dollars. However, we would expect considerable moderation

in the amount of net new funds raised through these instruments; bank

loan growth would probably be cut back by tighter lending terms, and

banks would probably become increasingly wary of adding to CD holdings at

ever higher interest costs. Marginal financial and business firms might

find it difficult to refinance maturing debts as banks and other lenders

become more selective. Financial strains would increase generally, and

the odds on failure of some of the more vulnerable firms would rise.

(12) Alternative B encompasses a 5¾ per cent growth rate for M1--

and growth rates of 6¾ and 5½ per cent for M2 and M3 respectively--in

the second half of 1974. These aggregate growth rates appear to be con-

sistent with a Federal funds rate around 11½-11¾ per cent, close to the

center of the range for this alternative. Thus, upward interest rate

pressure under this alternative would be considerably less than under

alternative C. At this writing, interest rates generally appear to be

in process of adjusting to Federal funds trading at rates somewhat above

11 per cent. This process may be completed by, or shortly after, the

forthcoming Committee meeting; and little further, if any, upward rate

movement is likely to develop subsequently if the funds rate remains

around the center of alternative B range.

(13) Assuming the prevailing money market conditions, M1

growth in the June-July period is likely to be in a 6-8 per cent annual

rate range. On the basis of partial data for the early part of June,



-8-

we would expect June growth to be on the order of 8 per cent at an annual

rate. Given the over-all interest rate increase of the past few months,

and the end of the tax refund period, growth in M1 is expected to slow

in July and subsequent months of the third quarter. For the third

quarter as a whole, M growth is indicated to be 5¼ per cent at prevailing

money market conditions--though rising to 6¼ per cent in the fourth quarter

when nominal GNP growth is projected to expand somewhat more rapidly.

(14) The substantial injection of nonborrowed reserves that

seems necessary to attain the aggregates of alternative A would probably

lead to an easing of money market conditions. A downward movement in the

funds rate--and especially a drop to the 10¾ per cent mid-point of the

range shown for this alternative--would be accompanied by a sharp decline

in market interest rates as investors came to believe that monetary policy

had made a major turn. The decline would be especially large in short-

term markets. In the Treasury bill market, the 3-month bill rate could

drop to below 7 per cent in view of the limited market supply at the

moment and the sizable volume of maturing mid-June tax bills. Given

the basic strength of credit demands, however, the immediate decline in

interest rates would probably be followed by a gradual upward readjustment

if the Federal funds rate were to hold around 10¾ per cent.



Proposed directive language

(15) Presented below are three alternative formulations

for the operational paragraph of the directive, which are intended

to correspond to the similarly lettered policy alternatives dis-

cussed in the preceding section. As will be noted, alternative A

refers to growth rates in the monetary aggregates prevailing over

recent months. Growth in M1 was at an annual rate of about 7 per

cent in the first quarter, and including an estimate of 8.2 per

cent for June, it is about 7 per cent for the second quarter as well.

The comparable rates for M2 are about 10 per cent for the first

quarter and about 8 per cent for the second quarter.

Alternative A

To implement this policy, while taking account of

developments in domestic and international financial markets,

the Committee seeks to [DEL: maintain about the prevailing restrictive]

ACHIEVE BANK RESERVE AND money market conditions [DEL: provided that]

CONSISTENT WITH GROWTH IN the monetary aggregates AT ABOUT THE

RATES PREVAILING OVER RECENT MONTHS [DEL: appear to be growing at

rates within the specified ranges of tolerance].



-10-

Alternative B

To implement this policy, while taking account of

developments in domestic and international financial markets,

the Committee seeks to [DEL: maintain about the prevailing restrictive]

ACHIEVE BANK RESERVE AND money market conditions [DEL: provided that

the] THAT WOULD MODERATE GROWTH IN monetary aggregates OVER THE

MONTHS AHEAD [DEL: appear to be growing at rates within the specified

ranges of tolerance].

Alternative C

To implement this policy, while taking account of

developments in domestic and international financial markets,

the Committee seeks to [DEL: maintain about the prevailing restrictive]

ACIIEVE BANK RESERVE AND money market conditions [DEL: provided that

the] THAT WOULD SLOW APPRECIABLY THE GROWTH IN monetary aggregates

OVER THE MONTHS AHEAD [DEL: appear to be growing at rates within the

specified ranges of tolerance].

(16) In the event that the Committee again wishes to couch

the operational paragraph of the directive in terms of money market

conditions, the specifications of alternative B might be associated

with the language used in the directive adopted at the last meeting--

namely, that "...the Committee seeks to maintain about the prevailing

restrictive money market conditions, provided that the monetary aggre-

gates appear to be growing at rates within the specified ranges of

tolerance."

Government security dealer trading positions are on a commitment basis. Trading positions, which exclude Treasury bills financed by repurchase
agreements maturing in 16 days or more, are indicators of dealer holdings available for sale over the near-term. Other security dealer posi-
tions are debt issues still in syndicate,excluding trading positions. The basic reserve deficit is excess reserves less borrowing at Federal
Reserve less net Federal funds purchases. Weekly data are daily averages for statement weeks, except for corporate and municipal issues in
syndicate which are Friday figures.

* STRICTLY OCNFIDENfIAL
** Monthly averages for rxcess reserves and borrowings are weighted averages of statement week figures.
