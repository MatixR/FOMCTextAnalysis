Prefatory Note 

 
 

The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain. 
 

Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a redaction process that removed information obtained on a 
confidential basis.  All redacted passages are exempt from disclosure under applicable 
provisions of the Freedom of Information Act.    

 

                                                 
1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked 
and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not 
reliably recognized by the OCR process and were not checked or corrected by staff.

MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Recent Developments

(1) Growth of the monetary aggregates has slowed sharply in the

last two months. Preliminary data indicate that over the January-March

period M2 and M3 increased at 1 and 2-1/4 percent annual rates, respectively,

well below their 6 to 7 percent short-run paths. As a result, both aggregates

in March are around the lower bounds of their annual growth ranges for 1987.

The velocities of the broader aggregates are estimated to have fallen only a

shade in the first quarter, based on the greenbook GNP forecast, following

decreases of about 4 percent in 1986. M1 expanded at only a 2-1/2 percent

annual rate over the latest two months. However, owing to the bulge at

year-end, M1 growth on a quarterly average basis came to 13-1/4 percent in

the first quarter, implying a further substantial drop in velocity--perhaps

7 percent at an annual rate compared with its 9-1/2 percent decline last

year.

(2) Slow growth in the aggregates over the last two months has

been broadly based. Some of the deceleration appears to be related to a

reversal of the bulge in deposits and bank lending associated with the surge

in transactions before year-end; also, some of the moderation in deposit

growth relative to last year likely reflects the completion of portfolio

adjustments to the decline in rates through last summer. However, reasons

for the extent of the recent weakness against a backdrop of moderate increases

in spending and income are not entirely clear. Weakness in demand deposits,

which have been essentially flat since mid-January, may be related in part

to a falloff in the pace of mortgage prepayments. Other checkable deposits

have been expanding at a sharply reduced pace as well since January, without

a compensating pickup in other retail deposits. With short-term rates some-

what above their levels of last fall and stock prices soaring while rates on

some retail deposits continue to edge down, savers may be finding alternative

investment outlets more attractive. Shifts into such instruments are sug-

gested by recent increases in noncompetitive tenders for Treasury bills, which

had been declining since last March, and some pickup in flows to bond and

stock mutual funds in January and February. In light of the less favorable

treatment of consumer interest expenses under tax reform, some households

also may be drawing down M2 assets to repay consumer credit or to substitute

for borrowing to finance large outlays, including contributions to IRAs

before the tax date.

(3) With bank credit growth weak in February and March following

the run-up over year-end, issuance by banks of CDs and other managed liabili-

ties in M3 also has moderated in recent months. Declines in overnight RPs

and Eurodollars contributed to the weakness in M2, but were offset in their

effects on M3 by increases in their term counterparts. At thrifts, CDs

continued to drop fairly rapidly, likely reflecting slow asset growth as

well as continued reliance on Federal Home Loan Bank advances.

(4) Debt expansion by domestic nonfinancial sectors has slowed

noticeably since January, bringing the growth of this aggregate from its

fourth-quarter base to a little above the upper end of its long-run range.

Business borrowing has fallen off as equity retirements have remained below

their year-end pace and sales of new equity picked up in lagged response to

rising share prices. Encouraged by relatively low long-term rates, busi-

ness borrowing has been concentrated in bond markets, and short-term credit



-4-

contracted in February and likely in March as well. Overall household

borrowing seems to have moderated somewhat in early 1987, but remains rela-

tively robust; strength in mortgages relative to consumer credit appears to

reflect underlying spending patterns as well as a substitution from consumer

credit to mortgage borrowing under home equity lines. The growth in Treasury

debt has been cut back substantially early this year, including a large

paydown of Treasury bills; the Treasury has met a substantial portion of its

needs by drawing on its sizable year-end cash balance.

(5) Total and nonborrowed reserves fell slightly over February

and March, as required reserves leveled off following the year-end bulge in

transactions deposits and excess reserves edged lower in line with their

usual seasonal pattern. In the three complete reserve maintenance periods

since the February FOMC meeting adjustment plus seasonal borrowing has aver-

aged $280 million, close to the $300 million level assumed in the reserve

paths. The federal funds rate associated with borrowing around this level

edged off from nearly 6-1/4 percent at the last Committee meeting to around

6 percent or a bit higher following clarification at the Humphrey-Hawkins

testimony that the System had not altered its basic stance toward reserve

provision.

(6) Other interest rates were little changed on balance since the

February FOMC meeting in exceptionally quiet trading. In addition to reduced

concerns about a monetary tightening, incoming data were seen as presenting a

mixed picture for the economy, although concerns about the dollar have tended

to limit the scope for any decline in rates. On balance, private short-term

rates are generally unchanged, while Treasury bill rates have declined about

15 to 20 basis points. This differential behavior may have reflected some



-5-

heightened concerns about credit quality related in part to Brazil's

suspension of debt servicing as well as the paydown of bills by the Treasury.

In contrast-to the quiet debt markets, equity prices rose 8 percent over the

period, bringing their gains since year-end to around 25 percent.

(7) The dollar traded in a narrow range through most of the inter-

meeting period, with its stability reinforced by the perception that at

their meeting in Paris on February 21-22 major industrial countries agreed

to support the prevailing structure of exchange rates. However, in recent

days the dollar has come under substantial selling pressure against the yen,

apparently triggered by renewed trade frictions between the United States and

Japan and by official statements that raised some questions about the U.S.

ccmmitment to the Paris agreement. As the dollar dropped below the 150 yen/

dollar level,

the United States by purchasing nearly $1-1/2 billion against

yen, of which roughly half was done for Federal Reserve account;

. Nonetheless, the

dollar has fallen about 4-1/4 percent against the yen since the last FOMC

meeting. Throughout the intermeeting period sterling has been strengthening

appreciably against the dollar and other currencies on brighter fiscal news

and improved electoral prospects for the Thatcher government.

Policy alternatives

(8) The table below gives three alternative specifications for

growth in the monetary aggregates from March to June, along with associated

federal funds rate ranges. (More detailed data, including growth rates im-

plied by each alternative from the fourth quarter to June, can be found in

the table and charts on the following pages.) Expansion in the monetary

aggregates under all three alternatives is expected to pick up from the

sluggish pace of February and March; even so, growth is projected to be

relatively moderate, and by June the broader aggregates would still be well

below the midpoints of their ranges under alternatives A and B and at or a

bit below the lower bounds under alternative C.

(9) Alternative B assumes maintenance of the current degree of

pressure on reserve positions, with reserve paths allowing for $300 million

of borrowing at the discount window. Federal funds would be expected to

trade around 6 percent or a touch above. The Treasury bill rate is expected

to remain around current levels or perhaps move lower in response to a

further reduction in supply; although the Treasury is likely to sell cash

management bills in coming days, they would mature shortly after the April

tax date, and net redemptions of bills at regular weekly auctions are expected

to continue for a time. Little net movement in long-term rates is antici-

pated under this alternative, consistent with staff expectations of moderate

economic expansion and limited inflationary pressures. The dollar might

remain under some downward pressure, but the decline in exchange rates

through the spring is expected to be moderate assuming continuing efforts

to stabilize rates under the Paris agreement. Sustained weakness in the

dollar could tend to push up interest rates in U.S. markets owing to con-

cerns about monetary policy responses and the strength of overall demand

for dollar assets.

(10) Under alternative B, growth in M2 would be expected to

strengthen to a 6 percent annual rate over the March-to-June period, lifting

this aggregate to the lower end of its long-run range. With market interest

rates little changed for some time now, and not anticipated to move far

from current levels under this alternative, M2 might grow about in line

with income over coming months. Shifts into non-M2 savings vehicles may

diminish, especially should stock prices show less strength, and any use of

M2 balances to pay down existing consumer loans in the wake of tax reform

might abate if those with a significant tax incentive have moved relatively

promptly. The deadline for 1986 IRA contributions is in mid-April, but

with the tax law changes it is difficult to predict the effects on M2

growth. On a quarterly average basis, M2 would rise at only a 4-1/2 percent

annual rate in the second quarter, given the pattern of growth over the

first quarter, and the staff's GNP forecast would imply a small rise in M2

velocity, the first increase in more than a year.

(11) M3 growth under alternative B also would be expected to

strengthen to a 6 percent rate over the March-to-June period. Inflows to

M2 deposits at banks are expected to be augmented by some pickup in the



-9-

issuance of managed liabilities included in M3; borrowing from foreign

branches should drop back from recently elevated levels, and overall needs

for funds are projected to increase reflecting in part a turnaround in

business loans now that much of the year-end bulge has been worked off.

The pace of CD runoffs at thrifts is expected to moderate as their asset

growth rebounds a bit from the recent depressed pace, though any intensi-

fication of concerns about the health of these institutions or their

insurance fund could work in the other direction. On a quarterly average

basis, M3 would grow at only a 4-3/4 percent rate, the slowest pace in more

than a decade and a half; M3 velocity, which has trended downward, would

post a small increase.

(12) Under alternative B, expansion of M1 is anticipated to

strengthen to a 9 percent annual rate over March to June. The acceleration

in M1 would reflect a resumption of growth in demand deposits, which are

anticipated to increase at a rate only a little below the projected growth

of spending. OCDs are expected to grow at around the reduced pace of

February and March; however, with opportunity costs widening only a little

further with the continued downward drift of offering rates, the pace of

growth would still considerably exceed that of income. On a quarterly

average basis, M1 would rise at a 7-1/2 percent rate in the second quarter,

the slowest rate since late 1984, and its velocity would decline at only a

2 percent annual rate. Over the first half of the year M1 would increase

at about a 10 percent annual rate.

(13) Debt of domestic nonfinancial sectors is expected to con-

tinue to run much below the pace of last year, though remaining well in

excess of the expansion of income. Debt is projected to increase at a 9

percent rate from March to June, moving the debt aggregate down to within



-10-

the upper portion of its 8 to 11 percent range. Borrowing by private

sectors should be around the reduced pace of the first three months of

the year and of roughly the same composition. With interest rates re-

maining around current levels and the yield curve relatively flat, business

borrowing is expected to remain concentrated in long-term markets. Gross

equity issuance might be close to its advanced March pace, while share

retirements, though substantial, likely will remain below the average rate

of 1986. Similarly, household borrowing is likely to continue to be con-

centrated in mortgage markets, reflecting strong single-family housing

activity and further substitution of home equity loans for consumer credit.

On a seasonally adjusted basis, federal borrowing will rebound from its

recent reduced pace, though in part this would serve to boost the Treasury's

cash balance over the quarter.

(14) Alternative A assumes a reduction in discount window borrow-

ing to a near-frictional $150 million or a 50 basis point decrease in the

discount rate with borrowing maintained at $300 million. In either case,

the federal funds rate would decline to close to 5-1/2 percent. This easing

in money market conditions would be expected to bolster the expansion of the

aggregates, increasing the odds that M2 and M3 will be in the long-term

ranges at midyear, even if economic growth turns out to be somewhat weaker

than the staff projects. Without such unanticipated economic weakness, M2

growth would be expected to strengthen to a 7 percent annual rate over the

March-to-June period, and M3 to 6-1/2 percent, lifting both noticeably above

the lower boundaries of their long-run ranges by June. Flows into retail

accounts would strengthen again, boosted by lagging offering rates on these

accounts, especially OCDs and passbook savings. M1 likely would accelerate

appreciably over the coming months.



-11-

(15) There appears to be little expectation of an easing action

in the period just ahead and thus the three-month bill rate also would

decline by about 1/2 of a percentage point, toward 5 percent. Other short-

term rates could fall a little more, tending to reverse the recent widening

in spreads, to the degree that lower interest rates were viewed as enhancing

the financial condition of troubled borrowers and intermediaries. Unless

this alternative were undertaken in the context of a generally weaker than

expected world economy accompanied by substantial monetary easing abroad,

downward pressure on the dollar likely would intensify, perhaps requiring

substantial additional official intervention if authorities attempted to

maintain exchange rates around recent levels. Absent indicators pointing

to a much weaker economy, the pressure on the dollar and perhaps more

concern about inflation might limit the extent of any decline in long-term

rates.

(16) Under alternative C, reserve paths would be drawn with a

borrowing level of $500 million, which would push the federal funds rate up

to the 6-1/2 percent area. The three-month bill rate would rise about 50

basis points under this alternative and CD rates possibly by more. The

increase in interest rates would tend to relieve downward pressure on the

dollar, at least for a while. Bond rates would rise, as there appears

to be little expectation in the markets of a tightening, although any such

increase would be limited by sentiment that such a move was acting to

contain inflationary pressures, in part through its effect on the dollar.

(17) A rise in interest rates would limit the extent of the pick-

up in M2--as opportunity costs of holding M2 balances widened. Given the

weakness of this aggregate in the first quarter, which may have reflected

shifts in portfolio preferences, alternative C would tend to bring M2



-12-

farther below the lower end of its long-run range over the second quarter.

Slower expansion of assets at banks and thrifts would act to restrain M3

growth to along the lower end of its long-run range. Growth in its M1

component would be expected to remain subdued but still be above that of

income.



-13-

Directive language

(18) Draft language for the operational paragraph, with the

usual alternatives for indicating the degree of reserve pressure, is shown

below. The draft provides for the specification of numerical growth rates

for M2 and M3 but, as in earlier directives, not for M1. Should the Commit-

tee wish to place particular emphasis on exchange market conditions in the

implementation of policy over coming weeks, language along the lines shown

in the first bracket might be used (with corresponding deletions to the present

language on foreign exchange market developments also shown in brackets).

An alternative would be to move up the reference to exchange market develop-

ments in the existing sentence on possible intermeeting adjustments. With

regard to such adjustments, the draft provides for numerous options with

appropriate usage of "would," "might," "somewhat," and "slightly."

OPERATIONAL PARAGRAPH

In the implementation of policy for the immediate future, the

Committee seeks to DECREASE SOMEWHAT (Alt. A)/maintain (Alt. B)/

INCREASE SOMEWHAT (Alt. C) the existing degree of pressure on

reserve positions. This action is expected to be consistent with

growth in M2 and M3 over the period from MARCH [DEL: January] through

[DEL: March] JUNE at annual rates of ____ AND ____ [DEL: about 6 to 7] percent,

RESPECTIVELY. Growth in M1 is expected to REMAIN [DEL: slow] substantially

BELOW ITS PACE IN 1986 [DEL: from the high rate of earlier months.] [IN

LIGHT OF THE RECENT INSTABILITY OF THE DOLLAR IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE

MARKETS, PARTICULAR EMPHASIS WILL BE PLACED ON CONDITIONS IN THESE

MARKETS IN OPERATIONAL DECISIONS. IN ADDITION, ] somewhat (SLIGHTLY)

greater reserve restraint would (MIGHT), or slightly (SOMEWHAT) lesser



-14-

reserve restraint might (WOULD), be acceptable depending on the

behavior of the aggregates, taking into account the strength of the

business expansion, [developments in foreign exchange markets,]

progress against inflation, and conditions in domestic and inter-

national credit markets. The Chairman may call for Committee

consultation if it appears to the Manager for Domestic Operations

that reserve conditions during the period before the next meeting

are likely to be associated with a federal funds rate persistently

outside a range of ____ TO ____ [DEL: 4-to-8] percent.
