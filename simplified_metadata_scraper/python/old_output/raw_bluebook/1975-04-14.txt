The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version available 
based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the Board 
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was created 
through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned 
versions text-searchable.2   Though a stringent quality assurance process was 
employed, some imperfections may remain. 
 
Please note that some material may have been redacted from this document if that

format.  All scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced 
tilting) and lightly cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other 
blemishes caused after initial printing).

MONEY MARKET CONDITIONS

Recent developments

(1) M1 expanded at an annual rate of about 14 per cent in March,

and current data suggest about a 6 per cent growth rate for April. For the

two-month target period, M1 thus appears to be growing at a 10 per cent

annual rate, well above the Committee's range of tolerance, as the table

shows. Growth of M2 over the March-April period appears to be running at

an annual rate of around 10½ per cent, slightly above the upper limit

of its range of tolerance. Larger-than-seasonal Federal tax refunds have

probably contributed to the particularly rapid growth in demand and time

deposits other than large CD's. During late February and the first three

weeks of March, refund payments totalled about $10.5 billion, or 55 per

cent more than in the same period last year.

1/ A majority of the Committee members concurred in the Chairman's
recommendation of March 27 that 5 per cent be treated as the
approximate upper limit for the average funds rate for the time being.



(2) Growth of the bank credit proxy resumed in March, following

the slight February contraction. The proxy appears to be rising more

rapidly in April, and may show an annual growth rate of around 8 per cent

for the two months combined. With business demand for bank loans

remaining weak, banks have used the recent increases in their overall

deposit flows largely to acquire Government securities and to help finance

expanded positions of security dealers.

(3) Following the March 18 FOMC meeting, the Account Manager

initially sought reserve conditions consistent with a Federal funds rate

remaining around 5 per cent. Data available shortly after the last

meeting, however, indicated stepped up growth in the aggregates to rates

at or above the Committee's ranges. In these circumstances, the Desk

would normally have tolerated a firming up in the funds rate to the 5¾

per cent upper limit of the Committee's range. But in view of the weak-

ness in the economy and the sensitive condition of financial markets,

the FOMC concurred with the Chairman's recommendation (of March 27) that

the Manager be instructed to treat 5½ per cent as the approximate upper

limit for the weekly average funds for the time being. In the first

two statement weeks of the intermeeting period the funds rate had

averaged close to 5 per cent. In the week just ended, when a sharp

drop in the Treasury balance added to the reserve supply, the average

funds rate declined to 5.28 per cent.

(4) Short-term interest rates generally have moved higher

since the March meeting. The rate on 3-month Treasury bills has advanced

15 basis points to around 5.55 per cent, and that on 12-month bills is



up 75 basis points, to 6.40 per cent. Private short-term rates have

advanced 10-25 basis points. With these latter rates rising, most large

banks have elected to hold their prime lending rate at 7½ per cent.

Factors that appear to have contributed to the rise in short-rates include

the large amount of new cash being raised by the Treasury in the short-term

area, belief that enactment of the tax bill will insure a near term pick-up

in economic activity, and the emerging expectation that monetary policy

will not be easing much, if any, further.

(5) Bond yields have also increased over the intermeeting

period, carrying some series up by as much as 40 basis points. With

corporate offerings projected to remain large for some months ahead and

the Treasury expected to raise $5-7 billion of new cash on average per

month over the next year or so, investors who expect upward rate pressure

later in 1975 and on into 1976 were reluctant to commit funds to long-term

markets. In these unfavorable circumstances scheduled new corporate debt

offerings of more than $1 billion were either cancelled or postponed.

Near the end of the intermeeting period, the combination of higher bond

yields and cutbacks in scheduled bond offerings helped to stabilize

conditions in bond markets.

(6) Deposits at nonbank thrift institutions expanded at a

very rapid pace in March, reflecting not only the attractiveness of yields

on depositary claims but also inflows of tax refunds. While these

institutions have continued to use improved flows to pay down debt and

rebuild liquidity, current supplies of mortgage funds reportedly are

adequate. Nevertheless, with other long-term yields rising, the thrifts

have not been aggressive mortgage lenders and mortgage rates have

stopped declining.

(7) The table on the following page shows (in percentage

annual rates of change) selected monetary and financing flows over

various time periods. Appendix table III compares money supply growth

rates computed on a quarterly-average basis with those computed on a

last-month-of-quarter basis.

Prospective developments

(8) The presentation of alternative policy specifications

has been revised somewhat in order more clearly to encompass as

longer-run objectives a broad spectrum of monetary aggregates and to

include a time span of a year as well as shorter periods. Alternative--

and, as best can be estimated, mutually consistent--ranges for longer-run

rates of growth in the various monetary aggregates for the 12-month

period from March 1975 to March 1976 are shown below for Committee con-

sideration. (Consistent growth rates from the first quarter of 1975 to

the first quarter of 1976 are shown in appendix table V). Growth rates

for interim periods (shown for convenience as point estimates rather than

ranges) under the three alternatives are included in the detailed table

on the next page.

rate of growth for M 1 over the period from December 1974 to September

1975. Growth in the second and third quarters of 1975 would be at

a more rapid 6¾ per cent annual rate to make up for the first quarter

shortfall. M 2 for this alternative shows about the same rate of growth

as at the last meeting, but M3 is somewhat more rapid, reflecting the

greatly enlarged public preference for deposits at thrift institutions

which appears to have emerged.

(10) Possible alternative short-run operating ranges of

tolerance for the Federal funds rate and for Ml, M2, and RPD

are shown in the table below for Committee consideration.

(11) Various different short-run specifications could be

consistent with a given longer-run target. Any particular 12 month

growth rate for a monetary aggregate could be achieved with different

patterns of growth in the aggregate during the period, and with con-

sequent different timing and magnitude of any necessary interest rate

adjustments. The short-run specifications deemed "consistent" with the



12-month growth rate will depend in part on the particular time pattern

contemplated in attaining the 12-month objective. In developing the

short-run specifications shown for the several alternatives in the pre-

ceding paragraph, it was assumed that the Committee would desire to have

the aggregates grow at a faster rate over the first half of the period--

that is, from March to September--than over the ensuing 6 months, for

the following reasons: (1) large tax rebates and one-time social security

payments are expected to have a strong impact on demand and time deposits

in late spring and early summer; (2) previous declines in short-term

interest rates are still having an expansionary impact on money demand;

and (3) the sharp rebound projected for the economy in the third quarter

would spur transactions demand for cash. All of the alternatives assume

that as economic recovery develops, the Federal funds rate would need

to rise above the mid-point of the short-run ranges shown to bring growth

in the aggregates into line with longer-run targets. In the case of

alternatives B and C, the short-run specifications indicate a rise in

the Federal funds rate over the next few weeks. The staff expects that

such a rise would moderate the extent to which interest rates might have

to rise later in order to restrain money demand.

(12) Alternative A contemplates a Federal funds rate remaining

in the 5¼-5½ per cent range most recently prevailing. M1 would be

expected to increase over the two month April-May period in a 7-9 per

cent annual rate range. Growth is expected to be especially large in

May when the largest part of the tax rebates are paid out. This

alternative contemplates about a 7¾ per cent annual rate of growth in

M1, and 11 per cent in M 2, over the second and third quarters.



(13) With little or no change in the Federal funds rate over

the next few weeks, upward pressures on market interest rates, if any,

are likely to occur mainly in the Treasury market. The Treasury will

continue to add sizable amounts to its weekly and monthly bill auctions,

A $1.5 billion 2-year note will be auctioned on Tuesday. And in the

mid-May refunding of $3.8 billion of maturing publicly held debt--to

be announced on Thursday, May 1--the Treasury will also probably raise

about $2-2½ billion of new cash in the coupon area. Recent postponements

in the corporate bond market have relieved pressure in that area to some

extent, but any interest rate decline will be limited over the near-term

since the calendar remains heavy and recently postponed issues would likely

be rescheduled as the market shows signs of improvement.

(14) A rise in the Federal funds rate to around the 6 per

cent level--as shown for alternative B short-run specifications in

paragraph (10)--would probably lead to a sharp market reaction. The

3-month bill rate could move up into the 6¼-6¾ per cent area. Treasury

coupon issues, particularly short-term coupons, might rise another 50

basis points, or possibly more in the short-run as markets over-anticipate

the extent of monetary tightening in process. Such a rise would lead to

yields in the 7¾-8 per cent area on 2-year Treasury notes--a yield level

which, if sustained, would begin to attract funds that might otherwise

go into banks and thrift instituions. We have assumed some moderation

in such flows under this alternative, but they are expected to remain

relatively large over the next few months. The availability of mortgage

market funds may not, therefore, be significantly limited in this period.



-10-

(15) The rise of interest rates under alternative B would work

to hold growth in M1 over the second and third quarters to around a 6¾ per

cent annual rate, as noted earlier. With some diminution in the expansion

of interest-bearing deposits, growth in broader measures of money would

be moderated, relative to alternative A. Bank credit expansion would be

reduced somewhat, but with business and consumer loan demands expected

to be weak at least over the next month or two, banks would still be in

a position to participate heavily in Treasury financings.

(16) The roughly 1 percentage point rise in the Federal funds

rate over the next few weeks contemplated under alternative C would

probably cause other short-term rates to rise by even larger amounts, at

least temporarily, mainly because of expectational effects on markets in

a period of heavy Treasury financings and with near-term prospects of

economic recovery. Longer-term rate increases could be substantial, if

borrowers tended to accelerate offerings under the circumstances in

anticipation of even higher rates later. On the other hand, pressures

on bond markets could be moderated if corporate borrowers begin to

utilize bank lines so as to avoid being locked into relatively high

interest costs. Lower growth rates in all of the monetary aggregates

would be expected. Banks and thrift institutions may begin to experience

a significantly slower inflow of consumer-type time and savings deposits,

and the bank prime loan rate and mortgage market rates would probably

show significant increases.

Proposed directive

(17) Presented below are three alternative formulations

for the operational paragraph of the directive, which are intended to

correspond to the similarly lettered policy alternatives discussed in the

preceding section. In all three alternatives, it is proposed to include

a reference to Treasury financing because the regular mid-May financing

will be announced later this month.

Alternative A

To implement this policy, while taking account of THE

FORTHCOMING TREASURY FINANCING AND OF developments in domestic

and international financial markets, the Committee seeks to

achieve bank reserve and money market conditions consistent

with more rapid growth in monetary aggregates over the months

ahead than has occurred ON AVERAGE in recent months.

Alternative B

To implement this policy, while taking account of THE

FORTHCOMING TREASURY FINANCING AND OF developments in domestic

and international financial markets, the Committee seeks to

achieve bank reserve and money market conditions consistent

with SOMEWHAT more rapid growth in monetary aggregates over the

months ahead than has occurred ON AVERAGE in recent months.



-12-

Alternative C

To implement this policy, while taking account of THE

FORTHCOMING TREASURY FINANCING AND OF developments in domestic

and international financial markets, the Committee seeks to

achieve bank reserve and money market conditions consistent

with [DEL: more rapid] MODERATE growth in monetary aggregates over the

months ahead [DEL: than has occurred in recent months].
