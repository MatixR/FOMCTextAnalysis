MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Recent Developments

(1) Pressures on reserve positions were eased slightly in mid-

July in response to indications that conditions in credit markets had

tightened further. With money growth lagging and activity showing no

signs of picking up, such a tightening was viewed as potentially exerting

undue restraint on an already sluggish economy. In an effort to offset

the effects of this influence, the borrowing assumption was reduced by $50

million to $400 million and the federal funds rate dropped by 1/4 percent-

age point to near 8 percent, where it generally has remained over the

balance of the intermeeting period.1

(2) Largely in reaction to the System's easing of reserve condi-

tions, short-term interest rates dropped about 30 basis points between the

July FOMC meeting and the end of that month. The decline in rates also

seemed to reflect some expectation of an additional easing in response to

data portraying a weaker trajectory for the economy. Bond yields were

unchanged on balance through the end of July. But the Iraqi invasion of

Kuwait at the beginning of August and the prospect of higher energy prices

propelled long-term rates upward in volatile trading. The rise in rates

1. More recently, to take account of the continued upswing in seasonal
borrowing, the objective for adjustment plus seasonal borrowing was
increased to $500 million in two $50 million steps; actual seasonal
credit has risen to about $425 million. In the three maintenance peri-
ods completed since the July meeting, adjustment plus seasonal borrowing
averaged close to the levels built into the reserve paths. In the first
eight days of the current maintenance period, however, borrowing has
averaged $630 million, elevated by disruptions to reserve flows stemming
from an extended power outage in New York, which also seemed to have put
some upward pressure on the federal funds rate in recent days.



was spurred by concerns about inflation, in light of the experience of the

1970s oil shocks, as well as by a heightened sense of uncertainty about

the financial and economic outlook and pessimism about prospects for a

budget accord. Bond yields are up as much as 1/2 percentage point since

the end of July and broad measures of stock prices, some of which had

reached record highs earlier in the intermeeting period, are down about

8 percent over the same period. Short-term market interest rates, which

dipped briefly when the events in the Middle East prompted an apparent

increased preference for liquidity, have backed up recently, partly on

disappointing inflation readings taken before the jump in oil prices. On

balance since the July meeting, most money market rates are down 15 to 25

basis points. Although Treasury securities benefited from a flight to

quality for a time in early August, there has been little net change in

spreads between money market rates, or between rates in longer-term

markets.

(3) The easing of short-term interest rates in the United States

and some signs of tightening abroad, along with expectations that these

divergent trends would continue, appeared to contribute to the decline in

the dollar on foreign exchange markets since the last Committee meeting.

Short-term interest rates rose about 1/4 percentage points in both Japan

and in Germany over the period. Long-term rates in those countries in-

creased 80 and 25 basis points, respectively, and their stock markets

posted substantial losses after the runup in oil prices. The dollar's

depreciation, which was interrupted for a time after the invasion of

Kuwait, totalled about 5-1/4 percent on a weighted average basis over the



intermeeting period. The price of gold surged above $400 per ounce in

recent weeks, likely reflecting both safe-haven motives and inflation

worries.

The U.S.

Treasury accounted for about $400 million

against marks.

These purchases along with some made earlier enabled the Treasury to un-

wind on July 31 a $2 billion warehousing operation with the System, leav-

ing $7 billion outstanding on that facility.

(4) Money growth remained sluggish in July. M2 increased at a

1-1/4 percent rate last month and M3 hardly rose at all, below the 3 and

1 percent rates, respectively, that the Committee had expected for the

June-to-September period. Both aggregates remained in the lower portions

of their annual ranges. M1 and M2 growth in July was held down--by

about 3-1/2 and 1 percentage points, respectively--by the introduction of

a reserve-avoidance practice at one bank holding company. Even

abstracting from this effect, however, M2 growth in July remained low

relative to econometric model forecasts. One possible contributor to this

weakness was the flurry of RTC activity at the end of June, working its

way through deposit flows and asset stocks. Data for early August suggest

2. Revisions to data on RPs and IRA/Keogh deposits at thrift
institutions going back as far as mid-1989 have boosted the levels of M2
and M3 in July by $7-3/4 and $12 billion, respectively. The revisions
will not have a significant effect on June-to-September growth rates,
but they did add about 1/4 percentage point to growth rates of both M2
and M3 from the fourth quarter of 1989 through July.
3. The subsidiary banks of a large regional bank holding company began,

in effect, sweeping OCDs into large time deposits each night, thereby
reducing transaction deposits and required reserves.



that growth in the aggregates is rebounding. Apart from the cessation of

the shift in OCDs to large time, the strengthening of M2 in August could

be reflecting the narrowing of opportunity costs on money assets, as

short-term market interest rates have dropped markedly from their peaks in

the spring. In addition, the sharp fall in prices in capital markets

reportedly prompted large transfers from bond and stock funds into money

market mutual fund shares.

(5) The growth of private sector credit in July remained at the

more moderate pace established this year. Borrowing by nonfinancial busi-

nesses evidently slackened last month: Gross bond issuance dropped back

from June's high level, outstanding commercial paper declined, and C&I

loans edged down. Responses to the Federal Reserve's latest survey of

senior loan officers provide additional evidence that banks have become

increasingly selective in recent months in granting credit to businesses

and have tightened both price and nonprice terms further. The tightening

of terms seems to have spread to larger firms; banks have become espe-

cially selective on commercial real estate loans. Only a few banks, how-

ever, reported any tightening of standards for single-family home mort-

gages, and banks on balance signalled another small increase in their

willingness to make consumer loans. Nevertheless, household borrowing

appears to have been quite soft. Consumer installment credit barely edged

up in June, and consumer loans at banks remained weak in July, even ab-

stracting from the securitizations that removed large blocks of credit

card receivables from bank balance sheets. Similarly, what little current

information is available suggests that mortgage credit growth has remained



-5-

noticeably below last year's pace. By contrast to the other nonfinancial

sectors, federal debt growth has stayed rapid, boosted by the funding

needs of the thrift bailout. As a result, the debt aggregate apparently

has remained around the midpoint of its 5 to 9 percent annual range.

Policy Alternatives

(6) The three usual options for monetary policy over the coming

intermeeting period are discussed below beginning on page 9. The choice

among those options is complicated by the potential adverse effects on

U.S. economic performance of the recent surge in oil prices and by uncer-

tainties about their future course. An increase in the price of imported

oil transfers real income and wealth to foreign suppliers, reducing domes-

tic demand, and thereby tending to depress real output. The shift in

demand cannot be offset by policy actions without additional adverse price

consequences; higher energy prices constitute a supply shock that presents

less favorable attainable combinations of economic activity and inflation

in the short run. Price pressures arise not only directly from the rising

prices of final energy products, but also indirectly as higher costs for

energy inputs are passed through to prices of other goods and services.

Price effects will be amplified if heightened inflationary expectations or

pressures to recoup real wage losses add an upward thrust to nominal labor

costs. Finally, for as long as energy supplies are reduced, labor produc-

tivity and the economy's potential output associated with a fully employed

labor force will be lowered, with the amount of the reduction dependent on

the adaptability of the capital stock to less energy-intensive production

methods.

(7) In the face of the less favorable set of inflation and out-

put choices, and of uncertainty about how the economic responses would

evolve--especially should the higher oil prices persist--one approach

might be to try to limit the odds of either a cumulating shortfall of



-8-

output or a sustained acceleration in inflation. This objective would be

fostered by maintaining growth of nominal spending along the path pre-

viously thought consistent with policy objectives. This strategy has

self-correcting characteristics over time. For example, a large increase

in prices would necessarily involve an offsetting sizeable shortfall in

output, and the resulting slack in the economy would over time counter any

tendency for inflation to accelerate; the deceleration of inflation in

turn implies a strengthening in the rate of change of output, ultimately

limiting its shortfall, as nominal income growth is maintained. As it

happens, simulations of the staff's large-scale macro model suggest that

nominal GNP can be maintained along its baseline path by following essen-

tially the same monetary policy as in the absence of the oil price shock.

To a first approximation, the same path for short-term interest rates in

the face of a $10 per barrel increase in the price of oil would lower real

output 1 percent after a year and raise the GNP deflator 1 percent (though

the increase in the CPI would be appreciably greater). With the same

pattern of nominal GNP and opportunity costs, the public's demand for M2

also would be unaltered.

(8) Should the Committee wish to place more weight on countering

risks of recession, seeking to ensure continued moderate economic growth,

it could run an easier policy than otherwise. Such a policy would accept

not only a once-and-for-all increase in the price level associated with

higher oil prices but also the risk of some ratcheting up of inflation

expectations and inflation itself for an extended period. On the other

hand, if the Committee saw greater risks of a substantial pickup in



inflation or attached more importance to avoiding significant deviations

from a path toward price stability, a tighter policy than otherwise would

be appropriate. Under this policy, economic slack would be greater,

especially in the near term, but this would establish a downtrend in the

inflation rate sooner. These alternatives would be most relevant should

oil prices be expected to persist at their current high levels, or to go

higher. A sense that oil price increases might reverse fairly soon would

argue for tempering any such policy response to the oil shock.

(9) The three short-run monetary policy alternatives presented

below embody unchanged, decreased, and increased pressures in the reserve

market. Under alternative B, federal funds would continue to trade around

8 percent in association with an initial specification for adjustment plus

seasonal borrowing at the discount window of $500 million. Under alterna-

tive A, the drop in the federal funds rate to 7-1/2 percent would accom-

pany a reduction in borrowed reserves to roughly $450 million, while the

8-1/2 percent federal funds rate under alternative C would correspond to

about $550 million in borrowing. With adjustment borrowing likely to

remain subdued, as generally has been the case this year, and with sea-

sonal borrowing anticipated to begin its normal annual downtrend later in

the intermeeting period, technical reductions in the borrowing specifica-

tion may be needed to keep the federal funds rate around its intended

trading area under each of the alternatives.

(10) Projected growth rates for the monetary aggregates associ-

ated with the alternatives are indicated in the table below. (The table

and charts on the following pages show more detailed data.)

(11) Market participants no longer seem to be expecting a near-

term easing in policy, and short-term rates would be unlikely to move

substantially on balance with federal funds remaining near 8 percent under

alternative B. Absent a significant change in oil prices, long-term

interest rates may stay around recent elevated levels. Scope for a rally

in bond markets seems to exist should a budget accord involving signif-

icant deficit reduction be reached after all, counter to current investor

skepticism. The exchange value of the dollar would be unlikely to retrace

much, if any, of its decline since the last Committee meeting.

(12) M2 growth is expected to pick up in August and September to

a 5-1/4 percent average rate, bringing its expansion from June to a 4 per-

cent rate, 1 percentage point faster than the pace specified by the Com-

mittee at its last meeting. In addition to the special factors producing

more rapid growth of OCDs and money market funds in August relative to

July, the acceleration in M2 owes to the narrowing of opportunity costs

over recent months. Even so, weak credit growth at depository institu-

tions is likely to continue to foster lower offering rates on small time

deposits and restrain growth of core deposits. Later in the quarter, the

RTC is expected to undertake a spate of resolutions, and the renewal of

transfers of deposits to banks should result in additional abrogations of

brokered deposit contracts and more downward pressure on offering rates.

Quarterly average growth of M2 would be held to only 2-1/2 percent, and M2

velocity this quarter would increase at a 3 percent rate, the same as in

the second quarter; the increases in velocity in both quarters are about

2-1/2 percentage points larger than projected by M2 demand models.4

(13) Under alternative B, M3 over August and September is pro-

jected to expand at a 3-1/2 percent average rate, implying growth of 2-1/2

percent from June to September. The pickup in M3 does not reflect a pro-

jected acceleration in credit at depository institutions. Rather, it re-

flects some strength in elements of this aggregate that are not direct

funding sources to such institutions--money market mutual funds and term-

Eurodollar deposits.5 Bank lending is projected to stay subdued as banks

continue to exercise extra caution in extending credit, while thrift

balance sheets will shrink further, especially as RTC activities pick up

over the balance of the quarter. Even so, the debt of nonfederal sectors

4. The somewhat stronger incoming data for M2, including revisions
to past months, have led the staff to revise its projection for M2
growth consistent with the greenbook forecast to 4 percent for 1990,
from 3-1/2 percent in the last bluebook. Nominal GNP growth for 1990 is
now expected to be lower than in the previous greenbook, but its effects
on M2 demand are about offset by the slight reduction in short-term
nominal interest rates and opportunity costs.
5. Data revisions, along with faster money fund inflows, have led to

an upward revision to projected M3 growth for 1990--from 1-1/2 to 2
percent.



-13-

is projected to continue to grow at a 6 percent rate over the third

quarter, about in line with nominal income. Federal debt growth, on the

other hand, is expected to balloon to a 14 percent annual rate over the

three months, as RTC working capital needs boost federal marketable

borrowing to a record $68 billion level (n.s.a.). Total domestic non-

financial debt growth as a consequence is projected at 7-3/4 percent over

the three months, keeping this aggregate around the midpoint of its annual

range.

(14) The easing of reserve market conditions under alternative A

would engender a like-sized decline in short-term interest rates. The

response of long-term interest rates to an easing is unclear. If incoming

information suggests sluggish economic growth or tighter credit condi-

tions, inflation concerns may not be heightened further by the policy

easing, and bond yields would fall. However, especially in the context of

the oil price shock, if the easing were interpreted as signalling greater

concern by the FOMC with maintaining output growth than with containing

inflation, the decline in the dollar could be particularly sharp, and bond

yields could rise. M2, and to a lesser extent M3, would be a bit stronger

under alternative A than with an unchanged funds rate; the staff projects

growth rates from June to September of 4-1/2 percent for M2 and 2-3/4

percent for M3.

(15) Under alternative C, a considerable backup in short-term

rates would appear likely, as a monetary policy tightening would fly in

the face of market expectations. Long-term rates might rise only a

little, as the increase in real interest rates would be at least partly



-14-

offset by a lessening in inflation expectations. The moderation in

inflation expectations would accompany a further downward adjustment of

market participants' outlook for real economic activity--as the effects of

higher real rates were reinforced by an even more cautious attitude of

lenders--and evidence that the Federal Reserve was leaning against the

price effects of the oil shock. The dollar could find renewed strength on

foreign exchange markets as interest differentials moved in favor of

dollar investments. M2 and M3 growth over the third quarter would be

restrained to 3-1/2 and 2-1/4 percent, respectively.
