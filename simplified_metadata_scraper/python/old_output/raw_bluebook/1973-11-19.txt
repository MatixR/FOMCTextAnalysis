The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version available 
based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the Board 
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was created 
through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned 
versions text-searchable.2   Though a stringent quality assurance process was 
employed, some imperfections may remain.

Recent developments

(1) After two months of net decline, the narrowly defined

money stock grew at about a 4-1/2 per cent annual rate in October, and

there appears to have been a further acceleration in early November.

For October and November combined, M1 appears to be growing at an annual

rate of slightly above 6 per cent, which, as the table shows, is in excess

of the range of tolerance adopted at the last Committee meeting. M2 is

also exceeding its October-November range of tolerance by a sizable

amount, as time and savings deposits other than large CD's have been

increasing more rapidly than expected. However, until the most recent

statement week, large CD's outstanding, continued to decline; as a result,

the adjusted credit proxy is likely to show no net growth for the

October-November period. The related cut-back in bank need for reserves

has contributed to a contraction in RPD's, which are running far below

the Committee's target range.

(2) The marked further attrition in large CD's reflected both

the high marginal reserve costs of CD's relative to other sources of bank

funds and the shift of business borrowing from banks to the commercial

paper market. The interest cost of commercial paper had declined sub-

stantially relative to the prime rate after the last Committee meeting,

but most recently commercial paper rates have begun to rise. Reduced

market rates in October help to explain the faster than anticipated growth

in other time and savings deposits at banks, as well as the improved

flow of savings funds into savings and loan associations. As usual, it

is difficult to isolate factors that account for short-run variations in

the demand for M1. However, the large liquidation of dollar holdings

by foreign central banks may have been a special factor accounting for

temporary increases in the cash balances of those receiving dollars, and

financial market uncertainties related to the energy crisis may also

have led to some temporary rise in demand for M1.

(3) Early in the inter-meeting period short-term interest

rates recorded further general declines, as market participants con-

tinued to anticipate additional System action to correct the sluggish

late summer performance of the monetary aggregates. Later on, however,

as the monetary aggregates showed some strength and the Federal funds

rate remained generally stable, market judgments about the likely course

of interest rates changed, and Treasury bill rates began to rise toward

levels consistent with the prevailing funds rate. Initially, the

adjustment process was relatively gradual, but reactions in foreign

exchange markets to the Mid-East oil supply situation entailed large-scale



shifts in funds and triggered sizable foreign central bank liquidation of

U.S. Government securities, including special issues. To protect its cash

position against further liquidation of special issues at a time when

overdrafts on the System were no longer available, the Treasury announced

an unanticipated bill strip offering, even before its mid-November refunding

had been settled. Responding to these unexpected developments, rates in

short-term markets rose sharply--particularly in the Treasury bill area,

where the yield on the 3-month issue moved to about 8-5/8 per cent by

November 13.

(4) In view of the sudden unsettlement of the Government

securities market at a time when the Treasury refunding was still in

process of distribution, the Desk moved cautiously in its reserve

absorption operations. With market factors tending to supply reserves,

the average Federal funds rate actually edged a little lower for a time.

More recently, however, with new issues in the refunding fairly well

distributed and general pressures in the credit market tending to sub-

side, the Desk has been able to permit the funds market to tighten, and

the Federal funds rate has moved up to 10 per cent or slightly above.

At the same time, the 3-month bill rate has fluctuated sharply, dropping

abruptly to 7.53 per cent on Thursday and closing at around 7.60 per cent

on Friday.

(5) Since the recent behavior of the 3-month issue has reflected

technical market conditions, the basic state of the bill market may be

better measured by the 6-month rate, most recently quoted at around 8.20

per cent, or 90 basis points above its level at the time of the last



Committee meeting. In long-term markets, municipal and Treasury bond

yields, have risen 20-25 basis points over the period, but yields on

new high-grade corporate issues have shown little net change and mortgage

market rates have declined.

(6) The table on the next page shows (in percentage annual

rates of change) selected monetary and financial flows over various

recent time periods. Appendix Table III compares money supply growth

rates computed on a quarterly-average basis with those computed on a

last-month-of-quarter basis.

about $3--$3-1/2 billion to the level of M1 in September, and smaller

amounts in earlier months, due mainly to larger than estimated growth in

nonmember bank deposits. The rate of growth for the year ending

September in the revised figures will be around 6-1/2--7 per cent, as

compared with 5.3 per cent for the unrevised, currently published

figures. All of the tables are, of course, based on the unrevised

figures since the new data will not be available on a firm enough basis

to guide operations between now and the next meeting.

(9) Under alternative B, M1 is indicated to expand in November-

December at a 4-1/2-6-1/2 per cent annual rate, given a Federal funds

rate range centered around 10 per cent. RPD growth in this period is

expected to be negative, however, because reserves required to be held

against bank CD's are expected to drop further despite a projected pick-up

in CD issuance later this year.

(10) The demand for M1 (as well as for short-term interest

earning assets) in the near-term is likely to be sustained by financial

and economic uncertainties generated by the energy crisis. In addition

to these precautionary demands for cash, expansion in nominal GNP is

projected to be sizable in the fourth quarter and is likely to require

expanding transactions demands for money. However, the impacts of the

energy crisis on transactions demands for cash are by no means clear.

If the crisis lowers the rate of growth in nominal GNP, transactions

demands would likely be dampened somewhat for any given Federal funds

rate. On the other hand, if nominal GNP expands about as projected

(even though real GNP growth may be adversely affected), these demands

for money may not be significantly altered. These income and output

effects are most likely to be felt after the turn of the year, however.



-8-

(11) While any significant income effects of an energy shortage

are likely to come later rather than sooner, market interest rates could

be influenced by anticipations of a slowing in income growth and a

reduction over the short-run in credit demands. Thus, between now and the

next meeting of the Committee, short-term rates could drop back toward the

late October lows or even further for expectational reasons, and the

spread between the funds rate and short-term rates could again widen.

The recent decline in Treasury bill rates may already have discounted a

considerable amount of potential weakness in credit demand, but as indicated

earlier, bill rates, and particularly the 3-month bill, have been extremely

volatile in recent days.

(12) Apart from expectational effects related to the energy

crisis, upward pressure on short-term rates might be anticipated over the

next few weeks as business credit demands at banks and in the open market

combined continue fairly strong and as the Treasury comes to market to

borrow new cash in early December, presumably through tax bills. Our

estimates suggest a cash need of about $4 billion.

(13) Under alternative A the Federal funds rate is likely to

decline toward 8-3/4 per cent by the next Committee meeting as reserves

are provided to support a movement toward the higher longer-run growth

path for the aggregates indicated under that alternative. And under

alternative C the funds rate is likely to rise toward 11-1/2 per cent

in the process of moving toward its lower aggregate growth path. Under

current circumstances, the market is sensitive to small changes in the

funds rate, and would be even more sensitive to sustained increases or



-9-

decreases. Thus, an appreciable decline in market rates is likely under

alternative A and a large rise under alternative C.

(14) Under alternative C, disintermediation would clearly

once again become a pressing problem, particularly around the year-end

reinvestment period. Under alternative B, however, net inflows of consumer-

type time deposits to banks and to thrift institutions may be at a moderate

pace over the next few months. Growth of such deposits at banks is likely

to slow from the relatively rapid pace of recent months, when banks

were able to offer a varied and attractive menu of ceiling-free certificates.

Banks and thrift institutions could, however, have an unfavorable experience

around the year-end reinvestment period even under alternative B if credit

demands are strong enough to generate rising short-term market interest

rates around that time.

(15) With regard to bank credit, we have assumed that the

recent rise in the commercial paper rate will lead to a renewal of

business loan growth at banks at a moderate pace in the last few weeks

of the year and thus to some renewed demand for CD funds. In addition,

we have assumed a modest net addition to banks' bill holdings, largely

as a result of participation in the forthcoming Treasury financing.

But we expect most of the bills to be acquired by nonbank investors,

after initial tax and loan underwriting by banks. In part reflecting

these developments, the bank credit proxy is expected to rise modestly in

December, following a period of virtual stagnation in October and November

taken together.



-10-

(16) In long-term markets, a relatively large volume of new

corporate and state and local government bond issues are expected to be

offered between now and the mid-December holiday lull. As a result, bond

yields may come under some upward pressure under alternative B, upward

rate pressure would be considerably greater under alternative C. The

energy crisis could augment upward rate pressures by increasing inflationary

expectations and/or by stimulating anticipations of additional real

capital investment.



-11-

Proposed directive

(17) Presented below are three alternative formulations for

the operational paragraph of the directive, which are intended to

correspond to the similarly lettered policy alternatives discussed in

the preceding section. In all three alternatives, it is proposed to

delete the reference to Treasury financing because the quarterly refund-

ing announced on October 24 has been completed. Alternatives A and C

refer to growth in the monetary aggregates that "has occurred over the

past 6 months"; the annual rates of growth from April through October

for M1, M2, and the bank credit proxy are, respectively, 4.8, 7.9, and

9.6 per cent.

Alternative A

To implement this policy, while taking account of [DEL: the

forthcoming Treasury financing and of] international and domestic

financial market developments, the Committee seeks to achieve

bank reserve and money market conditions consistent with [DEL: moderate]

FASTER growth in monetary aggregates over the months ahead THAN

HAS OCCURRED OVER THE PAST 6 MONTHS.

Alternative B

To implement this policy, while taking account of [DEL: the

forthcoming Treasury financing and of] international and domestic

financial market developments, the Committee seeks to achieve

bank reserve and money market conditions consistent with moderate

growth in monetary aggregates over the months ahead.



-12-

Alternative C

To implement this policy, while taking account of [DEL: the

forthcoming Treasury financing and of] international and domestic

financial market developments, the Committee seeks to achieve

bank reserve and money market conditions consistent with

[DEL: moderate] SLOWER growth in monetary aggregates over the months

ahead THAN HAS OCCURRED OVER THE PAST 6 MONTHS.

Notes: Government Security dealer trading positions are on a commitment basis. Trading positions, which exclude Treasury bills financed by repurchase agreements

maturing in 16 days Or more, are indicators of dealer holdings available for sale over the near-term. Other security dealer positions are debt issues

still in syndicate, excluding trading positions. The basic reserve deficit is excess reserves less borrowing at Federal Reserve less net Federal funds
purchases Weekly data are daily averages for statement weeks, except for corporate and municipal issues in syndicate which are Friday figures.

* STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL ** Beginning with January 1973, monthly averages for excess reserves and borrowings are weighted averages of statement
week figures
