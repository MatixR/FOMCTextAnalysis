Prefatory Note 

 
 

The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain. 
 

Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a redaction process that removed information obtained on a

1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked 
and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not

Recent Developments

(1) M1-B, adjusted for shifting into NOW accounts, contracted

at about a 7¾ percent annual rate on average in May and June.1/ This

aggregate fell well short of the April-to-June growth path set by the

Committee at its May meeting (of 3 percent or lower) and also of the

original target for the March-to-June period set in March at 5 percent

or somewhat less. The weakness in transactions balances extended to

NOW accounts, which declined slightly on balance over the last two months.

With sustained moderate expansion of its nontransactions component, M2

grew at a 4¾ percent rate on average in May and June and at a 7¾ percent

annual rate from March to June, also below paths set for this aggregate.

Brisk expansion of large CDs, especially at commercial banks, maintained

M3 growth at about a 9¾ percent average annual rate in May and June.

needs by selling commercial paper as the prime rate lagged the downward

movement in market yields. In June, credit expansion at large weekly

reporting banks evidently was rapid, but partial data for smaller banks

suggest that total bank credit may have increased at only half the May

pace.

(3) Total reserves contracted in June, following a substantial

rise in May, and over the past three months increased at only about a 3½

percent annual rate. Nonborrowed reserves showed only a slight increase

last month, after declining considerably in the previous two months.

Over the second quarter nonborrowed reserves declined by about a 7¼ per-

cent annual rate. For the first half of the year nonborrowed and total

reserves showed little net change, while the monetary base expanded at a

relatively low 5 percent annual rate.

(4) Given the Committee's decision that, in light of the April

surge in the monetary aggregates, some shortfall from its 3 percent April-

June growth target for M1-B would be acceptable, the initial operating



path for nonborrowed reserves was lowered in the first part of the inter-

meeting period as this aggregate weakened.1/ Borrowing consequently

remained around $2 billion or above, and federal funds generally traded

in an 18½ to 19 percent range. By mid-June, M1-B had weakened consider-

ably, and in a telephone consultation, the Committee indicated that,

consistent with the directive, the emerging weakness should be allowed

to show through in reduced borrowing at the discount window. M1-B sub-

sequently exhibited greater weakness, but borrowing demand at first

remained surprisingly strong and it was not until the last few days of

June that borrowing fell noticeably. The federal funds rate nonetheless

averaged about 18¾ percent in the most recent statement week.

(5) Despite the firmness of the federal funds rate, most other

short-term market interest rates have declined ¾ to 1¾ percentage points,

on net, since the May FOMC meeting. Indications of weakness in the money

stock and of reduced inflationary pressures encouraged market partici-

pants in the view that rates might have reached a cyclical peak, but this

bullish attitude has more recently been held with less conviction. The

Treasury paid down, net, about $3¼ billion of regular weekly and monthly

bills and $4 billion of cash management bills over the intermeeting

period, but foreign official institutions sold around $4¼ billion of

Treasury bills over this span largely to finance exchange market

intervention activity.

(6) Yields on most long-term securities trended downward

through much of the intermeeting period, but have firmed noticeably in

recent days. Corporate bond yields are still about 3/4 point lower than

at the time of the last Committee meeting, but yields on longer-term

Treasury coupon issues are up slightly. Interest rates in the primary

mortgage market have remained close to their peaks; S&Ls remain cautious

lenders, given their weak deposit flows, negative operating margins, and

concerns about liquidity.

(7) The dollar has appreciated almost 4 percent, on a trade-

weighted basis, since the May FOMC meeting. The dollar reached its

highest level since mid-1976 in the first week of June, moving higher

against all major foreign currencies despite a decline of U.S. interest

rates relative to foreign rates (which generally rose). The sources of

the dollar's strength in the first part of the intermeeting period

included political developments in Europe and, in the case of the pound,

the softness of international oil prices. The dollar fluctuated after

early June, as dollar interest rates first fell further and then rebounded

while foreign rates changed little.

rates of change, in percent, for selected monetary and financial flows

The Money and Credit Targets for 1981

(9) Under the Humphrey-Hawkins Act, the Federal Reserve must

report to the Congress by July 20 its updated objectives for money and

credit growth in 1981 and its preliminary views about the appropriate

objectives for calendar year 1982. This section of the Bluebook focuses

on the aggregates for 1981, while the next section discusses longer-run

strategy. The table below summarizes the growth of the monetary aggregates

and bank credit over the first half of this year. As may be seen from the

middle column of the table, the M1 measures at midyear stand below the

lower boundaries of their ranges, while M2 is at, and M3 above, the upper

limits of their respective ranges.

Money and Credit Growth in the First Half of 1981
(Seasonally adjusted annual rates, percent)

1981
80-IV to 81-11 80-IV to June Target

M1-A (shift
adjusted) 1.5 -0.1 3 to 5

M1-B (shift
adjusted) 2.2 0.6 3½ to 6

M2 9.7 9.0 6 to 9

M3 11.6 11.5 6½ to 9½

Bank Credit 8.7 8.5 6 to 9

(10) It was anticipated when the Committee set its target for

1981 in February that the broader monetary aggregates might tend to grow

at rates around the upper ends of their ranges if narrow money grew at

its midpoint rate. Thus the divergence in the first half between growth

of M1-B and of M2 is somewhat larger than the staff projected would be

the case for the year. This divergence mainly reflects lower than



-7-

expected growth in M1. Given the stronger increase in GNP for the first

half than was projected last February, the slower M1 growth was accompanied

by an unusually rapid two-quarter rise in its velocity--on the order of

10 percent at an annual rate. There appears to have been a pronounced

downward shift in the public's demand for transactions balances in the

early part of the year, perhaps associated with the stimulus to more intense

cash management provided by extraordinarily high interest rates and the

introduction of NOW accounts nationwide. The standard formulation of

money demand behavior in the Board's quarterly econometric model suggests

that, given actual GNP and interest rates, the velocity of M1-B should

have grown around 5 percentage points (annual rate) slower in the first

half. The 2 percent, annual rate, increase in the velocity of M2 in

the first half was also somewhat faster than anticipated for the year.

(11) The behavior of the aggregates relative to target in the

first half of this year raises the question of possible adjustments of

the current ranges for 1981. The table below presents what we believe

to be internally consistent alternative sets of growth rates for monetary

aggregates and bank credit over the year ending in the fourth quarter

of this year. In alternative 1, M1-B is assumed to grow at the 4¾ per-

cent midpoint rate of the Committee's present long-run target range; in

alternative 2, M1-B is assumed to grow by 3 percent, equal to the lower

bound of the existing 1981 range. As may be seen, attainment of 4¾ per-

cent M1-B growth is projected to involve M2 and M3 growth above the

upper ends of the present target ranges for those aggregates, while

3 percent growth of M-B is thought consistent with lower growth rates

of the broader monetary aggregates (just within the present range for M2

and just above for M3).

(12) Alternative 1 is the basis for the staff's Greenbook fore-

cast, which shows nominal GNP growing at a 9 percent annual rate over the

next two quarters. The staff also has assumed that there will not be a

further downward shift in the demand for M1-B over the remainder of the

year. Given those assumptions, market interest rates appear likely to be

a bit higher on average in the next six months than they were in the

quarter just ended.1/ Under the more restrictive monetary assumption of

alternative 2, short-term interest rates would be under more upward

pressure, and nominal GNP growth would be reduced somewhat in the second

half. There also would be substantially greater risk of financial dis-

locations. The economic and financial outlook under either alternative 1

or alternative 2 is, it should be stressed, quite sensitive to the

assumption about M1-B demand. Should something like the downward shift

of money demand over the first half be continued, alternative 1--or

perhaps even alternative 2--could be associated with declining short-term

1/ Interest rates thought consistent with alternatives 1 and 2 may be
found in Appendix III.



rates and noticeably stronger growth of nominal GNP and the broader

monetary aggregates.1 /

(13) The July Humphrey-Hawkins report will provide an occasion

also for updating the projection of actual (i.e., not shift-adjusted)

M1-A and M1-B growth for 1981. Given the behavior of other checkable

deposits since April, a question can be raised about whether the shift to

to new NOW accounts may be near completion. The staff believes that at

this time the over-all evidence does not justify a conclusion that the

shift is over, but is consistent with a considerably slower movement into

NOW accounts in the second half of the year than in the first. Thus far

2/
this year OCDs have increased by nearly $40 billion,2/ and we have assumed

a further increase of $10 billion over the remainder of the year. Recent

evidence on the proportions of new OCDs coming from various sources suggests

that the percentage coming from demand deposits should be assumed to remain

in the 70 to 75 percent area; in February it had been assumed that the

proportion would fall to two-thirds. These assumptions would mean that

actual M1-B would grow by 3 percentage points more than shift-adjusted M1-B.

1/ The staff's monetary aggregate projections for future months assume
that growth of small time and savings deposits will be bolstered by
the DIDC's June 25 decisions to remove the cap for ceiling rates on
small time deposits maturing in 2½ to 4 years and to remove ceilings
entirely on such deposits maturing in 4 years or more, all effective
August 1. It has been assumed that there will be a small net positive
effect on M2. But the response of the public and the institutions to
these decisions--not to mention legal issues that may be raised--
represents an element of considerable uncertainty in the outlook, and
will remain so for a few months. It also should be noted that the
staff has not built the proposed tax-exempt savings certificate (under
the "All Savers Act" bill) into its projection. This instrument would
further enhance M2 growth.

2/ Excluding the estimated trend increase of OCDs existing in December
1980.



-10-

The present range for actual M1-B of 6 to 8 percent assumes a 2 per-

centage point impact. A point higher actual range would technically

be justified if our assumptions about the second half of this year are

correct.1/

1/ A larger adjustment would be entailed for actual M1-A. The present

actual range is -4½ to -2 percent. On current assumptions about

OCD growth and proportions coming out of demand deposits, this range

might be lowered by 2 percentage points.



-11-

Preliminary Target Ranges for 1982

(14) As background for preliminary assessment of the ranges

for money and credit growth in 1982, the table on the next page presents

economic projections for a few different sequences of monetary growth.

Estimates of the differential impact of the various monetary strategies

rely heavily, though not entirely, on the Board's quarterly econometric

model. All the projections require certain caveats--in particular, they

largely reflect the average behavioral relationships of the past and do

not allow for marked short-run "supply-side" effects of the prospective

fiscal initiatives, for radical changes in inflationary expectations

based on alterations of monetary policy, or for the impact on markets or

psychology from extraordinary financial dislocations. Moreover, all of

the projections implicitly assume a significant degree of continuing

"downward drift" in the public's demand for M1-B, as currently defined--

roughly 2 to 3 percentage points per year, measured with the standard

quarterly model.

(15) The first longer-run strategy for money growth shown

in the table is the basis for the Greenbook forecast through 1982. It

assumes achievement of the midpoint of this year's M1-B range (shift

adjusted), and assumes further point reductions in 1982 and 1983.

Strategy 2 assumes that M1-B growth this year is held to the low end

of the current range (which still involves an acceleration of growth

over the second half of this year to a 4¾ percent annual rate), and

that growth in the next two years is the same as in strategy 1 (but of

course involving lower levels of money throughout the period). Strategy

3 is the most restrictive, and assumes growth in M1-B at the lower end

of the current range for 1981 and further decelerations of ½ point per year

from that. All these strategies entail substantial declines in the rate

of inflation, but at a cost within the projection period of a considerable

rise in the unemployment rate. Progress toward price stability could come

more rapidly if such restrictive monetary strategies themselves led to

a substantial reduction in inflationary expectations, but it is an open

question whether expectations can be reduced more quickly without even

greater weakness in output, at least for a time, than has been projected.

(16) Alternative sets of 1982 monetary growth ranges are shown

in the table below for Committee consideration. Alternative I calls for

a 1982 range for M1-B that is point lower than the current 1981 range, and

alternative II calls for a range that is 1 point lower.1/ The growth rates

presented for M1-B can be considered as shift-adjusted, or, if the shift

to NOW accounts is close to completion by the end of this year, as repre-

senting ranges for growth in actual M1-B. Alternatives I and II retain

2 point ranges for M1-B growth. A third alternative is presented with

a 3-point range for M1-B growth should the Committee wish to widen the

range to take account of uncertainties in the behavior of this variable

related to, among other things, the significant changes in its composition.

The range shown under alternative III--2½ to 5½ percent--reduces the upper

limit of the present 1981 range by point and the lower limit by 1 point.

A 3-point range of 3 to 6 percent for M1-B would have the disadvantages

of an upper limit that does not show a reduction from 1981 and of involving

alternatives presented.

Bank Credit 7 to 10 6½ to 9½ 6½ to 9½ 6 to 9

(17) Proposed ranges for 1982 for the broader aggregates are

centered on the staff's point estimates of growth rates consistent with

attainment of the midpoints of the associated M1-B ranges. Thus, these

ranges are equal to, or higher, than ranges for 1981. However, if the

Committee wished to continue indicating that growth in the broader aggre-

gates would be in the upper part of their ranges, it could retain the

present ranges for M2 and M3, or possibly lower them by ½ point; for M2,

however, such a lowering seems more feasible under tighter alternatives II

and III.

Short-run Targets for the Monetary Aggregates

(17) The table below provides three alternative short-run

targets for the monetary aggregates. These have been formulated in

terms of growth rates from June to September. Possible intermeeting

ranges for the federal funds rate also are provided. More detailed data

on these and other aggregates may be found on pages 16 and 17, and charts

indicating the relationship of the alternative targets to the Committee's

existing ranges for 1981 may be found on the next two pages.

M1-B 10½ 8½ 6½

M2 9½ 8½ 8

Federal funds range 14 to 20 16 to 22 18 to 24

(18) Alternative A was designed to return M1-B to the lower

end of its longer-run range by September. This requires a 10 percent

annual rate of growth, which would, if continued, result in a fourth-

quarter average level in line with the midpoint of the 1981 range. Assuming

a fairly smooth month-by-month trajectory, the quarterly average growth of

M1-B under alternative A would be 4 percent at an annual rate, as compared

to a projected third-quarter growth of nominal GNP of about 7½ percent.

M2 would be expected to accelerate from the relatively slow growth rates

of the past two months, reflecting not only the faster growth of M1-B but

also some strengthening of the nontransactions component. To achieve the

specified monetary growth, total reserves might have to expand at a 13

percent annual rate from June to August.

(19) Whether so rapid a growth in total reserves would entail

a drop in interest rates from current levels of course depends on the

demand for money. If money demand were to be quite weak relative to GNP,

as has been the case for much of this year, substantial downward pressures

on interest rates would probably develop. They also would if economic

activity were to become even weaker than in the second quarter. If,

however, as the staff currently projects, real GNP does not decline, and

the demand for money behaves in a relatively "normal" fashion, a con-

siderable rebound in M1-B growth could occur with little, if any, downward

pressure on interest rates. Under those conditions the federal funds rate

over the next few weeks might center around the 17 to 18 percent area, and

borrowing at the discount window be in a $1¼ to $1¾ billion range.

(20) With the funds rate in the 17 to 18 percent area, other

market rates would probably tend to decline from recent levels. However,

if the relatively rapid monthly money growth specified in this alternative

actually developed, the extent of any decline in other rates might be

limited by the expectational consequences of the rapid money growth. More-

over, interest rates will be influenced by relatively sizable credit

demands in the months ahead. The Treasury is expected to sell about

$15 billion, net, of marketable debt in the third quarter, and borrowing

will be much larger in the fourth. Business credit demands are expected

to expand, as internally generated funds do not keep pace with capital

outlays.

(21) Under alternative B, M1-B would grow at a rate that would

leave it below the lower end of the FOMC's 1981 range until November.

If this growth rate were continued through year-end, it would result

in growth for the year just marginally above the low end of the 3 to



-19-

6 percent range for M1-B. The resulting combination of lower GNP and

higher interest rates would tend to hold M2 growth down. Growth of total

reserves of about 10½ percent, at an annual rate, from June to August,

would be consistent with the alternative B monetary target. Given the

present discount window structure, borrowing likely would run $2 billion

or a bit more.

(22) The federal funds rate probably would be around the 19 to

20 percent area during the intermeeting period under alternative B. Other

interest rates would probably rise from recent levels, perhaps substantially

as the market is disappointed in its expectations that the funds rate would

decline gradually as the summer progresses. The 3-month Treasury bill yield

might approach, and possibly exceed, 16 percent. Business demands on

commercial banks could surge for a time, partly in response to higher

bond market yields, possibly requiring heavy CD issuance and/or Eurodollar

borrowing.

(23) Alternative C calls for more constraint on reserve growth

over the next three months than alternative B--with total reserves growing

at an 8 percent annual rate--should the Committee wish, for example,

to take an approach that provided greater assurance that broader aggregates

would come within current longer-run ranges. This alternative involves

M1-B growth at a 6½ percent annual rate over the next three months, which

would leave this aggregate still well below its present longer-run range

by September. Sizable upward pressure on interest rates over the period

ahead is likely to be generated under this approach, with the funds rate

moving above 20 percent and borrowing at the discount window probably

moving over $2½ billion. The dollar likely would rise rather substantially

on foreign exchange markets, possibly reaching levels that would generate



-20-

considerable intervention by foreign countries and related sales of

U.S. Government securities. The financial market pressures associated

with this alternative might not be long sustained, though, as high financing

costs and added strains on key financial intermediaries lead to a marked

near-term weakening in aggregate demand.

(24) Even under alternatives A or B, the earnings problems

of thrift institutions would remain intense, although they obviously would

be greatest with the higher interest rates implied by alternative C.

The liberalization of deposit rate ceilings tentatively set by the DIDC

to take effect in August should bolster thrift deposit flows; the degree

is impossible to anticipate with any precision at this point, especially

because there will be unconstrained bank-thrift competition in the 4-year-

and-over time deposit category. But earnings pressures on the thrifts

would be at best relieved only a little, and concerns that liquidity diffi-

culties may emerge as a result of such pressures will encourage the

thrifts to maintain cautious mortgage lending postures.



-21-

Directive Language

(24) Given below is a suggested operational paragraph for the

directive consistent with the form of the directives adopted at recent

meetings. The specifications adopted at the meeting on May 18 are

shown in strike-through form.

In the short run the Committee seeks behavior of reserve

aggregates consistent with [DEL: a substantial deceleration of] growth

in M-1B from [DEL: April to] June to SEPTEMBER AT an annual rate of [DEL: 3] ____

percent [DEL: or lower,] after allowance for the impact of flows into NOW

accounts, and with growth in M-2 at an annual rate of about [DEL: 6] ____

percent. [DEL: The shortfall in growth of M-1B from the two month

rate specified above would be acceptable, in light of the rapid

growth in April and the objective adopted by the Committee on

March 31 for growth from March to June at an annual rate of 5½

percent or somewhat less.] It is recognized that shifts into NOW

accounts will continue to distort measured growth in M-1B to an

unpredictable extent, and operational reserve paths will be

developed in the light of evaluation of those distortions. The

Chairman may call for Committee consultation if it appears to the

Manager for Domestic Operations that pursuit of the monetary

objectives and related reserve paths during the period before

the next meeting is likely to be associated with a federal funds

rate persistently outside a range of [DEL: 16 to 22] ____ TO ____

percent.



APPENDIX I

Measures of the money stock have been benchmarked to incorporate the

June, September and December 1980 call reports and certain deposits data

collected as a result of the Monetary Control Act of 1980. In addition,

the inclusion of travelers checks of nonbank issuers has raised the levels

of M1-A and the broader aggregates but has had minimal effects on their

growth rates.

Daily deposits data reported since November 1980 for foreign-related

institutions--U. S. branches and agencies of foreign banks and Edge Act

Corporations--and for other checkable deposits (OCD) at thrift institutions

with total deposits greater than $15 million as of December 1979 have been

incorporated. New deposits data of institutions with total deposits between

$2 and $15 million--that began reporting such data for one week each quarter

in January 1981 but staggered in such a way that one-third of all such insti-

tutions reports each month--also have been incorporated. Daily deposits data

of nonmember commercial banks with deposits greater than $15 million had been

incorporated at the time of the last benchmark in January 1981.

As shown in Table 1, the largest revisions to growth in M-1A and M1-B

were for early 1981. M1-A growth was lowered in January and February of

this year and raised in April, mainly reflecting new reports of quarterly

reporting banks. Growth in M1-B also was lowered in January and February,

as an upward revision in OCD at quarterly reporting institutions did not

offset the downward revision to demand deposits at these institutions and

NOW accounts at S&Ls; expansion in M1-B was raised in April, reflecting

strengthened demand deposits and OCD at quarterly reporting banks and OCD

at thrifts. The pattern of revisions to growth rates for shift-adjusted



-2-

M1-B is similar to that of M1-B. Growth in shift-adjusted M1-B in the

first quarter of 1981 was lowered by nearly 2 percentage points, to minus

3/4 percent at an annual rate. Benchmark revisions to M2 growth in 1981

have been relatively small. Growth in M3, shown in Table 3, was raised in

late 1980 and the first five months of 1981, primarily reflecting new daily

deposits data on large time deposits at foreign-related institutions.

downward adjustment to accommodate weakness in Ml-B growth.

3/ Total and nonborrowed reserves paths adjusted downward by $67 million reflecting
a $24 million downward adjustment to accommodate weakness in Ml-B growth and
another $43 million downward adjustment to smooth transition to next reserve
subperiod.

NOTE: Weekly data for columns 1, 2, 3, and 5 through 10 are statement week averages of daily data. Weekly data in column 4 are average rates set in the
auction of 6-month bills that will be issued on the Thursday following the end of the statement week. For column 11, the weekly date is the mid-point of
the calendar week over which data are averaged. Columns 12 and 13 are 1-day quotes for Friday and Thursday, respectively, following the end of the state-
ment week. Column 14 is an average of contract interest rates on commitments for conventional first mortgages with 80 percent loan-to-value ratios made
by a sample of insured savings and loan associations on the Friday following the end of the statement week. The FNMA auction yield is the average yield
in a hi-weekly auction for short-term forward commitments for government underwritten mortgages; beginning July 7, 1980, figures exclue graduated payment
mortgages. GNMA yields are average net yields to investors on mortgage-backed securities for immediate delivery, assuming prepayment in 12 years on pools
of 30-year FHA/VA mortgages carrying the coupon rate 50 basis points below the current FRA/VA ceiling.
