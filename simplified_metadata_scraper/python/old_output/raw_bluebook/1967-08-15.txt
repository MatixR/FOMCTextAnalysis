MONEY MARKET AND RESERVE RELATIONSHIPS

Recent developments

Spurred by large business tax payment financing needs and a

sizable Treasury tax bill financing, the pace of bank credit expansion

accelerated in June and July and continued relatively high in early August.

In July, bank credit (as measured by the daily average bank credit proxy)

expanded at a 15.2 per cent annual rate. This was at the top of the

13-15 per cent range for the month projected at the last FOMC meeting.

(After including borrowing abroad through foreign branches, bank credit

rose by 16 per cent in July). The slightly higher growth rate in bank

credit reflected a somewhat longer lasting expansion in private demand

deposits than had been projected, as the tax bills banks acquired by

crediting tax and loan accounts in the second week of July were sold off

more slowly than originally assumed. Time and savings deposits during

July expanded in line with projections at a 14.5 per cent annual rate.

The money supply, which had been expanding rapidly since the

beginning of May, largely in reflection of a sharp decline in U.S.

1/
Government deposits, grew 11.5 per cent in July on average. Most of

last month's growth in the money supply occurred early in the month,

1/ The money supply and other deposit and reserve series have been
revised to reflect new seasonals and benchmark data, as explained in
the appendix to the Green Book. The effect of the seasonal revisions was
to add 4 percentage points to the annual rate of growth in the money
supply in July (as compared with what it would have been with the old
seasonals) and to take away almost the same amount from May and June
together.

CONFIDENTIAL (FR) -2- August 11, 1967.

as sizable repayments of banks' business loans did not develop as

soon as expected following the bulge in such lending over the June

tax period. But beginning after mid-July growth in the money supply

leveled off, as considerably larger than usual net repayments of business

loans occurred and continued into early August.

These demands for credit and money were accommodated almost

by a 16 per cent expansion in nonborrowed reserves during July. As a

result member bank borrowings remained relatively low. Federal funds

and dealer loan rates were mostly at the low end of their recent ranges

in the latter part of July, with the Federal funds rate averaging

around 3¾ per cent and dealer new loan rates in New York around 4

per cent. In the latest statement week ending August 9, the funds rate

has averaged slightly above 4 per cent, and dealer loan rates have moved

up some.

In the bill market, rates fluctuated fairly sharply in the

second half of July, but since then the 3-month Treasury bill rate has

tended to stabilize around its mid-July level. Most recently, the 3-

month bill was quoted at 4.17 per cent. Longer-term bills have

drifted up in yield on balance, partly in reflection of the flotation

of the Treasury's new 15-month note, with the 1-year bill most recently

at 5.10 per cent. The President's tax message did not elicit any

extensive reaction on interest rates in money and capital markets, but

may have contributed to the apparent modest lessening of credit market

pressures in private capital markets.



CONFIDENTIAL FR) -3- August 11, 1967.

Member bank borrowings have averaged $78 million during the

past four statement weeks, little changed from previous weeks (except

for the high borrowings during the week containing the banks' midyear

statement date and the July 4 holiday). At the same time excess

reserves have averaged $342 million in the past four statement weeks,

down from the previous four weeks which included a seasonal bulge in

the second week of July. Free reserves averaged $264 million during

the weeks since the previous meeting.

Prospective developments

Credit expansion is expected to slacken during August, with

an annual rate of growth in the bank credit proxy of 5-7 per cent

expected from the week ending August 2 to the week ending August 30.

But for the month on average the bank credit proxy is expected to grow

by a 14-16 per cent annual rate, in large part reflecting the carry-

over effect on the August average of the bank credit growth in July.

In the previous Blue Book the bank credit projection for

the month had assumed that the Treasury would raise no new cash in

connection with the mid-August refunding and that the next cash

financing would be in early September. The current bank credit pro-

jection for August includes the effect of the Treasury cash refunding

with payment date at midmonth, which raised about $300 million of new

cash and avoided attrition that we had earlier estimated might be as

much as $500 million. In addition, it allows for a $2¼ billion for

new cash financing to be paid for at the end of August. This financing

may include a note offering, with a coupon attractive to banks.



CONFIDENTIAL (FR)

The new August projection would lead to a July-August average

bank credit expansion of 14-16 per cent, as compared with 10-12 per

cent shown in the last Blue Book. About half of the difference

reflects the different Treasury financing pattern that is emerging.

The recent strength in business loans persisted longer than expected,

but large repayments have recently developed, as earlier noted.

A slower rate of expansion in the money supply is also

expected in August, as loan demands are expected to continue quite

moderate over the balance of the month. On average in August, money

supply may expand at about a 3-5 per cent annual rate, and shows a

smaller increase over the course of the month.

Time deposits in August are expected to rise fairly sharply

at a 16-18 per cent annual rate. Recently there was a larger than

anticipated growth in outstanding negotiable CD's, as major banks have

tapped both the CD and Euro-dollar market to obtain funds perhaps in

part in anticipation of increasing loan demands this fall. Consumer

time and savings deposits, as best can be judged from the available

data, are still showing strength, although perhaps somewhat less

buoyancy than in the spring.

With these developments in train for August, maintenance of

prevailing money market conditions may be consistent with a more moderate

bank credit growth in September than in recent months. Prevailing money

market conditions would continue to encompass a Federal funds rate

averaging around 4 per cent or below, new dealer loan rates at New York

-4- August 11, 1967.



CONFIDENTIAL (FR) -5- August 11, 1967

banks in a 4 1/8 - 4-3/8 per cent range, member bank borrowings generally

in a $50-$100 million range, and free reserves averaging $200-$300

million. Such conditions would be consistent with an "even keel"

posture, in view of the forthcoming Treasury cash financing assumed to

be in the intermediate-term note area, and may keep the 3-month Treasury

bill rate in a 4.10-4.35 per cent range. The bill rate may drift up

toward the upper end of the range as the September dividend and tax dates

approach.

Under these conditions, and with basic economic developments

generally consistent with staff projections in the Green Book, bank

credit expansion in September might be in the order of 7-9 per cent on

average. However, an automobile strike during September could alter the

outlook for bank loans, depending on its duration and on the companies'

ability to stock the dealers with new models before a strike.

Strike uncertainty also, of course, affects projections for

the money supply and time deposits since it could seriously affect

corporate cash flows and personal income. Assuming no strike, or one

of brief duration or limited scope, money supply in September is likely

to decline by about 2-4 per cent on average. Some further increase in

U.S. Government deposits can be expected on average in September, in

view of the tax payments during the month and the new cash borrowing just

prior to the beginning of the month.

A slower rate of growth in time deposits is expected in

September. The recent somewhat less buoyant behavior of consumer time



CONFIDENTIAL (FR)

and savings deposits is expected to continue, but more importantly banks

are not expected to increase outstanding negotiable CD's to the extent

they did in recent weeks. The new Treasury cash offering may provide

some competition for time and savings deposits, especially if it is

necessary to use a highly attractive 5½ per cent coupon on an

intermediate-term security. In addition, corporations may show less

interest in CD's in September when their tax payments--including both

income taxes and withheld employee taxes--will be somewhat larger than

last year and substantially more than in 1965.

This credit and money picture for September--with Government

and private demand deposits taken together showing little net change--

would be consistent with a reduction in the annual rate of expansion

in nonborrowed reserves from about 13-15 per cent in July-August to

about 3-5 per cent in September. Assuming no significant change in free

reserve levels and money market conditions, the System would be providing

about $600 million of reserves between now and early September. Sub-

sequently the System would be a moderate net seller until late September

and early October.

The foregoing projections lead to annual rates of increase for

key monetary variables since last November, as follows:

June 1967 Dec. 1966
through through

Sept. 1967 May 1967
(4 months) (6 months)

Nonborrowed reserves 9% 14%
Bank credit proxy 12 11

Money supply 6 5
Time deposits 15 16

August 11, 1967.



CONFIDENTIAL (FR) -7- August 11, 1967.

The more moderate expansion of bank credit and reserves

foreseen for the coming month is not likely in itself to exert upward

pressures on long-term interest rates since it basically reflects an

expected moderation of private credit demands from their June-July

high levels. The tax message has also provided some basis for calming

the atmosphere in corporate and municipal markets. However, many

uncertainties persist with respect to the timing and ultimate size of

tax increases and to the reactions of businesses and consumers to a

prospective additional tax bite. Given these uncertainties, as well as

those surrounding the strike situation, a shortfall in bank credit

expansion below the moderate rates projected for September cannot be

ruled out as a possibility. On the other hand, larger than projected

bank credit growth could stem from business loan demands associated with

a stronger than anticipated turn-around in business inventory policies

and somewhat larger than expected tax payments in September.
