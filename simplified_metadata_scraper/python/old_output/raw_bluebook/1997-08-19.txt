Prefatory Note 

 
 

The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain. 
 

Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a redaction process that removed information obtained on a 
confidential basis.  All redacted passages are exempt from disclosure under applicable 
provisions of the Freedom of Information Act.    

 

                                                 
1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked 
and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not 
reliably recognized by the OCR process and were not checked or corrected by staff.

MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Recent Developments

(1) Over the intermeeting period, the federal funds rate averaged 5-1/2 percent, its

intended level since March, while most other market interest rates declined (Chart 1). Pri-

vate short-term rates fell by as much as 10 basis points.1 Futures rates for federal funds and

Eurodollars continue to suggest that markets expect policy to remain on hold for several

months and see relatively low odds on a tightening thereafter. Longer-term nominal yields

were down 15 to 25 basis points, but yields on indexed debt were about unchanged, suggest-

ing that a slight reduction in long-term inflation compensation accounted for the drop in

nominal yields. Earlier in the period, optimism about inflation apparently had become even

greater--sparked by favorable price and labor cost data, along with the market's take on the

Chairman's Humphrey-Hawkins testimony--and by late July nominal note and bond yields had

fallen almost 1/2 percentage point. Since then, bond prices and the foreign exchange value of

the dollar have partly reversed their earlier increases; prompted initially by reports of large

gains in employment in July and of strength in manufacturing output and price pressures in

the July NAPM survey results, market participants seem to have been reassessing whether

they hadn't become a little too optimistic about structural changes damping cyclical inflation

pressures. With less certainty about the inflation outlook, market reactions to incoming data

have been especially pronounced, and volatility in financial markets has risen considerably.

1 In contrast to private rates, Treasury bill rates rose over the intermeeting period, as
the Treasury shifted from paying down to issuing bills, on net.

Stock prices also have slipped in recent weeks and dropped sharply today, erasing most of the

large advances registered earlier in the period.

(2) The trade-weighted value of the dollar has gained about 3-1/2 percent on

balance over the intermeeting period. This appreciation occurred even though interest rate

differentials between dollar and foreign currency assets were little changed, averaging across

countries. In part, the dollar's increase reflected concerns about developments in Continental

Europe, where a variety of policy decisions raised new doubts about potential EMU members'

longer-term commitment to sound macroeconomic policies. The dollar has appreciated 4-1/2

percent against the DM despite the fact that German interest rates fell somewhat less than

U.S. rates; as the fall in the DM deepened, market participants came to the view that the

Bundesbank might soon raise rates to stem the decline. Elsewhere, the Bank of England

increased its repo rate twice over the intermeeting period, but indicated that this cycle of

tightening may be at or near its end, thereby weakening the pound, which fell 3 percent

relative to the dollar. New data suggesting that the Japanese economy is not rebounding

quickly from the recent consumption tax increase put downward pressure on the yen over the

intermeeting period. This tendency was offset to some extent by concerns about divergent

trends in U.S. and Japanese current account positions. For the period as a whole, the yen is

down 2-1/2 percent against the dollar. Financial turmoil in Thailand spilled over to several

other developing countries, primarily in Southeast Asia. The currencies of a number of

Southeast Asian countries have fallen 5 to 30 percent relative to the dollar since the beginning

of July as several central banks have been forced to abandon arrangements aimed at limiting

exchange rate fluctuations. A package of financial assistance and policy actions for the Thai

economy has been announced.

; the Desk did not intervene.

(3) Growth of M2 in July, at a 4-1/2 percent rate, remained near the moderate

pace of June. Data for early August suggest a pickup in M2 growth, owing particularly to

inflows to retail money funds, which may be related to the recent jitters in the stock market.

From the fourth quarter of last year through July, this aggregate expanded at a 5 percent pace,

a shade faster than expected at the time of the last Committee meeting. The velocity of M2

edged down in the second quarter, owing to a slight narrowing of opportunity costs, ending

the sequence of upticks seen over the previous four quarters.2 M3 growth surged to a 10-3/4

percent rate in July, even though adjusted bank credit growth slowed; issuance of large time

deposits was particularly strong, replacing overseas sources of funding at foreign banks and a

runoff of government deposits at domestic banks. Moreover, institution-only money funds

posted another month of rapid growth, as their yields lagged the decline in private short-term

interest rates and they evidently continued to substitute for in-house cash management by

businesses. From the fourth quarter of 1996 through July, M3 grew at a 7-1/2 percent rate,

substantially faster than the staff had anticipated.

(4) Private debt growth appears to have slowed a little from its brisk pace earlier

in the year, owing largely to a softening in household borrowing. Business borrowing has

risen in recent months, reflecting strength in capital spending. Financing conditions for the

2 Measured opportunity costs narrowed in the second quarter despite the Committee's
policy firming in March, as the contracting supply of Treasury bills put downward pressure
on their rates. Partly reflecting this rate decline, the runoff of outstanding bills obtained
through noncompetitive tenders intensified.

business sector remain quite favorable; indeed, quality spreads on junk bonds have edged

lower recently, and in survey responses a sizable fraction of banks reported a further decrease

in loan rate spreads from already narrow levels. Although banks, on balance, have continued

to tighten standards on consumer credit, the proportion doing so declined in the most recent

survey. A high level of tax receipts enabled the Treasury to pay down debt in May and June,

appreciably slowing the growth of total nonfinancial debt. From the fourth quarter of last

year through June, domestic nonfinancial debt grew at a 4-1/2 percent annual rate, just below

the middle of its annual range.

Policy Alternatives

(5) In the staff forecast, near-term growth has been revised down considerably

because inventory investment is expected to downshift from its surprisingly fast pace in the

first half. At the same time, the staff has revised up slightly its assessment of trend growth in

productivity and potential GDP. Still, the basic picture remains one of an economy that will

continue to operate above its potential, generating a gradual rise in inflation. Next year, final

demand growth is expected to slow, owing partly to the lagged effects of the recent strength

in the dollar, some rise in interest rates, and accelerator effects on business and household

capital expenditures. But this slowdown is not sufficient to relieve pressures on resources,

and both total and core consumer price inflation are forecast to edge up to 2-3/4 percent by

the end of 1998. The staff projections of output growth and inflation in both 1997 and 1998

are near the lower ends of the central tendencies of FOMC members' projections made last

month.

(6) With the risks apparently still tilted toward higher inflation, this document

presents the two basic policy options discussed in recent bluebooks: no change and tighter.

Under alternative B, the intended federal funds rate would be kept at its current level of 5-1/2

percent. Under alternative C, it would be boosted to 5-3/4 percent, either through reduced

provision of nonborrowed reserves or a hike in the discount rate.

(7) Despite the updrift in inflation projected by the staff, the Committee may

elect to maintain the current stance of monetary policy for the time being by choosing alter-

native B. Regardless of any longer-term risks, any likelihood of losing substantial ground



-7-

against inflation in the period just ahead appears to be remote: Inflation expectations seem to

have declined in recent months, which should help to moderate for a time any turnaround in

actual price increases; and, at this stage of the investment cycle and with consumers already

having responded to their increased wealth, the odds on a marked upside surprise in final

demand would seem to be lower than they might have appeared earlier. Moreover, the real

federal funds rate has been rising this year from an already high level, owing to the

Committee's firming of policy in March and the apparent decline in inflation expectations

since then, providing some assurance that policy is not substantially too accommodative.

Financial aggregates could be read in the same light, with both M2 and debt, the two

aggregates most closely related to nominal GDP, expanding moderately.3 In the staff forecast,

the rise in inflation is gradual, so that once the potential for an upswing in inflation became

more clearly evident, the Committee should have time to act before the economy's long-run

health were seriously threatened. Indeed, whether the structure of the economy has changed

in ways that make it somewhat less inflation-prone, at least for a time, than allowed for by

the staff projection remains an open question.

(8) Market participants uniformly do not expect a near-term policy move by the

Federal Reserve, and selection of alternative B by the Committee should elicit little imme-

diate market reaction. Thus, short-term interest rates generally would remain close to current

levels, as would the foreign exchange value of the dollar, though Treasury bill rates could

continue to edge up as supply constraints ease further with the seasonal widening of the

3 The relatively brisk advance of M3 seems to be driven primarily by the funding
choices of depositories and well as shifts in business cash management practices favoring
money funds, both of which bear little relationship to cyclical pressures.



-8-

federal deficit. In longer-term markets, prices are likely to remain more volatile than over the

spring and early summer as participants assess incoming data for clues about whether the

recent exceptional confluence of strong growth, high levels of resource utilization, and low

inflation can persist. However, data over the intermeeting period consistent with the staff

forecast would likely prove somewhat reassuring in this regard, because they would show the

economy growing at a moderate pace and inflation remaining damped. In these circum-

stances, long-term yields could move lower over the weeks ahead.

(9) Moderating growth in output will still leave utilization in the labor market

substantially above levels that in the past have been associated with accelerating prices. If

the Committee wants more insurance against the possibility that inflation will begin to pick

up, and especially if it wishes to tilt the odds a little in the direction of further progress

toward price stability over coming years, it may wish to raise the intended federal funds rate

at this meeting, perhaps by the 25 basis points of alternative C. With strong demand over

the past year and a half propelling the economy beyond the level of its estimated potential,

real short-term rates might be seen as having been below their equilibriums. One reason for

this situation may be that, despite a high real federal funds rate relative to its historical

average, financial market conditions evidently have been supportive of spending--spreads

faced by private borrowers are quite narrow and equity prices remain at a high level.

Although inflation performance has been surprisingly good of late, the effects of a stronger

dollar have played an important role that is not likely to be repeated in the next few years,

and signs of resurgent labor militancy may indicate reduced worker insecurity. Although

inflation expectations have fallen, the recent volatility in financial markets suggests that in



-9-

those markets such expectations may not be firmly anchored, and could turn around reason-

ably quickly once inflation begins to pick up. In those circumstances, delaying policy action

ultimately could turn out to be costly in terms of economic performance.

(10) With no near-term tightening expected, the market response to implementation

of alternative C could be sharp. Short-term market rates would jump by the full 25 basis

point increase in the funds rate; the prime rate likely would be lifted by an equivalent

amount. Bond markets would sell off as well. Investors would have difficulty interpreting

such an action in light of developments over the intermeeting period, and their response might

be shaped in part by the Federal Reserve's announcement. Participants might well think that

the action represented a one-time adjustment to rebalance risks, in which case the response

would tend to be muted. But more pronounced decreases in bond prices can not be ruled out

because investors might interpret the action as signifying that the Federal Reserve had

reassessed its fundamental outlook and now saw a more serious and sustained inflation threat

that would call for further tightening actions. If so, the value of the dollar on foreign

exchange markets probably would strengthen considerably. In either case, equity prices

almost certainly would fall, as real interest rates rose, and the decline could be considerable if

capital losses spurred investors to reexamine their assumptions regarding the risks of equity

investments.

(11) Under the unchanged federal funds rate of alternative B, M2 is projected to

grow at a moderate 4-1/2 percent rate on average over the remaining months of the year,

around the expected rate of expansion of nominal GDP, leaving this aggregate a little below

the upper limit of its 1 to 5 percent growth range for the year. The increase in M3 is likely



-10-

to slow somewhat, as factors that have temporarily been boosting managed liabilities in that

aggregate dissipate, but M3 growth will probably continue to be fueled by a shift in institu-

tional cash management toward money market funds. This aggregate is expected to finish the

year more than a percentage point higher than its 2 to 6 percent annual range, somewhat

above the staffs projection in the July bluebook. Although the federal government will shift

to being a net borrower in credit markets over the balance of the year, the growth of its debt

will be restrained by the narrow deficit. At the same time, the level and pattern of borrowing

by private sectors is not anticipated to change significantly, producing moderate growth in the

debt of all nonfinancial sectors--near the middle of its 3 to 7 percent range and in line with

nominal GDP.

Directive Language

(12) Shown below is (1) standard draft wording for the operational paragraph of the

directive that incorporates the usual options for Committee consideration and (2) possible

alternate wording that would include specific reference to the federal funds rate. The

alternate wording is identical to that in Don Kohn's memorandum dated August 14, 1997.

OPERATIONAL PARAGRAPH

STANDARD VERSION

In the implementation of policy for the immediate future, the Committee seeks to

INCREASE (SLIGHTLY/SOMEWHAT)/maintain/DECREASE (SLIGHTLY/SOMEWHAT)

the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions. In the context of the Committee's long-

run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful

consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, somewhat (SLIGHTLY)

greater reserve restraint would (MIGHT) or (SOMEWHAT) slightly lesser reserve restraint

(WOULD) might be acceptable in the intermeeting period. The contemplated reserve

conditions are expected to be consistent with moderate growth in M2 and M3 over coming

months.

ALTERNATE WORDING

First Sentence:

Current Wording: In the implementation of policy for the immediate future, the

Committee seeks to maintain/decrease/increase (somewhat/slightly) the existing degree of

pressure on reserve positions.



- 13-

June Bluebook Proposal: In the implementation of policy for the immediate future,

the Committee seeks to maintain current/tighten/ease (somewhat/slightly) conditions in

reserve markets consistent with the federal funds rate remaining/increasing/decreasing at/to

an average of around _ percent.

New Alternative: In the implementation of policy for the immediate future, the

Committee seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with maintaining/raising/lowering

the federal funds rate at/to an average of around ___ percent.

Second Sentence:

Current Wording: In the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price

stability and sustainable economic growth and giving careful consideration to economic,

financial, and monetary developments, (somewhat/slightly) greater reserve restraint

would/might or (somewhat/slightly) lesser reserve restraint would/might be acceptable in the

intermeeting period.

June Bluebook Proposal: In the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for

price stability and sustainable economic growth and giving careful consideration to

economic, financial, and monetary developments, decisions regarding the desirability

of adjusting the federal funds rate during the intermeeting period should give:

(1) equal weight to developments indicating a need to tighten or ease the

stance of policy;

(2) greater weight to developments indicating a need to tighten/ease the

stance of policy.



- 14-

New Alternative 1: In the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price

stability and sustainable economic growth and giving careful consideration to economic,

financial, and monetary developments, decisions regarding the desirability of adjusting

reserve conditions during the intermeeting period should give:

(1) equal weight to developments indicating a need to raise or lower the

federal funds rate;

(2) greater weight to developments indicating a need to (raise than to

lower) (lower than to raise) the federal funds rate.

New Alternative 2: In the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price

stability and sustainable economic growth and giving careful consideration to economic,

financial, and monetary developments, the Committee believes that

(1) incoming information is equally likely to warrant a tightening as an

easing of reserve conditions. Accordingly, decisions regarding the

desirability of adjustments to policy during the intermeeting period

should give equal weight to developments indicating a need to raise or

lower the federal funds rate;

(2) incoming information is more likely to warrant (a tightening rather than

an easing) (an easing rather than a tightening) of reserve conditions.

Accordingly, decisions regarding the desirability of adjustments to

policy during the intermeeting period should give greater weight to

developments indicating a need to (raise than to lower) (lower than to

raise) the federal funds rate.
