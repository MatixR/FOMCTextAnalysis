Prefatory Note 

 
 

The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain. 
 

Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a redaction process that removed information obtained on a 
confidential basis.  All redacted passages are exempt from disclosure under applicable 
provisions of the Freedom of Information Act.    

 

                                                 
1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked 
and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not 
reliably recognized by the OCR process and were not checked or corrected by staff.

Recent developments

(1) Growth of M-1A and M-1B slowed further in November, but re-

mained well above that needed to reach the FOMC's short-run target path.

Meanwhile, growth in M-2 and M-3 accelerated last month. The pickup in

the broader aggregates reflected a surge in the expansion of small time

deposits and large CDs. Savings deposits, on the other hand, declined

for the first time since May, and money market mutual funds dropped slightly

further. Recent data suggest a substantial slowing in growth of all of the

monetary aggregates in December. M-1A growth for the year 1980, shown in the

penultimate column of the table below, is likely to be just under the upper

limit of its longer-run FOMC range, while growth rates for the other

monetary aggregates will exceed the upper limits of their respective

1/ In 1980 actual shifts into ATS accounts out of demand deposits and other
assets were greater than anticipated in the point differential in the
targets for M-1A and M-1B. With appropriate adjustment of the target
ranges--raising the M-1B range and lowering the M-1A range--actual growth
in M-1B would be only slightly above its range, as would M-1A.

as commercial and industrial loans continued to expand sharply, and bank

credit growth for the year 1980 will be in the upper half of its longer-

run range.

(2) Reserve aggregates rose sharply in November, but a

substantial part of this growth was attributable to an increase needed to

accommodate a large rise in reserve requirements resulting from the

reduction of weekend Eurodollar reserve-avoidance activities. After adjust-

ment is made for this development, nonborrowed reserves declined at about

a 5 percent annual rate last month, as shown in the last column of the table

on page 3. However, total reserves, adjusted, grew at an 18 percent annual

rate. This advance reflected not only the continued rapid expansion in

required reserves associated with the larger than targeted growth in the

monetary aggregates, but also unexpectedly strong demands for excess

reserves, probably related to the implementation of the Monetary Control

Act. The enlarged level of excess reserves accounted for 8 percentage

points of the growth in total reserves. With demands for reserves out-

pacing the adjusted target path of nonborrowed reserves, member bank

borrowing increased substantially further early in the intermeeting

period, and the federal funds market continued to tighten. In the latest

statement week, however, member bank borrowing declined to an average of

$1.8 billion.

(3) With demand for reserves outpacing the amount supplied through

open market operations, and with further pressure on short-term markets

generated by the percentage point increase in both the basic discount rate

and the surcharge, short-term interest rates have risen another 2 to 5

percentage points since the November FOMC meeting. Pressures have been

particularly intense on very short-term instruments. The federal funds

rate averaged 18.82 percent in the most recent full statement week.1/ Rates

on 3-month Treasury bills and 3-month CDs rose to as high as 17 and 21

percent, respectively, above peaks reached in early spring. With bank

credit demand strong, banks have pressed large CD offerings on the market.

In addition, the Treasury raised more than $6 billion of new cash through

short-term bills since the previous meeting. With business loan demands

1/ At a telephone meeting on November 26, the Committee raised the upper
end of the federal funds rate range adopted in November from 17 to 18
percent. On December 5 and then again on December 12, the Committee
agreed that open market operations would not be precisely constrained
by the 18 percent limit.

remaining quite strong and costs of loanable funds rising, banks raised

their prime lending rates from 16 1/4 percent to 20 percent.

(4) Bond yields have increased less than short rates, rising

about 5/8 to 1 percentage point since the November meeting. The Treasury

raised just under $5 billion of new money with coupon securities in that

period. At the same time, the volume of public offerings of bonds by

corporations in November and early December was relatively light as firms

have backed away from the market in the anticipation that yields would

come down over the near term. Primary mortgage rates have moved up less

than bond yields; new mortgage commitment activity is reported to be

quite limited at current rate levels.

(5) The dollar has risen sharply on exchange markets since the

last Committee meeting, in response to the continued widening of interest

rate differentials in favor of dollar assets and to the intensification of

concerns over the Polish situation. The dollar rose by 3 to 4 percent

against Continental currencies and declined only against the yen.

U.S. authorities acquired $2 billion of DM.

Alternative longer-run monetary strategies

(7) To aid the Committee in its preliminary assessment of monetary

targets for next year, to be announced in February, the table on the following

page presents estimates of GNP, prices, and unemployment that might be

expected with alternative monetary strategies. Strategy I is based in part

on the FOMC's tentative decision with respect to M-1 for 1981 made in July,

and is the monetary premise for the greenbook GNP projection. It involves

a reduction next year of ½ percentage point in target growth of M-1A and

M-1B, abstracting from the distorting effects on these aggregates of shifts

into NOW and related accounts. It further assumes similar reductions in

1982 and 1983. Strategy II assumes continuation through 1981 and for two

years thereafter of the FOMC's 1980 target for M-1A--that is, growth at

the 4¾ percent midpoint of this year's range. The figures for strategies

III and IV show impacts if instead growth over the next three years is

at 6 and 3½ percent, respectively.

(8) The steadily reduced rate of money growth envisioned by

strategy I is likely to entail a noticeable reduction in the rate of inflation,

with some improvement next year and larger improvement in later years. Such

monetary restraint, so far as we can tell now, would permit little real

growth, and unemployment would be expected to rise throughout the 3-year

projection period. Strategy II would provide a bit more scope for real

growth, but with slightly less success in slowing price increases within

the projection time horizon. The higher money growth rates of strategy

III would appear to permit enough real growth to reduce the unemployment

rate and to move it below its current level in 1983. However, there would

be less progress in reducing inflation. Finally, strategy IV--which entails

Note: Strategy 1 represents M-1A growth (abstracting from NOW/ATS account
effects) of 4k percent in 1981, 3% percent in 1982, 3k percent in
1983. This is consistent with the assumptions underlying the
Greenbook GNP forecast and with the Committee's tentative target for
1981. Strategy 2 is 4% percent M-1A growth in each of the next
three years. Strategy 3 is 6 percent M-1A growth in each of the
next three years. Strategy 4 is 3 percent M-A growth in each
of the next three years. All the projections embody the fiscal
policy assumptions of the Greenbook, in particular a $35 billion
tax cut in 1981 with no further discretionary tax actions in
subsequent years.

a prompt, sizable reduction in money growth--would have the largest effect

in reducing inflation over the projection period, but at the highest short-

run cost in terms of real growth and unemployment.

(9) The behavior of the economy in response to these several

strategies will depend, among other things, on changes in expectations by

the public. We have assumed no more than a gradual abatement of inflationary

expections, as actual price increases diminish as a result of slack markets.

But should, for instance, the strong commitment to restraint of strategy I

or strategy IV lead to a rapid decline of inflationary expectations, and

hence to reduced upward pressure on wages and prices, there would be more

scope for expansion in real GNP. On the other hand, the greater money growth

of strategy III, which exceeds the upper limit of the tentative target

announced by the FOMC for 1981, could exacerbate inflationary expectations

because the System might be seen as becoming accommodative to inflation;

in that case, this strategy could involve more rapid inflation and less

real growth than shown in the table.

(10) All of our projections assume a further downward shift of

demand for M-1A and M-1B relative to GNP and interest rates (as measured

by the prediction error in the money demand equation of the Board's

quarterly model). The extent of shift in 1981 is somewhat less than occurred

in 1975 - 1976, after allowing for the estimated impact from introduction

of nationwide NOW accounts at the beginning of next year.1/ If such a down-

ward shift does not occur, the proposed targets would be even more restraining

in their impact on nominal GNP growth. For example, if the downward shift

were not to occur, or to be significantly less than expected, then adoption

1/ A brief discussion of money demand shifts implied by a few money
demand equations is contained in appendix II.



of the targets for 1981 involved in strategy I probably would yield an

economic outcome for that year more restrictive than implied by strategy IV.

(11) It should also be pointed out that the M-1 growth rates

assumed for these projections appear to involve relatively more growth in

the broader aggregates, particularly M-2, than was implicit in the Committee's

tentative thinking about targets for 1981. The table below compares the

monetary targets for 1981 decided in July with the set the staff believes

consistent with those M-1 ranges. As reflected in the two sets of ranges,

Tentative targets Current estimates
for 1981 set in July of consistent set

M-1A 3 to 5½ 3 to 5½

M-1B 3½ to 6 3½ to 6

M-2 5 to 8½ 8 to 11

M-3 6½ to 9½ 7½ to 10½

Bank credit 6 to 9 6½ to 9

we would expect M-2 growth to be above the upper end of the tentative range

for this aggregate announced in July and M-3 to be at least in the upper

part of its tentative range. This is based on our assessment of credit demands

on banks and thrift institutions next year, asset preferences of the public

at expected market rates of interest, the availability of attractive consumer-

type instruments at depository institutions, and recent experience.

(12) Adjustments to targets next year for M-1A and M-1B would

need to be made to take account of the impact on the public's deposit

holdings from the introduction of NOW and related accounts on a nationwide

basis. Our estimates of likely impacts are described in appendix III. On the

assumption that thrifts, including credit unions, will very actively compete

for such deposits, we have assumed that the total of funds newly shifted into



-10-

NOW accounts will be larger than earlier expected; however, we have retained

the assumption that two-thirds of these funds will come from demand deposits.

There is a wide range of error around these estimates, but our midpoint

estimate is that such shifts will reduce M-1A growth by about 4 percentage

points and raise M-1B growth by 2 percentage points. The relation between

M-1A and M-1B will also be influenced by the rate of growth in already

outstanding checkable deposits other than demand deposits (OCDs) as compared

with M-1A. We have assumed that the OCD component of M-1B will grow somewhat

faster than M-1A; this is consistent with the recent trend growth in house-

hold transactions balances, but the actual outcome will also depend to a

great extent on the behavior of OCDs as a savings vehicle. On balance,

consistent with the Committee's earlier tentative decision effectively to

reduce M-1A and M-1B growth by ½ point next year, we would now anticipate

that actual growth for M-A over the year 1981 would be in a -1 to 1½

percent range (1 point lower than earlier), and for M-1B in a 5½ to 8 per-

cent range (½ point higher than earlier).

Near-term targets

(13) The table below presents for Committee consideration alterna-

tive sets of targets for the monetary aggregates through the first quarter of

next year, taking the known November level as a base. The growth rates of

M-1A and M-1B are specified in terms of their behavior in the absence of

the January 1 introduction of nationwide NOW accounts; the corresponding

actual changes in these narrow aggregates, reflecting the anticipated

distorting effects of shifting into interest-bearing checking accounts,

are shown in parentheses. The staff's assumption is that the Committee

would wish to set its targets for M-1A and M-1B in terms of the "effective"

growth rates, with paths for the measured aggregates being adjusted as

incoming weekly data give some indication of the actual degree of shifting.

Also shown in the table are associated federal funds rate ranges for the

intermeeting period. (Detailed and longer-run data for the monetary

aggregates are contained in the table on the next page.)

from the substantial weakening of economic activity projected, growth of

the narrow aggregates at the rates indicated for any of the alternatives

probably would be accompanied by a decline in interest rates from their

current levels. However, as noted earlier, inflationary trends will be

giving considerable impetus to the public's demand for transactions balances

over the whole of 1981, and thus interest rates may well stay at high

levels on average next year.1/

(15) Alternative B has been designed to place M-1A and M-1B

in March near the midpoints of the FOMC's tentative long-range targets for

1981 adopted last July. Thus, under this alternative the rate of growth

over the first three months of next year would be 4¼ percent annual rate,

assuming M-1A grows at the 2½ percent annual rate for December. Substantially

lower growth rates are included in alternative C. This alternative would tend

to limit the potential for interest rate declines should the economy weaken

as projected and may tend to reduce the risk of pronounced interest

rate fluctuations in the course of the year. Alternative A proposes some-

what higher growth rates of money than alternative B. (The charts on the

following pages depict the near-term behavior of the monetary targets under the

three alternatives, with M-1A and M-1B shown both before and after adjust-

ment for the impact of NOW accounts; the alternatives are shown in relation

to the tentative long-run ranges for 1981 established at the July meeting.)

(16) Under alternative B, actual M-A growth may be slightly

negative after the turn of the year, on the assumption that the NOW account

effect reduces M-1A growth by about 5½ percentage points over the first

three months of the year. Measured M-1B growth may be around 7½ percent in

the early months of next year on the assumption that shifts out of assets

not contained in M-1B raise growth of that aggregate by about 2 percentage

points. To achieve the monetary expansion indicated by alternative B,

total reserves would have to increase at about a 1¾ percent annual rate

from November to March, and by 3 percent over the shorter-run period from

November to January.

(17) Under alternative B, the federal funds rate might be expected

to drop over the forthcoming intermeeting period to around 17 percent, and

probably by more later in the quarter, unless the economy proves to be

stronger than expected. A 17 percent funds rate would imply borrowing in

a range of $1¼ to $1 billion, given the present discount rate structure. A

drop in the funds rate to this level would be accompanied by declines of 2

percentage points or so in very short rates. Intermediate- and longer-term

market rates would drop substantially initially, partly as short positions

are covered. Rate declines may be more limited over the longer run, as

markets face adverse expectational pressures associated with sharp increases

that may be published in the consumer price index and with discussion of a

deficit-expanding tax cut. Even before such a tax cut becomes a reality,

debt markets will be burdened with heavy federal financing requirements--

expected to run between $20 and $25 billion in the first quarter. The long-

term bond markets will, in addition, be called upon to absorb a massive

backlog of corporate and municipal offerings that have been awaiting a down-

turn in rates.

(18) Bank credit growth should slow in the months ahead, reflecting

not only the slackening of loan demand associated with the weakening of final

demands and some liquidation of inventories but also the funding of short-term

debt by businesses. In reflection, the issuance of managed liabilities--

especially large CDs--should fall off from the recent elevated pace,



-16-

contributing to a moderation of M-3 growth. At thrift institutions, residen-

tial mortgage credit flows likely will be somewhat smaller than in the past

couple of months. Average rates on new S&L commitments for conventional

fixed rate loans are expected to move higher in the weeks immediately

ahead, but then to move downward only moderately. Although thrift institu-

tions are projected to continue to experience ample deposit inflows, the

funds will remain very costly and in an environment of significant operating

losses the institutions may tend to emphasize investment in short-term,

particularly liquid, assets.

(19) To attain the somewhat higher monetary targets of alterna-

tive A total reserves would have to increase at a 2¾ percent, at an annual

rate, between November and March and by a 3½ percent rate in the two-month

December-January period. The federal funds rate may fall to around 16

percent in the intermeeting period, and, given the present discount rate

structure, borrowing could be in a range around $1 billion. Other

short-term rates may drop 3 percentage points or so, tending to

lessen the financing and cash flow difficulties of many businesses

and households. The reduction in deposit costs at thrift institutions,

while substantial, would still leave them facing severe earnings pressures

over the next several months. Even though short rates drop more under

this alternative than under alternative B, long rates may be little

different, particularly if inflationary expectations remain high--as they

may if a substantial easing in short rates occur well before signs of a

weakening in price pressures or before there are clear signs of a significant

drop-off in economic activity.



-17-

(20) Alternative C is the most restrictive of the three short-run

options presented. Under this alternative, M-1A in March would be just below

the lower end of the tentative long-run growth cone for 1981--on both an

adjusted and unadjusted basis. The alternative C monetary targets are

consistent with virtually no growth in total reserves. Borrowing over the

next few weeks might decline only a little from the recent $1.8 billion

level, and the federal funds rate might remain in the 18 to 20 percent area.

However, as the first quarter progresses, federal funds and other short-term

rates are likely to drop somewhat as evidence of economic weakness emerges and

demands for credit and money soften. Credit conditions on the whole would

remain quite taut, though. Mortgage markets in particular would show little

or no easing and this, together with continued consumer credit stringencies,

would inhibit household spending.



-18-

Directive language

(21) Given below are suggested operational paragraphs for the

directive consistent with the form of the directive adopted at recent

meetings. Because December figures for the monetary aggregates are

largely projected, the language calls for expansion of reserve aggregates

at a pace consistent with the desired rate of monetary growth over the

four-month period ending in March 1981, provided that the weekly average

federal funds rate remains within a specified range. The specifications

adopted at the November meeting are shown in strike-through form.

In the short run, the Committee seeks behavior of reserve

aggregates consistent with growth of M-1A, M-1B, and M-2 over the

FOUR-MONTH period [DEL: from September to December] ENDING IN MARCH

1981 at annual rates of about [DEL: 2½] ____ percent, [DEL: 5] ____ percent, and

[DEL: 7¾] ____ percent respectively, [DEL: or somewhat less,] provided that in

the period before the next regular meeting the weekly average

federal funds rate remains within a range of [DEL: 13 to 18] ____ TO

percent.

If it appears during the period before the next meeting that

the constraint on the federal funds rate is inconsistent with the

objective for the expansion of reserves, the Manager for Domestic

Operations is promptly to notify the Chairman, who will then decide

whether the situation calls for supplementary instructions from

the Committee.

Appendix II

Alternative Econometric Estimates of the Drift in the Demand for M-1A
in Recent Years and Projections for QIV '80 to QIV '81

Since the mid-70's several developments have likely worked to

reduce the demand for M-1. Legislative and regulatory changes have created

new kinds of deposits or permitted expanded use of existing ones. At the

same time high interest rates have encouraged the use of very liquid deposit

substitutes such as RPs and MMFs, while also providing a greater incentive

for investment in cash management systems designed to lower average cash

holdings. As a result, M-1 velocity has tended to rise somewhat more than

might be expected on the basis of the prior established relationships.

To provide a quantitative indication of the amount of this downward

demand shift or drift, three representative money demand models have been

selected. As shown in Appendix Table II-1, these models differ mainly in

the specification of the opportunity cost of holding transactions balances.

The first of these models is the Board's quarterly econometric model. In

this model the opportunity cost of holding money balances is represented by

two money market yields--the three-month Treasury bill rate and the federal

funds rate--and the passbook savings rate. The second model shown in the

table was developed by Michael Hamburger, while he was on the staff of the

Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The opportunity cost of holding M-1

balances in his model is depicted by a long-term rate of interest--a bond

rate--and a dividend-price ratio for common stocks as well as the passbook

rate. The last one shown was developed by two members of the Board staff,

Richard Porter and Thomas Simpson. Their model is like the Board's quarterly

model with one major exception: it includes a ratchet variable designed to

capture the incentive to invest in new money management systems that enable

the depository to conduct transactions with a smaller amount of money

balances. When market rates of interest are high and expected to remain



II - 2

high for some time in the future, the perceived profitability of adopting

new cash management systems increases and new systems are implemented that

reduce deposit demands, not only in the current period but also in the future.

Appendix Table 11-2 shows the annual rate of demand errors or

drift in M-1A for each of these models over the six-year period from QIV '74 -

QIV '75 to QIV '79 - QIV '80 and for the QIV '80 to QIV '81 longer-run

target periods. In each case, money demand drift, shown in the third panel

of the table, is measured as the difference between actual (or targeted)

money growth and predicted money growth, shown in the upper panels of the

table. Since each of the econometric models was estimated based on data

prior to mid-1974, none of them could be expected to predict the weakness

in M-1A growth associated with regulatory changes permitting NOW/ATS accounts

and savings deposits for businesses and for state and local governments.

The lower panel in table II-2 modifies the drift estimates by adjusting

the predicted growth rates for an estimate of the impact of such regulatory

actions on M-1A.

The Board's quarterly model, which tended to be the best equation

of the three prior to the mid-70's, generates large drift estimates in 1975

and 1976, even when adjusted for the regulatory changes. Neither it nor the

Porter-Simpson model generates particularly large errors in the period from

1977 to 1980, especially when the adjustment for the regulatory changes is

made. The Porter-Simpson model produces somewhat smaller estimates of demand

drift than the Board's quarterly model in the years 1975 and 1976 and

again in 1980, in large measure because of the behavior of the ratchet cash

management variable in periods during or just following high long-term

rates. Making the adjustment for the regulatory changes, the Hamburger

model correctly forecasts the average rate of expansion of the money stock

over the six-year period. In large part the slower growth predicted by



II - 3

this model than the others can be attributed to the historically high value

of the dividend-price ratio over this period and the sluggish response of

this model to the increasing inflation since 1977.

For the QIV '80 to QIV '81 longer-run target period the models pro-

vide a wide range of estimates of demand drift. Abstracting from the intro-

duction of nationwide NOW accounts, the predictions bracket the 4¼ percent

midpoint of the longer-run target range for M-1A. The Board's model implies

that M-1A will be about 2¾ percentage points above this midpoint, while the

Porter-Simpson model predicts growth at about 1¼ percentage points below

the midpoint. The latter model is, in effect, predicting that the relatively

high long-term rates expected to prevail over the coming year will induce

a further increase in the efficiency of cash management and a fairly rapid

increase in velocity.

1/ Predicted growth rates for 1975-80 are based on actual values of the money demand determinants through 1980-QIII.
Thereafter, they are based on the staff's judgmental Greenbook projection for interest rates and output.

2/ The adjustments are based on the assumption that the introduction of ATS accounts nationwide, NOW accounts in the
Northeast, and savings accounts for businesses and for state and local governments has had a depressing effect on M-1A
growth. An adjusted M-1A series is constructed as an estimate of what M-1A would have been if these new deposit cate-
gories had not been created. The series added to M-1A essentially consists of two-thirds of other checkable deposits,
one-fourth of business savings deposits and one-fifth of state and local savings deposits. Since the latter two series
tend to fluctuate with interest rates, the actual adjustment is made by assuming that these series grow at half the
rate of increase of nominal income after the initial introductory phase for each.



Appendix III

Estimated Impact of Nationwide NOW accounts on the Monetary
Aggregates in 1981

As the public adjusts to the year-end introduction of nationwide

NOW accounts, growth in M-1A will be slowed by shifts from household demand

deposits to other checkable deposits (OCDs), while growth in M-1B will be

enlarged by shifts of funds from savings and other liquid assets to OCDs.

No significant impact is expected on M-2 because it includes virtually all

of the funds likely to shift to NOWs.

The advent of nationwide NOWs (and continued shifting into similar

accounts) will affect principally the approximately $88 billion of house-

hold demand deposits currently held in the 42 states where NOWs are not yet

authorized. However, some further shifting to NOW accounts is also expected

from the roughly $13½ billion of household demand deposits in the Northeast,

especially in New York and New Jersey.1/ Some inferences about the propor-

tion of household demand deposits in the 42 states likely to be converted

to NOWs may be drawn from the earlier experience with NOW and ATS accounts.

In Massachusetts and New Hampshire, shifting to NOW accounts initially was

slow, reflecting the novelty of the NOW concept in 1974 as well as the uncer-

tainty about its future status. Similarly, the public's adjustment to the

introduction of ATS accounts nationwide in 1978 has been rather slow. In

contrast, when NOWs were first authorized in the four other New England

1/ NOWs have been authorized in Massachusetts and New Hampshire for
all depository institutions except credit unions since January 1, 1974,
in the other four New England states since February 27, 1976, in New
York since November 10, 1978, and in New Jersey since December 28, 1979.
NOWs may be held only by individuals and nonprofit organizations. ATS
were authorized nationwide at banks and thrifts on November 1, 1978 and
share drafts first became available at federal credit unions on October 1,
1974. ATS accounts may be held only by individuals, and share drafts
only by credit union members.



III - 2

states in 1976 and in New York in 1978, the growing awareness and acceptance

of NOWs resulted in much faster adjustment.

Based on the historical growth rate of household demand deposits,

such deposits would probably grow to a level of about $110 billion by the

end of 1981 if there were no shifts into OCDs. The varied NOW and ATS

experience suggests a fairly wide range for the possible proportion of

personal demand deposits shifting to NOWs in 1981. If the adjustment by the

public to the availability of NOWs outside the Northeast is extremely rapid

(that is 25 percent shift in the first year), a diversion to NOWs of about

$24 billion of these household demand deposits may occur in 1981. Another

$1 billion is expected to be shifted in the Northeast. On the other hand,

if the adjustment is slow, total shifts may come to only about $6 billion.

These figures translate into an estimated reduction of M-1A growth ranging

from 1½ to 6½ percentage points in 1981 (table 1).

Surveys in early 1979, experience in New England, and a recent

sampling by Reserve Banks suggests that roughly one-third of existing NOW

deposits were diverted from assets other than demand deposits. Assuming

that a similar pattern emerges in the rest of the nation, roughly $3 to

$12½ billion of savings deposits and other liquid assets will shift to NOWs

during 1981. These figures imply an estimated boost to M-1B ranging from

¾ to 3 percentage points.1/

The width of these ranges reflects the high degree of uncertainty

regarding the speed of adjustment to nationwide NOWs in light of the

1/ If the mix of growth in OCD included a shift of savings deposits
equal to that- of demand deposits, the impact on M-1B would be twice
as large as shown while the impact on M-1A would be unchanged. The
interest rate ceiling at banks on nationwide NOWs and ATS accounts
will equal the ceiling on their regular savings accounts, and this
might provide an incentive for the public to shift more of their
savings into such accounts.



III - 3

diversity of experience with NOW and ATS accounts. Several factors argue

for expecting a rate of growth in the vicinity of the lower bound:

(1) About one-third of commercial banks--holding around 87
percent of total commercial bank individual savings de-
posits and an estimated 70 percent of household demand
deposits--already offered either NOW or ATS (or both)
accounts at the end of 1979. In addition, over 70 per-
cent of mutual savings banks offer NOW-ATS, and over 90
percent of such institutions offer some form of transac-
tion account that could act as a vehicle for offering
ATS. Only S&Ls and CUs have yet to enter the market for
household transaction balances in large numbers. Thus,
since NOW and ATS accounts are close substitutes from the
viewpoints of both offering institutions and depositors,
the nationwide NOW authority does not seem to be the sort
of innovation that should cause massive shifts of funds.

(2) Thrift competition is not as intense in most parts of the
country as in the states currently permitting NOW accounts,
and therefore banks in the 42 states may be less aggressive
in merchandising NOWs than were institutions in New England
and New York. Thrifts hold just over half of all savings
deposits nationwide, compared to about three-quarters in
the Northeast.

(3) Money market mutual funds may divert some of the more
interest-sensitive funds from NOWs, particularly if market
rates remain at high levels.

On the other hand, there are bases for arguing for a relatively

fast rate of conversion:

(1) Recent high market interest rates have heightened consumer
awareness of the value of interest-bearing transaction
deposits thus increasing the marketability of NOWs. More-
over, from the point of view of depository institutions,
relatively high market interest rates during 1981 might
increase incentives to market NOW accounts more aggressively
in an effort to retain or attract funds.

(2) While NOW and ATS accounts are functionally equivalent, the
simplicity of the NOW account concept likely will make it
easier to market than ATS.

(3) NOWs afford most S&Ls nationwide their first opportunity to
compete in the household transaction deposit market. Typical
pricing structures announced by S&Ls suggest an aggressive
stance, aimed to acquire a large market share by offering
NOWs free of service charges with minimum balance require-
ments of at least $1,000--frequently $2,000 to $3,000--for
service charge-free accounts.



III - 4

Midpoints of the estimated ranges may be viewed as the most

likely impact of shifts to NOW accounts in 1981, namely a 4 percentage

point reduction in M-1A growth and a 2 percentage point boost in M-1B

growth. The adjustment by the public to the introduction of nationwide

NOWs is expected to continue, but at a reduced pace, in 1982 and 1983.

The ultimate shift to NOW accounts likely will be quite large; after more

than six years of NOW accounts at all depository institutions in Massa-

chusetts and New Hampshire, roughly two-thirds of household demand

deposits are estimated to have shifted.
