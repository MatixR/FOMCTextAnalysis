The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain. 
 

Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These

scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked

Recent Developments

(1) M2 grew only a little on balance in May and June, and its M1

ccmponent declined over the two months. While some of the weakness in May

reflected the unwinding of the previous tax-related buildup, more generally

these aggregates appear to have been substantially affected by the increase

in interest rates among other factors this year. Expansion in M3 was

better maintained, as banks and thrifts issued large CDs and term RPs in

volume to fund a moderate pace of credit extension. Over the March-to-

June period M2 and M3 grew at annual rates of about 2-3/4 percent and 5-1/2

percent, respectively, compared with the pace of around 6 percent or less

for both aggregates specified by the Comittee. From the fourth quarter

through June, M2 increased at a 4 percent annual rate, leaving this aggre-

gate well below its 5-1/2 to 8-1/2 percent annual growth cone and a little

below its associated parallel band; its velocity increased 3 percent at an

annual rate over the first half following several years of declines.

Growth in M3 from the fourth quarter was about 5-1/2 percent--at the lower

end of its annual growth cone-and its velocity increased 2 percent. For

Ml, growth from the fourth quarter to June was around 7-3/4 percent; while

M1 velocity continued to fall in the first half, by the second quarter the

rate of decline was less than 1 percent.

(2) The substantial reduction in the growth of both M1 and M2

this year appears importantly to reflect a reversal in the trend of oppor-

tunity costs of holding monetary assets, which have increased since last

fall; over this period, the rise in short-term market rates has consider-

ably outstripped the increase in rates on most M2 balances. While the

expansion of retail deposits, taken as a whole, has slowed significantly

this year, demand deposits have been particularly weak in recent months,

perhaps indicating the importance of declines in compensating balances as

interest rates have risen. However, the slowing in M1 and M2 seems some-

what greater than can be explained solely on the basis of these interest

rate effects. In part, households may be using financial assets or reduc-

ing the pace of their accumulation in order to hold down their debt, per-

haps in response to less-favorable tax treatment of consumer debt.

(3) Relative interest rate movements also appear to have been a

principal factor governing flows within the retail portion of M2 this year.

Returns on liquid retail deposits--OCDs, MMDAs, and savings deposits-have

not changed much, while rates on small time deposits have risen substan-

tially, tracking the increase in open market rates. As a consequence,

funds appear to have been diverted from liquid deposits into small time

accounts, which resumed growing over May and June.

(4) Moderate credit growth at commercial banks and reduced asset

expansion at thrift institutions have contributed to the slowing of M3

growth this year. Net securities acquisitions by banks have been much more

subdued than during the second half of 1986, when expectations of declining

rates were pervasive, while loan growth at commercial banks has continued

at about the pace of last year. Asset expansion by thrift institutions

appears to have been damped so far this year, perhaps by more stringent

capital requirements imposed by the FHLBB. M3 growth also has been re-

strained by increased reliance by banks on liabilities not included in this

aggregate such as borrowings from foreign branches and Treasury deposits.



-4-

(5) The debt of domestic nonfinancial sectors is estimated to

have expanded at around a 9-1/2 percent pace on average in May and June,

bringing growth from the fourth quarter to June to about 10 percent, a

shade above the midpoint of its monitoring range and well below the rate

of recent years. Nonfinancial corporations thus far in 1987 have trimmed

their borrowing as the pace of net equity retirements has slowed somewhat.

In the household sector, moderation in debt growth has been most evident in

consumer credit, while mortgage borrowing did not pick up despite the sub-

stitution of home equity loans for consumer credit. Federal government

borrowing also decelerated in the first half of the year, but not by as

much as the deficit given unusually strong tax receipts, allowing the

Treasury to build up its cash balance.

(6) After the May FOMC meeting, the borrowing assumption used

to construct reserve paths was raised to $500 million, where it was main-

tained over the intermeeting period. Actual borrowing during the first

full maintenance period after the meeting was nearly $800 million; borrow-

ing was particularly heavy over the long Memorial Day weekend at a time

when an imminent increase in the discount rate was widely expected. Bor-

rowing has been lighter in the last two maintenance periods, bringing the

average for the three complete maintenance periods since the meeting down

to $580 million. Total reserves decreased at about a 2 percent annual rate

between April and June, reflecting a falloff in required reserves associated

with the net contraction in M1; for the year, growth in total reserves has

been 9-3/4 percent, compared with an increase of 20 percent in 1986. The

monetary base continued to expand on balance over the past two months, and



-5-

growth for the first half of the year was around 8-1/4 percent, down from

9-3/4 percent last year.

(7) Financial markets remained somewhat skittish early in the

period, owing to continuing concerns about the dollar, Citicorp's large

provision for losses on loans to LDCs, and the announcement of Chairman

Volcker's resignation. Later, though, investor sentiment improved in

response to a sharp drop in some commodity prices, a firmer dollar, and an

associated abatement of inflation fears. The federal funds rate averaged

around 6-3/4 percent during the intermeeting period. On balance, other

short-term interest rates are down 10 to 45 basis points, while longer-term

Treasury yields are about 50 basis points lower and corporate bond rates

have declined somewhat less. The commitment rate for fixed-rate mortgages

decreased over the period to 10-3/8 percent, about 50 basis points below

the peak in May but 125 basis points above the low set earlier this year.

Stock price indexes increased strongly over most of the period to record

levels, for a net gain of 4 to 10 percent since the May FOMC meeting.

(8) The weighted-average foreign-exchange value of the dollar

moved upward by about 3-1/4 percent on balance during the intermeeting

period. Early in the period, the dollar seemed to gain continued support

from the tighter monetary conditions that had developed in the United

States and somewhat easier conditions in several key foreign countries.

More recently, the dollar advanced further, despite the small decline of

short-term U.S. interest rates in June. The announcement by Japanese

authorities in late May of a package of measures to expand their econmy

seemed to provide support for the dollar, which gained almost 5-1/2 per-

cent against the yen during the intermeeting period, as did the release

Long-term targets

(9) The table below presents two alternative sets of specifi-

cations for growth in the monetary aggregates and debt for 1987. Alter-

native I comprises the ranges adopted in February. Although the staff

expects M3 and debt to remain within their existing ranges over the second

half of the year, there is a distinct possibility that restraint on infla-

tion in the context of continuing moderate economic growth would entail

M2 expansion over the balance of the year that was not sufficient to return

this aggregate to within its current annual range. Alternative II would

allow for that possibility by including a lower growth range for M2.

Alternative 1987 Ranges

Alt. I Alt. II
(Current Ranges)

M2 5-1/2 to 8-1/2 4-1/2 to 7-1/2
M3 5-1/2 to 8-1/2 5-1/2 to 8-1/2
Debt 8 to 11 8 to 11

(10) With M2 now well below its growth cone, and a little below

the lower end of its associated parallel band, growth at around a 7-1/2

percent annual rate over the remainder of the year would be needed to

achieve the 5-1/2 percent lower end of the current range in the fourth

quarter. Some acceleration of M2 is quite possible. Growth of this

aggregate in the first half of the year may have been depressed to some

extent by special factors whose impact would diminish over time-for

example, the initial adaptation to the new tax law. However, most of the

M2 slowing appears to have stemmed from the widening of opportunity costs

on M2 components as rates on these components lagged the upward movement



-8-

in market rates. If market interest rates were to continue near current

levels, M2 would be expected to pick up as the effects of the market rate

increases to date diminished, reflecting in part the catchup of deposit

offering rates. Under these circumstances M2 velocity likely would decrease

a little over the second half, which along with at least moderate expansion

of nominal income would tend to boost growth of this aggregate just to

within its current long-run range. Thus, reaffirming the alternative I

range would seem most consistent with an outlook for the economy in which

interest rates were expected to remain at or move below current levels.

The lower M2 growth rates of alternative II would allow some scope for a

further tightening of policy should that be considered necessary. In the

staff greenbook forecast, restraint on inflation and moderate expansion of

the economy in circumstances of continued downward pressure on the dollar

are associated with a further appreciable rise in interest rates over the

coming year and a half. If rates should begin to increase in the next few

months, M2 velocity probably also would rise over the second half, and any

pickup in M2 could be quite modest, with growth for the year coming to 5

percent or less-below the lower end of the current range.

(11) M3 and the debt of nonfinancial sectors, by contrast, seem

likely to be well within their long-run ranges for the year, even if inter-

est rates rise from current levels. M3 growth is expected to strengthen

over coming months to around a 7-1/2 percent rate, bringing growth for the

year to around 6-1/2 percent. Continued moderate increases in bank credit

may be financed to a greater extent by liabilities within M3 over the

second half of the year, as government deposits drop from their very high

levels and the unusually heavy reliance on net Eurodollar borrowing in the



-9-

first half tapers off. Credit growth at thrifts is expected to remain

above the depressed first-quarter pace and to be financed more by large

time deposits, which resumed growth in May and June after declining over

the previous eight months. Nonfinancial debt over the second half of the

year is projected to continue growing about in line with the pace of recent

months, implying growth for the year of 9-1/4 percent.

(12) M1 growth over the second half of the year is expected to

remain sluggish under the economic conditions anticipated in the staff

forecast, perhaps on the order of 3 percent, as expansion of both OCD and

demand deposits is held down by wider opportunity costs. The steeper yield

curve already in place, along with the slowness of NOW account yields to

adjust to further increases in market rates, would likely reverse some of

the savings flows into NOW accounts that occurred in the past few years.

Rising interest rates would restrain the growth of demand deposits as well

through their effect on cash management and compensating balance require-

ments. Even in the absence of a further rise in interest rates, any pick-

up in M1 from the depressed pace over the months of the second quarter

could be relatively limited, and with this aggregate expanding a little

less than nominal GNP, growth for the year might be around 7 percent.

(13) Despite the unusual weakness in demand deposits and very

sharp slowing in OCD flows this year, money demand equations have tracked

Ml growth over the first half of the year fairly well. But the "predict-

ability" of M1 behavior and the connection of this aggregate to economic

activity and prices is still open to question. The aggregate appears to

remain highly sensitive to small changes in opportunity costs, and the

model results depend importantly on the use of the actual deposit and



-10-

market interest rates. Specification of an M1 growth range of a standard

width consistent with an expected outcome for the broad aggregates and

spending would require a degree of confidence in forecasts of market and

deposit interest rates that does not seem warranted. Therefore, ranges for

M1 have not been incorporated into the alternatives presented above.

(14) The table below gives three alternative specifications for

growth in money and credit in 1988. Alternative I would retain the current

ranges; alternatives II and III would reduce the ranges by varying amounts.

Alternative 1988 Ranges

Alt. I Alt. II Alt. III

M2 5-1/2 to 8-1/2 4-1/2 to 7-1/2 3-1/2 to 7
M3 5-1/2 to 8-1/2 5 to 8 4-1/2 to 7-1/2
Debt 8 to 11 7-1/2 to 10-1/2 7 to 10

(15) Alternatives II and III both encompass rates of money growth

the staff considers consistent with its economic forecast. As noted above,

that forecast embodies an appreciable upward movement of interest rates by

the end of next year, given the anticipated persistence of price and dollar

pressures. Depending on the timing and size of rate increases and the lags

of offering rates on deposits, M2 velocity might be expected to increase

again next year, perhaps by more than one percent. With GNP expanding a

little more than 6 percent under the staff forecast, M2 would be expected

to increase around 5 percent or a little less.l/ M3 growth of around 6-1/2

1. The recent tax reform is not expected to affect M2 growth materially in
1988. The reduced attractiveness of IRA contributions, which already have
fallen off substantially in the early part of this year despite the accept-
ability of contributions for the prior tax year, would tend to buoy M2 de-
mands. On the other hand, the value of the tax deductibility of interest on
consumer debt will be phased down again, perhaps reinforcing incentives to
restrain asset accumulation instead of taking on more debt.



-11-

percent is expected under the staff forecast. This projection is consistent

with moderate expansion of bank and thrift credit next year, and fairly

normal funding patterns. While both sets of institutions will be under

pressure from capital guidelines to hold down balance sheet expansion, the

forecast assumes that market concerns about the health of banks or thrifts

do not seriously impair the overall credit extension and funding process.

M1 would be expected to increase only about 4 percent, as rising interest

rates continue to limit the growth of demand deposits and NOW accounts.

(16) Growth of the debt of domestic nonfinancial sectors is

expected to slow a little more next year, on a fourth-quarter average

basis, to 8-1/2 percent, the same pace anticipated for the second half of

this year. The growth of government indebtedness is expected to taper off

a little, reflecting a slight moderation in borrowing by state and local

governments owing to reduced refunding volume in an environment of same

upward pressures on interest rates. In the business sector, a decline in

borrowing needs for share retirements should be largely offset by some

widening of the margin of capital spending over internal funds, given the

prospect for relatively flat after-tax profits. Expansion in household

debt is expected to be maintained by continued substantial mortgage borrow-

ing in conjunction with housing activity and home equity loans.

(17) The staff econmic forecast assumes that policy is aimed

at achieving money and credit growth consistent with some restraint on

domestic spending in circumstances in which progress toward price stability

may be threatened, in part by further depreciation of the dollar and marked

improvement in real net exports at a time when unemployment may already be

in the neighborhood of the "natural rate." Especially in the absence of a



-12-

more substantial federal deficit-reduction effort, restraint of domestic

private demand through limited growth of money may be needed to contain

inflation pressures and promote an orderly adjustment of external imbalances.

M2 expansion thought consistent with the staff forecast would be in the

lower part of its alternative II range and M3 near the middle. The lower

money growth specifications of alternative III embody a range of outcomes

somewhat better centered on the staff's expectations, especially for M2.

This range would allow more scope for restraint on inflationary pressures,

particularly should they turn out to be more intense than anticipated, or

for a downward shift in money demand. Since M2 growth could be fairly weak

as interest rates rose under these circumstances, the lower end of the

alternative III range is a full percentage point below that of alternative

II. The upper end is reduced only a half percentage point to allow for the

possibility of no change or a small decrease in velocity should interest

rates remain near current levels.

(18) Alternative I encompasses money growth rates that would be

more consistent with little further change in interest rates or even sane

decline, perhaps accompanying weaker than expected economic growth or very

substantial progress in reducing the structural federal deficit and limited

underlying price pressures. This alternative, then, would be more appro-

priate if the risks were thought to lie in the direction of a shortfall in

aggregate demand, rather than a resurgence of inflation. Considerable

weakness in domestic demand would tend to constrain inflationary pressures

even if the dollar were to drop appreciably further. Under these condi-

tions, nominal interest rates near or below current levels might be needed

to support economic growth. In this context, income velocity of M2 also



-13-

would be expected to change little on balance next year or begin to

decline again, implying expansion of M2 around or a bit below the middle

of the alternative I range if growth in nominal GNP were sustained at

6 percent, and this alternative would allow some latitude for some further

monetary growth should that be appropriate to foster economic expansion.



-14-

Short-run policy alternatives

(19) The table below presents three alternative specifications

for monetary growth from June to September, along with associated federal

funds rate ranges. (More detailed data, including growth from the fourth-

quarter base of the long-run ranges to September, are shown on the table

and charts on the following pages.) Under all three alternatives, growth

in M2 and M3 would strengthen from the pace of recent months, and M3 growth

from the fourth quarter of last year would rise noticeably into its annual

range. Under A and B, the pickup in M2 would be sufficient to lift this

aggregate to around the lower end of the alternative II long-run range by

September, although it would remain below its alternative I long-run range.

Under alternative C, the pickup in M2 growth would be inadequate to raise

this aggregate to near the lower end of even the alternative II long-run

range by September. M1, in all three cases, is expected to expand more

slowly than the broader measures over the next few months, at a pace below

that of the first half of the year.

positions, federal funds would be expected to trade in a 6-1/2 to 6-3/4

percent range, perhaps more toward the lower end of the range, given the

current absence of market expectations of a near-term tightening of

policy. In these circumstances other short-term rates would be about

unchanged over the near term, although the three-month Treasury bill rate

could drift higher as the paydown of bills abates. The dollar might

remain around current levels for a time, but at some point considerable

downward pressure could well reemerge under the weight of continued out-

sized external deficits. In this event, longer-term rates would tend to

rise in reflection of heightened inflationary concerns and short-term

rates could also begin to firm in anticipation of some additional tighten-

ing of monetary policy.

(21) Without an increase in reserve pressures, growth in M2 is

expected to pick up substantially from the unusually slow pace of May and

June, toward the pace of nominal income expansion. The depressing influ-

ence of the previous increase in market rates should begin to wear off

reasonably promptly since offering rates on many components of M2 seem

already to have adjusted to the current structure of market rates. With-

in M2, rate relationships are expected to favor small time deposits, as

they have recently, at the expense of the more liquid retail components--

OCDs, savings deposits, MMDAs, and money funds. In the event of mounting

concern about the solvency of some thrift institutions, retail deposit

growth at thrifts could be damped, although any effects on M2 would be

limited by conversions of large time deposits to accounts of less than

$100,000 and by shifts of core deposits to commercial banks and money

funds in view of the absence of other liquid or insured alternatives.



-17-

With somewhat stronger third-quarter M2 growth, the advance in M2 velocity

would slacken to about a 2 percent rate, given the staff GNP forecast.

(22) M3, under alternative B, would probably expand at a 7-1/2

percent annual rate, up about 2 percentage points from the March-to-June

period. While asset growth at banks and thrifts is expected to continue

around its average pace of recent months, a runoff of Treasury deposits

will lead to more issuance of managed liabilities in M3. With faster

expansion of M3 in the third quarter, its velocity would resume contract-

ing at about a 1-1/2 percent rate, broadly in line with its longer-run

trend.

(23) M1 would be expected to grow at a 4 percent annual rate

over the June-to-September period under alternative B, implying quarterly

average growth at only a 1 percent rate and the first M1 velocity in-

crease-at a 5 percent rate--in nearly three years. As adjustments to

the earlier rise in opportunity costs of holding both demand deposits and

OCDs taper off, these components would resume expanding, but the extent

of any pickup would be limited by the persistence of significantly higher

opportunity costs relative both to market instruments and time deposits.

(24) Under this alternative, growth of debt of domestic non-

financial sectors is expected to moderate over the June-to-September peri-

od and expansion in this aggregate from the fourth quarter is expected

to edge down to 9-1/2 percent by September. Borrowing by the Treasury is

likely to decline, on a seasonally adjusted basis, as the Treasury draws

down its cash balance. Other sectors are expected to maintain their bor-

rowing at about the moderate pace of recent months. Business borrowing

will continue to be buoyed by the financing of share retirements, while

credit required to finance investment expenditures remains modest. House-



-18-

hold credit usage will remain concentrated in the mortgage category,

boosted by continued shifting from consumer credit into home equity loans.

(25) Alternative A assumes a reduction in the borrowing allow-

ance to $300 million; the federal funds rate is likely to decline to the

6 to 6-1/4 percent area. Other money market rates also would fall by

comparable amounts, as there is very little expectation of a near-term

easing in monetary policy built into market rates. With an unwinding of

some of the rise over recent months in opportunity costs, M2 would move

closer to the lower end of its current longer-run range by September and,

given the lagged effect of the lower market rates and faster income growth,

would be likely to rise to just within this range in the fourth quarter.

The boost to M3 growth stemming from a small pickup in depository credit

expansion would lift this aggregate well into its current annual range.

(26) The decline in short-term rates under alternative A would

contribute to a resumption of downward pressure on the dollar, potentially

to a significant degree if this were seen as adding to inflationary pres-

sures. Under these circumstances, any tendency for long-term rates to

decline would be limited and possibly more than offset by the market re-

action to the weaker dollar and inflation anxieties.

(27) Alternative C assumes a $200 million increase in the path

allowance for borrowing to $700 million. The federal funds rate would

climb to the 7 to 7-1/4 percent area and the bill rate would post a

similar increase. Firmer conditions in the money market would act to

postpone the reemergence of downward pressure on the dollar in exchange

markets and the possible reduction of inflationary concerns would temper

any tendency for Treasury bond yields to rise. There could be some widen-



-19-

ing in quality spreads, though, if the effects of this policy action were

seen as aggravating debt servicing difficulties, including through weaker

income growth, both at home and abroad.

(28) Any pickup in M2 is likely to be quite modest under alter-

native C. Over the June-to-September period, M2 would be expected to

strengthen only marginally, to a 3-1/2 percent rate, damping growth from

the fourth quarter to 4 percent by September. Transactions deposits

would be most affected, with M1 expected to grow at only a 2 percent pace

over this period. M3 probably would expand at around a 7 percent pace,

owing to continued solid bank credit growth and more issuance of managed

liabilities in M3; and growth in this aggregate from the fourth quarter

would still strengthen--to 6 percent by September.

Directive language

(29) Presented below for Committee consideration is draft

language dealing with the Committee's long-run ranges for 1987 and 1988.

With regard to the ranges for 1987, two variants are proposed for the

broader aggregates. Variant I is keyed to a Committee decision to re-

tain the current ranges for these aggregates. The language in brackets

is provided should the Committee wish to express an expectation that

growth in M2 or the broader aggregates more generally would be around

the lower limit of their ranges. Variant II might be considered if the

Committee wishes to lower the 1987 range for M2 that was established in

February. A separate paragraph for M1, patterned on the language in the

current directive justifying the absence of a target range, would follow

and could be used with either variant.

With regard to the ranges for 1988, the draft allows for the

possibility that the Committee may want to give some broad indications of

its expectations for M1 growth next year without establishing a numerical

target range, at least at this time.

Draft language for the operational paragraph is shown in para-

graph (30) on page 23. The current directive language relating to the

Committee's longer-run ranges (adopted in February) is appended for

reference on pages 24-25.

1987 Ranges

Variant I

The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial

conditions that will foster reasonable price stability over time,

promote growth in output on a sustainable basis, and contribute to



-21-

an improved pattern of international transactions. In furtherance

of these objectives the Committee agreed at this meeting to reaffirm

the ranges established in February for growth of 5-1/2 to 8-1/2 per-

cent for both M2 and M3, measured from the fourth quarter of 1986 to

the fourth quarter of 1987. [The Comittee agreed that growth in the

aggregates around the lower ends of their ranges may be appropriate

in light of developments with respect to velocity and signs of the

potential for some strengthening in underlying inflationary pressures,

provided that economic activity is expanding at an acceptable pace.]

The monitoring range for growth in total domestic nonfinancial debt

set in February for the year was left unchanged at 8 to 11 percent.

Variant II

The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial

conditions that will foster reasonable price stability over time,

promote growth in output on a sustainable basis, and contribute to

an improved pattern of international transactions. In furtherance

of these objectives, and taking account of developments with respect

to velocity and signs of the potential for some strengthening in

underlying price pressures, the Committee agreed that some reduction

in the M2 range from that established in February would be consistent

with restraint on inflation and satisfactory economic performance.

The Comittee set the new range for growth in M2 at ____ to ____ percent,

measured from the fourth quarter of 1986 to the fourth quarter of

1987. The Committee reaffirmed the range for M3 growth of 5-1/2 to

8-1/2 percent established in February for 1987. The monitoring range

for growth in total domestic nonfinancial debt set in February for the

year was left unchanged at 8 to 11 percent.



-22-

Ml (Both Variants)

With respect to M1, the Committee recognized that, based on

experience, the behavior of that aggregate must be judged in the

light of other evidence relating to economic activity and prices;

fluctuations in M1 have become much more sensitive in recent years

to changes in interest rates, among other factors. Because of this

sensitivity, which has been reflected in a sharp slowing of the

decline in M1 velocity over the first half of the year, the Committee

again decided not to establish a specific target for growth in M1 over

the year as a whole. Instead, the appropriateness of changes in M1

will continue to be evaluated in the light of the behavior of its

velocity, developments in the economy and financial markets, and the

nature of emerging price pressures. The Committee anticipates sub-

stantially slower growth of M1 in 1987 than in 1986 in the context of

continuing economic expansion, given the intensification of price

pressures this year-associated in part with a substantial downward

movement of the dollar in foreign exchange markets--and the abatement

of the weakness in M1 velocity. The Committee in reaching opera-

tional decisions over the balance of the year might target appropriate

growth in M1 from time to time in the light of circumstances then

prevailing, including the rate of growth of the broader aggregates.

1988 Ranges

For 1988 the Committee agreed on tentative ranges of monetary

growth, measured from the fourth quarter of 1987 to the fourth

quarter of 1988, of ____ to ____ percent for M2 and ____ to ____ per-

cent for M3. The Committee decided not to establish a 1988 range



-23-

for M1 at this time in light of the continuing exceptional uncer-

tainties about the relationship of this aggregate to key measures

of economic performance. However, the Committee indicated an expec-

tation that the growth in M1 associated with restraint on inflationary

pressures and moderate economic expansion might be well below the

average pace of the previous several years. The issues involved with

establishing a target range for M1 would be carefully reappraised

at the beginning of 1988. The Committee provisionally set the associ-

ated range for growth in total domestic nonfinancial debt at ____ to

____ percent.

OPERATIONAL PARAGRAPH

(30) The draft for the operational paragraph follows closely the

format used at the May meeting, with the addition of the usual alternatives

for the sentences on reserve pressures and possible intermeeting adjustments.

With regard to the latter, the May directive gave primary emphasis to

potential inflationary developments and the behavior of the dollar.

In the implementation of policy for the immediate future, the

Committee seeks to DECREASE SOMEWHAT (Alt. A)/MAINTAIN (Alt. B)/

increase somewhat (Alt. C) the EXISTING degree of reserve pressure

ON RESERVE POSITIONS sought in recent weeks, taking into account the

possibility of a change in the discount rate. Somewhat greater reserve

restraint would (MIGHT), or somewhat lesser reserve restraint (WOULD)

might, be acceptable depending on indications of inflationary pressures

and on developments in foreign exchange markets, as well as the behavior

of the aggregates and the strength of the business expansion. This



-24-

approach is expected to be consistent with growth in M2 and M3 over

the period from [DEL: March through] June THROUGH SEPTEMBER at annual rates

of around ____ AND ____ 6 percent, RESPECTIVELY {DEL: or less]. Growth in

Ml is expected to remain well below its pace during 1986. The Chair-

man may call for Committee consultation if it appears to the Manager

for Domestic Operations that reserve conditions during the period

before the next meeting are likely to be associated with a federal

funds rate persistently outside a range of [DEL: 4 to 8] ____ TO percent.

Current Language
(Long-run targets adopted in February)

The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial
conditions that will foster reasonable price stability over time,
promote growth in output on a sustainable basis, and contribute to
an improved pattern of international transactions. In furtherance
of these objectives the Committee at its February meeting established
growth ranges of 5-1/2 to 8-1/2 percent for both M2 and M3, measured
from the fourth quarter of 1986 to the fourth quarter of 1987. The
associated range for growth in total domestic nonfinancial debt was
set at 8 to 11 percent for 1987.

With respect to M1, the Committee recognized that, based on
experience, the behavior of that aggregate must be judged in the
light of other evidence relating to economic activity and prices;
fluctuations in M1 have become much more sensitive in recent years
to changes in interest rates, among other factors. During 1987,
the Committee anticipates that growth in M1 should slow. However,
in the light of its sensitivity to a variety of influences, the
Committee decided at the February meeting not to establish a per-
cise target for its growth over the year as a whole. Instead, the
appropriateness of changes in M1 during the course of the year will
be evaluated in the light of the behavior of its velocity, develop-
ments in the economy and financial markets, and the nature of emerg-
ing price pressures.

In that connection, the Committee believes that, particularly
in the light of the extraordinary expansion of this aggregate in
recent years, much slower monetary growth would be appropriate in
the context of continuing economic expansion accompanied by signs
of intensifying price pressures, perhaps related to significant



-25-

weakness of the dollar in exchange markets, and relatively strong
growth in the broad monetary aggregates. Conversely, continuing
sizable increases in M1 could be accommodated in circumstances
characterized by sluggish business activity, maintenance of progress
toward underlying price stability, and progress toward international
equilibrium. As this implies, the Committee in reaching operational
decisions during the year might target appropriate growth in M1
from time to time in the light of circumstances then prevailing,
including the rate of growth of the broader aggregates.
