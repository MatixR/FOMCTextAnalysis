Prefatory Note 

 
 

The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain. 
 

Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a redaction process that removed information obtained on a

1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked

MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Prepared for the Federal Open Market Committee

By the staff Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System

Class I - FOMC September 22, 1995

MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Recent Developments

(1) Over the intermeeting period, the federal funds rate

averaged 5-3/4 percent, the Committee's intended level.1  Other

market interest rates fell appreciably over most of the period, though

they have reversed a portion of those declines in recent days. On

net, yields on short-term Treasury securities decreased 15 to 25 basis

points and longer-term Treasury yields dropped about 35 basis points.

Lower interest rates, together with optimism about prospects for cor-

porate earnings and a continued brisk pace of merger announcements and

share buybacks, propelled broad stock price indexes to record levels

during the period, though they have ended off their highs.

(2) Contributing to the drop in rates were further evidence

of subdued price pressures and indications that the rebound in output

growth would be modest; as a consequence, the gradual fall-off in

inflation expectations evidenced in survey data in recent years prob-

ably has been extended (chart). Greater confidence that the budget

process would produce a significant reduction in federal deficits may

also have fostered declines in rates. Changes in forward rates,

which--atypically--dropped as much at longer horizons as at inter-

mediate horizons, are consistent with the inference of downward revi-

sions to market forecasts of the secular paths of federal deficits and

inflation. Market participants see a greater likelihood of further

monetary policy easing over the balance of the year now than they did

1. The allowance for adjustment and seasonal borrowing was
maintained at $275 million over the intermeeting period; actual
borrowing averaged close to the allowance.

in mid-August, but little chance of a move at the September meeting.

In recent days, expectations of ease have been trimmed and market

rates have backed up, associated in part with a reversal of previous

dollar strength.

(3) The dollar's weighted-average exchange value declined

2-1/2 percent, on balance, over the period since the August FOMC meet-

ing; the dollar rose 2-1/2 percent against the yen but fell against

other major currencies. For most of the period, the weighted-average

dollar had moved higher, owing in part to monetary easings abroad.

German short- and long-term rates declined about 35 and 15 basis

points, respectively, as the Bundesbank reduced its official lending

rates by 1/2 percentage point. The Bank of Japan lowered its discount

rate 1/2 percentage point and call money rates nearly as much on

September 8. Japanese bond yields declined substantially, reversing

much of the backup in earlier weeks. The Japanese policy easing was

accompanied by massive intervention to strengthen the dollar against

the yen, which was apparently successful at least for a time. Aug-

menting the dollar's rise against the yen were Japanese trade figures

for July, which showed Japan's current account surplus finally turning

down in dollar terms. Late in the period, however, the yen reversed

course after the announcement of the new Japanese fiscal package, and

the mark rose as prospects for European monetary union seemed to dim;

the dollar declined against other major currencies as well. Dollar

weakness may have been exacerbated by concern about the possibility of

a default by the U.S. Treasury on its debt.

The U.S. monetary authorities did

not intervene during the period.



(4) Private debt growth appears to have moderated in recent

months from the pace set earlier this year. The expansion of business

loans at commercial banks slowed to an annual rate of just 3 percent

in August, owing in part to stronger commercial paper issuance, and

has remained sluggish this month. Issuance of corporate bonds in

public markets also was light in August; a resurgence has been evident

in the first half of September in response to declining interest

rates, and the calendar of pending issues is full. In the household

sector, bank loan data adjusted for securitizations indicate that

consumer credit growth has continued to decelerate. Home mortgage

borrowing, however, likely has been buoyed by declining interest rates

and stronger home sales. Credit supply conditions remain favorable.

Banks still seem to be eager providers of funds to businesses, where

delinquency rates remain low, and spreads of loan rates over market

rates continued to narrow this summer. In the household sector, how-

ever, some evidence of rising debt service difficulties appears to be

prompting a shift toward a less aggressive stance by banks. In the

open markets, yield spreads on junk bonds have widened slightly but

remain relatively low, and spreads on higher-rated private paper rela-

tive to Treasuries have stayed narrow. Federal debt has been about

flat over August and September, as the Treasury has financed the

deficit mainly by drawing down its cash balance. Total domestic

nonfinancial sector debt rose at only a 3-1/4 percent annual rate in

August, bringing growth from the fourth quarter to 5-1/2 percent, near

the middle of its 3-to-7 percent annual range.

(5) The broad monetary aggregates have decelerated somewhat

in September, though their trend growth remains fairly strong. M2

and M3 are estimated to be expanding this month at rates of 3-3/4 and



4-1/2 percent, respectively, leaving M2 somewhat below and M3 appreci-

ably above the upper ends of their annual ranges. The velocities of

the broad aggregates appear to have fallen significantly in the

current quarter as they did in the second quarter, marking the first

back-to-back declines in more than four years. The drop in market

interest rates, and associated declines in the opportunity costs of M2

assets, seems to be the primary factor behind the decline in the

velocity of this aggregate, which is being mirrored in sluggish

demands for some instruments outside of M2. Net noncompetitive

tenders for Treasury securities, for example, have turned negative

since earlier this year, and flows into bond mutual funds have

remained anemic. Purchases of shares in stock funds, however, have

stayed heavy.2 M3 growth has continued to be supported by brisk

issuance of the managed liabilities included in the aggregates as well

as by institution-only money funds.

(6) In contrast to the broader aggregates, M1 growth has been

quite weak in recent months; this aggregate has contracted at a 4-1/2

percent pace in September and has fallen 1 percent at an annual rate

since the fourth quarter of 1994. M1 has been depressed appreciably

this year by the introduction by additional banks of programs to sweep

NOW account balances into nonreservable MMDAs. Apart from the effects

of such sweep accounts, M1 has expanded at an estimated 2-1/2 percent

rate in September and at a 1-1/2 percent rate for the year to date.

2. With a strong contribution from capital gains, M2 plus bond and
stock funds is estimated to have expanded at a 12 percent annual rate
in the third quarter, following growth at a rate 9-1/2 percent in the
second quarter.



(A more detailed discussion of OCD sweep arrangements and their ef-

fects on the monetary and reserve aggregates appears in an appendix.)

Currency growth has remained moderate in September, perhaps reflecting

a continuation of slower net shipments of U.S. currency abroad.3

3. The monetary base is estimated to have grown at a 1-1/2 percent
rate in September. Adjusted for the effects of OCD sweeps, the base
has risen at a 3-1/4 percent rate this month. Total reserves have
fallen at a 3-1/2 percent rate, while abstracting from sweeps they
would have risen at an estimated 10 percent rate.

Policy Alternatives

(7) The incoming information since the last FOMC meeting has

not altered the general patterns of the staff economic forecast. The

staff projection assumes no change in the federal funds rate until

late in 1996, with bond yields foreseen as staying around their recent

lower levels. Output is still projected to expand at a pace just

below that of its potential through the end of next year, while the

unemployment rate drifts up to 6 percent. The staff projects infla-

tion in the CPI to come in a little below 3 percent this year and

next; with the level of output slightly below its potential in 1996,

core CPI inflation moderates a little next year. The staff outlook

for output growth and unemployment is consistent with the central ten-

dencies of the July forecasts of the Governors and Presidents for

these two years. The outcomes for the total CPI would undershoot the

central tendency for this year but would be well within the central

tendency specified for next year. In 1997, the staff's forecast of

economic growth in the 2 percent area and CPI inflation around this

year's pace is accompanied by a slight easing in the nominal funds

rate at the end of 1996.

(8) The staff forecast assumes that aggregate spending is not

significantly disrupted in the process of determining the new federal

budget. The first potential difficulty occurs over the intermeeting

period when budget authority for annual appropriations expires on

October 1. However, Congress and the Administration are discussing

continuing resolutions that would permit spending while negotiations

are ongoing. In any case, a lapse in appropriations, even if it were

to persist for several weeks, would not have much direct effect on

GDP. in part because a considerable volume of government spending



would persist. Moreover, multiplier effects are likely to be minimal

as government employees draw on savings to maintain consumption

levels in the face of a temporary income loss. With normal government

spending and revenue patterns disrupted, however, projections of the

Treasury balance, and hence reserve supply, would be more uncertain.

(9) The staff currently estimates that a cash constraint

owing to the debt ceiling will become binding on November 15--the date

of the next scheduled FOMC meeting--assuming no unprecedented steps by

the Treasury to avoid default. A default on federal debt, even if

interest on accrued obligations were paid belatedly, would add a risk

premium to interest rates on Treasury debt. The impact on private

securities markets is difficult to predict. On the one hand, default

risk on private issues would not necessarily increase, and indeed,

demands for these securities may benefit as substitutions for Trea-

suries. On the other hand, market psychology could deteriorate, with

some possibility of a more generalized flight from dollar assets. In

addition, in the event of default, innumerable problems of clearing

and settlement could arise and the liquidity position of individual

transactors counting on timely Treasury payments could be impaired.

Either a shutdown or a default would necessitate a more flexible pro-

vision of liquidity by the Federal Reserve--both through open market

operations and the discount window. Whether an adjustment to the

stance of policy itself might be warranted by such developments might

be seen as best determined on the basis of information available at

the time.

(10) The case for keeping the funds rate at 5-3/4 percent as

under alternative B could rest on an assessment that the current funds

rate may well provide the appropriate monetary impulse, at least for



the time being. The staff forecast could be viewed as representing

both a likely occurrence under a stable funds rate, even with the

substantial fiscal restraint assumed, and a satisfactory balance be-

tween the Committee's inflation and employment objectives. Moreover,

with the dollar recently under downward pressures, and financial mar-

kets looking for clues as to how the Federal Reserve evaluates and

will respond to the evolving fiscal situation, any change in the

stance of policy could risk market overreaction and misinterpretation.

Under these conditions, even if the Committee saw some odds that the

economy or inflation would come in below the staff forecast, it might

choose to stand pat until easing was more clearly called for by incom-

ing economic data.

(11) Although the data received over the intermeeting period

have strengthened market participants' conviction that Federal Reserve

easing has become more likely by year-end, only a small probability of

a move at the September meeting is seen. Thus, choice by the Commit-

tee of alternative B's unchanged funds rate likely would engender just

a minor increase of short-term rates. Any immediate reaction in bond

or foreign exchange markets should be muted. Over the upcoming inter-

meeting period, economic reports consistent with the subdued growth in

the staff forecast could keep alive expectations of subsequent mone-

tary easing, allowing intermediate- and long-term interest rates to

remain near current trading ranges. The exchange value of the dollar

would be little changed. Of course, markets may be buffeted by

developments in the legislative process suggesting shifting odds on

the extent of deficit reduction.

(12) If the Committee saw reasonably high odds of more

restrictive effects on the economy than the staff forecast, it might



-10-

favor an easing of the funds rate, as under alternative A. Such

effects would come at a time when the economy already is expected to

be expanding at a rate less than the growth rate of its potential and

with monetary policy possibly seen as also on the restrictive side.

In July, the Committee reversed only a portion of the move toward

policy restraint it made last winter when the risks to the economy of

rising inflation were much larger. Real rates across the maturity

spectrum remain elevated by historical standards, though, to be sure,

the level of equilibrium real rates is uncertain. Moreover, real

rates could move up a little further over time with an unchanged funds

rate, as current expectations of a policy ease were frustrated.

(13) The downward adjustment of short-term market interest

rates that would accompany the unanticipated implementation of alter-

native A would be a little smaller than the 1/2 percentage point cut

in the funds rate operating target. Market participants may well

interpret the action as responding to prospective fiscal restraint or

to receding inflation pressures, so inflation expectations might not

react adversely. On the other hand, they are not likely to project

significant further rate cuts pending new information on these fac-

tors, limiting rate decreases. On balance, the associated declines in

intermediate- and longer-term interest rates probably would be smaller

than the fall in short-term rates, which is the historically typical

market reaction. The dollar's exchange value could be expected to

extend its most recent decline.

(14) The 1/2 percentage point policy tightening of alterna-

tive C could be favored if the inflation performance projected by the

staff to accompany an unchanged federal funds rate were seen as repre-

senting an insufficiently rapid approach to the Committee's ultimate



-11-

objective of price stability. Indeed, the staff forecast shows very

little downward tilt to inflation rates. Moreover, the current un-

employment rate is a little below the staff's estimate of the NAIRU,

and economic growth going forward at a pace below potential is by no

means assured--especially in light of current bond rates and stock

prices. On the basis of relationships embodied in the Greenbook

alternative simulation, a policy tightening of the dimensions of

alternative C would nudge economic growth to below 2 percent over the

next two years, opening up enough slack in labor and product markets

to make more noticeable progress toward price stability in 1997 and

beyond.

(15) The 1/2 percentage point hike in the funds rate of

alternative C would catch market participants off guard. Their inter-

pretation of the action, of course, would be conditioned by the word-

ing of the accompanying announcement, which presumably would emphasize

more aggressive pursuit of the Committee's longer-run price stability

objective. In that context, the sharp jump in money market interest

rates may be accompanied by a much more muted increase in bond yields,

if longer-term inflation expectations were favorably affected. If the

impact on inflation expectations were negligible, though, an appreci-

able selloff in the bond market could result. In any event, some

intermediate-term rates--real and nominal--would rise significantly as

market participants revised up their expected path for short-term

rates for some time into the future. The exchange value of the dollar

likely would strengthen.

(16) Without serious disruptions to governmental operations,

federal debt growth should slow from its pace earlier in the year to a



-12-

3-1/4 percent annual rate over the last four months of the year. Non-

federal debt growth would continue at a 4-1/4 percent pace over the

same interval. For businesses, borrowing will remain below the first

half of the year, held down by lower inventory investment and slower

growth in capital spending; the composition of borrowing, however,

should tilt back toward the bond market. For households, some pickup

in mortgage borrowing should counter a further moderation in consumer

credit. Concerning credit supply conditions, banks remain comfortably

positioned to lend, although the growing strains on households may

lead to a little more caution in this area. As shown in the table be-

low, total debt of domestic nonfinancial sectors is projected to ex-

pand at a 4 percent rate over the final four months of this year,

placing this aggregate in the fourth quarter a little more than 5 per-

cent above its year-earlier level.

(17) The broad monetary aggregates are expected to grow over

the remainder of this year somewhat more rapidly than forecasted in

the last bluebook. The additional projected strength primarily owes

to the recent decline in market interest rates, both short- and long-

term, which has further narrowed the opportunity costs of holding



-13-

retail money balances.4 Under alternative B, M2 is projected to

grow at a 5-3/4 percent rate over the final three months of the year.

M3 is foreseen as expanding at a 6 percent rate, somewhat faster than

the staff's projection of bank credit expansion, reflecting the an-

ticipated ongoing shift from nondeposit to deposit sources of funding.

In the fourth quarter, the velocities of both monetary aggregates

would continue to decline, albeit at a reduced pace. M2 in the fourth

quarter would be quite near the top of its 1 to 5 percent annual

growth cone, while M3 would be well above its 2 to 6 percent annual

growth range. (A table showing the growth rates of the monetary

aggregates over the balance of the year under each of the alternatives

is attached.)

4. M1 is expected to continue to decline over the remainder of the
year, at about a 1-1/2 percent rate under alternative B, as still more
banks introduce sweep accounts that transfer funds automatically from
NOW accounts to MMDAs to reduce reserve requirements. Assuming about
$10 billion of additional sweeps over the last three months of the
year, revised up from $3 billion in the last bluebook, this effect
will reduce the M1 growth rate over the last three months of the year
by 3-1/2 percentage points and over the four quarters of 1995 by 2-3/4
percentage points. Actual M1 over the four quarters of this year is
now projected to edge down by 1 percent under alternative B.

Directive Language

(18) Presented below is draft wording for the operational

paragraph that includes the usual options for Committee consideration.

OPERATIONAL PARAGRAPH

In the implementation of policy for the immediate

future, the Committee seeks to DECREASE (SOMEWHAT/

SLIGHTLY)/maintain/INCREASE (SOMEWHAT/SLIGHTLY) the

existing degree of pressure on reserve positions. In

the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for

price stability and sustainable economic growth, and

giving careful consideration to economic, financial,

and monetary developments, slightly (SOMEWHAT) greater

reserve restraint (WOULD/MIGHT) or slightly (SOMEWHAT)

lesser reserve restraint would (MIGHT) be acceptable in

the intermeeting period. The contemplated reserve con-

ditions are expected to be consistent with [DEL: more moderate]

growth in M2 and M3 over [DEL: coming months] THE BALANCE OF

THE YEAR NEAR THE PACE OF RECENT MONTHS.



Appendix: Sweeps of Transaction Deposits into MMDAs

In January 1994, commercial banks began instituting sweep

programs for retail customers. In such programs, household NOW

account balances (included in the "other checkable deposits" (OCD)

component of M1) are swept into money market deposit accounts (MMDAs).

Retail sweeps of this nature legally reduce a bank's required re-

serves. Assuming a 10 percent marginal reserve requirement and in-

vestment of the reserve balances freed by the sweep at a 5-3/4 percent

federal funds rate, a bank earns 58 basis points of interest per dol-

lar swept. Improvements in automation over the years have reduced the

cost of installing and operating the software required for such a

system, making this financial innovation advantageous for many in-

stitutions.

While information about the detailed features of retail sweep

programs is not available from many of the banks that have implemented

them, the typical program appears to be structured as follows. The

bank sets up two separate subaccounts for each depositor, a NOW

account and a special-purpose MMDA. Each night, any funds in the NOW

account in excess of some upper limit, say $1,000, are transferred to

the MMDA. If debits to the NOW account threaten to reduce its balance

below zero, enough funds are transferred back from the MMDA to re-

plenish the NOW account to a $1,000 balance. While there are no

limits on transfers out of NOW accounts, only six transfers per month

out of MMDAs are permitted under Regulation D. Because of that limit,

1. Sweep accounts for business customers of banks became widespread
in the mid-1970s. They involve sweeps of demand deposits into RPs or
other money market instruments whose minimum sizes are too large to
accommodate households.



if a sixth transfer is made from the MMDA to the NOW account within

the same statement month, then the entire remaining balance is

transferred and no further sweeps from the NOW account to the MMDA

occur until the following month.

Recently, two banks reported an alternative type of program

in which all balances in NOW accounts are swept into MMDAs each Friday

night, and returned to the NOW accounts on Monday. With a maximum of

five Mondays per month, there is no risk of triggering a sixth trans-

fer. This "weekend-sweep" reduces OCD balances to zero for three-

sevenths of each week--implying a smaller reduction in OCDs than the

80 percent typically achieved under the aforementioned schemes, but it

is very simple to implement.

Through edit checks and other reports from Reserve Banks,

Board staff have learned of the existence of retail sweep programs at

11 banking organizations; each program typically includes several

banks within a holding company.2 No data are available on the

ongoing amount of funds that reside in MMDA accounts as a result of

sweep activity. However, Board staff have tallied estimates of the

total volume of balances swept out of OCD accounts on the day each

program was implemented. The cumulative estimated impact effects

through September 1995 are $34 billion.3

The creation of retail sweep programs has no effect on M2,

since OCD balances are being swept into MMDAs, which are themselves a

component of M2. However, adjustments need to be made to narrow

2. To date, 28 separately-chartered large banks and 69 small banks
have instituted sweeps. Large banks account for 85 percent of the
amounts swept.

3. This estimate is likely to be close to the total dollar volume
of sweep activity, as it is based on edit checks of daily data sup-
plied weekly to Federal Reserve Banks by all commercial banks having
total deposits above $55 million, which includes all banks with mar-
ginal reserve requirements of 10 percent.

As shown, the establishment of sweep programs reduced the

growth rate of M1 by about a percentage point in 1994, and by about

2-1/2 percentage points from the fourth quarter of 1994 through

September of 1995. The growth rate of total reserves was lowered by

an estimated 1-1/2 percentage points in 1994 and 4-3/4 percentage

points so far this year. Because currency represents a large share of

the monetary base, OCD sweeps have had considerably less effect on

growth of the base--only 1/4 percentage point in 1994 and 3/4 percent-

age point so far in 1995.

While Board staff are aware of several other banking organi-

zations that are considering the implementation of retail sweep pro-

grams, it is unclear how far this innovation will spread. Small banks

who can meet reserve requirements entirely with vault cash would gain



nothing from it, and banks with a 3 percent marginal reserve require-

ment might not find it cost effective.4 If sweeps were implemented

only by banks that had ex ante a 10 percent marginal reserve require-

ment and were required to hold balances at the Federal Reserve, then

OCD would be reduced by perhaps another $160 billion, assuming that

about three-quarters of such balances are swept on average. Required

reserve balances held at the Federal Reserve would be reduced from the

current level of about $20 billion to $7 billion in consequence.

This may be a high estimate of OCD sweep effects, as it includes some

large banks having no interest in reducing required reserves, since

they hold Federal Reserve balances on the margin for clearing pur-

poses.

However, the new sweeping techniques may not be applied only

to NOW accounts. One institution recently began sweeping a small

amount of personal demand deposits into MMDAs, and there is no real

impediment to the spread of this innovation to corporate demand

deposits as well. (Given the uncertainty of corporate payment flows,

weekend sweeps may be the technique banks come to use to avoid the

reserve requirement tax on demand deposits.) If sweeps of both OCD

and demand deposits become widespread, required reserve balances held

at Federal Reserve Banks could fall to a very low level.

Major declines in required reserve balances and associated

structural changes in reserve demand would have important effects on

4. If, for each dollar swept, only 3 cents of reserve balances
were freed, the return per dollar swept would amount to 17-1/4 basis
points with a 5-3/4 percent funds rate. In the extreme, if a bank had

the maximum volume of deposits ($50 million) subject to the 3 percent
reserve requirement, they were all OCD, and 80 percent were swept, the
maximum potential earning would amount to $70,000 annually.

5. The reduction in required reserve balances is smaller than 10
percent of the reduction in OCD because some of the original reserve
requirements were met with vault cash rather than with Federal Reserve
balances.

the implementation of monetary policy, and could potentially increase

substantially the volatility of the federal funds rate.

Depositories hold balances at the Federal Reserve to meet

reserve requirements, to make payments, and to access Federal Reserve

services. Overdrafts can occur because of large unpredictable trans-

actions between a bank's customers and the customers of other banks.

Required reserve balances provide some cushion against the risk of

overdrafts. If such balances fall persistently below the levels

needed for clearing purposes, a bank may choose to establish a re-

quired clearing balance, which earns credits against priced Federal

Reserve services. When the marginal dollars in reserve accounts are

being held to meet required reserves or required clearing balances,

banks have considerable flexibility in managing balances at the

Federal Reserve from a day to day. Because such requirements are met

on a two-week average basis, banks can arbitrage the federal funds

rate within days and across days, and, given carryover, across

maintenance periods to a limited extent. This flexibility is an

important reason why the funds rate remains close to the FOMC's

desired levels.

However, a bank can benefit from required clearing balances

only to the extent that it uses Federal Reserve services.6  If

required balances in total are low, a bank's reserve management will

be dominated by the daily risk of overdrafts, rather than by the need

to meet two-week average requirements. It may, for example, seek

excess reserves in the form of precautionary balances early in the day

and late-day balances to cover unexpected payments. Depending on the

6. Through August 1995, banks implementing retail sweeps have
established required clearing balances amounting to 18 percent on
average of the estimated reductions in required reserve balances
associated with the sweeps.



-A6-

distribution of reserves among banks and the degree to which credit

lines in the federal funds market have already been filled, the funds

rate could become quite volatile late each business day, as some banks

try to work down unneeded precautionary balances while others scramble

to line up funding for clearing needs. Furthermore, predicting the

aggregate reserves needed on a daily basis at the time of the Desk's

11:30 A.M. open market operation becomes much more difficult when

reserve demands are based on daily, and even intraday, needs rather

than the more smoothly-evolving estimates of maintenance-period

average demands for required balances.

Heightened volatility in the federal funds rate was evident

in early 1991, after the Federal Reserve reduced to zero the reserve

requirements on nontransaction deposits. The upper panel of chart A-1

shows the sharp increases in the intraday trading ranges of the

federal funds rate at that time.7  However, funds rate volatility

declined rather quickly as banks adjusted to the lower level of re-

quired reserves (in part by establishing required clearing balances),

and as required reserves themselves grew rapidly along with M1

deposits in the declining interest rate environment.

As shown in the lower panel, the extreme volatility of the

funds rate in early 1991 was associated with an unusually low level of

required operating balances, the sum of required reserve and required

clearing balances. While such balances are currently several billion

dollars above the lows reached in 1991, they could drop well below

such levels by the time the new sweep programs have become fully

implemented.

7. Reluctance to use the safety value of the discount window owing
to fears of adverse reputation effects in the market contributed to
the funds rate volatility.

However, the current wave of transaction account sweeps is

unlike the experience of early 1991 in several respects. The 1991

reserve requirement cut was an industry-wide change implemented by the

Federal Reserve without a long lead-time, while in contrast sweep

programs are being established voluntarily by commercial banks self-

selected for an interest in reserve management on schedules they them-

selves choose. Moreover, improvements in reserve management since

early 1991, including greater awareness of the advantages of estab-

lishing required clearing balances, may mitigate the impact of the new

sweeps on federal funds rate volatility.

Nevertheless, the uncertainties are considerable. Staff at

the Board and the Desk are closely monitoring the diffusion of this

financial innovation for signs of potential adverse effects on the

implementation of monetary policy, and have begun studying possible

modifications to regulations and operating procedures that could

mitigate any such effects.
