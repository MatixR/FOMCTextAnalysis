1  In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic 
format.  All scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced 
tilting) and lightly cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other 
blemishes caused after initial printing). 
 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optical character recognition computer program (OCR) 
first created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, 
staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.  Please note that the numbers and text in charts and

MONEY MARKET AND RESERVE RELATIONSHIPS

Money markets

Recent developments. Most short-term interest rates have

continued to move higher in recent weeks, but Treasury bill rates have

shown little net change since early March, although they have fluctuated

over a fairly wide range in this period. The recent increase in prime

loan rate was accompanied by rising rates on negotiable certificates

of deposit. Offering rates on commercial and finance company paper

also advanced as issuers made adjustments to the higher cost of bank

loans.

Over the three statement weeks ending March 16, net borrowed

reserves have averaged almost $215 million and member bank borrowings

about $540 million -- compared with averages of $120 and $475 million,

respectively, in February. The rise in net borrowed reserves in

recent weeks has been reflected in a somewhat tauter atmosphere in

the Federal funds market, where trading at 4-3/4 per cent has been

more frequent.

Although the banking system as a whole has been under

greater reserve pressure, two factors appear to have moderated any

related tendency for bill rates to rise. First, strong nonbank

bill demand has helped keep dealer inventories relatively low.

Second, the central money market banks continued to operate with

relatively comfortable reserve positions, as major banks, especially

in New York, prepared for large CD runoffs in March and heavy loan

demands over the tax and dividend periods.

Prospective developments. If net borrowed reserves average

around $200 million over the next three weeks, the 3-month bill rate

is likely to fluctuate within a 4.55 to 4.70 per cent range. With

continued pressure on member banks to borrow, the Federal funds rate

may be expected to trade more frequently at 4-3/4 per cent, especially

if loan demand continues strong.

A number of factors may tend to keep bill rates near the

lower end of the range in the earlier part of the period. These

include some reinvestment demand from maturing March tax bills not

turned in for taxes, demands associated with the April 1 Cook County

property tax, and temporary investment demands from proceeds of large

capital issues currently reaching the markets. In addition, the

anticipated termination in late March of the $100 million additions

to the weekly 3-month bill auctions may be having some firming

influence on the bill market.

With the reversal of Cook County buying and particularly

with the approach of the mid-April tax date, however, bill rates

may come under some upward pressure. Corporate tax payments in

mid-April under the accelerated schedule are expected to be about

$1-1/4 billion larger than last year and no tax bills are available

to smooth the payment process. Underlying factors that may keep

short-term rates under upward pressure in the weeks ahead are the



CONFIDENTIAL (FR) - 3 -

higher offering rates that have recently emerged on new time CDs

in a period of large maturities and prospective sizable short-term

Federal Agency issues.

Despite the rise in the prime loan rate, bond yields have

declined recently. This decline was influenced by rising expecta-

tions of a tax increase and by some postponements of previously

scheduled offerings. In the weeks ahead, the outlook for corporate

financing suggests upward pressure under bond yields. However, if a

tax rise should appear increasingly probable --with the attendant

implication that the present discount rate is sustainable -- bond

yields could remain around present levels.

Reserve flows, bank credit, and money

Current developments. Information available through mid-

March suggests that total reserves on a monthly average basis may

increase at about a 2 per cent annual rate, total member bank deposits

by 1 per cent, and time deposits around 5 per cent, while private

and Government demand deposits show offsetting movements. The pro-

jected rise in total reserves partly reflects an increase in

seasonally adjusted excess reserves, assuming the actual level of

these remains about unchanged from recent weeks. In contrast to

other recent months, nonborrowed reserves in March are expected to

decline.



CONFIDENTIAL (FR) - 4 -

After rising sharply in January and declining moderately

through February, the weekly figures for total member deposits, now

shown in the accompanying text table, have been rising modestly thus

far in March. Private demand deposits and the money supply have

risen rather sharply since their end-of-February lows, but this has

been largely offset by a greater than seasonal decline in Government

deposits, while time deposits have shown only a small rise.

Prospective developments. Reserve aggregates in coming

months are likely to grow somewhat more rapidly than the low rates

indicated for March. Private credit demands are expected to continue

strong and will help carry member bank deposits back above their

late January peak. A moderating factor in the rate of reserve expansion

will be the absence of Treasury cash financings, with the next Treasury

operation being a routine refunding in mid-May.

In view of large gross CD maturities ahead, net time deposit

expansion is not likely to be strong, although perhaps picking up

from its relatively slow March pace. Private demand deposits rose

sharply in the first half of March largely because of a decline

in Government deposits. There may be some further rise after the mid-

March tax date partly because Government deposits are expected to rise

less than seasonally; for the month as a whole an increase of over

10 per cent is expected in private demand deposits.



CONFIDENTIAL (FR) - 5 -

These shifts between public and private balances are

likely to be at least partly reversed in April, although the deposit

outlook is more uncertain than usual this year in view of the new

tax legislation and the lingering unknown effects of the 1964 tax

law on individuals' April payments (or refunds). But, as of now, one

would expect private demand deposits to be rising at around a 5 per

cent annual rate over the next few months, with Government deposits

showing little change on balance on a monthly average basis.

Bank credit expansion in the months ahead is likely to range

around a 5-6 per cent growth trend. A moderate growth in both total

and nonborrowed reserves would accompany such an increase.

Explanation of Projections in Table B-1

1. Changes in Federal Reserve credit indicate reserves needed to offset projected changes in
required reserves and factors affecting the supply of reserves.

2. Projected changes in currency outside banks reflect seasonal movements plus an allowance
for growth of about $30 million per week.

3. Projected effects of Treasury operations, included in "technical factors," reflect scheduled
and assumed calls in current two weeks and thereafter, maintenance of Treasury balances with
Federal Reserve at $400 million.

4. Projected changes in gold stock reflect assumed outflow after March at the rate of about
$50 million per month.

5. Projected changes in required reserves reflect estimated seasonal movements in private
deposits, except as indicated in projections in Table B-2, and projected movements in U.S.

Government demand deposits. Government deposit projections are based on anticipated Treasury
receipts and expenditures and the following assumed financing operations: a $100 million

increase in the weekly Treasury bill auction on March 24 and March 31; $0.5 billion, March 25;
$0.4 billion, April 4: $0.5 billion, April 11.
