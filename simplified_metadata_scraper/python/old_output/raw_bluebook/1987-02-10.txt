created through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain. 
 

Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These

MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Recent Developments

(1) M2 and M3 accelerated in December, and growth remained close

to those higher rates in January; for the two months together, M2 advanced

at about a 9-1/2 percent annual rate and M3 at 9 percent1, both appreciably

faster than the 7 percent paths set by the FOMC for these aggregates for

the November-to-March period. M1 increased at about a 21 percent rate on

average over December and January. Growth of the monetary aggregates was

boosted over the two months by an unusually large volume of transactions

around year-end. An exceptional amount of churning in financial markets

and a surge in bank lending in late December were prompted in part by

incentives to complete certain types of transactions before provisions of

the new tax law took effect at the start of 1987. These developments were

associated with an unprecedented increase in demand deposits from mid-

December through early January; by late January the bulge in such deposits

had run off. In addition, banks stepped up their issuance of managed

liabilities, especially CDs, over the two months to help fund the rise in

credit.

(2) The retail components of the aggregates also strengthened in

the November-January period. Growth in OCDs, which may also have been

affected by year-end transactions, picked up in December and accelerated

further in January, reaching around a 40 percent rate last month. Growth

in retail nontransactions deposits in M2 increased as runoffs of time deposits

slowed. The opportunity costs of holding retail deposits have remained quite

low, though moving a bit higher over recent months in part as deposit offering

rates edged down.

(3) Boosted by the borrowing around year-end, total credit growth

of domestic nonfinancial sectors increased to around a 13 percent rate over

December and January. The extraordinary volume of business loan demand at

U.S. banks in this period resulted not only from tax-related transactions,

but also from a shift of credit demands from overseas branches and the commer-

cial paper market as short-term market rates rose sharply relative to the

prime rate; only a portion of the increase in commercial and industrial

loans was reversed over January. Overall short-term credit borrowing by

businesses was quite strong on a month-average basis in both December and

January. Mortgage pool issuance and bank real estate lending have remained

robust, likely reflecting brisk home sales and some substitution of home

equity lines for consumer credit. In the federal sector, tax receipts have

been lifted temporarily by the effects of tax law changes, and the Treasury

has reduced its borrowing by cutting back offerings at weekly bill auctions.

(4) Paralleling the bulge in transactions balances around year-

end, total reserve growth surged to 40 percent in December and then fell to

half that rate in January. Excess reserves also rose sharply in December;

deposit turnover likely was very high, and bank reserve management seemed

especially cautious in the face of unusual pressures in money markets and

the coincidence of the year-end with the end of a reserve maintenance period.

Allowance was made in open market operations for a large amount of excess

reserves over year-end, but the total exceeded $2 billion, a post-war

record. The funds rate spurted to daily averages of 14 to 16 percent on



the final two days of the year and borrowing climbed sharply to meet the

demand for reserves in the statement period ending December 31, averaging

$905 million, compared with the $300 million allowance used throughout the

intermeeting period in constructing the reserve path. Borrowing fell off

to $290 million in the next maintenance period, but rose in the maintenance

period ended January 28 to $462 million as a result of another unanticipated

strengthening in excess reserves. Even after year-end pressures subsided in

January, federal funds continued to trade at or above 6 percent, somewhat

higher than might earlier have been expected given the degree of reserve

pressure. Smaller banks in particular seem to have reduced their discount

window usage--both seasonal and adjustment--perhaps reflecting ample liquidity

and weak loan demand. Most recently, funds have tended to trade around 6

percent; borrowing has averaged $190 million through the first eight days of

the current statement period.

(5) Most other short-term rates rose around year-end as credit

demands intensified and the funds market tightened, but subsequently reversed

those increases, returning to close to their levels at the time of the last

FOMC meeting. Even so, short-term rates remain above their lows of last fall,

when federal funds were trading consistently below 6 percent. Long-term

yields have shown mixed changes over the intermeeting period, with Treasury

bond yields moving a little higher, while rates in the corporate and mortgage

markets have declined somewhat into more typical alignment with Treasury

rates. Although a drop in the dollar and stronger incoming economic data

have raised questions about the scope for a further easing in monetary

policy, some market participants still appear to hold the view that sluggish

growth in the industrialized countries could well prompt further easing

moves by spring. Stock prices soared to new highs over the intermeeting



period, boosted in part by the perceived potential for enhanced competitive-

ness of U.S. industry following the dollar depreciation.

(6) The dollar's exchange value has declined on balance by 6-1/2

percent on a trade-weighted average basis against G-10 currencies since the

last Committee meeting, with decreases of 8 percent against the German mark

and 6 percent against the yen. The dollar began to decline in the latter

part of December, and dropped sharply further after publication at the end

of December of preliminary U.S. trade figures for November, which showed a

much larger than expected deficit and seemed to underscore the slow pace of

adjustment of massive world current account imbalances. The Bundesbank's

announcement in late January of a discount rate cut and the improvement in

U.S. trade figures shown when December data were released, along with other

indications of a brighter outlook for the U.S. economy, have tended to relieve

downward pressures on the dollar, which has rebounded 3-1/4 percent from its

lows in late January.

. The Desk intervened to sell $50 million equivalent of yen for

U.S. account--equally shared by the System and the Treasury.



Long-run ranges

(7) The table below presents three alternative sets of ranges for

growth in the broad monetary aggregates and credit from the fourth quarter of

1986 to the fourth quarter of 1987. These alternatives encompass all the

possibilities discussed at the last FOMC meeting. The tentative ranges for

1987 announced by the Comittee last July are given in alternative II.

Alternative I specifies slightly more rapid expansion of M2 and M3, retaining

the 1986 growth ranges for these aggregates. Under both of these alternatives,

the range for the debt of domestic nonfinancial sectors is the same as the

tentative 1987 monitoring range for this aggregate set in July, which was

unchanged from 1986. Alternative III contemplates a further reduction in

all the ranges. M1 is discussed separately in paragraphs 14 to 16 below.

Alt. I Alt. II Alt. III
(Tentative
1987 ranges)

M2 6 to 9 5-1/2 to 8-1/2 5 to 8

M3 6 to 9 5-1/2 to 8-1/2 5 to 8

Nonfinancial Debt 8 to 11 8 to 11 7-1/2 to 10-1/2

(8) The staff's forecast for the economy in the greenbook is

believed consistent with a slowing of M2 growth in 1987--to around 7 percent.

In that forecast, nominal GNP growth of around 5-3/4 percent for the year

is expected to be accompanied by little net change in interest rates. A

7 percent growth of M2 would be the slowest rate of expansion of this

aggregate in over a decade, but each of the intervening years was marked

by factors--such as rapid income growth, declining market interest rates,



or major deposit deregulation--that are not anticipated this year. 1 Indeed,

growth of M2 at 7 percent would be at the upper end of the range of the

predictions of a number of conventionally specified M2 demand equations using

the staff's interest rate and income projections. Many of these equations

embody more rapid adjustments of deposit offering rates or of the public's M2

holdings in response to the previous narrowing of opportunity costs than the

staff views as likely given recent experience. In the staff forecast, velocity

would drop a little more than 1 percent in 1987, as shown in the chart on the

next page. Although this decline would be considerably smaller than in 1986,

it would leave V2 further below its historic range.

(9) M3 growth also would be expected to moderate in 1987--perhaps

to below 7 percent. Expansion of credit at banks and thrifts should slow in

line with debt expansion more generally, holding down needs to issue managed

liabilities in M3. Banks are likely to allow tax-exempt portfolios to decline

further under the new tax law, and their lending to businesses should taper

off as equity retirements abate and corporations concentrate borrowing on

longer-term markets. Tighter capital requirements should damp asset expansion

at thrift institutions. The securitization and sale of loans by depository

institutions is likely to continue to expand, facilitated in the case of

mortgages by the advent of REMICs under the new tax law. M3 expansion of

a little under 7 percent would imply around a 1 percent decline in velocity

that, as can be seen in the chart, would be about in line with its long-run

trend.

1. The provisions of the new tax law are not expected to affect M2 signifi-
cantly for the year 1987. IRAs for the 1987 tax year and beyond will be less
attractive alternatives to M2 forms of savings, but flows into these accounts
early this year could be especially strong to take full advantage of the
deductibility of contributions for 1986.

(10) The debt of domestic nonfinancial sectors is projected to

increase at about a 10 percent rate in 1987, a bit above the midpoint of

its tentative 8 to 11 percent monitoring range, but substantially below its

rate of growth in 1986. The moderation in the rate of increase in debt is

projected to occur primarily in the government sectors. Much of the decline

in federal government borrowing would reflect the decrease in the deficit;

in the state and local sector, however, debt issuance is expected to fall off

owing to reduced refunding activity, rather than any improvement in the under-

lying budget position. Business borrowing is expected to continue at about

the pace of 1986; the decline in equity retirements will be partly offset by

an increase in the need for external funds to finance investment. Household

borrowing likely will be restructured toward home equity loans and away from

traditional consumer credit, but the overall pace of borrowing should not be

greatly affected, and household debt levels will continue to climb relative

to income.

(11) With respect to the three alternatives for growth in the

broad aggregates, all would appear broadly consistent with moderate growth in

the economy accmpanied by only a modest pickup in inflation, given the

staff's assessment of the economic fundamentals and the factors affecting

money demand. Alternative III might be considered more appropriate to the

extent velocity growth was thought likely to return to previous trends, or

to rebound following its recent marked declines. For M2, such trend

velocity behavior is suggested by the results of many of the money demand

models, which indicate growth at or below the midpoint of this range.

Alternative III also might be considered more appropriate if the risks were

seen to be on the side of mounting inflation, resulting, say, from a further

substantial drop in the dollar feeding through into wage and price increases



-9-

more generally, augmented perhaps by pressures on resource utilization should

the trade balance turn around rapidly. Of all the alternatives, the ranges

of alternative III would imply the potential for the greatest restraint on

nominal income under those circumstances, in order to maintain progress

toward price stability. In particular, if upward movements of interest rates

were to accompany the tendency towards higher inflation, velocity could begin

to strengthen substantially, implying the need for growth in the lower alterna-

tive III ranges.

(12) Alternative I ranges, on the other hand, leave a little more

room to accommodate another substantial decline in velocity. Such an outcome

could arise from exceptionally strong demands for liquidity, given income and

interest rates, perhaps associated with continued brisk increases in total

financial assets. Or a sizable drop in velocity also could result from sub-

stantial declines in interest rates should they be needed to sustain economic

expansion, perhaps in the face of faltering growth worldwide or an absence of

any pressures in prices. The effects of any further rate declines on velocity

could be quite large if the adjustment of deposit rates remains very sticky.

Sizable interest rate decreases, especially if they occurred in the early

part of the year, might be enough to augment demands for broad money suffi-

ciently to threaten the upper ends of an 8 or 8-1/2 percent range later in

the year, potentially constraining policy at that time.

(13) Alternative II, embodying the Committee's tentative ranges,

could be seen as balancing these risks. The staff's expectations for M2

and M3 growth, around the middle of this alternative's ranges, suggest com-

parable odds of running either very high or very low in the range. The

alternative II range would provide for some restraint on income growth should

inflationary pressures tend to intensify, and the upper ends of the ranges



-10-

would allow further substantial declines in velocity should they materialize.

The downward adjustment of the ranges from 1986 to 1987 would convey the

Committee's sense that slower money growth over time will be necessary to

sustain and consolidate progress toward price stability. At least a modest

slowing of money growth in 1987 would be required under alternative II, given

that the upper ends of the ranges of this alternative are a little below

actual growth in 1986.

(14) M1 would be expected to slow from its extraordinary growth

of 1986 under the conditions in the staff economic forecast, though given

recent experience any M1 projections must be regarded as very uncertain. If

interest rates remain near current levels, as assumed in the forecast, demand

deposit growth is likely to be considerably below the pace of 1986; much of

the adjustment of compensating balances to the decline in rates last year

probably has already occurred, and conditions leading to a still higher

level of mortgage refinancings or another extraordinary burst in financial

transactions contributing to increases in demand balances are not anticipated.

An important source of uncertainty in the M1 projection is the behavior of

deposit offering rates and the public's further response to historically

narrow opportunity costs on these accounts. On the presumption that the

adjustment of NOW account rates is likely to continue to be very sluggish,

inflows to these accounts could remain substantial, tapering off gradually

over the year. On balance, M1 might grow in the neighborhood of 10 percent

in 1987--above the upper end of the Committee's very tentative 3 to 8 percent

range. Such growth would imply a velocity decline of around 4 percent, con-

siderably slower than in 1986, as shown in the chart on the next page. Given

the likely outcome for the first quarter, such growth would require expansion

at an average rate of around 8 percent over the balance of the year. Growth

for the year could exceed 10 percent, however, especially if opportunity

costs do not widen appreciably and depositors continue to shift large volumes

of funds to NOW accounts. On the other hand, econometric money demand models

generally are showing growth rates in the 5-1/2 to 7-1/2 percent range given

the staff's income and interest rate forecast. In the staff's quarterly

model this result rests importantly on a sharp fall-off in OCD inflows result-

ing from a continuing decline in offering rates and a marked response by the

public to the widening spread.

(15) In addition to uncertainties about offering rate behavior and

the public's attitude toward accumulating liquid assets, M1 probably will

remain extremely responsive to any further movements in market interest rates.

Available evidence suggests that a one point change in market rates from

current levels will result in about a 3 to 4 percentage point change in money

demand over a year--about three times the response of M2. Such a response,

along with the various other uncertainties affecting the outlook for M1 and

its velocity, suggest that if the FOMC were to establish a range for Ml, a

very wide range would be needed to encompass the same kinds of contingencies

as a 3 percentage point width for M2 and M3. An M1 range of six percentage

points, say of 7 to 13 percent centered on the staff's expectation, while

allowing for a variety of contingencies, would still seem to be more suscepti-

ble to being breached than the M2 and M3 ranges. Should rates rise sub-

stantially, velocity could advance strongly, implying a very weak M1 for a

given income growth; conversely a further decline in rates might imply another

substantial fall in velocity, with M1 continuing to increase at rates close

to those registered in 1986.

(16) Even so, specification of a numerical range for M1 could convey

in concrete form the Committee's expectations for acceptable growth over the



-12-

current year. It would provide a benchmark against which to evalute M1

behavior over the intermediate term, although the aggregate would need to

be interpreted together with other indicators. Another approach to an M1

range would be to put forth a lower range considered consistent with restora-

tion of more normal velocity relationships. It was on this basis that the

Committee established its tentative 3 to 8 percent range for 1987.

Short-run policy alternatives

(17) The table below presents three alternative specifications for

growth in the monetary aggregates through March, together with associated fed-

eral funds rate ranges. Growth rates are shown from a November base, as

chosen at the last meeting; growth rates from December to March, which are

shown in the table on the following page, are somewhat lower, reflecting the dis-

tortions to money stock levels at year-end.

M1 16-1/2 15-1/2 14-1/2

Associated federal
funds rate range 3 to 7 4 to 8 5 to 9

(18) The specifications of alternative B involve maintaining a

reserve path allowance for borrowing at the discount window of $300 million.

The federal funds rate would be expected to range around 6 percent, as it

has in recent days. With funds trading consistently in this area, the three-

month Treasury bill rate might edge back down toward 5-1/2 percent. Bond

rates would be expected to continue to fluctuate around current levels as

incoming economic indicators are likely to point to continued moderate

economic expansion. The dollar could well come under some renewed downward

pressure--given persistent large current account deficits.

(19) It now appears that maintenance of current conditions in

reserve markets under alternative B will be consistent with slightly more

rapid growth of the broad money aggregates over the November-to-March period

than foreseen at the last FOMC meeting, though within the upper bounds of the

growth cones associated with any of the long-run alternatives. M2 under

this alternative would be expected to slow substantially in February and

March from the average pace of recent months, but to expand at an 8 percent

rate over November to March, compared with the current short-run specification

of 7 percent. The year-end distortions seem to have unwound by February, and

growth over the balance of the quarter should reflect underlying influences

from income and interest rates. The increase in transactions balances is

expected to moderate substantially and smaller inflows to overnight RPs and

Eurodollars are likely following their recent surge. Nontransactions core

deposits should continue to outpace the growth of income as opportunity costs

remain quite low, especially on savings accounts, given the stickiness of

offering rates. The decline in M2 velocity is expected to moderate from

around a 5-1/2 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter to 3 percent in the

first.

(20) M3 under alternative B also is expected to slow in February

and March from the average pace of recent months as credit demands on banks

decrease sharply from elevated year-end levels, reducing needs to issue man-

aged liabilities. Overall credit growth should moderate as well, with domestic

nonfinancial debt expected to grow at an 8 percent rate over the balance of

the quarter. From the fourth quarter through March, debt would have expanded

at a 10 percent annual rate, in the upper part of any of the long-run

alternatives.

(21) The outlook for M1 growth continues to be highly uncertain

owing to both erratic demand deposit movements and the difficulty of assess-

ing the outlook for OCD growth at historically low opportunity costs. With

demand deposits already having retraced their run-up over year-end, this

component has begun to expand again. OCD growth is projected to moderate.



-16-

While this component accelerated in January, the opportunity cost of holding

NOW accounts has been widening since late summer, albeit slowly, and the

outflow of time deposits--one source of funds shifting to OCDs--is expected

to abate further. On balance, M1 growth would slow in February and March

under alternative B from the exceptional pace of recent months, although

continuing to outpace GNP by a substantial margin. In the first quarter, M1

velocity is projected to contract at about a 10 percent annual rate, after

falling at nearly a 14 percent rate in the fourth quarter.

(22) Alternative A assumes a reduction in discount window borrow-

ing to $150 million, a near-frictional level, or a one-half percentage point

cut in the discount rate with the borrowing allowance maintained at $300

million. In either case, the federal funds rate would move down to around

5-1/2 percent. Other short-term rates would decline by nearly this amount,

with the three-month bill dropping to close to 5 percent, as there appears

to be little market expectation of monetary easing in the period immediately

ahead. Downward pressure on the dollar would intensify, absent comparable

policy moves by central banks abroad. In the context of a weaker dollar, and

possibly greater concern about inflation, the scope for long-term rates to

fall might be limited; however, should the easing in money markets be followed

by economic indicators pointing to a weaker economy and less inflationary

pressure than is now expected, long-term rates would be more likely to fall

appreciably.

(23) Under alternative A, M2 growth would slow only moderately

from its pace of recent months and the level of M2 in March would be within

the alternative I long-run range, but near the upper end of the alternative

II range and above the alternative III growth cone. Similarly, the decelera-

tion in M3 would be less pronounced, although this aggregate in March would



-17-

be below even the upper end of its alternative III long-run range. Flows

into retail accounts are likely to strengthen even further, though this would

be muted to the degree that mounting cost pressures encouraged depository

institutions to no longer delay downward adjustments in offering rates on

retail deposits, especially OCDs and savings deposits. Absent a major adjust-

ment, M1 growth in March might return to close to the 15 percent path of

1986. M3 growth would be augmented by larger inflows to money market mutual

funds and heavier bank funding needs as businesses took down more bank loans,

especially if long-term rates did not register appreciable declines.

(24) Under alternative C, reserve paths would be drawn with a

borrowing level of $500 million, which would likely lead to a rise in the

federal funds rate to the 6-1/2 percent area. Such a policy move would

exert greater restraint on M2, bringing this aggregate well within even the

alternative III range. A relatively large widening of opportunity costs of

liquid retail accounts would act to damp expansion of M2 while reduced asset

growth at banks and thrifts would limit issuance of managed liabilities in

M3. Tighter reserve conditions also would raise the odds that M1 growth

would decelerate substantially in the months ahead.

(25) The three-month bill rate would rise by about 50 basis points

under this alternative and other short-term rates would rise by a similar

amount, absent any accompanying greater concern about debt-servicing diffi-

culties of bank debtors. Downward pressure on the dollar would be relieved,

at least for a while, and the exchange value of the dollar could even

strengthen temporarily. Bond rates would back up, but the extent of any rise

would be tempered by reduced pressure on the dollar and sentiment that such a

firming measure would act to check inflationary pressure.

Directive language

1987 Ranges

(26) Presented below for Committee consideration is draft

directive language relating to the decision on the longer-run ranges (draft

language for the operating paragraph is shown in (27) below). Suggested

deletions from the current directive are indicated in the usual strike-

through form 1/ and proposed additions are in caps. Language for the

broad monetary aggregates and debt is given in the first draft paragraph

below.

With respect to M1, two variants are presented. These variants

are drafted as separate paragraphs but, of course, could be combined with

the paragraph on broad money and debt. Both begin with the same sentence--

carried over from the current directive--relating to uncertainties in M1

behavior. In variant I the subsequent language is suggested if the Commit-

tee decided not to set a range for M1 in 1987. Language like that in the

first set of brackets could be used if the Committee wished to give some

general sense of its expectations with regard to M1 growth for the year and

1/ In addition to the language shown in strike-through form, the following
sentences concerning the 1986 growth of debt and the tentative ranges
for 1987 are suggested for deletion from the directive.

"Given its rapid growth in the early part of the year, the
Committee recognized that the increase in total domestic
nonfinancial debt in 1986 may exceed its monitoring range
of 8 to 11 percent, but felt an increase in that range would
provide an inappropriate benchmark for evaluating longer-term
trends in that aggregate.

For 1987 the Committee agreed on tentative ranges of monetary
growth, measured from the fourth quarter of 1986 to the fourth
quarter of 1987, of 5-1/2 to 8-1/2 for M2 and M3. While a range
of 3 to 8 percent for M1 in 1987 would appear appropriate in the
light of most historical experience, the Committee recognized
that the exceptional uncertainties surrounding the behavior of
M1 velocity over the more recent period would require careful
appraisal of the target range at the begining of 1987."



-19-

some indication of the possible implications, depending on circumstances,

of substantial deviations from expectations. Wording such as that pro-

posed in the second set of brackets could be used if the Committee

wished at the same time to indicate that more weight might be given to

M1 over time under appropriate circumstances. The variant II paragraph

is proposed in the event that the Committee were to decide to specify a

numerical growth range for M1, while also indicating the possibility

that growth above or below the range might be acceptable.

Language for the Broader Aggregates and Debt

The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial

conditions that will foster reasonable price stability over time,

promote growth in output on a sustainable basis, and contribute to

an improved pattern of international transactions. In furtherance

of these objectives the Committee [DEL: agreed at the July meeting to

reaffirm the ranges] established [DEL: in February for] growth RANGES OF

6-to-9 ____ TO ____ percent AND ____ TO ____ PERCENT for both M2 and M3,

RESPECTIVELY, measured from the fourth quarter of [DEL: 1985] 1986 to the

fourth quarter of [DEL: 1986] 1987. The associated range for growth in

total domestic nonfinancial debt was [DEL: provisionally] set at [DEL: 8 to 11]

____ TO ____ percent for 1987.



-20-

Variant I for M1

With respect to M1, the Committee recognized that, based on the

experience of recent years, the behavior of that aggregate is subject to

substantial uncertainties in relation to economic activity and prices,

depending among other things on the responsiveness of M1 growth to changes

in interest rates. In light of these uncertainties [DEL: and of the substantial

decline in-velocity-in the first-half-of-the-year,] the Committee decided

[DEL: that] NOT TO ESTABLISH A RANGE FOR THE growth of M1 IN 1987 AT THIS TIME

[DEL: in excess-of the-previously-established 3-to-8-percent range for 1986

would-be-acceptable. Acceptable-growth-of M1 over the remainder of the

year-would-depend on] M1 WILL BE EVALUATED IN LIGHT OF the behavior of

its velocity, developments in the economy and financial markets, and

price pressures. [THE COMMITTEE ANTICIPATES SLOWER M1 GROWTH IN 1987.

CONTINUED VERY RAPID GROWTH IN THIS AGGREGATE IS POSSIBLE, AND MIGHT

BE A MATTER OF CONCERN, PARTICULARLY IF IT OCCURRED IN THE CONTEXT OF

INTENSIFYING PRICE PRESSURES AND RAPID GROWTH IN THE BROAD MONETARY

AGGREGATES. CONVERSELY, MARKED WEAKNESS OF M1 COULD OCCUR AND MIGHT

BE ACCEPTABLE IN LIGHT OF THE EXTRAORDINARY EXPANSION OF THIS AGGREGATE

IN RECENT YEARS, ESPECIALLY IN CIRCUMSTANCES CHARACTERIZED BY RISING

INTEREST RATES AT A TIME WHEN THE ECONOMY AND PRICES WERE SHOWING

STRENGTH.] [THE BEHAVIOR OF M1 WILL BE REVIEWED DURING THE YEAR AND THE

WEIGHT PLACED ON THIS AGGREGATE OVER TIME WILL DEPEND ON THE EXTENT TO

WHICH ITS VELOCITY SEEMS TO BE RESUMING MORE PREDICTABLE PATTERNS.]



-21-

Variant II for M1

With respect to M1, the Committee recognized that, based on the

experience of recent years, the behavior of that aggregate is subject to

substantial uncertainties in relation to economic activity and prices,

depending among other things on the responsiveness of Ml growth to changes

in interest rates. [DEL: In light of these uncertainties and of the substantial

decline- in velocity in the first half of the year,] The Committee decided

that A RANGE OF ____ TO ____ PERCENT WOULD BE APPROPRIATE FOR THE GROWTH OF

M1 IN 1987, BUT IN LIGHT OF THE UNCERTAINTIES ASSOCIATED WITH THE BEHAVIOR

OF M1, GROWTH ABOVE OR BELOW THIS RANGE COULD (WOULD) BE ACCEPTABLE. [DEL: growth

of M1 in excessof the previously established 3 to 8 percednt range for

1986-would be acceptable. Acceptable growth of M1 over the remainder

of-the-year-would-depend on] M1 WILL BE EVALUATED IN THE LIGHT OF the

behavior of velocity, growth in the other monetary aggregates, develop-

ments in the economy and financial markets, and price pressures.

OPERATIONAL PARAGRAPH

(27) The proposed language conforms with that adopted at the

December meeting in that no expectations are indicated for M1 growth.

With regard to possible intermeeting adjustments in the degree of

reserve pressure, the usual wording alternatives are supplied should

the Committee wish to change the asymmetrical language of the latest

directive.

In the implementation of policy for the immediate future, the

Committee seeks to DECREASE SOMEWHAT (Alt. A)/maintain (Alt. B)/

INCREASE SOMEWHAT (Alt. C) the existing degree of pressure on

reserve positions. This action is expected to be consistent with

growth in M2 and M3 over the period from November (DECEMBER) to



-22-

March at an annual rate RATES of about [DEL: 7] ____ AND ____ percent,

RESPECTIVELY. Growth in M1 will continue to be appraised in the

light of the behavior of M2 and M3 and the other factors cited

below. Slightly (SOMEWHAT) greater reserve restraint or somewhat

(SLIGHTLY) lesser reserve restraint would (MIGHT) be acceptable

depending on the behavior of the aggregates, taking into account

the strength of the business expansion, developments in foreign

exchange markets, progress against inflation, and conditions in

domestic and international credit markets. The Chairman may call

for Committee consultation if it appears to the Manager for Domestic

Operations that reserve conditions during the period before the

next meeting are likely to be associated with a federal funds rate

persistently outside a range of [DEL: 4 to 8] ____ TO ____ percent.



APPENDIX

MONEY STOCK REVISIONS

Measures of the money stock have been revised to incorporate

annual benchmark and seasonal adjustments. This appendix discusses the

revisions and presents tables comparing growth rates of the old and new

series. These revisions are to be regarded as strictly confidential until

their scheduled release on February 12.

Benchmark Revisions

Deposits of commercial banks and thrifts have been benchmarked to

incorporate call reports through June 1986 as well as revisions from other

reports. The benchmark revisions had smaller effects on monetary growth

than was common in earlier years, owing largely to reporting improvements,

especially for RPs. The benchmark lowered growth in the broader aggregates

for 1986 slightly and had no net impact on M1 growth. M2 growth for the year

as a whole was reduced by 0.2 percentage point, while M3 growth was lowered

by 0.1 percentage point.

Seasonal Revisions

The seasonal factor review employed basically the same X 11-ARIMA

procedures that were used last year. Unlike past years, however, seasonally

adjusted M1 is now constructed by summing travelers checks, currency, demand

deposits and other checkable deposits (OCDs), each seasonally adjusted sepa-

rately. Owing to data limitations, seasonally adjusted OCDs previously had

been derived indirectly as the difference between seasonally adjusted trans-

actions deposits (demand deposits plus OCDs) and seasonally adjusted demand

deposits. M2 continues to be calculated by seasonally adjusting its non-M1

component as a whole, and M3 by adjusting its non-M2 component as a whole.



A-2

Seasonal factor revisions modified the pattern of growth within

1986, especially for M1 and M2. In particular, M1 and M2 growth early in the

year was raised while growth in subsequent months on balance was lowered.
