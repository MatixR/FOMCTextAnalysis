Prefatory Note 
 
 
The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version available 
based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the Board 
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was created 
through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned 
versions text-searchable.2   Though a stringent quality assurance process was 
employed, some imperfections may remain. 
 
Please note that some material may have been redacted from this document if that

1  In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic 
format.  All scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced 
tilting) and lightly cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other 
blemishes caused after initial printing). 
 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optical character recognition computer program (OCR) 
first created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, 
staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.  Please note that the numbers and text in charts and 
tables were not reliably recognized by the OCR process and were not checked or corrected by staff.

MONETARY AGGREGATES AND
MONEY MARKET CONDITIONS

Recent Developments

(1) Incoming data since the February FOMC meeting suggest

that M1 is growing at about a 6 per cent annual rate in the February-

March period, somewhat below the mid-point of its range. Continuing

strength in time deposits other than large CD's (particularly in savings

deposits) has sustained M2 growth. Over February-March, M2 is now expected

to expand at a little more than an 11 per cent annual rate, near the mid-

point of its range.

(2) Growth in total bank loans has remained quite modest, as

business demands for short-term credit have continued to be weak; business

loans at banks declined at a 5.3 per cent annual rate in February. Banks

have continued to allow CD's to run off in volume, as inflows of other

time and savings deposits have remained large. They have also added

further to their security holdings, particularly Treasury coupon issues

in the 1-5 year maturity area.

(3) Late in February, incoming data suggested that growth in

the aggregates was strengthening rather considerably. The rate of

expansion in M2 appeared to be at the upper limit of the range specified

by the Committee, and growth in M1 was above its mid-point. Accordingly,

the Desk decided to shade its Federal funds rate target from 4¾ per cent

to a 4¾--4-7/8 per cent range. However--with incoming information at

the time pointing to a strengthening of economic activity--banks over-

reacted to the Desk's willingness to permit some additional firming in

the money market, and for a while began bidding aggressively for Federal

funds. As a result, the effective funds rate was above 5 per cent on

several days of the statement week, and the average for the week rose

to 4.95 per cent. Subsequently, with additional data indicating that

growth in M1 and M2 over the February-March period might be well within

the ranges, the Desk has operated to return the funds rate to the 4¾ per

cent area.

(4) The firming in money market conditions at the end of

February, coupled with published data which at the time indicated a

substantial strengthening in the monetary aggregates, resulted in a

general advance of short-term rates of 1/8 to 1/2 a percentage point,

with the largest increases in the bill area. With the recent easing in

the funds market, however, short-term rates have dropped back, and are

now only about 10-25 basis points above levels prevailing at the time of

the February FOMC meeting. Bond market rates showed little net change

over the intermeeting period, as declines in late February--which carried



-3-

rates on some high quality corporate issues td their lowest levels in 2

years--were reversed in early March when short-term rates rose and the

forward calendar of new issues increased. Mortgage rates have edged down

slightly on balance recently, as deposit inflows at thrift institutions

have remained strong.

annual rates of change) selected monetary and financial flows over various

time periods.

Prospective developments

(6) Alternative shorter-run operating ranges for the monetary

aggregates and the Federal funds rate are summarized below for Committee

consideration. More detailed figures, as well as longer-run growth rates,

are shown in the tables on pp. 5a and 5b.

Federal funds rate 3¾ to 4¾ 4¼ to 5¼ 4¾ to 5¾
(intermeeting range)

(7) The Federal funds rate under alternative B is centered on

4¾ per cent, the funds rate level most recently sought by the Desk. Given

such a funds rate, over the March-April period M1 is expected to expand

in a 3½-7½ per cent annual rate range. Tax refunds are likely to con-

tribute somewhat to growth in demand deposits in March. As April progresses,

however, payments by the Treasury will probably be moderating and might be

more than offset by the public's drawing down balances that had been built

up by earlier refunds. Thus, M 1 growth during the March-April period is

expected to depend essentially on transactions demands associated with

the projected relatively rapid expansion in nominal GNP. Our expectation

for money growth over the next two months assumes some continued downward

shift in money demand.

(8) M2 under alternativeB is projected to rise in a 6-10

per cent annual rate range in the March-April period. Growth in time

deposits other than money market CD's is expected to slow from its

exceptional January-February pace, when inflows were being influenced by

the initial shift of funds in response to the decline in short-term

market rates to levels near or below 5 per cent. Nevertheless, such

deposits will probably grow at a still fairly substantial 11¼ per cent

annual rate over the March-April period. Short-term rates under alterna-

tive B would be expected to change little between now and the next

Committee meeting, although they could rise a bit toward the end of the

period, reflecting mid-April tax date pressures.

(9) The staff continues to believe that interest rates will

have to rise later in the year--perhaps beginning in late spring--if a

6 per cent rate of growth in M1 from QIV '75 to QIV '76 is to be achieved.

Under alternative B, we have assumed that the Federal funds rate will

average about 6½ per cent in the fourth quarter of 1976 .1/ This represents

somewhat less upward rate pressure than assumed in the previous blue

book, and reflects the need for a little more expansion in M1 over the

last three quarters of the year to make up for the fact that growth in

the first quarter of 1976 is now expected to be somewhat slower than

anticipated a month ago. Under these assumptions, M2 growth over the

period from QIV '75 to QIV '76 would be about 9¾ per cent--somewhat above

the mid-point of the Committee's one-year range.

(10) Alternatives A and C call for an easing and tightening

of the money market, respectively, in the period before the next

1/ See appendix table IV for long-run projections of the Federal funds
rate.



-7-

Committee meeting. Through the summer months, alternative A would

encourage somewhat more growth in M1 and M2, and alternative C less.than

would alternative B. But if M1 and M2 are to grow over the year. from

QIV '75 to QIV '76 at rates near the mid-points of their respective one-

year ranges, the near-term declines in interest rates anticipated under

alternative A would be short-lived, and rates would begin rising, perhaps

by late spring. We have assumed that under alternative A the funds rate

would average about 6¾ per cent in the fourth quarter of 1976. On the

other hand, the greater near-term restraint of alternative C would mean

that more monetary expansion would be required later in 1976 to achieve the

Committee's longer-run targets. Under this alternative, interest rates

would be likely to cease rising in late summer, with the funds rate

leveling out at around 6 per cent.

(11) The staff expects that under all three alternatives

business credit demands at banks would remain weak over the next month or

two and that the bank credit proxy will show relatively little growth.

Later in the year, as business working capital needs expand, business loan

demand on banks will probably pick up. In response, banks may begin to

raise funds in the CD market. However, the need to do so may be small

since we expect that flows into other deposits--though slowing somewhat as

the year progresses in reflection of rising market interest rates--will

be generally sufficient to finance demands on banks.

(12) The forward calendar for corporate and municipal bonds

appears to be relatively substantial over the next few weeks. In addition,



-8-

the Treasury may raise some cash through an offering of intermediate-

or longer-term coupon issues. Nevertheless, if the money market remains

stable--as is assumed under alternative B--long-term interest rates are

likely to remain around current levels in view of the strong institutional

investor interest in bonds that has developed since the beginning of the

year. A tightening of the money market, as contemplated under alternative

C, would probably cause some upward adjustment in long rates. Such a near-

term adjustment may be limited, however, if borrowers postpone scheduled

issues--as they may, since many of the issues now on the calendar had been

accelerated to take advantage of propitious market circumstances.



Proposed directive

(13) Given below is a proposed operational paragraph if the

Committee wishes to formulate its instructions in terms of desired growth

in monetary aggregates over the months ahead. No alternatives are pre-

sented for this formulation, in the expectation that the reference to

desired growth will be taken to apply to the longer-term targets and

that at this meeting the Committee will not reconsider those targets.

"Monetary aggregates" proposal

To implement this policy, while taking account of developments

in domestic and international financial markets, the Committee seeks

to [DEL: maintain prevailing] ACHIEVE bank reserve and money market condi-

tions CONSISTENT WITH MODERATE GROWTH IN MONETARY AGGREGATES over

the period [DEL:immediately] ahead [DEL: , provided that monetary aggregates

appear to be growing at about the rates currently expected.]

(14) Should the Committee desire to continue placing main

emphasis on bank reserve and money market conditions, the language

needed would depend on the specific conditions sought. Three alterna-

tive "money market" directives intended to correspond to the similarly

lettered policy alternatives are given below.
