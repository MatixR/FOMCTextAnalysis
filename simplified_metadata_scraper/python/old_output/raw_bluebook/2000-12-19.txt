MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

PREPARED FOR THE FEDERAL OPEN MARKET COMMITTEE

Class II -- FOMC

MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Recent Developments

(1) Market expectations about the future course of monetary policy were

revised down appreciably over the intermeeting period amid signs of weakening

growth in economic activity, deteriorating conditions in some segments of financial

markets, and public comments by monetary policy makers about the implications of

these developments. Judging by futures market prices, investors have cut their

forecasts of the federal funds rate at the end of 2001 about 1/2 percentage point since

the last FOMC meeting, to around 51/2 percent (chart 1). Most market participants

now expect the Committee to announce at this meeting that it sees the risks as evenly

balanced, and they appear more confident that the target federal funds rate will be

trimmed 25 basis points at the late-January meeting.' The shift in the economic and

policy outlook pulled down yields on nominal Treasury coupon securities 35 to 55

basis points. Yields on ten- and thirty-year inflation-indexed securities declined less,

1. The average effective federal funds rate was close to the 6-1/2 percent target over the
intermeeting period. The Desk redeemed $1.9 billion of Treasury securities to avoid
exceeding its per-issue limits on holdings. It offset the resulting reserve drain and
accommodated the seasonal demand for currency by purchasing $3.9 billion of Treasury
coupon securities in the market, acquiring $517 million of Treasury bills from foreign
customers, and increasing the volume of outstanding twenty-eight-day RPs by $7 billion, to
$21 billion.

about 10 basis points. The narrowing gap between nominal and indexed yields may in

part reflect a notable reduction in longer-term inflation expectations.

(2) The marking down of prospects for economic growth, along with

additional warnings and negative reports on corporate earnings, weighed on equity

prices and elevated risk spreads in securities markets, especially for firms with ratings

at or below the lower end of the investment-grade scale. However, much of the

marked drop in equity prices between the last FOMC meeting and the end of

November was rolled back following statements by Federal Reserve officials that

solidified expectations that policy would be eased in early 2001. On balance, broad

indexes of equity prices fell 3 to 13 percent. Yields on higher-rated investment-grade

bonds shed 40 to 50 basis points, in line with those on Treasury securities. Yields on

lower-rated investment-grade issues were down somewhat less, bringing the total

increase in their spreads over the highest-quality corporate rate to about 3/4 percentage

point this year. Yields on junk bonds rose 20 basis points over the intermeeting

period; their risk spreads widened 70 basis points, for a cumulative increase of nearly

3 percentage points since year-end 1999. Wariness about credit risk also became

much more apparent in money markets. In the commercial paper market, rate

spreads between top- and second-tier issues jumped 20 to 85 basis points on balance.

The largest increase occurred at the one-month maturity, reflecting the inclusion of a

considerable premium for taking on risk over the year-end as the maturity date of the



3

paper moved into 2001. Spreads also widened for paper whose maturity dates did not

cross over into next year.

(3) Business financing strengthened appreciably in November from its

depressed level in October, but its composition reflected the disparate market

conditions for high- and low-rated firms. Gross issuance of investment-grade

corporate bonds surged as their yields fell and investors remained receptive to such

offerings. In contrast, junk bond issuance was anemic. Gross equity issuance also

rose, but was concentrated in seasoned, rather than initial, offerings. Bank lending to

businesses remained subdued, perhaps reflecting weak capital spending as well as the

more stringent lending standards and terms reported by banks over recent quarters.

In the household sector, total consumer credit continued to grow at a moderate pace

in October, down from the rapid increases of earlier this year; available data from

banks for November do not suggest additional slowing. The decline in mortgage rates

since the spring appeared to support residential mortgage growth. Federal debt

continued to contract.

(4) M2 growth sagged to a 2-3/4 percent annual rate in November, down from

4-1/2 percent in October, but partial data for December suggest a bounceback

2. Generally, year-end premiums for low-rated borrowers are as large as those in 1998 and
1999, which were periods of especially marked uncertainty characterized by elevated
demands for safe and liquid investments and very high year-end premiums. In contrast,
those for high-rated borrowers are even lower than in 1996 and 1997, when year-end
premiums were more typical.



4

(chart 2).3 Growth over October and November was much weaker than in the

preceding two months, likely in response to the slower growth of income and

spending since midyear. M2 growth may have received a boost going into December

from temporary outflows from bond and equity mutual funds in the final weeks of

November. Growth of M3 slowed less than that of M2 in November, in part owing

to increased issuance of large time deposits as banks reduced their reliance on net

borrowing from overseas offices. Even so, the expansion of M3 has been relatively

sluggish in the past two months, reflecting the slow growth of bank credit.

(5) With perceptions mounting that growth of economic activity in the

major foreign industrial countries-especially those in the euro area-was generally

cooling by less than in the United States, yields on the longer-term government

obligations of these countries fell somewhat less than those on U.S. Treasury

securities over the intermeeting period. The foreign exchange value of the dollar

declined about 1-1/4 percent against a basket of the major currencies, stemming largely

from losses of 3-1/4 percent and 1-3/4 percent, respectively, vis-à-vis the euro and the

Canadian dollar. A national election in Canada in late November decisively

strengthened the ruling party's parliamentary majority and helped buoy the Canadian

dollar. By contrast, weaker-than-expected economic data, stalled business sentiment,

and political uncertainties in Japan weighed on the yen, which depreciated 4 percent

on net against the U.S. dollar.4

(6) Vulnerabilities in several emerging markets contributed to a 1/2 percent

appreciation of dollar's value against an index of the currencies of our other important

trading partners over the intermeeting period. Banking sector problems in Turkey led

to difficulty in maintaining that country's crawling foreign exchange peg. Overnight

rates temporarily moved into the four-digit range to staunch capital flight, and

Turkish longer-term risk spreads rose more than 200 basis points on balance over the

intermeeting period. Concerns about weakness in the high-tech sector depressed

financial markets in many Asian emerging market economies, especially in Korea and

Taiwan. While the government of Argentina moved closer to enacting fiscal reforms,

risk spreads on its debt remained elevated. Moreover, spreads on Brazilian and

Mexican debt widened a little, suggesting some regional spillover of investor concerns.

Still, global investors apparently distinguished among differing risks, and the overall

emerging market bond spread rose only slightly, on net, over the intermeeting period.

intervened in dollars over the intermeeting period.

Policy Alternatives

(7) In light of weaker-than-expected economic data, a further tightening of

financial conditions for riskier firms, and somewhat lower equity prices, the staff has

marked down substantially its forecast of the path of spending. Output growth is

projected to be especially soft in the near term, reflecting inventory adjustments in

some industries as well as weaker spending on high-technology products. But, with

the federal funds rate unchanged, economic growth returns to a pace not far below

the growth of potential in 2002, buoyed by lower oil prices, the declining value of the

dollar, and more stimulative fiscal policy. Pressures in labor markets ease over the

projection period, with the unemployment rate rising to 5 percent by the final quarter

of 2002-in the neighborhood of the staffs estimate of the short-run NAIRU at that

time. Core consumer inflation is flat over the forecast period, albeit at a rate a bit

above the average pace of the past couple of years, as the indirect effects of lower oil

prices offset the effects of a weaker dollar and, over the first part of the period, still

notable pressure on resources.

(8) If the Committee shares the staffs assessment of the economic

fundamentals and views a period of subpar economic growth as not only likely but

also necessary to stabilize core inflation, it might prefer the unchanged federal funds

rate of alternative B. In addition, recent substantial revisions to the near-term

outlook may suggest that the economic situation is quite fluid and that the degree of



8

conviction about any particular outcome is relatively low. Leaving policy unchanged

would provide time for more evidence to accumulate that could potentially clarify the

outlook for spending and productivity growth. Of course, this benefit must be

weighed against the potential costs of inaction. In the current circumstances, the

Committee may view economic conditions as implying that the potential costs of

inaction at this meeting would be lower than usual if economic outcomes turn out

differently than now anticipated. On the one hand, in the event of somewhat slower-

than-expected economic growth going forward, the quicker dissipation of labor

market pressures resulting from a short delay in easing policy might not be

unwelcome, given that labor markets are very tight and inflation is probably at the

high end of the range that might be considered acceptable in the long run. If, on the

other hand, pressures on prices intensify because economic growth rebounds more

promptly than expected or unit labor costs accelerate, then the Committee should

have sufficient time to react before higher inflation becomes entrenched because long-

term inflation expectations appear to be firmly anchored.

(9) If the Committee is not yet convinced that growth is likely to move

enough below potential to offset continuing, though probably reduced, concerns that

inflation will pick up, it may choose to retain the balance of risks statement weighted

toward heightened inflation pressures. However, the Committee might see the changes to

the outlook since its last meeting as large enough to justify a shift to a statement of



9

balanced risks or even one tilted toward economic weakness. Even if inflation still seems

likely to edge higher, the weaker outlook for economic activity should reduce the

acceleration in prices. And with output growth expected to be slower than potential,

the Committee may at the same time have equal or greater concerns about achieving

its other goal of sustainable economic growth. As already noted, in the staff forecast a

flat nominal funds rate is sufficient to cap core consumer inflation at a rate a bit above

its level of recent years and to raise the unemployment rate to the neighborhood of its

natural rate, perhaps suggesting approximately balanced risks.5 However, with

expectations of growth in productivity and earnings evidently moving lower,

equilibrium real interest rates likely have fallen in recent months, perhaps by more

than implied by the staff forecast, suggesting higher odds of excessive economic

weakness if the current stance of policy were maintained. Moreover, incoming data

on spending, combined with the tightening of conditions in financial markets and

deteriorating consumer sentiment, may also signal that there is an increased downside

asymmetry to the outlook for aggregate demand.

5. Ordinarily, one might expect that, with inflation unchanged, the real federal funds
rate would be reduced as the unemployment rate rose, in order to minimize
overshooting. But, the staff forecast is consistent with the real funds rate implicitly
being in the neighborhood of its equilibrium level. In that case, the rise in the
unemployment rate would represent a lagged adjustment to the previous increase of
the real funds rate to that level, rather than the effects of a relatively high funds rate.



10

(10) While financial market participants expect policy to be eased early in

2001, they do not expect such an action at this meeting. They do anticipate that the

Committee will move to a statement of balanced risks, which would be seen as

opening up the possibility of a shift in the stance of policy in the near term. Given

these expectations, the choice of alternative B with a statement of balanced risks

should have little effect on financial markets. If the Committee instead reiterated that

the risks are weighted toward increased inflation pressures, investors likely would push

back the timing and reduce the odds and likely extent of easier policy next year. In

that case, interest rates and the value of the dollar on foreign exchange markets would

move higher, and equity prices would decline. By contrast, if the Committee

announced that risks were weighted toward economic weakness, investors likely

would increase the amount and move forward the timing of expected easing going

forward. Bond and equity markets would rally, and the value of the dollar likely

would decline. With the Federal Reserve seen as alert for signs of economic

weakness, the response of markets to incoming data that pointed in that direction

might be accentuated.

(11) If the Committee thinks that output growth is likely to slow appreciably

more than envisioned in the staff forecast, then it might choose the 25 basis point

easing of alternative A. Such an assessment of growth prospects might reflect

concern that the reduced pace of economic expansion, additional financial difficulties,



11

and weaker earnings growth could be in the process of eroding consumer and

business sentiment and tightening financial conditions more than in the Greenbook.

In this circumstance, a prompt easing of policy, by bolstering asset values and

confidence, might help short-circuit this interactive process. Easier policy also might

be in order if the Committee believes output growth along the lines of the staff

forecast is likely, but reads the evidence as suggesting a considerably higher sustainable

level of output, and hence a correspondingly lower NAIRU, than estimated by the

staff. Under these circumstances, even if the Committee thinks that some reduction

in the level of demand on productive resources is appropriate, it might want to ease

policy slightly now given both the lags with which changes in policy influence the

economy and the substantial rise in the unemployment rate projected by the staff.

(12) With no policy move expected at this meeting, adoption of alternative A

would presumably trigger a rally in bond and stock markets and a decline in the

foreign exchange value of the dollar. The size of the resulting moves in asset markets

would depend on the accompanying statement of the balance of risks. If the

Committee announced that it believed risks to be in balance, investors could well

interpret the easing as the Committee "buying insurance" against a possible further

weakening of growth. Such an action would probably be viewed as mostly bringing

forward in time policy actions that market participants already anticipate, but the

effects in financial markets still would be substantial. An even larger effect could be



12

expected if the Committee instead announced that risks appeared to be weighted

toward economic weakness, as investors came to expect a greater cumulative easing of

policy.

(13) If the Committee judges that core inflation already has moved above the

range consistent with effective price stability, and that the prospects for a reversal

given the current stance of policy are small, then it might be inclined to tighten policy

25 basis points, as in alternative C. Such a move might appear more attractive if

output growth were seen as unlikely to slow by as much as in the staff forecast,

perhaps because the Committee believes that equity investors have already taken

reduced earnings prospects into account, and so views equity prices as more likely to

resume at least a gradual uptrend than to be flat as in the staff forecast. Moreover, the

Committee may be concerned about the upside risks to labor costs that could result

from workers either attempting to reverse the hit to real wages that has resulted from

higher energy prices or to catch up with previous increases in productivity at a time

when the acceleration in productivity may have ended.

(14) A policy tightening at this meeting would come as a considerable

surprise. Even if the Committee shifted to a statement of balanced risks, expectations

of policy easing likely would be reduced appreciably, and so the expected path of the

federal funds rate would be significantly higher. Bond and stock prices would fall, and

the dollar likely would rise. Risk spreads probably would widen further as



13

expectations of higher interest rates and slower growth boosted market participants'

concerns about debt repayment problems.

(15) Under the staff forecast, credit conditions are expected to tighten only a

little further, and primarily for marginal borrowers. While markets remain receptive to

better credits, business borrowing from November to March is anticipated to be at a

pace well below that of earlier this year. Growth in investment slows, but so too does

growth in internal funds, and the stepdown in borrowing is attributable to slower

accumulation of liquid assets and reduced merger activity by those firms facing less

accommodative credit conditions. Household debt growth also should decline, as

spending on durables increases more slowly than it has in recent years. Federal

surpluses result in further substantial paydowns of Treasury debt. All told, the debt of

domestic nonfinancial sectors is projected to advance at about a 4-3/4 percent annual

rate through March of next year, a bit below the growth in nominal GDP.

(16) From November through March, M2 is projected to expand at a

4-1/2 percent annual rate, somewhat above the surprisingly slow pace of the last two

months. The pickup brings growth in M2 close to that of spending, reflecting in part

the waning of the effects of previous tightenings. M3 growth is expected to rebound

from its lows in October and November as bank credit growth picks up. However,

with the expansion of bank credit seen as fairly weak in the months ahead, M3 is

projected to advance at a rate well below that of earlier in the year.

Directive and Balance-of-Risks Language

(17) Presented below for the members' consideration is draft wording for (1)

the directive and (2) the balance-of-risks sentence to be included in the press release

issued after the meeting.

(1) Directive Wording

around ____ 6-1/2 percent.

(2) Balance-of-Risks Sentence

Against the background of its long-run goals of price stability and

sustainable economic growth and of the information currently available, the

Committee believes that the risks [ARE BALANCED WITH RESPECT TO

PROSPECTS FOR BOTH GOALS] [continue to be weighted mainly toward

conditions that may generate heightened inflation pressures] [ARE

Appendix

Review of Debt and Money Growth in 2000

A surging economy resulted in rapid growth of the debt and the monetary aggregates
over the first half of the year, but the expansion of credit and money eased in the second half
of the year as the pace of economic growth slowed markedly. Financial flows were also
influenced by the tightening of monetary policy from mid-1999 through May of this year and
by greater risk aversion shown by lenders toward the end of the year.

Domestic Nonfinancial Sector Debt

Aggregate debt of domestic nonfinancial sectors grew 5-1/4 percent over 2000, a
considerable slowdown from the almost 7 percent gains posted in 1998 and 1999.6 Some of
this slowdown is attributable to the federal government, which paid down 6-3/4 percent of its
debt, compared with 2-1/2 percent last year. In addition, nonfederal debt growth moderated,
falling to 8-1/2 percent from a 9-1/2 percent pace last year.

Business debt expanded strongly over the first half of 2000, propelled by rapid
growth in capital spending, even as actual and anticipated monetary policy tightening pushed
corporate borrowing rates higher, and by share repurchases and cash-financed merger
activity. In the second half of the year, however, business borrowing slowed appreciably, as
firms trimmed the pace of investment spending. Prospects for weaker economic growth, in
combination with a substantial rise in the default rate on junk bonds and in repayment
difficulties in the syndicated loan market, apparently caused lenders to reassess credit risks.
Increasingly large fractions of banks firmed terms and standards on business loans over the
course of the year, and financing conditions in the corporate bond market tightened
significantly for issuers with lower credit ratings. Spreads between high-yield and
investment-grade corporate bonds soared late in the year to levels above those seen in the
fall of 1998. This widening was accompanied by substantial outflows from high-yield bond
funds and a sharp cutback in junk bond issuance. Firms also had greater difficulty raising
funds in the equity market, as the increased volatility of stock prices and the substantial drop
in valuations in some sectors caused IPOs to fall off later in the year.

Growth in commercial mortgage debt slowed somewhat this year, to an estimated
rate of 9-1/2 percent. Fundamentals in the commercial real estate market appeared to remain
solid, and delinquency rates on commercial mortgages stayed around their historic lows.

In the household sector, consumer credit grew rapidly in the first half of the year,
boosted by continued strength in spending on durable goods, but slowed some in the second

previous year to the fourth quarter of the current year using staff projections.



half as the expansion of consumer spending cooled. Growth in home mortgage debt over
the year was relatively strong, easing only modestly from last year's pace. In total, household
debt increased 8-3/4 percent in 2000, well above the expansion in disposable personal income.
As a result, the household debt service burden rose further to a level just below the previous
peak in the mid-1980s. Nevertheless, there was little deterioration in the performance of
household loans, as delinquency rates on home equity loans, mortgage credit, and consumer
credit edged only slightly higher. Household net worth relative to disposable income
declined over the year as a result of falling equity prices, in contrast to the strong increases of
recent years. Despite the considerable volatility in equity markets, households continued to
accumulate equity mutual funds, favoring capital appreciation over less risky types of funds.

Growth of state and local government debt was anemic in 2000. Gross issuance of
long-term municipal bonds was well below the robust pace of the past two years, as
refunding offerings were held down by higher interest rates and the need to raise new capital
was limited by strong tax revenues. Net issuance was also damped by paydowns of
previously advance-refunded bonds. Credit quality in the municipal market improved
considerably this year, with credit upgrades outnumbering downgrades by a substantial
margin, except in the not-for-profit health care sector.

The federal government paid down debt at a rapid pace, as the budget surplus for
fiscal 2000 rose to $237 billion. To maintain large, regular issues of new securities in order to
preserve their liquidity, the Treasury initiated a debt buyback program and repurchased
$30 billion par value of outstanding bonds over the year. The prospect of a considerable
reduction in the supply of Treasury debt over coming years appeared to pull down Treasury
yields relative to private yields and to contribute to an abrupt inversion of the Treasury yield
curve early in the year. By the end of fiscal 2000, the stock of marketable Treasury debt had
fallen about $1/2 trillion from its peak in 1997. Through 1999, nonfederal debt had expanded
enough to more than replace the reduction in Treasury debt, so that the ratio of overall
nonfinancial debt to GDP actually rose modestly. This ratio fell in 2000, however, as the
Treasury debt paydown accelerated and corporate borrowing slowed.

Depository Credit

Depository institutions continued to play an important role in meeting the demand
for credit by businesses and households, as depository credit grew more strongly than total
nonfinancial debt over 2000. Depository credit expanded rapidly through late summer,
reflecting strong loan demand by households and businesses as well as a willingness of banks

debt), Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac continued their efforts to offer liquid alternatives to
Treasury securities. The outstanding stock of notes and bonds issued under the agencies'
Benchmark and Reference programs surpassed $300 billion. In addition, each firm had more
than $100 billion of bills outstanding under those programs.



to extend large volumes of credit given their ample capital base, solid profits, and
expectations that the economy would continue to grow strongly. In the last four months of

the year, however, depository credit growth declined appreciably, as household lending
slowed to a moderate pace and business lending nearly dried up. Several banks also shed
large amounts of government securities over that period.

Increasing proportions of domestic banks tightened standards and terms on business
loans as the year progressed, with the share in the fourth quarter reaching the highest level
since November 1991. Banks reportedly tightened credit conditions most aggressively on
riskier loans, likely concerned by the continued rise in delinquency and charge-off rates on
C&I loans. The tightening was also more severe for large and middle-market firms; fewer
banks reported firming standards and terms for small businesses, consistent with surveys of
small businesses indicating that few were having much difficulty obtaining credit. Most
banks did not tighten credit conditions significantly for household loans.

Monetary Aggregates

M3 expanded 8/4 percent this year, above the 7-3/4 percent pace in 1999. Growth
again outpaced that of nominal income, and M3 velocity declined for the sixth year in a row.
The increase in M3 was particularly robust over the first three quarters, as banks used the
managed liabilities in this aggregate to help fund the rapid expansion of bank credit.
Institutional money funds also grew briskly despite the tightening of policy early in the year.
M3 growth receded in the final months of the year, as the flattening of bank credit led to a
drop in the issuance of managed liabilities.

M2 grew about 6 percent in 2000, down modestly from 6-1/4 percent in 1999. In part,
the deceleration reflected the impact of rising short-term interest rates, which increased the
opportunity cost of holding M2. The behavior of M2 over the year was largely consistent
with the relationship between its velocity and opportunity cost observed over recent years.
The depressing effects of higher interest rates were most apparent in the liquid deposit
components, whose rates respond very sluggishly to movements in market rates. Growth in
small time deposits and retail money market mutual funds, whose rates do not lag market
rates as much, was considerably stronger. Currency growth was held down early in the year
by a run-off of balances that had been elevated by Y2K concerns, and it has remained
surprisingly sluggish over the remainder of the year, apparently reflecting weakness in both
domestic and foreign demand.
