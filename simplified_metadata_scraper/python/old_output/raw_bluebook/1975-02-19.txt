Prefatory Note 
 
 
The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version available 
based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the Board 
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was created 
through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned 
versions text-searchable.2   Though a stringent quality assurance process was 
employed, some imperfections may remain. 
 
Please note that some material may have been redacted from this document if that

Recent developments

(1) M1 contracted at an annual rate of about 9½ per cent in

January, and, with recent data suggesting only modest growth in February,

a net contraction in M1 during the two-month target period now seems

likely, as the table shows. Flows into time deposits other than money

market CD's have been generally well sustained, but, with M1 weak,

1/ These figures do not incorporate the regular quarterly benchmark revision
of monetary aggregates that will be published this coming Thursday.
Revisions in the series (based in large part on the October call report)
were relatively minor; the December level for M was raised by about
$500 million and the rate of growth for M1 in 1974 was raised from 4.6 to
4.7 per cent. All tables on subsequent pages of this report (with the
exception of Tables 1 and 2 following the charts) are based on the new

series. The new and old series are compared in appendix table V .

2/ The range shown reflects the reduction in the lower limit from 6½ per
cent on February 6.



-2-

M2 appears to be growing at only about a 4½ per cent annual rate in the

January-February target period--also well below the lower end of the

Committee's range of tolerance. In the face of continued weak loan

demands, banks have reduced their reliance on non-deposit sources of

funds since year-end and have not pressed aggressively to issue large

CD's. As a result, the bank credit proxy is expected to show very little

growth during the January-February period.

(2) Immediately after the January FOMC meeting, the Account

Manager began providing reserves with a view to achieving an average

Federal funds rate around 7 per cent. When incoming data showed the

monetary aggregates expanding at annual rates below the lower ends of the

Committee's ranges of tolerance, however, the Desk moved to ease money

market conditions. As a result, by the statement week ending February 5,

the prevailing funds rate had declined to about 6½ per cent, the lower

limit of the range of tolerance agreed upon at the January meeting. On

February 5, the Committee concurred in the Chairman's recommendation to

reduce the lower limit of the funds rate constraint to 6¼ per cent, and

in the statement week just ended the average rate was 6.28 per cent,

As the funds rate dropped, member banks reduced borrowings from the

discount window further to near minimal levels; in the first two weeks

of February such borrowing averaged about $95 million--more than half

of which was special, longer-run borrowing--as compared with an average

of around $400 million in January.



-3-

(3) The further decline in the Federal funds rate, and the

February 3 reduction in the discount rate to 6¾ per cent, have contributed

to sharp reductions in other short-term interest rates as well. These

declines have ranged generally from 50 to 100 basis points since the last

Committee meeting. Rates on private short-term instruments have registered

the largest changes and are now 200-300 basis points below their year end

levels. The 3-month Treasury bill has traded most recently around 5.45

per cent. Although the rate on prime business loans at leading banks

has also been reduced during the inter-meeting period, the level now

prevailing at most key banks is 8¾ or 9 per cent; this is high relative

to the 6-3/8 per cent rate on 90-119 day commercial paper.

(4) The large inter-meeting declines in short-term rates

have contributed to a strong rally in long-term securities markets. As

a result, yields on corporate and municipal bonds are now 40-60 basis

points below their mid-January levels. In the market for longer-term

Treasury issues, yields have also moved lower, notwithstanding the

Treasury's enlargement of its February refinancing to raise new money

and the very heavy volume of Federal deficit financing forecast for the

weeks and months ahead by the new Federal Budget. The new note and

bond issues offered in the Treasury refinancing were all well received

and have most recently traded at premiums as much as 1 point above the

average prices at which they were initially auctioned.

(5) Savings flows to non-bank thrift institutions--like those

to banks--have displayed significant growth in January. However, with

mortgage demands remaining weak, these expanded flows have been used

for the most part to repay debt and rebuild liquid asset holdings. The



-4-

growth in savings flows, along with the continued modest volume of new

mortgage demands and the general decline in other interest rates, has

resulted in further reductions of some 40 basis points in conventional

mortgage rates since the turn of the year.

(6) The table on the following page shows (in percentage

annual rates of change) selected monetary and financing flows over various

recent time periods. Appendix table III compares money supply growth rates

computed on a quarterly-average basis with those computed on a last-

month-of-quarter basis. Projected figures on the two bases are shown in

Appendix table IV for the alternatives presented in the next section.

nominal GNP. In particular a rebound in money demand is anticipated

for the weeks immediately ahead following the unusually large contraction

of recent weeks--an expectation that is supported in some degree by the

early February data. Thus, M1 growth is expected to be fairly sub-

stantial under any of the alternatives in the February-March period.

(9) Of the alternatives shown, alternative A encompasses the

6 per cent annual growth rate for M1 specified by the Committee at its

last meeting in its longer-run targets for the first half of '75. This

alternative also shows a 9¾ per cent growth rate for M2, slightly higher

than the rate specified by the Committee last time. The projected

relationship between M 1 and M2 is changed because a further decline in

market interest rates is now assumed to be necessary if the indicated

M1 growth rate is to be attained by mid-year, and that should result

in larger inflows of consumer-type time and savings deposits.

(10) Given the January shortfall in M1 and the sharply weaker

economy now projected by the staff for the first and second quarters

of this year, we would expect it to be necessary for the Federal funds

rate to decline to around the middle of a 4-5 per cent range between now

and mid-March if the growth in the aggregates as shown under alternative

A were to be attained. Some further decline in the funds rate might be

needed by early spring.

(11) So steep a drop in interest rates would have a very

substantial cumulative impact on the demand for money, narrowly and

broadly defined. By the second quarter, the staff would expect M1 growth,

for example, to be at about a 10 per cent annual rate, and to accelerate

further in the third quarter when a sharp recovery in GNP is projected.



-8-

Thus, over the first nine months of the year, this alternative implies

an 8 per cent annual rate of growth in M1. If the Committee should wish

to get back on the 6 per cent growth trend after mid-year, a sharp rise

in interest rates would be necessary during the late spring and summer.

(12) The specifications of alternative B involve attainment

of a 6 per cent rate of growth in M1 by September, rather than by mid-

year. With the target horizon stretched out, interest rates are likely

to decline more moderately over the near-term, and the later upward

movement is likely to be more delayed and probably less sharp. The

annual growth rate for M1 over the first half of this year under

this alternative would be around 4½ per cent, while M2 would expand

at about a 7½ per cent rate.

(13) Alternative B contemplates a further decline in the

Federal funds rate over the next few weeks to about the middle of a

4¾-5¾ per cent range. Further significant declines in the funds rate

in the spring may not prove necessary, assuming that GNP is no weaker

than projected for the first half of this year and that the sharp

expansion in economic activity projected for the third quarter develops.

(14) Private short-term credit demands are expected to remain

weak into early spring, but the Treasury is likely to borrow an additional

$15-$18 billion of new cash between now and mid-April. The provision of

bank reserves and easing of money market conditions needed to sustain

growth in the monetary aggregates, as specified in alternative B, should,

at least over the near-term, permit the new Treasury debt to be absorbed

at declining interest rates, though the reductions may be modest. The



-9-

3-month bill rate could drop by about ½ percentage point to around

5 per cent between now and the next Committee meeting. Given the

shift in borrowing demands from private sectors to the Treasury,

private short-term rates may decline more. Longer-term rates may

show rather modest further declines, however, since corporate and state

and local government demands on bond markets are expected to remain

sizable.

(15) Alternative C contemplates a smaller reduction in the

funds rate than alternative B and hence a less rapid growth in the

monetary aggregates between now and the end of summer. Under this

alternative, M1 is indicated to expand at an annual rate of about

5 per cent over the first nine months of the year. By the time the

year is over, M1 may have grown at near a 6 per cent rate under this

alternative if economic activity in the second half of the year turns

out to be as strong as projected in the Green Book.

(16) Under alternative C, the funds rate would be expected

to decline to around 6 per cent--the mid-point of the range shown

in paragraph (7)--or a little below, between now and the next Committee

meeting. Such a decline is probably not much more than the market has

already discounted. As a result, interest rates may decline little

further over the next few weeks under this alternative. Moreover,

the weight of Treasury financings could place upward pressure on the

rate structure rather soon.



-10-

(17) Under alternative D, which involves money market

conditions in the neighborhood of those prevailing on average in the

period since the last meeting, M 1 would grow at a rate of about 4 per

cent over the first nine months of the year. If the funds rate was

around the 6½ per cent mid-point of the range shown for that alternative,

market rates would probably rise--possibly sharply in the Treasury

market--in the weeks immediately ahead. Net inflows of savings to

thrift institutions would not be likely to strengthen from their

recent pace, and might slacken somewhat--which would tend to limit

the extent of recovery in housing. In general, prospective market

developments under this alternative may have implications for the

projected pattern of economic recovery in the second half of the year.



-11-

Proposed directive

(18) Presented below are four alternative formulations for

the operational paragraph of the directive, which are intended to

correspond to the similarly lettered policy alternatives discussed in

the preceding section. In all four alternatives, it is proposed to

delete the reference to Treasury financing--because the quarterly financing

announced on January 22 has been completed--and the Board's action on

reserve requirements.

Alternative A

To implement this policy, while taking account of the

[DEL: forthcoming Treasury financing,] developments in domestic and

international financial markets, [DEL: and the Board's action on

reserve requirments,] the Committee seeks to achieve bank

reserve and money market conditions consistent with more rapid

growth in monetary aggregates over the months ahead than has

occurred in recent months.

Alternative B

To implement this policy, while taking account of [DEL: the

forthcoming Treasury financing,] developments in domestic and

international financial markets, {DEL: and the Board's action on

reserve requirements,] the Committee seeks to achieve bank

reserve and money market conditions consistent with SOMEWHAT

more rapid growth in monetary aggregates over the months ahead

than has occurred in recent months.



-12-

Alternative C

To implement this policy, while taking account of [DEL: the

forthcoming Treasury financing,] developments in domestic and

international financial markets, [DEL: and the Board's action on

reserve requirements,] the Committee seeks to achieve bank

reserve and money market conditions consistent with [DEL: more rapid

MODERATE growth in monetary aggregates over the months ahead

than has occurred in recent months.]

Alternative D

To implement this policy, while taking account of [DEL: the

forthcoming Treasury financing,] developments in domestic and

international financial markets, [DEL: and the Board's action on

reserve requirements,] the Committee seeks to achieve bank

reserve and money market conditions consistent with [DEL: more rapid

MODEST growth in monetary aggregates over the months ahead

than has occurred in recent months.]

Government security dealer trading positions are on a commitment basis. Trading positions, which exclude Treasury bills financed by repurchase
agreements maturing in 16 days or more, are indicators of dealer holdings available for sale over the near-term. Other security dealer positions
are debt issues still in syndicate, excluding trading positions. The basic reserve deficit is excess reserves less borrowing at Federal Reserve
less net Federal funds purchases. Weekly data are daily averages for statement weeks, except for corporate and municipal issues in syndicate
which are Friday figures.
* STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL ** Monthly averages for excess reserves and borrowings are weighted averages of statement week figures.
