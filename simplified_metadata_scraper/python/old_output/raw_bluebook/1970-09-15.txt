CONFIDENTIAL (FR) September 11, 1970.

MONETARY AGGREGATES AND
MONEY MARKET CONDITIONS

Recent developments

(1) Published data show that the money stock and the adjusted

credit proxy both grew rapidly on average during August, at annual rates

of about 11 per cent and 24 per cent, respectively. For both aggregates,

much of the greater-than-anticipated August strength reflected an unusually

rapid rise in private demand deposits, as security and business loans at

banks expanded sharply. Most recently, however, partial data for the

statement week ending September 9 indicate that the level of the money

stock has probably fallen sharply relative to its expected path and would,

unless revised substantially, lead to a considerably weaker-than-anticipated

September performance.

(2) The rapid August growth rate for the published money stock

also reflected a marked reduction in the importance of several types of

international transfers at major banks; these transfers had the effect on

the published figures of understating the growth rate of the money supply

earlier in 1970. Because the sources of bias became less important in

August than in earlier months, once the published data are roughly ad-

Justed to eliminate the effect of these biases (as explained in the

appendix), the August change in the money stock adjusts downward to an



-2-

annual rate of around 9 per cent. Since only one of the sources of bias

in the money supply data affects the bank credit proxy, adjustments to

eliminate bias produce only very minor changes in the proxy series.

(3) Total time and savings deposits grew less rapidly in August

than in July, partly as CD expansion dropped to a little less than half of

the $5 billion July pace. A part of this CD growth was offset by shrinkage

of bank-related commercial paper, amounting to about $500 million over the

month. As major banks have approached the statement week beginning

September 17 to which the new reserve requirement on bank-related commercial

paper will first apply, the run-off of such paper has accelerated. The rate

of growth of time and savings deposits other than large CD's also slowed

in August from the unusually rapid July pace.

(4) Conditions in the money market were easier on average during

the three statement weeks that followed the last meeting of the Committee,

with the rate on Federal funds averaging just under 6-1/2 per cent. While

Federal funds traded generally in a 6-1/8--6-3/8 per cent rate range during

the week immediately following the last Committee meeting, inthe statement

week just past the funds rate averaged 6.64 per cent, the same as in the

week of the Committee meeting, but still about 25 basis points below

the average level of the previous three statement weeks. The drop in the

funds rate just after the Committee meeting reflected a marked shift in

reserve distribution favoring the money center banks. Since then, there

has been a reversal of this flow. As a result, the average basic reserve

deficit at the 46 major reporting banks rose $1.2 billion from the state-

ment week ending August 26 to that ending September 9.



-4-

(5) Net borrowed reserves averaged $500 million, and member

bank borrowing $700 million in the three statement weeks following the

Committee meeting, some $250--$300 million below the comparable averages

for the three preceding weeks. However, these earlier higher numbers

still included about $250 million of special member bank borrowing related

to loans generated by churning in the market for non-bank-related commercial

paper.

(6) The drop in the Federal funds rate immediately following the

announced reduction of reserve requirements and the August meeting of the

Committee led security market participants to anticipate a significant

further near-term easing of monetary policy and a consequent cut in the

prime rate at banks. These changed expectations were quickly reflected in

interest rates. Bond yields in late August were down about a quarter of

a percentage point from levels prevailing just before the last Committee

meeting, and the average rate for new three-month bills reached a low

of 6.20 per cent in the August 24 auction. Since then, however, the

combination of a heavy and growing calendar of corporate and municipal

issues and uncertainty about the course of monetary policy in light of the

August bulge in monetary aggregates and the recent upward drift in day-to-

day money market rates have contributed to a general backing up of interest

rates. The three-month bill rate has most recently been around 6.40 per

cent, still around 15 basis points below the level prevailing just before

the last FOMC meeting.

Prospective developments

(8) If the Committee wishes to continue with a policy that

encompasses financial flows and credit conditions consistent with a 5 per

cent rate of growth for the money supply, the following language for the

second paragraph of the directive might be considered (alternative A):

To implement this policy, the Committee seeks to promote

[DEL:some easing of conditions in credit markets and somewhat greater

MODERATE growth in money over the months ahead than occurred in the

second quarter, while taking account of possible liquidity problems

and allowing bank credit growth to reflect BANK EFFORTS TO REBUILD

LIQUIDITY AND any continued shift of credit flows from market to

banking channels. System open market operations until the next

meeting of the Committee shall be conducted with a view to main-

taining bank reserves and money market conditions consistent with

that objective, taking account of the effects of other monetary

policy actions.]

(9) Specification of monthly and weekly target paths for the

monetary aggregates is complicated insofar as the money supply is concerned

by the need to adjust, for purposes of monetary policy formulation, for the

known amount of bias in the published figures (the sources of bias and their

effect are detailed in the appendix). The following table presents target

paths for the money stock that would be consistent with a 5 per cent target

growth rate in the fourth quarter for the unbiased, or adjusted, money supply



-7-

series. To provide a link with published data on the money supply and with

weekly data (for which bias estimates are not yet available), the table

also shows monthly target paths for the existing series through October.

In the third quarter, growth of the money supply is expected to be below a

5 per cent growth trend--4-1/2 per cent in the published series and 3-1/2

per cent in the adjusted series. This develops because it seems unlikely

that over the last half of September the money supply could be expanded

sharply enough through open market operations to achieve the desired 5 per

cent growth rate for the quarter as a whole, barring a drastic easing of

money market conditions. However, revisions in data, particularly for

the week ending September 9, not to mention errors in projection for the

latter half of September, would of course strongly influence the actual

third quarter results as compared with currently expected results.

1/ Beginning October 1, the level of total reserves includes a $300 million
estimated increase in reserves required against bank-related paper. The
annual rates of change have been calculated excluding the effects on reserves
of both the increased requirement on commercial paper and the reduction on
time deposits so as to maintain continuity of the reserve series.

(11) The third quarter growth rate in money supply of 3-1/2 per

cent is substantially short of policy goals and a money growth rate around

3--3-1/2 per cent would be anticipated for the fourth quarter under money

market conditions recently prevailing. As a result some easing of money



-9-

market conditions would seem to be needed to attain a 5 per cent growth

target in the fourth quarter. Achievement of this objective might require

a Federal funds rate averaging down in a 6-1/8--6-1/2 per cent range and

member bank borrowings averaging a little below $500 million. Net borrowed

reserves might be expected to average around $350 million, with the volume

of needed open market operations in the week ending October 7 reduced by an

estimated $450 million of reserves released by the net effect of the recent

reserve requirement changes. These money market conditions would be likely

to contribute to renewed general declines of interest rates. Over the

near-term, with major Treasury cash borrowing deferred until the latter part

of October, the 3-month bill would probably move down into a 6--6-3/8 per

cent range. As short-term market rates decline generally, expectations

of a prime rate cut would be heightened, and bond yields would probably

drift lower, although the heavy calendar of new offerings might tend to

limit the size of such declines.

(12) Even with some easing of money market conditions, time

deposit growth is likely to slow somewhat further over the months ahead

from the unusually rapid rate that followed the late June suspension of rate

ceilings on short-term CD's. During September and early October, CD

expansion may be sustained at the pace of recent weeks as banks continue

to adjust to the commercial paper reserve requirement, but over the rest

of the quarter CD growth seems likely to slacken further.

(13) A weekly path for monetary aggregates consistent with the

published monthly series in paragraph 9 is shown below for the period until

the next FOMC meeting.

Alternative B

(14) Should the Committee desire to seek a 6 per cent growth

rate for the money supply over the fourth quarter and a significant easing

in credit market conditions, it may wish to consider the following

language for the second paragraph of the directive (alternative B):

To implement this policy, the Committee seeks to promote

some FURTHER easing of conditions in credit markets and somewhat

greater growth in money over the months ahead than occurred in

the first half of the year, while taking account of possible

liquidity problems and allowing bank credit growth to reflect

BANK EFFORTS TO REBUILD LIQUIDITY AND any continued shift of

credit flows from market to banking channels. System open

market operations until the next meeting of the Committee shall

be conducted with a view to maintaining bank reserves and

money market conditions consistent with that objective, taking

[DEL: account of the effects of other monetary policy actions.]

(17) Attainment of the more rapid growth in the money supply

indicated in the above tables would require a more pronounced easing of

money market conditions than under Alternative A. These easier conditions

might include a Federal funds rate fluctuating in a 5-3/4--6-1/4 per cent

range, member bank borrowings around $300-$400 million and net borrowed

reserves in a $100-$250 million range. Such conditions could well

trigger an immediate cut in the prime rate and reduce the 3-month

Treasury bill rate to 6 per cent or below. Such a development might also

create expectations of a reduction in the Federal Reserve discount rate,

contributing to general downward pressures on interest rates, in both

short- and long-term markets. On the other hand, some partly offsetting



-14-

upward interest rate pressure, chiefly in longer maturity ranges,

might develop if there were a heightening of expectations that signifi-

cantly easier credit availability would lead to intensification of

inflationary conditions later on.

(18) The adjusted credit proxy is expected to grow some-

what more rapidly, along with the more rapid growth in money supply,

as compared with alternative A. Money supply growth is not expected to

become more rapid until October, although the exact lags over the near-

term in public and bank responses to monetary policy changes are con-

jectural. Net inflows of time deposits to banks are likely to become

larger as market interest rates decline--making CD's viable throughout

the maturity range. However, since business loan demands are expected

to be moderate, we would expect banks to drop their CD offering rates

in line with declines in other market interest rates. As CD's become

a more certain source of funds, banks may become more willing to let

commercial paper run off and to reduce Euro-dollar borrowings. Thus,

the upward effect on the adjusted bank credit proxy of the rather

marked lowering of market interest rates expected under this alterna-

tive might not be extremely sharp, and will likely depend in part on the

extent to which businesses switch from open market to bank borrowing

and on the extent to which banks and dealers take speculative positions

in securities.

(19) Weekly figures for monetary aggregates over the period

between now and the next meeting are shown in the table below (with

the money supply figures linked to the published series as under

alternative A).

APPENDIX

Preliminary Corrections for Money Supply Bias in 1970

For some time it has been apparent that current measure of

monetary growth were being distorted, as bank float increased more than,
deposits at large banks.l/ In 1969, the money supply s-rLes was, re-
vised upward to take account of bills payable and London checks, but
this revision only partially corrected the series for the downward bias
arising from international transfers. To attempt to measure the remain-
ing bias, the staff has obtained additional information from several

sources in preparation for a revision of the money supply series this
fall. While this information is not yet complete, some rough estimates
have been made of monthly average corrections that may be appropriate
for 1970.

Effects on growth rates as currently measured

Table 1 compares growth rates in M as current measured and
as corrected for the estimated bias. The corrected growth rate. indicate
expansion over the first half of 1970 at a 5-1/2 per cent annual rate,
compared to 4 per cent for the published series, and for the first eight
months of the year at 5.9 per cent, as compared with 5 per cent for
the published series. As had been anticipated, the largest adjustment
is for the second quarter. However, the second quarter adjustment will
be larger than the 1 percentage point previously indicated in the Blue
Book of June 19.

In the third quarter the growth rate will probably be lower
by about 1 percentage point after correction for bias. This level of
the money supply in the third quarter will be higher than published aft -
bias correction. But the effect of tne sources of bias on the rate of
growth depends on how the amount of bias is changing relative to the
change in private demand deposits; for the rate f ~L. :o 'e biased
downward, the amount of bias would have to be e pu:lng a- a faster rate
than private demand deposits. In fact, during the third quarter the
amount of bias in the published figures is expected to decline, thus
leading to a fairly significant overstatement in the actual rate of growth
when measured by the figures as presently published. The expected decline
in bias in the published figures is in large part attributable to termina-
tion of use of "guerilla" drafts at three major New York City banks, as
explained below.

1/ Bank float, or cash items in process of collection, traditionally
have been deducted iron the money supply to avei I .oble outtir.g of
deposits that occurs in tne check clearing process. However, avail-
able statistics do not provide breakdowns of cash items associated with
the deposit component of the money supply.



Appendix

Estimates of bias

Table 2 provides monthly average estimates of four sources of
bias. Edge Act Corporations and agencies of foreign banks are not repre-
sented in commercial banking statistics from which the money supply series
is constituted, so their demand deposits are not included at present. Yet
these institutions are responsible for a very large daily volume of Euro-
dollar and foreign exchange transactions which clear through their major
New York City correspondents. New York banks account for these trans-
actions by crediting cash items in process of collection and debiting due
to banks. Deduction of these cash items from the money supply is in-
appropriate so long as the demand deposits of Edge Corporations (which
to a great extent represent official checks written in repayment of Euro-
dollar borrowings by their parent) and agencies are excluded.

Edge Corporations submit daily deposit reports to the New York
FRB in the same form as those provided by member banks. Hence, their
demand deposits other than interbank can be added to the money supply as
an offset to the cash items generated by these institutions. Such deposits
consist mainly of checks written but not yet cleared, judging from their
parallel movement with New York City bank cash items over European holiday
periods. Transactions of Edge Corporations are responsible for the largest
portion of the estimated current bias in money supply statistics. This
source of bias increased in the first half of 1970, but it has declined
slightly since mid-year.

The basis for correcting bias associated with the foreign
agencies is much less satisfactory, although it is known that the effect
of agency transactions is similar to that for Edge Corporations. The only
information available from agencies currently is in month-end condition
reports to the New York State Banking Commisioner. These single-date
reports lack standardized depcsit figures, making it difficult to estimate
their contribution to money supply bias directly from the deposits that
give rise to it. However, our investigation suggests that figures on "due
from U.S. banks and trust companies", as reported by the agencies, is a
suitable proxy for the agency cash items submitted to New York City banks
for collection. Table 1 reflects totals for 25 foreign agencies operating
in New York. This single-date, indirect measure of agency activity leaves
considerable room for error in the bias correction, but it. appears to he
the best retrospective information available. It is estimated that agency
transactions declined in importance in the first quarter, but rose above
year-end levels by mid-year. As explained below, it is planned to obtain
more representative data directly from the agencies to carry the money
supply series forward after revision.

The other major component of bias included in these estimates
is the so-called "guerilla draft". This accounting device was utilized
by a few large banks from late 1969 until recently to obtain reserve bene-
fits under both Regulations D and M. Such transfers involved "guerilla"
or clearing house checks drawn by foreign agencies at the request of a

They had the effect of generating cash items at New York banks which
collected the drafts without any corresponding debits to demand deposits
included in the money supply. This practice resulted in downward bias
in both levels and rates of growth of the money supply throughout the
first half of 1970, but its termination recently will reduce the amount
of bias in third quarter estimates significantly.

The smallest component of measurable bias, as indicated by
figures on Table 2, is the net effect of transactions through the

relatively new Clearing House International Payments System (CHIPS).
A large volume of international transactions are now cleared by major

New York banks through CHIPS by means of electronic equipment tied into

a clearing house computer. Until recently it was by no means certain

that these clearings were introducing only small errors into money

supply measurement. The problem for money supply statistics evolved
from changes in statistical reporting with the advent of this computer
clearing system. Some banks, but not all, began reporting payments and
receipts through CHIPS as due to and due from banks, respectively, where
formerly they reported officers checks and cash items. Other banks main
tained their former reporting practice. Depending on the pairing of
banks with mixed reporting methods, money supply data could be overstated
or understated by such transactions. CHIPS began operation in April,
with the volume of payments increasing to several billion dollars
currently. The clearing house has provided daily data on these trans-
actions which indicate very little net effect up to now. The staff is
currently negotiating with other regulatory agencies to achieve standard-
ized reporting. This will eliminate distortions from this source.

On balance, the total measurable downward bias in the level
of the money supply is estimated to have increased from about $3 billion
at the end of 1969 to about $4-1/2 billion at mid-year. Since June, the
total bias has been reduced about $500 million, reflecting mainly termina-
tion of the use of guerilla drafts in response to Mr. Hayes' August 13
letter to New York City banks. No information is yet available for banks
outside New York on the possible use--if any--of this or similar devices
that might affect the money supply.

Plans for money supply revision

The bias corrections discussed above are still too rough to
publish. Moreover, it would be desirable to extend these corrections
back as far as the adjustments appear significant to avoid a break in
series. It would also be desirable to obtain better information on
foreign agency transactions for purposes of carrying the corrected
series forward. These tasks, as well as the annual benchmark and season-
al factor revision, have been given a high priority by the staff, and a
major revision incorporating all of these elements will be published this
fall, probably around the end of October.



Appendix -4-

It should be noted that the proposed corrections for trans-
actions of Edge Act Corporations and foreign agencies will require con-
tinued attention as the money supply series is carried forward. This
situation will change when Euro-dollar and foreign exchange transactions
are converted from clearing house to Federal funds settlement. Such
Federal funds settlement will eliminate the cash items bias discussed
above. However, implementation of such a system will require close
cooperation between the Federal Reserve, commercial banks, and other
institutions involved in international transactions.
