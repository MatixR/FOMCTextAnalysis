MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES 

Recent Developments 

(1) Market participants universally anticipated the FOMC’s decision at its 

February meeting to increase the target federal funds rate 25 basis points to 

2½ percent, to continue to assess the risks to sustainable economic growth and price 

stability as balanced, and to retain the “measured pace” language.1  As a result, the 

market reaction to the announcement was quite muted, as was the case with the 

publication three weeks later of the minutes of the meeting.  In the interim, however, 

Chairman Greenspan’s monetary policy testimony, which was silent as to whether 

policy tightening would continue to be measured, led market participants to mark up 

their expected path for policy.  Policy expectations were boosted further by 

heightened inflation concerns sparked by increases in the prices of energy and other 

commodities and incoming economic data, especially the higher-than-expected core 

readings on PPI and PCE inflation.  Judging from federal funds futures quotes and 

the Desk’s most recent survey of primary dealers, investors once again are virtually 

certain of a 25 basis point increase in the target federal funds rate at the upcoming 

meeting and generally expect only minor changes to the statement (Chart 1).  Futures 

prices indicate a mean expectation for the federal funds rate of 3¼ percent by July, 

about ¼ percentage point higher than expected at the time of the February meeting.  

Options prices imply that investors now see a pause as less likely than they did in 
                                           
1 The average effective federal funds rate was very close to the target over most of the 
intermeeting period.  Late in the period, the funds rate averaged somewhat above target in 
response to the anticipation of another tightening move by the FOMC at this meeting.  The 
Desk redeemed $333 million of Treasury coupons and purchased no bills or coupon 
securities.  The volume of outstanding long-term RPs increased $1 billion, to $17 billion.

February and a 50 basis point move at one of the next three meetings as somewhat 

more likely.  Current futures quotes suggest an expected federal funds rate of about 

4¼ percent at the end of 2006, 50 basis points higher than at the time of the last 

meeting. 

(2) Consistent with this upward revision to policy expectations, the two-year 

nominal Treasury yield gained 45 basis points over the intermeeting period.  Ten-year 

yields rose almost as much—and probably more than can be accounted for solely by 

the revision to policy expectations—perhaps as investors reevaluated fixed-income 

pricing in light of the Chairman’s characterization of the low level of long-rates 

prevailing in mid-February as a “conundrum” and as doubts surfaced about the 

continued willingness of foreign investors to add to their holdings of dollar assets.  

Concerns about inflation seemed to increase as well, with ten-year inflation 

compensation measured from TIPS rising about 25 basis points.  However, the 

forward-rate structure of inflation compensation indicates that this increase was 

concentrated over the next two years.  Inflation compensation five to ten years ahead 

rose only 10 basis points over the intermeeting period, and survey measures of longer-

term expectations were about unchanged. 

(3) Investment-grade private yields increased a bit less than comparable-

maturity Treasury yields, leaving spreads a few basis points lower (Chart 2).  Yields on 

speculative-grade bonds, in contrast, moved up only a little, implying that their spread 

over Treasuries fell about 35 basis points.  Corporate balance sheets are generally 

healthy, and indicators of business credit quality are favorable; still, current yield 

spreads seem to provide very little compensation for risk relative to historical norms.  

In recent days, profit warnings by General Motors and accompanying debt 

downgrades pushed up GM credit default swap premiums and sent GM stock prices 

lower.  Despite GM’s troubles and increases in bond yields and energy prices, broad 

stock indexes edged up over the intermeeting period, although the Nasdaq index

declined 2½ percent.  Implied volatility of stock prices, as well as of interest rates, 

remained low (see box).   

(4) The trade-weighted foreign exchange value of the dollar against major 

currencies declined 2¼ percent on balance over the intermeeting period (Chart 3).  

The dollar appreciated for several days following the Chairman’s speech on the 

current account on February 4, which many analysts interpreted as expressing 

diminished concern about the adjustment of the U.S. external deficit.  However, that 

move proved short-lived; sometimes-contradictory news stories and reports about 

possible diversification away from dollar assets—including statements by authorities 

in Japan, Taiwan, and Korea—seemed to contribute to the dollar’s subsequent 

decline.2  Late in the period, the release of trade data for January renewed investor 

concerns about the financing of the U.S. current account deficit and apparently 

weighed on the dollar.  On a bilateral basis, the dollar depreciated against most other 

major currencies over the period, including a 3 percent decline posted against the 

Canadian dollar and a 2¾ percent drop vis-à-vis the euro.  The dollar rose slightly 

versus the yen, however, amid signs of continued economic sluggishness in Japan.  

Ten-year sovereign yields increased 15 to 20 basis points in most major foreign 

industrial countries, reflecting in some cases moves up in expected future inflation, 

and major equity indexes registered modest gains.  Both the Reserve Bank of Australia 

and the Reserve Bank of New Zealand raised their main policy rates 25 basis points 

earlier this month, citing concerns about inflationary pressures.   

(5) The dollar was about unchanged on net over the intermeeting period against 

the currencies of our other important trading partners.  The dollar depreciated more 

than 2½ percent against the Korean won and by smaller amounts versus several other

Factors Affecting the Volatility of Financial Variables 
 
As noted by the black line in the chart below, realized volatility for the ten-year Treasury yield has 
fallen over the past year to its lowest point in several years.  In part, FOMC communications may 
have contributed to this decline by providing clearer guidance to market participants about the 
likely future course of monetary policy.  In addition, volatility associated with market reactions to 
macro data releases (the red line) seems to have moved lower over recent months.  (Treasury 
yield volatility associated with reactions to macro data releases is measured here as the moving 
six-month standard deviation of changes in the ten-year Treasury yield over narrow time intervals 
bracketing each economic data release.)  Clearly, many factors other than macro data releases 
influence yields, and the effect of these other factors is especially pronounced during periods of 
market turmoil such as the fall of 1998, the aftermath of the September 11 attacks, and the period 
following major corporate accounting scandals.  Since last June, however, the decline in yield 
volatility seems to be attributable largely to the decline in the volatility associated with market 
reactions to macro data releases.  Following this decline, the latter measure of volatility has 
remained in the middle of its historical range.  The blue line displays the volatility in yields 
attributable to the predicted market reactions to macro data releases based on a simple event study 
regression relating changes in ten-year yields to the unexpected or surprise component of 
economic data releases estimated over the period from 1991 to present.  This volatility series also 
has moved lower over recent months, suggesting that the drop in ten-year yield volatility has been 
associated both with a decline in the average magnitude of economic data surprises and a more 
muted market response to surprises.

Asian currencies.  In contrast, the dollar appreciated about 4½ percent against the 

Brazilian real, amid reports of official sales of real by the Brazilian central bank.  

During the intermeeting period, Brazil’s main equity index was boosted to record 

highs by large capital inflows from foreign private investors.  Although higher dollar 

interest rates raised concerns in Latin American financial markets toward the end of 

the intermeeting period, equity prices in the region were generally strong, owing in 

part to perceptions of improving economic conditions.  Dollar-denominated bond 

spreads narrowed to record low levels earlier this month, but they widened abruptly in 

the past week.    

(6) Growth in nonfinancial sector debt has remained robust of late.  Domestic 

nonfinancial business sector debt grew at an 8 percent annual rate in the final quarter 

of last year and appears to be rising nearly as fast in the current quarter (Chart 4).  

Business borrowing has likely been boosted by faster inventory accumulation and a 

pickup in merger and acquisition activity.  With the housing market still hot and 

mortgage debt expanding at a double-digit clip, household debt again grew robustly in 

the final quarter of 2004 and appears to be on track for another sizable increase this 

quarter.  The growth of federal debt remains brisk. 

(7) M2 growth slowed to a 2½ percent pace over the first two months of 2005, 

evidently in response to widening opportunity costs.  Rates on liquid deposits have 

changed little in the face of rising short-term market rates, while those on small time 

deposits have kept better pace with market yields.  As a result, liquid deposit growth 

was anemic in January and February while small time deposits grew substantially.  In 

addition, the attractiveness of M2 assets has apparently dimmed relative to capital 

market instruments, as flows into longer-term mutual funds have increased this year.

Policy Alternatives 

(8) Incoming information over the intermeeting period led the staff to mark up 

its assessments of the underlying strength of aggregate demand and the inflation 

outlook as well as its assumption for the path of the federal funds rate.  The staff has 

read the smaller-than-expected moderation in spending on capital goods thus far this 

year as implying that the strength in capital spending over the latter half of 2004 did 

not owe materially to a pulling forward of spending to take advantage of the partial-

expensing tax provision that expired at the end of the year.  As a consequence, the 

staff now interprets a larger portion of last year’s pickup in investment as the product 

of factors that are likely to support such spending into this year.  The drag associated 

with an upward revision to the projected path of oil prices in light of the sharp and 

unexpected rise in spot and future oil prices over the intermeeting period only 

partially offsets this additional strength in aggregate demand.  Real GDP is now 

projected to expand 4 and 3½ percent, respectively, in 2005 and 2006, placing the 

level of output only a touch below that of its potential at the end of the forecast.  

Recent readings on inflation, higher prices for oil and other commodities, and some 

further depreciation in the exchange value of the dollar induced the staff to raise its 

inflation projection a bit.  Core PCE inflation is now anticipated to tick up this year to 

about 1¾ percent before falling back to about 1½ percent in 2006.  Total consumer 

price inflation is projected to slow appreciably this year and next as oil prices retrace 

some of their recent gains, non-oil import prices decelerate, and productivity growth 

remains solid.  The Greenbook forecast is now conditioned on an assumption that the 

target federal funds rate will reach 3½ percent by the end of this year and 4 percent by 

the end of 2006—a trajectory that is 50 basis points higher than assumed in January 

and only a bit below the market’s anticipated path for the funds rate.  Longer-term 

yields are expected to change little over the forecast period:  The effects of rising 

short-term rates are counterbalanced by some marking down of forward rates at 

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 10 of 37



longer horizons as market participants’ policy expectations come into better alignment 

with the staff outlook.  Equity prices are projected to rise at a pace sufficient to yield 

risk-adjusted returns in line with those on fixed-income securities, and the foreign 

exchange value of the dollar is anticipated to edge lower over the forecast period.   

(9) This Bluebook presents three alternatives for the Committee’s consideration 

that are summarized in Table 1, together with associated wording.  Under Alternative 

B, the funds rate would be raised 25 basis points at this meeting.  The accompanying 

statement would be quite similar to that issued following the February meeting but 

would note that output continues to grow at a solid pace, that inflation pressures had 

picked up, and that the rise in energy prices had not notably fed through to wages or 

core consumer prices.  Alternative B makes the balance-of-risks assessment explicitly 

conditional on “appropriate policy” and uses a more forceful verb phrase, “should be 

kept,” to underscore that it may take policy action to preserve balance.3  As explained 

in the box on the next page, several of the characterizations in that statement may 

now or in the not-too-distant future be seen as needing revision in light of economic 

developments.  As a case in point, the Committee may regard the current measured-

pace language as limiting its flexibility at this and subsequent meetings.  To allow for a 

broader range of policy options, under Alternatives A and C, the measured-pace 

language is replaced with a sentence emphasizing economic prospects as the principal 

factor that will determine the pace at which policy accommodation is removed.  The 

statement could point to upside risks to sustainable growth and price stability 

conditional on an unchanged target federal funds rate for the next few quarters as an 

additional way of signaling the likely direction of the path for policy.  Under 

Alternative A, the funds rate also would be raised 25 basis points, but the 
                                           
3 The Committee has accompanied its six prior tightenings with assessments that the risks to 
both of its goals were balanced, which indicates that those assessments have implicitly been 
conditioned on an appropriate path of policy.  However, explicitly stating that conditionality, 
as in Alternative B, will probably limit the usefulness of this form of the risk assessment in 
signaling the likely direction of future policy moves.

Output appears to be growing at a moderate 
pace despite the rise in energy prices, and labor 
market conditions continue to improve

sufficient to eliminate any remaining 
resource slack. 

Rationale 

4. Inflation and longer-term inflation 
expectations remain well 
contained. 

Although month-to-month movements in 
inflation have been volatile of late, 
underlying inflation and longer-term inflation 
expectations remain well contained. 

Inflation and Longer-term inflation 
expectations remain well 
contained, though pressures on 
inflation have picked up 
modestly in recent months.  The 
rise in energy prices, however, 
has not notably fed through to 
wages or core consumer prices. 

While Inflation and longer-term inflation 
expectations remain well contained, pressures 
on inflation have intensified in recent 
months.  

5. The Committee perceives the 
upside and downside risks to the 
attainment of both sustainable 
growth and price stability for the 
next few quarters to be roughly 
equal. 

The Committee perceives the upside and 
downside risks to the attainment of both 
sustainable growth and price stability for the 
next few quarters to be roughly equal that, if 
the current target for the federal funds rate 
were maintained for the next few quarters, it 
is more likely than not that output would 
grow at a pace faster than is sustainable and 
that inflation pressures would pick up.   

The Committee perceives that, 
with appropriate policy action, 
the upside and downside risks to 
the attainment of both sustainable 
growth and price stability for the 
next few quarters to be should be 
kept roughly equal. 

The Committee perceives the upside and 
downside risks to the attainment of both 
sustainable growth and price stability for the 
next few quarters to be roughly equal that, if 
the current target for the federal funds rate 
were maintained for the next few quarters, it 
is more likely than not that output would 
grow at a pace faster than is sustainable and 
that inflation pressures would pick up.   

Assessment 
of Risk 6. With underlying inflation expected 

to be relatively low, the Committee 
believes that policy 
accommodation can be removed at 
a pace that is likely to be measured. 
Nonetheless, the Committee will 
respond to changes in economic 
prospects as needed to fulfill its

Issues Associated with the 
FOMC Statement Language 

 
The Committee will likely face five key issues 
concerning its statement language over upcoming 
meetings.  First, as noted in the markup of the February 
FOMC statement at the right, the Committee will need 
to determine whether its characterization of the stance 
of policy—marked in red—should be modified in some 
way.  Second, as noted in blue, the FOMC may need to 
revise its assessment of the pace of underlying 
productivity growth in light of the realized and 
anticipated slowing in actual productivity growth.  
Third, the assessment of inflation and inflation 
expectations—noted in green—may need to be 
revisited.  Fourth, as marked in purple, the Committee 
may wish to alter the “measured pace” language.  This 
might be the case if the Committee judged that a pause 
in the process of removing policy accommodation 
might be called for or, alternatively, if it determined 
that economic circumstances warranted a more rapid 
policy adjustment.  However, eliminating the measured-
pace language without a replacement would leave the 
risk assessment paragraph without a signal about the 
future direction of policy.  That omission raises the 
fifth issue—noted in orange—regarding the balance-of-
risks assessment.   

February 2005 FOMC Statement 

The Federal Open Market Committee decided today 
to raise its target for the federal funds rate by 25 basis 
points to 2-1/2 percent.  

The Committee believes that, even after this action, 
the stance of monetary policy remains 

accommodative and, coupled with robust 
underlying growth in productivity, is providing 
ongoing support to economic activity.  Output 
appears to be growing at a moderate pace despite the 
rise in energy prices, and labor market conditions 
continue to improve gradually. Inflation and 
longer-term inflation expectations remain well 

contained.  

The Committee perceives the upside and 

downside risks to the attainment of both 

sustainable growth and price stability for the 

next few quarters to be roughly equal. With 
underlying inflation expected to be relatively low, 
the Committee believes that policy accommodation 
can be removed at a pace that is likely to be 
measured. Nonetheless, the Committee will respond 
to changes in economic prospects as needed to fulfill 
its obligation to maintain price stability.  

Is productivity 
growth still 
robust? 

Is policy still 
accommodative? 

Is inflation well-
contained and 
expected to be 
relatively low? 

Are the risks still 
balanced? 

Will the pace of 
firming remain 
‘measured’?

accompanying statement would suggest less concern about underlying inflation 

prospects.  Under Alternative C, the funds rate would be boosted 50 basis points, and 

the accompanying statement would give more emphasis to the perception of upside 

inflation risks.  These alternatives may contain elements of statement language that 

the Committee might find more appealing than the wording of Alternative B or may 

be helpful in informing potential changes in the policy announcement over the next 

few meetings. 

(10) All three alternatives envisage some policy tightening at this meeting, which 

might be seen as necessary to contain the apparent momentum of spending and 

heightened inflation pressures.  During the discussion in February, members 

universally viewed themselves as likely to favor firming in March, and the data 

released since then would not seem likely to have discouraged that sentiment.  In that 

regard, investors appear unanimous in their expectation of a quarter-point hike at this 

meeting.  While considerable uncertainty surrounds estimates of the equilibrium real 

rate, standard models put it well above the current level of the real federal funds rate 

(Chart 5).  Additional tightening would also be called for by a range of standard policy 

prescriptions (Chart 6).   

(11) If the Committee found the Greenbook forecast for output and inflation 

conditional on continued gradual removal of policy accommodation both plausible 

and acceptable, it might choose to raise the target federal funds rate ¼ percentage 

point at this meeting and issue a statement like that shown for Alternative B in Table 

1.  The Committee might view this action as consistent with the measured-pace 

language of the February statement and appropriately validating current market 

expectations of continued gradual firming.  While there are some signs of greater 

pressures on inflation—as evidenced by more rapid growth in producer and 

commodity prices and a possible further increase in near-term inflation 

expectations—resource slack lingers, labor costs have only edged up, and firms

Equilibrium Real Rate Chart: Explanatory Notes 
 

The equilibrium real rate is the real federal funds rate that, if maintained, would be projected to return 
output to its potential level over time.  The short-run equilibrium rate is defined as the rate that would 
close the output gap in twelve quarters given a model’s projection of the economy, and the medium-run 
concept is the value of the real funds rate projected to keep output at potential in seven years under the 
assumption that monetary policy acts to bring actual and potential output into line in the short run and 
then keep them equal thereafter.  With the exception of the TIPS-consistent measure, the real federal 
funds rates employ the log difference of the core PCE price index over the previous four quarters as a 
proxy for expected inflation, with the staff projection used for the current quarter.  TIPS indexation is 
based on the total CPI.  
        

Measure Description 

Single-Equation 
Model  

The measure of the equilibrium real rate in the single-equation model is based on an 
estimated aggregate-demand relationship between the current value of the output gap and 
its lagged values as well as the lagged values of the real federal funds rate.  In light of 
this model’s simple structure, the short-run measure of the equilibrium real rate depends 
only on the recent position of output relative to potential, and the medium-run measure is 
virtually constant. 

Small Structural 
Model 

The small-scale model of the economy consists of equations for five variables: the output 
gap, the equity premium, the federal budget surplus, the trend growth rate of output, and 
the real bond yield.  Unlike the estimates from the single-equation model, values of the 
equilibrium real rate also depend directly on conditions associated with output growth, 
fiscal policy, and capital markets. 

Large Model 
(FRB/US) 

Estimates of the equilibrium real rate using FRB/US—the staff’s large-scale econometric 
model of the U.S. economy—depend on a very broad array of economic factors, some of 
which take the form of projected values of the model’s exogenous variables.  These 
projections make use of several simple forecasting rules which are appropriate for the 
three-year horizon relevant for the short-run concept but are less sensible over longer 
horizons.  Thus, we report only the short-run measure for the FRB/US model. 

Greenbook-
consistent  

Measures of the equilibrium real rate cannot be directly obtained from the Greenbook 
forecast, because the Greenbook is not based on a formal model.  Rather, we use the 
FRB/US model in conjunction with an extended version of the Greenbook forecast to 
derive a Greenbook-consistent measure.  FRB/US is first add-factored so that its 
simulation matches the extended Greenbook forecast, and then a second simulation is run 
off this baseline to determine the value of the real federal funds rate that closes the output 
gap.  The medium-run concept of the equilibrium real rate is not computed because it 
requires a relatively long extension of the Greenbook forecast. 

TIPS-consistent Yields on TIPS (Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities) incorporate investors’ 
expectations of the future path of real interest rates.  The seven-year instantaneous real 
forward rate derived from TIPS yields reflects the short-term real interest rate expected to 
prevail in seven years as well as any applicable term premium on the Bluebook 
publication date.  The term premium is assumed to be 70 basis points.

probably have scope to absorb some increase in costs by reducing profit margins.  A 

quarter-point firming at this meeting presumably to be followed by further increases 

over time could be seen as sufficient to cut off the inflation pressures already in the 

pipeline, especially so if the Committee harbors doubts about the continued vigor of 

the expansion given the sharp rise in oil prices and the backup in long-term rates.   

(12) According to the Desk’s survey of primary dealers and anecdotal reports, 

market participants universally anticipate a quarter-point firming in policy at this 

meeting and generally expect only relatively minor changes to the statement language.  

As a result, it seems likely that the market reaction to Alternative B would be fairly 

muted.  However, investors would take note of the reference to the pickup of 

inflation pressures and would conclude that the Committee believed that “appropriate 

policy” would most likely entail more policy firming than previously expected.    

Consequently, yields would probably tick up a few basis points following the 

announcement while stock prices could fall back a bit. 

(13) The Committee might view recent elevated readings on some price 

measures as providing a stronger signal of heightened inflation pressures than does 

the staff.  In this case, the Committee may wish to raise the target federal funds rate 

by 50 basis points and issue a statement like that described for Alternative C.  This 

option might be viewed as particularly appealing if the Committee thought that 

underlying productivity growth had slowed substantially or that output was already 

approaching, or had even outstripped, potential.  Even if the Committee generally 

believes that inflation and inflation expectations are likely to remain well-contained 

under the gradual trajectory of policy tightening assumed in the Greenbook, it may 

view the upside risks to that forecast—which are explored in the “spending boom 

with rising inflation expectations” scenario in the Greenbook—as sufficiently 

worrisome to justify a half-point move at this meeting.  In light of the apparent 

momentum of aggregate demand, the Committee may perceive the risk that market 

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 19 of 37



participants come to view it as wavering in its commitment to keep inflation in check 

as more serious than the risk that market participants begin to build in an 

inappropriately tight path for monetary policy. 

(14) If the Committee instead views recent higher inflation readings as largely 

transitory, it may wish to firm policy by a quarter point at this meeting and issue a 

statement like that described under Alternative A.  With longer-term inflation 

expectations well-contained and resource slack apparently being worked down slowly, 

the Committee may see relatively little cost in continuing along a path of gradual 

removal of policy accommodation.  Indeed, the Committee may want to choose the 

words of its statement so as to keep market participants from marking up their 

expected path of tightening.  This might be so even if the Committee anticipates that 

resource slack is likely to be eliminated fairly soon, if it also saw downside risks to that 

forecast—such as are discussed in the “higher bond premiums” scenario in the 

Greenbook—as significant given the recent run-up in interest rates and rise in oil 

prices. 

(15) Under either Alternative A or C, the Committee may judge that the 

measured-pace language is no longer consistent with the likely future course of policy.  

Some might view this wording—at least as it has come to be interpreted in the 

markets after six quarter-point firmings with unchanged language—as ruling out a 

potential pause in policy at upcoming meetings.  At the same time, that wording might 

be regarded as potentially constraining on the upside if the Committee saw a 

significant likelihood that it might need to accelerate the process of removing policy 

accommodation.  Indeed, members might not choose to firm 50 basis points at this 

meeting because of the force of such a constraint.  As a result, the Committee might 

wish to strike the measured-pace language from its statement at this meeting.  To 

accomplish this while still providing a general signal about the probable future 

direction of policy, the Committee could make its risk assessments conditional on an 

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 20 of 37



unchanged target federal funds rate for the next few quarters.  For Alternatives A and 

C, the Committee could then indicate that it is “more likely than not” that the growth 

of output would exceed its sustainable pace and that inflation pressures would pick 

up.  The last sentence of the paragraph could underscore the importance of 

“economic prospects” as a guide for policymakers in judging the pace at which policy 

accommodation should be removed. 

(16) Although the risk assessment paragraphs in Alternatives A and C are similar, 

the characterizations of the economy and prices in the rationale paragraphs are quite 

different.  Under Alternative A, the rationale paragraph would suggest that the 

Committee sees the stance of monetary policy as “somewhat” accommodative and 

regards the recent uptick in inflation readings as transitory, with underlying inflation 

and inflation expectations remaining well-contained.  Such sentiments, along with the 

observation that the firming of policy had cumulated to 175 basis points, would seem 

to signal a pause sometime soon.  In contrast, the language for Alternative C would 

suggest that output growth is proceeding at a pace that seems likely to eliminate 

resource slack in the near term and would note that inflation pressures have 

intensified, signaling a pickup in the pace of firming.  Such language may be favored 

in order to indicate that the Committee could begin to tighten more forcefully 

sometime soon even if it moves 25 basis points at this meeting.  

(17) Market participants would be caught off guard by the 50 basis point 

tightening of Alternative C.   Moreover, investors could infer from the concerns 

expressed about inflation and the removal of the measured-pace language that further 

half-point policy tightenings could well be forthcoming.  Interest rates would likely 

rise sharply across the yield curve, while stock prices would decline in response to 

both the rise in rates and an associated marking down of prospects for earnings 

growth.  The rise in longer-term yields would be tempered to the extent that investors 

scaled down their longer-term inflation expectations.  The market reaction to the 

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 21 of 37



language of Alternative C would be somewhat attenuated if the Committee boosted 

rates at this meeting by only a quarter point.  Even in this case, however, the language 

would presumably be read as suggesting that a more rapid removal of policy 

accommodation was likely in the future—that is, 50 basis point moves could well be 

in the cards.  The market reaction to adoption of Alternative A is more difficult to 

gauge, but the mention of cumulative firming, upbeat assessment of inflation 

prospects, and the characterization of the stance of policy as only “somewhat” 

accommodative in the rationale paragraph should tend to put some downward 

pressure on yields.  Some observers might interpret the absence of the measured-pace 

language as an indication of increased odds of a pause at upcoming meetings.  On net, 

interest rates would probably drop and stock prices would likely move up following 

the announcement. 

Money and Debt Forecasts 

(18) Widening opportunity costs and perceptions of favorable returns in bond 

and equity markets are expected to damp money growth this year and next.  With 

short-term money market rates increasing, the composition of M2 is expected to 

continue to shift toward components such as small time deposits that offer more 

competitive yields.  M2 is projected to rise 3 and 4 percent, respectively, in 2005 and 

2006—roughly in line with the historical relationships among money, income, and 

opportunity costs.  Borrowing by domestic nonfinancial corporations is anticipated to 

pick up over the forecast horizon as rising capital expenditures and mergers and 

acquisition activity spur financing needs, which increasingly exceed internal funds.  By 

contrast, the pace of borrowing in other sectors, while still brisk, is projected to step 

down from that of last year.  In the household sector, consumers are expected to take 

steps to reverse some of the decline in the saving rate registered in recent years.  

Moreover, mortgage debt is projected to decelerate appreciably in response to higher

Directive and Balance of  Risks Statement 

(19) Draft language for the directive and draft risk assessments identical to those 

presented in Table 1 are provided below. 

Directive Wording 
The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial 

conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth 

in output.  To further its long-run objectives, the Committee in the 

immediate future seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with 

MAINTAINING/increasing/REDUCING the federal funds rate 

AT/to an average of around ____________ 2-1/2 percent. 

Risk Assessments  

A. The Committee perceives that, if the current target for the federal funds 

rate were maintained for the next few quarters, it is more likely than not 

that output would grow at a pace faster than is sustainable and inflation 

pressures would pick up.  However, the pace at which policy 

accommodation will be removed to contain those risks will depend on 

economic prospects.  

B. The Committee perceives that, with appropriate policy action, the upside 

and downside risks to the attainment of both sustainable growth and 

price stability should be kept roughly equal.  With underlying inflation 

expected to be relatively low, the Committee believes that policy 

accommodation can be removed at a pace that is likely to be measured; 

nonetheless, the Committee will respond to changes in economic 

prospects as needed to fulfill its obligation to maintain price stability. 

C. The Committee perceives that, if the current target for the federal funds 

rate were maintained for the next few quarters, it is more likely than not 

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 25 of 37



that output would grow at a pace faster than is sustainable and inflation 

pressures would pick up.  However, the pace at which policy 

accommodation will be removed to contain those risks will depend on 

economic prospects.

Inflation Indicator Based on M2 and Two
Estimates of V*

Note. P* is defined to equal M2 times V* divided by potential GDP. Long-run velocity (V*) is estimated from
1959:Q1 to 1989:Q4. V* after 1992 is estimated from 1993:Q1 to present. For the forecast period, P* is based
on staff M2 forecast and P is simulated using a short-run dynamic model relating P to P*. Vertical lines
mark crossing of P and P*. Dashed areas denote projection period.
