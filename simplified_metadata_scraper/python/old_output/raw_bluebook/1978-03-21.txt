Prefatory Note 

 
 

The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain. 
 

Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a redaction process that removed information obtained on a 
confidential basis.  All redacted passages are exempt from disclosure under applicable 
provisions of the Freedom of Information Act.    

 

                                                 
1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked 
and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not 
reliably recognized by the OCR process and were not checked or corrected by staff.

Recent developments

(1) M-1 declined at about a 4 per cent annual rate in

February, but growth appears to have resumed in March and, over the

two months, is projected at about a per cent annual rate, slightly

below the lower end of the FOMC's range.1 / Reflecting weakness in

M-1, M-2 growth over the February-March period is projected at

around a 5 per cent annual rate, in the lower half of its range.

Large denomination time deposits included in M-2 have continued to

expand sharply in recent weeks, while flows into small time and

savings deposits have remained quite weak. Deposit growth at thrift

institutions has been relatively slow as well.

9.6 to 9.8 per cent. All tables on subsequent pages of this

report (with the exception of Tables 1 and 2 following the charts)
are based on the new series. The new and old series are compared
in Appendix III.

(2) The Account Manager aimed for a Federal funds rate

of around 6¾ per cent throughout the intermeeting period, even

though M-1 and M-2 growth weakened relative to their respective

ranges. The FOMC, in a telephone meeting on March 10, decided to

retain the 6¾ per cent funds rate target for the time being in view

of the weakness of the dollar in international exchange markets and

the probability that the economic effects of the prolonged coal

strike and severe weather were temporarily depressing the aggregates.

(3) With Federal funds trading steadily at rates around 6¾

per cent, private short-term interest rates have remained essentially

unchanged since the February FOMC meeting. Treasury bill rates,

however, have edged down a bit further over this period, mainly in

response to continued large foreign central bank acquisitions of

these securities. In addition, the volume of Treasury bill financing

has been somewhat smaller than previously anticipated, reflecting

a short-fall in Federal outlays and lagging disbursements of tax

refunds. Bond yields also have edged lower as the volume of public

bond offerings by corporations and State and local governments has

remained moderate.

(4) Yields in both primary and secondary sectors of the

mortgage market have stayed about unchanged since late February,

following their advance earlier in the first quarter. However, with

deposit inflows still sluggish, S&L's have continued their sizable

borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Banks. As a result, the thrifts



-3-

probably have continued to become less accommodative in extending new

loan commitments and appear to be tightening lending terms.

(5) The table on the next page shows (in terms of percentage

annual rates of change) related monetary and financial flows over

various time periods.

Prospective developments

(6) The table below presents for Committee consideration

three alternative sets of specifications for the monetary aggregates

and the Federal funds rate for the forthcoming intermeeting period.

(More detailed and longer-term data for the aggregates are shown in

the tables on pp. 6 and 7.)

Ranges for March-April

M-2 6½ to 10½ 6 to 10 5½ to 9½

Federal funds rate 6 to 6½ 6½ to 7 7 to 7½
(Intermeeting period)

(7) Each of the alternatives is consistent with the growth

ranges for QIV '77 to QIV '78--as indexed by M-1 growth in a 4 to 6½

per cent range--adopted by the Committee at its February meeting and

each requires that interest rates would rise over the balance of

the year in order to constrain growth in the aggregates to the mid-

point of the longer-run ranges. Under alternative B, the Federal

funds rate would be expected to remain unchanged over the inter-

meeting period and then begin rising thereafter, reaching about 8

per cent by fall. The near-term decline in the funds rate contemplated

1/ The ranges are based on the revised series for the monetary
aggregates, described in Appendix III. The benchmark revision
raised the growth of M-1 and M-2 in 1977 by .4 and .2 of a
percentage point. The impact of the revision was reported orally
to the FOMC at its last meeting, when the current longer-run
ranges were established.

under alternative A would likely require a greater rise in this

rate over the summer and fall. Under alternative C, restraint would

begin earlier; thus the required upward adjustments in the funds

rate over 1978 would be somewhat less.1/ The levels of interest

rates consistent with each alternative imply continued relatively

slow growth of interest-bearing deposits subject to rate ceilings

at banks and thrift institutions, even though the projections of

deposit aggregates assume a 50 basis point increase in time deposit

ceiling rates in the months ahead.

(8) It is likely that the recent weakness in M-1 growth

will be reversed over the near-term. The abatement of severe

weather conditions is expected to contribute to an acceleration

of economic activity and an associated pick-up in money demand.

Moreover, tax refunds are expected to accelerate in coming weeks,

thus temporarily buoying money balances in March-April. In addition,

the restraining impact on money demand of the relatively sharp increase

in interest rates from the spring to the fall of last year by now

probably has been exhausted, and short-term rate increases since fall

have been relatively small, about 1/4 of a percentage point.

(9) Against this background, M-1 growth is expected to

accelerate in the weeks ahead. Given the Federal funds rate assump-

tion of alternative B--with the rate centered at the 6¾ per cent

1/ See Appendix I for projected Federal funds rate under each
alternative. Appendix II displays the implied velocities of
M-1 and M-2 associated with each alternative.



level prevailing since early January--M-1 growth over March-April

is likely to be in a 4 to 9 per cent annual rate range.

(10) Growth in M-2 over this period is expected to be in a

6 to 10 per cent annual rate range under alternative B. As has

been the case since last fall, savings deposits at commercial banks

are projected to remain essentially unchanged. Temporary inflows

from larger than seasonal tax refunds may do little more than offset

deposit weakness caused by the large differential between market

rates and the ceiling rate on passbook savings accounts. With

market yields also above the effective ceiling rates on all maturities

of small denomination time deposits at commercial banks, such deposits

are likely to grow only moderately in the March-April period. However,

loan demands are expected to remain relatively strong; thus banks

are likely to continue aggressively to offer large denomination time

deposits in order to supplement their deposit base. A major portion

of these deposits is included in M-2. Consequently the interest-

bearing component of this aggregate is projected to continue to

expand at an 8 to 9 per cent seasonally adjusted annual rate.

(11) The modest pace of inflows to thrift institutions

can be expected to persist in March-April under alternative B.

Growth of deposits at mutual savings banks and savings and loan

associations, combined, may be around a 6 to 7 per cent annual rate.

Over subsequent months, the assumed increase in deposit rate ceilings

would keep deposit inflows to thrifts from eroding further as market



-10-

interest rates rise. Reductions in thrift portfolio

liquidity and increased borrowings from the Federal Home Loan

Banks and from other sources are thus likely to continue in order

to finance takedowns of existing commitments. Moreover, further

reductions in new commitment activity and in spot purchases of

mortgages from mortgage bankers and others can be expected.

(12) If the Federal funds rate remains at the 6¾ per

cent level contemplated under alternative B, short- and intermediate-

term interest rates over the intermeeting period are likely to

remain near their current levels. Some upward rate pressures

might develop as accelerating economic activity bolsters financing

demands of businesses at banks and in the commercial paper market.

In addition, Treasury borrowing in short- and intermediate-term

markets between now and mid-April will be relatively heavy.

Potential upward rate pressures in the short-term sector will tend

to be offset, however, by market anticipation of the substantial

pay-down of Treasury bills following the mid-April tax date.

Moreover, rates on shorter-term Treasury securities could remain

low relative to other market rates, should foreign central banks

continue to acquire large amounts of such securities as a result

of their intervention activities in foreign exchange markets.

(13) Under alternative B, mortgage rates might rise

somewhat further in the intermeeting period as thrifts adjust

lending policies in response to sustained weak deposit inflows.



- 1-

Bond yields, however, are expected to be essentially unchanged. The

forward calendar for corporate issues remains relatively modest and

institutional demands large. Furthermore, the forward calendar for

tax-exempt offerings continues below the exceptional 1977 level and

interest in such issues by fire and casualty insurance companies,

commercial banks, and individuals are projected to remain sizable.

(14) Alternative C contemplates an increase in the Federal

funds rate to the mid-point of a 7 to 7-1/2 per cent range between now

and mid-April. Growth in M-1 in the March-April period would probably

be in a 4 to 9 per cent and M-2 in a 5-1/2 to 9-1/2 per cent annual

rate range. Although the market is expecting some tightening of policy

later this spring, an increase in the Federal funds rate over the

near-term apparently is not being anticipated by market participants,

given the recent moderation of growth in the monetary aggregates.

The 3-month bill might move into a 6-5/8--6-3/4 per cent area, and

there would be commensurate adjustment in other short-term rates.

Member bank borrowing from the discount window would rise substantially,

producing expectations of an upward adjustment in the discount rate.

Such borrowing has been relatively low recently, and no banks are under

administrative pressure at the window.

(15) The sizable increase in short-term rates likely to

develop under alternative C would probably be accompanied by only

modest upward pressure on bond yields in the intermeeting period.



-12-

As previously noted, new bond offerings are expected to be modest

and institutional investment demand strong. By contributing to

slower deposit inflows, however, alternative C would add to near-term

upward pressure on mortgage rates and increase the need for an

adjustment in deposit ceiling rates.

(16) An easing of the Federal funds rate to around 6¼

per cent, as contemplated under alternative A, would be very

surprising to the market in light of the weakness of the dollar

in foreign exchange markets and recent indications of acceleration in

the rise of wholesale and retail prices. In addition, if staff pro-

jections are correct, such an easing action would be taking place

in conjunction with publication of accelerated growth in M-1. Short-

term market rates would decline, with the 3-month Treasury bill rate

possibly falling below 6 per cent. The value of the dollar would

probably decline in international exchange markets. Long-term interest

rates would probably decline little, since market participants would

likely view such an action as temporary. Indeed, as noted earlier,

interest rates would soon need to begin rising in order to restrain

growth in the aggregates to the mid-point of their longer-run ranges,

and by autumn would have to reach levels higher than under alternatives

B and C.



-13-

Directive language

(17) Given below are alternatives for the operational

paragraphs of the directive. The first formulation places main

emphasis on near-term rates of growth in monetary aggregates. The

second formulation, like the directive adopted at the last meeting,

places main emphasis on money market conditions; it shows--in strike-

through form--the specifications adopted at the last meeting. As

suggested below, the particular language needed in the opening lines

of the money market formulation would depend on the specific condi-

tions sought; the three alternatives shown--calling, respectively,

for somewhat easier, prevailing, and somewhat firmer money market

conditions--are intended to be associated with the specifications

discussed in the preceding section under alternatives A, B, and C.

"Monetary Aggregates" Formulation

The Committee seeks to encourage near-term rates of growth

in M-1 and M-2 on a path believed to be reasonably consistent

with the longer-run ranges for monetary aggregates cited in the

preceding paragraph. Specifically, at present, it expects the

annual growth rates over the March-April period to be within

ranges of ____ to ____ per cent for M-1 and ____ to

____ per cent for M-2. In the judgment of the Committee such

growth rates are likely to be associated with a weekly-average

Federal funds rate of about ____ per cent. If, giving approx-

imately equal weight to M-1 and M-2, it appears that growth rates



-14-

over the 2-month period will deviate significantly from the

midpoints of the indicated ranges, the operational objective

for the Federal funds rate shall be modified in an orderly

fashion within a range of ______ to ______ per cent. In

the conduct of day-to-day operations, account shall be taken

of emerging financial market conditions, including the condi-

tions in foreign exchange markets.

If it appears during the period before the next meeting

that the operating constraints specified above are proving to

be significantly inconsistent, the Manager is promptly to notify

the Chairman who will then decide whether the situation calls

for supplementary instructions from the Committee.

"Money Market" Formulation

At this time, the Committee seeks to maintain about the

prevailing money market conditions (OR TO ACHIEVE SOMEWHAT

EASIER OR SOMEWHAT FIRMER MONEY MARKET CONDITIONS) during the

period immediately ahead, provided that monetary aggregates

appear to be growing at approximately the rates currently

expected, which are believed to be on a path reasonably con-

sistent with the longer-run ranges for monetary aggregates

cited in the preceding paragraph. Specifically, the Committee

seeks to maintain the weekly-average Federal funds rate at

about the current level (OR TO REDUCE OR TO INCREASE THE WEEKLY-

AVERAGE FEDERAL FUNDS RATE SOMEWHAT FROM THE CURRENT LEVEL) ____,



-15-

so long as M-1 and M-2 appear to be growing over the [DEL: February-

March] MARCH-APRIL period at annual rates within ranges of [DEL: 1 to 6]

______ TO ______ per cent and [DEL: 4-1/2 to 8-1/2] ______ TO ______

per cent, respectively. If, giving approximately equal weight

to M-1 and M-2, it appears that growth rates over the 2-month

period are approaching or moving beyond the limits of the indicated

ranges, the operational objective for the weekly-average Federal

funds rate shall be modified in an orderly fashion within a range

of [DEL: 6-1/2-to-7] ____ TO ____ per cent. In the conduct of day-

to-day operations, account shall be taken of emerging financial

market conditions, including the conditions in foreign exchange

markets.

If it appears during the period before the next meeting that

the operating constraints specified above are proving to be signif-

icantly inconsistent, the Manager is promptly to notify the Chair-

man who will then decide whether the situation calls for supplementary

instructions from the Committee.

APPENDIX III

Revisions in the Monetary Aggregates

Benchmark adjustments for domestic nonmember banks and revised

seasonal factors have been incorporated into the money stock series and

related data. The benchmark adjustments are based on the most recent

call report data and go back to December 1976. Seasonal factors have

been revised to incorporate an additional year of data and adjustments

resulting from the Board staff's annual review of these factors. Growth

rates for the revised M1 and M2 in 1977 are 7.8 and 9.8 per cent,

respectively, as compared with rates of 7.4 and 9.6 per cent for the old

series. The impact of benchmark and seasonal factor changes on monthly,

quarterly, and annual M1 and M2 growth rates for 1977 are shown in

Tables III-1 and 111-2.

The benchmark adjustments are based on corrected data for

the universe of domestic nonmember banks for December 1976 as well as

such universe figures for March, June, and September 1977. The

adjustments added $400 million to M1 at the end of 1976 and $1.6 billion

to the level of M at the end of 1977. The level of M2 was reduced

by $400 million at the end of 1976 and was raised by $1.4 billion at

the end of 1977. As shown in column 4 of Tables III-I and 111-2, over

the year 1977, on a quarterly average basis (QIV '76 to QIV '77), the

benchmark adjustment added 0.4 percentage point to M1 and 0.2 to M2 .

For MI, the benchmark added about 1 percentage point to the growth

rate in the first half of the year, but had essentially no effect on

growth in the second half of the year.



III - 2

Seasonal revisions, shown in the last column of

Tables III-1 and III-2, smoothed the quarterly and the monthly

data by considerably reducing bulges in growth of M-l that had

occurred in April, July, and October of last year. Bulges in

April and October had also developed in 1976. Growth in these

months is still quite strong, however, possibly indicating develop-

ment of a new seasonal pattern not yet fully captured in tne

seasonal adjustment procedure.

NOTE: Government security dealer trading positions are on a commitment basis. Trading positions, which exclude Treasury securities financed by repurchase
agreements maturing in 16 days or more, are indicators of dealer holdings available for sale over the near-term. Underwriting syndicate positions consist
of issues still in syndicate, excluding trading positions. The basic reserve deficit is excess reserves less borrowing at Federal Reserve less net Federal
funds purchases. Weekly data are daily averages for statement weeks, except for corporate and municipal issues in syndicate which are Friday figures.

* Strictly confidential.
** Monthly averages for excess reserves and borrowings are weighted averages of statement week figures.
