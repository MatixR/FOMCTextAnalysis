Prefatory Note 
 
 
The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version available 
based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the Board 
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was created 
through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned 
versions text-searchable.2   Though a stringent quality assurance process was 
employed, some imperfections may remain. 
 
Please note that some material may have been redacted from this document if that

Recent developments

(1) Changes in RPD's and the monetary aggregates have fallen

short of the Committee's September-October ranges of tolerance, as

the accompanying table shows. In the case of M1, the net contraction

already evident in August continued in September, perhaps in part because

market participants moved out of cash into securities in anticipation of

interest rate declines. A very slight decline also appears to be in

train for October. Growth in M2 was restrained mainly by the contraction

in M1, as expansion in consumer-type time deposits at banks continued to

be fairly strong. The largest shortfall relative to Committee targets

was in RPD's; this was associated not only with weakness in M1 but also

to a great extent with the sharp recent declines in the outstanding

amount of large CD's.

(2) The adjusted credit proxy appears to be growing in the

September-October target period at only about a 3-1/2 per cent annual

rate, the slowest two month pace since early 1970. Banks have been

less eager to issue large CD's in light of the recent moderation in

business loan expansion. There have also been market reports that large

banks have come to prefer overnight Federal funds borrowing as compared

with CD's, given recent expectations of declining short-term rates.

(3) The recent shrinkage of M 1 and the reduced growth of other

money and credit aggregates created market anticipations that System

operations were likely to add to downward pressures on interest rates.

For this reason market attention was closely riveted on the day-to-day

pattern of Desk operations, especially their relationship to the pre-

vailing level of the Federal funds rate. When Desk transactions appeared

to indicate some willingness to supply reserves more aggressively,

market interest rates declined sharply, particularly in the short-term

sector. During the inter-meeting period short-term yields were off

generally 100 to 150 basis points. Among key rates, the 90-day Treasury

bill yield showed the largest decline, moving down from about 8.70

per cent at the time of the last meeting to an interim low of 6.94 per

cent, and trading most recently at about 7.15 per cent. Bond yields

characteristically have shown more moderate inter-meeting declines,

ranging generally from 15 to 30 basis points.



-3-

(4) By late September, incoming data began to indicate that all

of the money and reserve aggregates were falling below the Committee's

ranges of tolerance. At the same time, the Federal funds rate was tending

above the 10-3/4 per cent upper limit of the Committee's range of tolerance.

In these circumstances, the Desk moved against shortfalls in the aggregates

through sizable reserve supplying operations. However, because market

interest rates had already dropped sharply in anticipation of a policy

modification, and in view of the provision in the directive to take account

of financial market conditions, the Desk avoided overly aggressive actions

for fear of further exacerbating the general rate decline.

(5) Since developing market circumstances had led to incon-

sistencies in the instructions under which the Manager was operating, a

telephone meeting was held on October 2. The Committee directed the

Manager to provide reserves at a pace consistent with an average Federal

funds rate of 10-1/2 per cent. At a second telephone meeting on October 10,

when more current data indicated a further shortfall in the money and

reserve aggregates, the constraint on the Federal funds rate was relaxed,

with the Manager directed to move in stages to 10-1/4 and then, if new

data confirmed the weakness in the aggregates, to 10 per cent. As the

money market eased in the first two statement weeks of October, member

bank borrowings dropped to an average of about $1.4 billion, after

averaging $1.9 billion in September.

(6) Nonbank thrift institutions had a more favorable deposit

experience in September as net outflows (seasonally unadjusted) slowed



-4-

appreciably. In early October, preliminary data for large New York City

savings banks show sizable net savings losses, but partial data for other

savings banks and for savings and loan associations were more favorable.

The combination of recent rate declines in securities markets and reduced

concern about deposit outflows at thrift institutions has contributed on

balance to a leveling off of mortgage rates.

(7) The table on the next page shows (in percentage annual rates

of change) selected monetary and financial flows over various recent

time periods. Appendix Table III compares money supply growth rates computed

on a quarterly-average basis with those computed on a last-month-of-quarter

basis.

Prospective developments

(8) Three alternatives for Committee consideration summarized

below include growth rates for M1 over the fourth and first quarters at

annual rates of 6-1/2 per cent alt. A), 5 per cent (alt. B), and 3-1/2

per cent (alt. C). As shown in the chart on the following page, the

6-1/2 per cent growth rate of alternative A returns M1 by March of next

year to a long-run 5-1/4 per cent growth path (illustrated by the dashed

line). The 5 per cent growth rate of alternative B brings M1 by March

to a 4-1/2 per cent trend line (shown by the dotted line on the chart)

that starts from the September money supply estimate available at the

last Committee meeting. This line represents the longer-run path

associated in the last Bluebook with the short-run targets adopted by the

Committee at its September meeting.

(9) Given the lagged effects on money demand of the interest

rate increases of earlier this year, the staff believes that attainment of the

growth rates for reserves and monetary aggregates specified in alternative B

is likely to involve a further decline in the Federal funds rate over the

near-term. A sharper decline in the funds rate would be likely under A.

Under alternative C, money market conditions seem most likely to remain

around those prevailing recently, given the more restrained growth in

reserves and the aggregates posited.

(10) RPD growth for October-November of course becomes larger

the easier are the policy alternatives. While the differences in RPD

growth in the short-run are modest, the differences in growth of non-

borrowed reserves are larger in order to compensate, under the easier

alternatives, for the further drop in member bank borrowings that would

be envisaged. The unchanged money market conditions of alternative C

encompass a Federal funds rate centered in a 9-1/2--10-1/2 per cent range

and member bank borrowings that fluctuate around $1.5 billion. To attain

the aggregates specified under B, the Federal funds rate would be expected

to decline toward the lower part of the 8-3/4--1-l/4 per cent range

indicated, and average member bank borrowings may decline to around

$1.3 billion. Under A, the funds rate could drop considerably further

to around 8 per cent and member bank borrowings to around $1 billion.

However, it has become very difficult in recent weeks to anticipate shifts

in member bank demands for borrowing as market conditions change, and

these estimates of borrowing could even be a bit on the high side.



(11) Under alternative C, unless the Federal funds rate declines

to the lower end of the indicated range, Treasury bill rates are likely

to move somewhat higher, as expectations of additional easing in monetary

policy are disappointed. Upward pressure on bill rates is likely to be

larger in the event that the Treasury were to offer additional bills for

payment late this month or in connection with the mid-November refunding

operation (the refunding of $3.7 billion of outstanding publicly-held

debt will be announced October 24). Under alternative B, and even more

so under A, short-term market interest rates are likely to decline over

the next few weeks as market expectations of further easing in policy

are confirmed. Bank prime rates probably would be reduced, and some

further rate declines would be likely to occur in long-term markets.

(12) Although the interest rate declines anticipated under the

easing alternatives might be fairly sharp, it is quite likely that rates

will turn around, particularly under alternative B. This assumes that

the economy expands as projected in the Greenbook and therefore that the

underlying transactions demand for money will be relatively well maintained

and credit demands will be fairly strong. Thus, under alternative B, bill

rates might be back in the neighborhood of current levels, or perhaps

above them, by around year-end. The degree of any reversal would be

tempered, however, if it proves necessary to reduce the funds rate

somewhat below the bottom of the alternative B range later this year in

order to achieve the desired monetary growth path.



-9-

(13) With resumed growth in November more than offsetting a

small decline in October, M 1 would expand at a modest rate over the two

month period. Expansion is expected to continue into the first quarter

of 1974 as transactions demands remain moderately strong, the retarding

effect of interest rate increases earlier this year wears off, and recent

interest rate declines further strengthen money demand.

(14) Other key assumptions underlying the monetary relation-

ships discussed in this bluebook are: (1) resumed expansion of out-

standing large negotiable CD's, as banks experience moderate business

loan growth and seek to offset a run-off on balance in U.S. Government

deposits between now and year-end; (2) expansion of other time and

savings deposits at banks at a moderate rate under alternative C as

money market conditions remain unchanged and short-term interest rates

rise from current levels, with net inflows strengthening under the

easier conditions of alternatives B and A; (3) reimposition of some

sort of interest rate ceilings on consumer-type certificates maturing

in 4 years or more at banks and other savings institutions, with the

ceiling structure working to redistribute savings flows at the margin

toward nonbank savings institutions.



-10-

Proposed directive language

(15) Presented below are three alternative formulations for

the operational paragraph of the directive, which are intended to

correspond to the similarly lettered policy alternatives discussed in

the preceding section. For all three alternatives it is proposed to

retain the instruction to take account of international and domestic

financial market developments and to add a reference to the forthcoming

Treasury financing. Alternatives A and C refer to the average growth

rates in the monetary aggregates "than has occurred thus far this

year." The annual rates of growth from December 1972 to September 1973

are as follows: M1, 4.2 per cent; M2, 6.9 per cent; and the bank credit

proxy, 13.0 per cent.

Alternative A

To implement this policy, while taking account OF THE FORTHCOMING

TREASURY FINANCING AND of international and domestic financial

market developments, the Committee seeks to achieve bank reserve and

money market conditions consistent with [DEL: moderate] FASTER growth in

monetary aggregates over the months ahead THAN HAS OCCURRED THUS

FAR THIS YEAR.

Alternative B

To implement this policy, while taking account OF THE FORTHCOMING

TREASURY FINANCING AND of international and domestic financial

market developments, the Committee seeks to achieve bank reserve and

money market conditions consistent with moderate growth in monetary

aggregates over the months ahead.



-11-

Alternative C

To implement this policy, while taking account OF THE FORTH-

COMING TREASURY FINANCING AND of international and domestic

financial market developments, the Committee seeks to achieve bank

reserve and money market conditions consistent with [DEL: moderate]

SOMEWHAT SLOWER growth in monetary aggregates over the months

ahead THAN HAS OCCURRED THUS FAR THIS YEAR.
