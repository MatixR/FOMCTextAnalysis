The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain. 
 

Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a redaction process that removed information obtained on a

scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked

MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Recent developments

(1) M1-B growth, adjusted for shifts into NOW accounts, rose to

an 81 percent annual rate in November, and continued rapid in early December.

The strength in M1-B reflected a marked pickup in other checkable deposits,

while demand deposits also rose a little (in contrast to marked declines over

the first three quarters of the year). The exceptional strength in OCDs

growth may be associated with the public's desire to accumulate passbook

savings type assets in light of uncertainty about the near-term course of

economic activity and interest rates. Growth in M-B over the October to

December period probably will be at about a 7¾ percent annual rate (assuming

an appreciable decline in the level of M1-B over the last half of December).

Despite the recent pickup, QIV '80 to QIV '81 growth in adjusted M1-B will

be only about 2 percent, well below the Committee's 3½ to 6 percent longer-

run range. (Recent monetary and reserves data are shown in the table on the

next page.)

(2) M2 expansion surged to a 16½ percent annual rate in November,

and is estimated at a 14½ percent annual rate over the two-month October to

December period--considerably more than expected at the time of the last

meeting. M2 growth was buoyed by continued brisk inflows to money market

funds and by a turnaround in savings deposit flows to a modest increase

following a steady decline for more than a year. For the QIV '80 to QIV '81

period, M2 is expected to grow at a 9½ percent rate, above the Committee's

6 to 9 percent longer-run range. Reflecting the strength in M2, M3 growth

also has accelerated recently, and remains well above the upper end of the

Committee's longer-run range.

(3) Bank credit expansion slowed in November to a 3 percent

annual rate, due mainly to a continued reduction in holdings of U.S. govern-

ment securities and a further moderation in the growth of business loans.

The weak loan growth, coupled with stronger inflows to core deposits,

allowed commercial banks to run off large time deposits for the second con-

secutive month in November. S&Ls, however, continued to issue such deposits

at the appreciable pace of other recent months, with the premium over

offering rates of commercial banks reduced from the unusually high spread

of last summer.

(4) Total reserves are expected to grow at a 6 percent annual

rate over the last two months of the year, reflecting the increase in

required reserves associated with the strength in the aggregates. Non-

borrowed reserves are likely to expand at about an 11 percent rate over

this interval as adjustment borrowing in December will be down from its

October level. In the first two weeks of the intermeeting period, adjust-

ment borrowing averaged only about $200 million. As M1 and M2 strengthened,

the increase in required reserves was accompanied by a rise in adjustment

borrowings. During the past two statement weeks, borrowing averaged $380

million; this was less than the $450-500 million implied by the reserve

path, as banks economized on excess reserves.1/ The reduced level of

borrowing early in the period, and the one percentage point decline in the

discount rate to 12 percent on December 3, contributed to a further easing

are shown in appendix.

in the federal funds rate to the 11 to 12 percent area in early December

from 13 to 13 1/2 percent at the time of the November meeting. Most recently

federal funds have been trading in a 12 to 12 1/2 percent range.

(5) Both short- and long-term interest rates continued to decline

early in the intermeeting period, responding to the further easing in money

market conditions and the weakness of economic activity. Rates subsequently

backed up, however, owing to strength in the monetary aggregates, reports of

Administration estimates of a greatly enlarged budget deficit, and a rise

in the funds rate to levels above the discount rate. At present, market

rates are generally above levels prevailing at the time of the previous

Committee meeting, but the prime loan rate is down one percentage point

and primary mortgage rates have dropped about 3/4 of a point.

(6) After declining through late November, the dollar rebounded

with the recent rise in U.S. short-term interest rates to post a small

net advance on a weighted average basis since the last Committee meeting.

Political developments abroad and more favorable inflation expectations

for the United States also contributed to the strength of the dollar.

Background for preliminary consideration of target ranges for 1982

(7) The growth ranges for the aggregates in 1982 tentatively set

by the FOMC in July are 2-1/2 to 5-1/2 percent for M1, 6 to 9 percent for M2,

6-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent for M3, and 6 to 9 percent for bank credit. With the

exception of M1, these are the same ranges that were set for 1981. The M1

range is a reduction from the 1981 range of 3-1/2 to 6 percent for M-B,

shift adjusted.1/

(8) As statistical background for consideration of the annual

targets for 1982, the table on the next page shows actual growth of money

supply measures for the years 1977 through 1981. Annual growth in M-B

measured from QIV to QIV decelerated gradually over the last few years,

followed by a sharper drop-off in 1981, particularly on a shift-adjusted

basis. But whether the marked deceleration in shift-adjusted M1-B this year

accurately measures the degree of greater restraint depends in part on

whether there was a downward shift in money demand (relative to nominal income

and interest rates). In the degree that there was such a shift, slower growth

1/ The nomenclature "M1" represents the same measure as M1-B. It is assumed
that, consistent with earlier FOMC discussion, the distinction between
M1-A and M1-B will be dropped and that M1-A will not be published (though
its components will be). Moreover, it has also been assumed that the FOMC
will not wish to continue with the "shift-adjusted" concept. It has been
a year since NOW accounts were introduced nationwide and the great bulk of
the conversion of outstanding savings and other interest-bearing deposits
into newly established NOW accounts has apparently already taken place.
It is likely that the public learned about nationwide NOW accounts more
rapidly than they did when these accounts were first introduced in New
England, when significant conversions of accounts continued over several
years. This is supported by reports from a sampling of banks in mid-
November that suggest the stock adjustment is about over. In addition,
growth in the number of NOW accounts has tailed off considerably since
summer. Nonetheless, it should be recognized that further structural
shifts of funds into NOW accounts might develop, and need to be adjusted
for, should, say, regulatory changes by DIDC change the nature of the
the account.

would not indicate more restraint but would represent an accommodation to the

shift in public preference away from narrow money assets to other assets. It

is difficult to judge the extent of sach hifts in practice. Econometric

results, supported by more direct evidence of changing cash management

practices, suggest a fairly substantial downward shift in desired M1 balances

this year. This would indicate that the "effective" deceleration in money

could be considerably less than measured.

(9) With regard to the broader aggregates, there has been no

measured deceleration over recent years .M And this year, their growth

has been above the upper limits of the ranges set for them, markedly so in

the case of M3. However, the broader aggregates, like Ml, have also been

subject to demand shifts. If, for instance, allowance were made for shifts

from market assets to money market funds, the growth in the broader Ms would

be reduced, particularly in the past two years.1/ In addition, broader

Ms have been subject to other structural changes this year, such as the

further deregulation of time deposit accounts by removing the cap on the

SSC ceiling rate effective at the beginning of August, a more active use

of retail RPs by depository institutions, and the introduction of ASCs at

the beginning of October.

(10) Among the considerations entering into the Committee's

decision about ranges for the aggregates in 1982 would be the need to con-

tinue to show determination to slow money growth over time. In that context,

the Committee's intention to continue a policy of gradually reducing growth

over time would be signalled by a lower target range for 1982 than for 1981,

even if actual growth in M1 next year were to be more rapid than the rela-

tively low rate of this year (on a QIV to QIV basis). Following past

Committee practice, the range for M1 next year would take off from its level

in the fourth quarter of 1981, which is given by the actual level of M1-B,

2/
not shift adjusted. Another approach would be to take off from the

targeted level for 1981 (say, either the bottom or the midpoint of the

1/ Estimates based on responses from Michigan surveys and on assumptions
about institutional behavior in the absence of money market funds
suggest that M2 growth could be reduced by a percentage point or so
in the past two years, more in 1981 and less in 1980.

2/ The series does not link onto shift-adjusted M1-B because the latter
series excludes that portion of NOW accounts which represents funds
that would, in the absence of nationwide NOW accounts have been in
other interest-bearing assets in 1981. Those accounts, totaling about
$12 billion in the fourth quarter of 1981, are of course included in
M1.



-8-

1981 range).1/ However, to the extent that there was in fact a downward

shift in money demand in 1981, such an approach would lead to a higher

level of money in 1982 than was warranted by the Committee's basic policy

intentions.

(11) From another viewpoint, though, a higher range for M1

(taking off from the actual QIV '81 level) or perhaps a further widening

by raising the upper end, might be considered on the grounds that it may be

needed to encourage satisfactory economic recovery, especially if the view

is also taken that there may be no, or only a minor, downward shift in

money demand relative to income and interest rates next year. An increase

in the upper end of the range might also be considered to allow for the

possibility that either significantly lower market interest rates (a

possibility, for example, if inflation improves more than anticipated) or

actions by DIDC to make NOW accounts significantly more attractive would

occasion a surge in such deposits and substantial upward pressures on M1.

The offsetting risk to such an approach, however, is the possibility that

1/ The relevant range for this purpose would be the 6 to 8-1/2 percent
growth in measured M-B that was indicated by the Committee in early
1981 to be consistent with the basic shift-adjusted target of 3-1/2
to 6 percent. The 2-1/2 point difference between the two reflects the
estimate made than of shifts into NOW accounts from interest-bearing
assets. In the event it appears that such an estimate was approximately
correct. The shift appears to have been equivalent to about a 2-3/4
percent differential. The increase in NOW accounts outside the
Northeast (net of transfers from ATS accounts) in 1981 (QIV '80 to
QIV '81) was about $45 billion, with the fraction coming from interest-
bearing assets estimated at just over 1/4 for the year on the basis of
reports from depository institutions. At mid-year, the staff had
estimated an increase of $50 billion, with about the same fractional
shift from interest-bearing assets. Thus, the behavior of NOW accounts
on balance has been about as expected. M1-B growth was weaker than
targeted-whether shift-adjusted or not--because of shortfalls in
currency and demand deposits that presumably at least in part reflected
a downward shift in money demand.



-9-

public would construe an increase in the tentative range as reflecting

a diminution in the Federal Reserve's determination to curb money growth,

given the need to finance large budgetary deficits.

(12) Reductions, rather than increases, in the tentative M1

range, or at least in the lower end of it, might be considered if a

continued sizable downward shift in money demand (given income and interest

rates) is anticipated next year. The staff's GNP projection, based on

4 percent M1 growth, assumes a shift on the order of 2-1/2 percentage

points on the basis of our conventional quarterly money demand equation.

The low end of the tentative range provides scope for a larger shift. If

market interest rates remain high next year-and we are projecting that

rates will, on average, exceed current levels-there will be continued

incentive for financial innovations, such as the proposed sweeps of NOW and

demand deposit accounts into money market funds, that may work to reduce

M1 balances considerably.

(13) Attainment of the tentative 1982 ranges for the broader Ms

would represent a deceleration in their measured growth. From that view-

point, there may be little need to consider a further lowering of those

ranges at this time. While some little lowering might not be inconsistent

with a view that price increases will be lower in 1982 and that real income

growth will be weak (particularly if one held the view that such a combi-

nation would lead to weaker nominal income growth than the 8-1/2 percent

projected by the staff), the credibility of a reduced range might be in

doubt given this year's results. Moreover, with more deregulation possibly

in prospect for next year, a case might also be made for adjusting the

ranges upward, at least for M2, to accommodate a more favorable competitive

position for depository institutions relative to market instruments. A



-10-

more particular question may also be raised about the interpretation for

purposes of monetary policy of a possible increase in M2 from a liberali-

zation of tax and deposit ceiling rate regulations on IRAs; indeed, whether

these accounts should be included in M2 is uncertain given their role as a

vehicle for long-term savings. The staff currently projects in 1982 M2

would grow by 8-1/2 percent, and M3 just a shade faster, given M1 growth of

4 percent (the midpoint of the tentative 2-1/2 to 5-1/2 percent range) and

our nominal GNP projection.

(14) Uncertainties about the impact of ongoing changes in

financial technology on the public's holdings of deposits and closely related

assets argue for retaining long-run target ranges for money as wide as 3

percentage points. Indeed, given the particular uncertainties about M1

at this juncture in the development of financial services and markets, one

might even argue that its range should be somewhat wider. In addition to

the issues noted in paragraphs (11) and (12), the interpretation of M1, and

its proper setting as a target, could be affected by its changing composition.

With relatively more of the aggregate held by consumers in NOW accounts,

which behave in part like savings accounts, the sensitivity of M1 demand to

both interest rates and income-and in turn the impact of M1 supply on

income-could be affected. However, we estimate that no more than roughly

5 percent of M1 represents NOW accounts that have been shifted from saving

balances.

Near-term Targets

(15) The upper panel of thetable below presents three alternative

specifications for the monetary aggregates during the first quarter of 1982.

Growth rates are measured from a QIV '81 average base-in part because of the

very preliminary nature of the December estimates of the aggregates-with the

alternatives designed to achieve growth of M1 by March consistent with the

upper, middle, and lower ends, respectively, of the FOMC's tentative long-

run range for that aggregate in 1982. Implied growth rates over the three

month December-to-March period, based on the staff's current December

estimates, are shown in the second panel. Possible ranges for the inter-

meeting federal funds rate are indicated in the last line of the table.

(More detailed and longer-run data for the monetary aggregates may be found

on the following page, and charts indicating the relationships of the alter-

native targets to the Committee's tentative longer-run ranges for 1982

(16) Alternative B calls for M1 growth from QIV '81 to March

at a 4 percent annual rate, but probably involves M2 growth slightly above

the upper end of its range. Growth of M1 from the estimated December level

to March would be at a slower 2¼ percent rate since the level of December is

high relative to the fourth quarter average. Growth of M2 over that period

would also be relatively moderate-at a 7-1/2 percent annual rate--for the

same reason.

(17) Assuming a continued downward shift in M1 demand, though at

a slower pace than last year, and a small increase in nominal GNP in the

first quarter, such a slowing in M1 growth from the recent pace may be

accompanied by little net change in short-term interest rates over the

next several weeks. However, both the economic outlook and the state of

money demand (given income and interest rates) are highly uncertain at

this juncture, so that an even wider range than usual should be placed around,

interest rate projections. For instance, strong downward pressures could

develop--more consistent with a normal cyclical pattern of short-term rates-

if the economic recession does not tend to abate early next year as assumed

in the GNP projection. On the other hand, upward pressures could emerge,

even with a weak GNP, if the demand for money were relatively strong either

because of a return to historical relationships or because economic uncer-

tainties caused the public to continue to save more than earlier in the year

and to hold part of this saving in NOW accounts.

(18) The alternative B specifications would require expansion in

total reserves at a 2 percent pace from December to March.1 / Assuming

adjustment borrowing in the $450 million area, nonborrowed reserves would

increase at a 1-1/2 percent rate and, at the present discount rate, the

-14-

federal funds rate in the intermeeting period would likely fluctuate up

in a 12 to 13 percent range. The 3-month Treasury bill could be expected

to trade in the 11 to 11-1/2 percent area, as sizable first quarter

Treasury financing demands make themselves felt in an environment in which

the money market shows no sign of easing.

(19) Private short-term credit demands are likely to remain weak,

partly as borrowing is fairly strong in bond markets and partly in connection

with projected inventory liquidation. Corporate borrowers who had postponed

bond issues in December because of the rebound in long-term rates, may

come back into the market early next year if they come to believe that the

cost of staying out will be higher than expected-especially with enlarged

Treasury offerings in prospect later in the year. Should corporate bond

yields remain near current levels, there may be some scope for a further

drop in interest rates on home mortgage commitments given the relatively

wide spread existing between bond and mortgage rates. Even though thrift

operating losses can be expected to moderate further at the projected short-

term interest rate level as high cost deposits are rolled over, their deposit

growth is not expected to be robust; this, together with continuing uncer-

tainties about future rate developments, is likely to discourage them from

aggressively offering mortgages.

(20) Alternative A calls for a 5-1/2 percent growth target for

M1 from the fourth quarter to March and 4-1/4 percent from the estimated

December level to March, and involves a greater risk that the level of M2

in the first quarter will be above the upper limit of its tentative

long-run range. This alternative would entail growth in total reserves at

a 4 percent annual rate over the first three months of the year. Assuming

a level of adjustment borrowing of around $250 million, nonborrowed



-15-

reserves would grow at a 6 percent rate. Such a pace of reserve provision

would likely be associated with a federal funds rate near or a little below

the current 12 percent discount rate. That probably would be accompanied

by a decline in short-term rates from recent levels, with the 3-month bill

perhaps around 10 to 10-1/2 percent. Bond yields are likely to decline some,

but declines might be limited by a sizable pickup in bond offerings as the

market viewed the decline as opening another "window". With an indication

of lower borrowing costs, thrift institutions would be somewhat more willing

to cut mortgage rates further and increase commitment activity.

(21) The contemplated modest decline in short-term interest

rates under alternative A might be accompanied by a tendency for the dollar

to decline on exchange markets. However, any decline could be short-lived,

or limited, as foreign central banks take advantage of any strengthening

in their currencies to lower their own interest rates further in light

of continued weak performance of their economies.

(22) Alternative C--which calls for virtually no growth in M1

between December and March--may be expected to bring M2 into the upper part

of its tentative long-run range by March. Essentially no growth in total

reserves would be involved, and assuming adjustment borrowing of $650 million,

nonborrowed reserves would decline at about a 2-1/2 percent rate in the first

quarter. A federal funds rate of perhaps 13 to 14 percent in the inter-

meeting period would be implied. Such a move in the funds rate would surprise

market participants, and a fairly substantial rise in other market interest

rates, at least temporarily, would tend to develop. The 3-month bill rate

would probably move to near 12-1/2 percent, the corporate bond rate might

approach 16 percent, and new issue volume would probably drop significantly



-16-

as firms return to short-term credit markets. Residential mortgage rates

would retrace part of their recent decline. The higher than expected level

of interest rates would tend to strengthen the dollar further in foreign

exchange markets and limit reductions in foreign interest rates.

(23) As 1982 progresses, short-term interest rates likely will

rise to levels above those currently prevailing, assuming M1 grows at the

midpoint of the FOMC's tentative range. The table below shows interest

rate forecasts for the year, assuming alternative B for the first quarter

and midpoint growth of M1 thereafter. These assumptions lie behind the

Greenbook GNP projection. Selection of alternative A might involve a

larger rise in rates later in the year to compensate for the greater near-

term monetary stimulus associated with this approach if the Committee desires

to slow money growth later in an effort to achieve midpoint growth for the

year. Alternative C, on the other hand, by exerting near-term restraint

would probably be associated with lower rate levels later in the year,

reflecting not only the greater scope for faster money growth at that time

but also possibly weaker economic activity.

Directive language

(24) Given below is a suggested operational paragraph for the

directive. The specifications adopted at the meeting on November 17 are

shown in strike-through form.

IN THE SHORT RUN, THE COMMITTEE [DEL: , after noting a moderate

shortfall in growth of M1-B in October from the target path set

at the last meeting,] seeks behavior of reserve aggregates con-

sistent with growth of [DEL: M1-B] M1 AND M2 [DEL: from October to December]

FROM THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 1981 TO MARCH at [DEL: an] annual [DEL: rate] RATES

of about [DEL: 7] ____ percent [DEL: (after allowance for the impact of flows

into NOW accounts)] and [DEL: with growth of M2 at an annual rate around

11] ____ percent RESPECTIVELY. The Chairman may call for Committee

consultation if it appears to the Manager for Domestic Operations

that pursuit of the monetary objectives and related reserve paths

during the period before the next meeting is likely to be asso-

ciated with a federal funds rate persistently outside a range of

[DEL:11 to 15] ____ TO ____ percent.

1/ Represents borrowing in remaining statement weeks (as intermeeting period progresses)
implied by each weekly updating of the 5-week average nonborrowed path. The movement
in implied borrowing represents deviations in total reserves from target as well as
the implications of compensating to whatever extent, for misses in nonborrowed reserves
from target in the earlier weeks of the reserve period.

2/ Total and nonborrowed reserves paths adjusted upward by $43 million due to changes affecting
the reserves multiplier.

3/ To prevent unexpectedly low borrowings in the week of November 25 from distorting the non-
borrowed reserves path, the 5-week average nonborrowed reserves path was adjusted upward by
an additional $42 million.

4/ To prevent the unexpectedly low borrowings in the weeks of November 25 and December 2 from
distorting the nonborrowed reserves path, the upward adjustment to the 5-week average non-
borrowed reserves path noted in footnote 3 was raised to $100 million.

5/ Total and nonborrowed reserves paths adjusted upward by $274 million due to changes affecting
the reserves multiplier.

6/ To prevent the unexpectedly low borrowings in the week of November 25 and December 2 from
distorting the nonborrowed reserves path, the upward adjustment to the 5-week average non
borrowed reserves path noted in footnotes 3 and 4 was raised to $117 million.

7/ Total and nonborrowed reserves paths adjusted downward by $137 million due to changes
affecting the reserves multiplier.

8/ To prevent the unexpectedly low borrowings in the week of November 25 and December 2 froe
distorting the nonborrowed reserves path and to avoid a sharp change in bank reserves
positions just prior to the Committee meeting, the upward adjustment to the 5-week average
nonborrowed reserves path noted in footnotes 3, 4, and 6 was raised to $165 million.
