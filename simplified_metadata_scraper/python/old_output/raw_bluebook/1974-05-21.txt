through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned 
versions text-searchable.2   Though a stringent quality assurance process was 
employed, some imperfections may remain.

MONEY MARKET CONDITIONS

Recent developments

(1) M1 increased at an annual rate of 8.3 per cent in April.

Growth appears to be moderating in May, and M1 is indicated to expand

at a 6.5 per cent annual rate over the April-May period, slightly

below the upper end of the Committee's range of tolerance. Growth

in M2 also appears to be slowing over April and May, to a rate slightly

below the mid-point of its range of tolerance, reflecting somewhat

more moderate expansion of time deposits (other than large CD's) than

projected at the time of the April Committee meeting.1/ Deposit in-

flows at nonbank thrift institutions have slowed markedly. Estimates

for April show no growth, seasonally adjusted, at mutual savings banks

and only a 4 per cent rate of growth at S&L's; data for recent weeks

suggest the possibility of an even weaker performance in May.

1/ Growth rates for M1 and M2 are based on revised data. Money supply
figures have been revised back to October to reflect December call
report information for nonmember banks and new data for foreign agencies
and branches. The revision raises the annual rate of growth
for M1 from 7.5 to 8.9 per cent in the fourth quarter of 1973,
and from 6.7 to 7.1 per cent in the fourth quarter of 1974. Levels
of M 1 for December and March are raised by $1 and $1.3 billion,
respectively. The old and revised series are compared in appendix
table V.

agreed to change the ceiling guideline to 11% per cent.

(2) CD's and other non-deposit sources, however, expanded much

more rapidly than projected for the inter-meeting period, as bueiness

loan demands remained strong. Mainly as a result of this, estimated RPD

growth for the April-May period is far above the upper end of the Committee's

range of tolerance, as indicated in the table below.

(3) Following the April FOMC meeting, incoming deposit data

suggested that growth in both M 1 and M2 would exceed the upper end of

their ranges of tolerance. Accordingly, the Account Manager adopted a

more reluctant approach to the provision of reserves, expecting the

Federal funds rate to move up to around 10¾ per cent, the upper end of

its range. Money market pressures proved unexpectedly strong, however,

and Federal funds began to trade around 11 per cent toward the end of

the statement week ending April 24th. Given these conditions, and the action

to raise the discount rate to 8 per cent on April 24, Chairman Burns

recommended on that day raising the upper end of the tolerance range for

the Federal funds rate to 11 per cent. A majority of the Committee members

concurred in this recommendation.

(4) Subsequently, the Account Manager sought reserve conditions

consistent with an 11 per cent Federal funds rate. Unusually strong

money market pressures persisted, however, and the Federal funds rate

averaged above 11 per cent. In the past statement week the effective

rate has been consistently close to 11 per cent, although today it

eased to about 11.35 per cent. It appears that member banks have had

a strong preference to avoid borrowing at the discount window, opting

instead to pay a higher rate on Federal funds. Apart from special

borrowing by a problem bank, member bank borrowing over the past two

statement weeks averaged $1.6 billion, down from an average of almost

$2 billion in the previous three weeks.

(5) The Desk has been handicapped in attempting to counteract

these pressures by the technical state of the markets for Treasury and



-4-

Federal Agency securities. Dealer positions in U.S. Government securities

have been depleted throughout the period, reflecting the state of

expectations in the dealer community, sizable Desk purchases, and good

retail demand. Collateral for repurchase agreements has also been on

the scarce side. Moreover, dealers have withdrawn sizable amounts of

repurchase agreements before maturity because they have been making

considerable net sales of Treasury securities to the public.

(6) On May 17, Chairman Burns recommended that the Committee

take note of the difficulties faced by the Desk in the recent period.

Also, given the likelihood that the technical problems encountered might

persist over the next few days, the Chairman expressed the view that it

would be appropriate to change the ceiling guideline for the funds rate

from 11 to ll¼ per cent. A majority of Committee members concurred in the

Chairman's recommendations.

(7) After rising sharply early in the inter-meeting period,

interest rates on Treasury securities, particularly on Treasury bills,

have dropped considerably in recent days. The 3-month bill rate was

quoted 7.93 per cent at the close on Friday, as compared with an average

issuing rate of 9.02 per cent established in the auction of May 6. The

rally in the Treasury securities market has been generated not only by

the previously noted shortage of issues, but also by an apparent shift

of investor preferences toward securities of the highest quality, sparked

by news stories regarding the problems of the Franklin National Bank and

widespread rumors that some other banks and financial houses might also

be encountering difficulties.



-5-

(8) Private short-term rates have risen sharply since the

last Committee meeting. Banks have raised their prime rates from the

10 per cent level prevailing in mid-April into an 11¼ --11½ per cent

range. Yields on large CD's and commercial paper with 3-month maturity

dates have risen a percentage point or more to levels above 11 per cent.

Evidence of a move toward higher quality securities is also apparent in

these sectors of the credit markets. There are reports, for example, that

a number of investors have reduced the list of institutions whose

commercial paper, bankers' acceptances, and negotiable CD's they are

prepared to acquire. And there has been a marked widening of the yield

spread between issues of prime and lower grade borrowers in these markets.

(9) For its mid-May refunding operations, the Treasury

decided to pay down $1.6 billion of the $5.6 billion of maturing debt

and to refund the remainder by issuing three securities: $2.0 billion

of an 8¾, 25½ month note; $1.75 billion of an 8¾, 4¼ year note; and

$300 million of a 8.50 per cent, 25-year bond. Both notes were auctioned

at prices near par and currently are quoted above their auction averages.

The bond was auctioned at a substantial premium to provide a yield of

8.23 per cent; the premium subsequently increased enough to reduce the

yield to 8.13 per cent, but most recently the price has fallen back to

about the auction average. Dealers have now distributed the bulk of

their awards of all three issues.

(10) The table on the next page shows (in percentage annual

rates of change) selected monetary and financial flows over various recent

time periods; money supply figures are on a revised basis. Appendix



-6-

table III compares money supply growth rates computed on a quarterly-

average basis with those computed on a last-month-of-quarter basis.

Projected figures on the two bases are shown in appendix table IV for

the three alternatives presented in the next section.

(12) At its last meeting, the Committee established a 5½ per

cent annual rate of growth for M1 from March to September as its longer-

run target. Since then, the March level of M1 has been raised by

$1.3 billion, reflecting revisions for new year-end benchmark data (as

explained in the footnote on page 1). The 4¾ per cent annual rate of

growth for M1 in alternative C has been set to compensate for this

upward revision. As shown in the chart on the following page, such a

growth rate would achieve the M1 level in September that was implicit in

the longer-run path adopted by the Committee at its last meeting.

Alternative B continues a 5½ per cent growth rate for M1, but from the

new March level. Alternative A contemplates a somewhat more rapid 6¼ per

cent growth rate in M 1 over the second and third quarters combined.

(13) A somewhat more rapid longer-run rate of growth in M1 than

adopted by the Committee at its last meeting, such as envisioned under

alternative A, appears necessary if money market conditions are not to

tighten further. Under alternative A, the staff would expect the Federal

funds rate to trade most frequently around 11-11¼ per cent.

(14) The funds rate has been subject to upward pressure, in

part because of a shift of bank borrowing preferences from the window to

the funds market. This pressure may moderate, however, if more normal

borrowing preferences come to prevail. We have assumed that member banks

will want to increase their borrowing (apart from special borrowing) to

about $2 billion per week on average under alternative A, given the roughly 3

percentage point spread of the Federal funds rate over the current 8 per

cent discount rate. Special borrowing by a problem bank may add another

$1 billion or so to borrowing levels.

(15) If funds were to trade mostly around 11 per cent over

the weeks ahead there probably would be some decline in other short-term

rates, and also in long rates, since market participants appear to have

adjusted to a funds rate somewhat above this level. Declines could be

fairly sizable, at least temporarily, if the market were to interpret

such a move as signaling a shift in policy direction. Moreover, the

shift in investor preferences toward high quality assets, and the



-10-

continued short market supply of Treasury bills, would tend to keep

Treasury rates low relative to other market rates--perhaps in a 7½--8½

per cent range in the case of the 3-month bill. The odds on bill rates

settling in the upper part of this range would increase if the Treasury

should choose to issue a bill strip of $1-1½ billion--a possibility that

has been under some discussion.

(16) With the money market conditions assumed under alternative

A, the staff would expect M1 growth in May-June to be in a 5-7 per cent

range. The mid-point of this range, if attained, would produce a 6¾ per

cent annual growth rate in the second quarter. Growth would be expected

to slow somewhat in the third quarter to about a 5¾ per cent rate, as

demand for money is further restrained by lagged impacts of the sharp

rise in short-term interest rates over the past few months.

(17) Growth in time and savings deposits at banks (other than

negotiable CD's at the large weekly reporting banks), and in deposits

at thrift institutions has been sharply curtailed by the attraction of

high market interest rates to savers. We would expect this tendency

to continue even under alternative A, so that M2 growth over the second and

third quarters would be expected to slow to around 6.5 per cent, and in

M3 to about 5.0 per cent--on the order of 4 percentage points below the

average annual rate of expansion in the fourth and first quarters.

(18) Restraining M1 growth to a 5½ per cent annual rate over

the second and third quarters--as under alternative B-- would be

expected to put somewhat more pressure on the money market, with the



-11-

Federal funds rate rising to around 12 per cent between now and the

next Committee meeting. The 3-month bill rate would likely move up into

an 8½--9½ per cent range over the next few weeks, and other market rates

would also adjust upward. This rise in rates would be needed to hold

the rise in money demands to a pace consistent with a 5½ per cent growth

rate for M1 in the second and third quarters, in view of the larger

increase in prices and nominal GNP. now projected. This relationship

between money growth and interest rates makes no allowance for the

possibility that liquidity preference may increase if confidence in

financial markets continues to weaken.

(19) To achieve the even greater restraint on monetary ex-

pansion called for under alternative C, the Federal funds rate would be

expected to rise to around 13 per cent over the next few weeks. The

time and savings deposits experience at banks and thrift institutions

would be expected to deteriorate further--with deposit flows at thrift

institutions probably negative as the Treasury bill rate adjusted

sharply upward, perhaps to near 10 per cent.

(20) Under alternative A, banks are expected to continue

borrowing fairly heavily through CD's, and to obtain funds in the Euro-

dollar market. We have projected a slower growth in CD's, though, in

the expectation that tighter lending terms by banks will work to moderate

loan growth. Moreover, it appears that less-than-prime banks are be-

ginning to encounter investor resistance to their CD's. If, as seems

quite possible, such resistance intensifies, CD growth could be substantially

less than projected, bank credit expansion could be constrained, and

strains in other financial markets (including the Euro-dollar market) could

be exacerbated.



-12-

(21) Under alternative C and possibly also B, sharply higher

interest rates would erode asset values and bring the adequacy of bank

liquidity into question. Banks outside major money centers might in some

cases be excluded altogether from raising funds in national money markets.

With the intensification of pressures on financial institutions and

financial markets, many institutional lenders would likely severely

restrict loan extensions. The mortgage market would come under great

pressure and some nonfinancial businesses would encounter serious liquidity

problems.

(22) A further significant rise in interest rates over the

next few months may need to be followed by a decline in late summer in

order to avoid unduly limiting monetary expansion in the final months of

the year. Alternative C has the greatest potential for such a pattern,

and might well bring about a severe wrenching of market conditions.



-13-

Proposed directive

(22) Presented below are three alternative formulations for

the operational paragraph of the directive, which are intended to

correspond to the similarly lettered policy alternatives discussed in

the preceding section. In all three alternatives, it is proposed to

delete the reference to Treasury financing because the quarterly refunding

announced on May 1 has been completed and the issues largely distributed.

Also, in view of the strong connection between U.S. financial markets, the

Euro-dollar market, and foreign exchange markets, it is proposed to say

". . .while taking account of financial market developments. . ."

without separate reference to "international" and "domestic" developments.

In alternative C, it is proposed to give special emphasis to that

phase--i.e.,". . .while taking careful account. . ."--in view of the

strong possibility of exaggerated market reactions to the sharp rise in

interest rates associated with open market operations designed to achieve

the specified rates of growth in the aggregates.

Alternative A

To implement this policy, while taking account of [DEL: the

forthcoming Treacury financing and of internationl and domestic]

financial market developments, the Committee seeks to achieve bank

reserve and money market conditions [DEL: that would moderate] CONSISTENT

WITH MODERATE growth in monetary aggregates over the months ahead.



-14-

Alternative B

To implement this policy, while taking account of [DEL: the

forthcoming Treasury financing and of international and domestic]

financial market developments, the Committee seeks to achieve

bank reserve and money market conditions that would moderate

growth in monetary aggregates over the months ahead.

Alternative C

To implement this policy, while taking CAREFUL account of

[DEL: the forthcoming Treasury financing and of international and domestic]

financial market developments, the Committee seeks to achieve bank

reserve and money market conditions that would moderate SLOW

APPRECIABLY THE growth in monetary aggregates over the months ahead.

(23) In the event that the Committee wishes to couch the

operational paragraph of the directive in terms of money market conditions,

the specifications of alternative A might be associated with language

indicating that ". . .the Committee seeks to maintain about the pre-

vailing restrictive money market conditions, provided that the monetary

aggregates appear to be growing at rates within the specified ranges

of tolerance."
