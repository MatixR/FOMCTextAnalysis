MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Recent Developments

(1) Financial market developments over the intermeeting period were once again

dominated by investors' changing perceptions of the Asian economic turmoil and its potential

repercussions for the U.S. economy. The Committee's widely anticipated decision to hold

policy unchanged at its December meeting elicited essentially no market response, and

Treasury securities traded in a relatively narrow range through the year-end (Chart 1).1 Early

in January, however, heightened concerns over the turbulence in Asia combined with its

implications for U.S. prices and output, which were underscored by statements of Federal

Reserve officials, seemed to augment the demand for dollar-denominated assets and especially

for Treasury securities. By mid-January, yields on Treasury notes and bonds had dropped as

much as 50 basis points from their levels at the December FOMC meeting. Short-term rates

fell over these weeks as well, apparently on the view that the impact here of troubles in Asia

could prompt an easing in monetary policy in coming months. Over the remainder of the

intermeeting period, Treasury yields retraced some of their earlier declines, partly as market

participants seemed to become more confident that effective steps were being taken to deal

with the situations in several Asian countries. On balance, intermediate- and long-term

Treasury yields fell 15 to 35 basis points over the intermeeting period while yields on short-

1. The Desk provided a substantial volume of reserves around the year-end to address an increase
in the demand for excess reserves, seasonal advances in required reserves, and drains on the supply of
reserves stemming from seasonal movements in currency in circulation. Nonetheless, some reserve
pressures were evident at year-end, with funds trading as high as 10 percent late in the day on
December 31 and a handful of large banks turning to the discount window. These pressures subsided
quickly in following days and there were few signs of unusual reserve pressures later in January, even
though required operating balances fell to a seasonal trough just below $14 billion.

term Treasuries edged lower. The rally in bond markets over the intermeeting period

probably helped to support equity prices. Corporate earnings announcements for the fourth

quarter for the most part met or exceeded analysts' downward-revised expectations, but

concerns about the effects of Asian developments made investors more cautious in their

assessment of the trajectory for corporate profits going forward. Many major stock price

indexes recorded small gains on balance.

(2) The slope of the Treasury yield curve--measured as the yield spread between

the ten-year Treasury note and the three-month Treasury bill--narrowed a little further over

the intermeeting period and, at about 35 basis points currently, the spread has fallen 3/4

percentage point since August to stand considerably below its average level of 1-1/4 percentage

points since 1965 (Chart 2). Unlike most prior episodes of pronounced flattening in the yield

curve, this time around there have been sizable declines in yields at maturities of two years or

more while those for short-term Treasury bills, anchored by Federal Reserve policy, have held

fairly steady. Some of the drop in longer-term rates still likely reflects enhanced demand for

safe and liquid dollar assets amid turmoil in foreign markets, in effect reducing the term

premium at the long end of the yield curve. In addition, investors' concerns about an

incipient buildup in inflationary pressures that would prompt monetary policy tightening have

been much attenuated since August. Indeed, the current shape of the yield curve seems

consistent with a view common among market participants that calls for a slowing in output

growth accompanied by low and stable inflation, with relatively minor adjustments to the

stance of monetary policy. Judging from recent federal funds futures quotes, market

participants currently rate the odds for a policy easing at the February FOMC meeting as slim

at most, but consider the probability of a small easing by midyear to be somewhat higher.

(3) Since the December FOMC meeting, the dollar has continued to appreciate

against the currencies of emerging market economies in Asia. The dollar rose a further 6

percent against the won over the intermeeting period, but has been little changed since early

January. The factors that have helped to stabilize the situation in Korea include President-

elect Kim Dae-jung's public support of strong adjustment measures and material progress in

resolving the short-term liquidity problems of Korean financial institutions. The Indonesian

rupiah fell 46 percent against the dollar over the intermeeting period on concerns about the

government's commitment to economic reform and about longer-term political stability. The

weakness in the rupiah led to downward pressures on other regional currencies. The

Malaysian ringgit and Thai baht fell 8 percent and 11 percent, respectively, vis-a-vis the

dollar over the intermeeting period. Equity markets rallied in those countries whose

currencies had fallen the most, apparently as some investors felt that both equity prices and

currencies had dropped far enough to warrant taking a chance on companies with strong

export potential.

(4) On balance, the exchange value of the dollar against the currencies of most

industrialized countries was up somewhat over the intermeeting period. European currencies

were affected by growing market realization of the adverse impact of the Asian crisis on

European economies. The dollar gained around 2 percent against the Canadian dollar,

. To counter the

associated decline in the Monetary Conditions Index, the Bank of Canada raised short-term



4

rates 50 basis points. The one major exception was the yen, which appreciated 3 percent

against the dollar on balance, as the prospects for additional fiscal stimulus, along with

somewhat greater stability in the region, appeared to support the yen.

. The Desk did not intervene in the foreign

exchange market during the period.

(5) Growth of the broad monetary aggregates finished 1997 on a strong note and

that tone has been sustained into the new year. M2 expanded at a 6 percent pace in the

fourth quarter last year, boosting its growth over the four quarters of 1997 to just above the

upper end of its annual range.2 The velocity of M2 fell in the fourth quarter of 1997 for the

second time in as many quarters, retracing a small portion of its upward drift over the period

since mid-1994. M2 growth in January is now projected at 7 1/2 percent, well above the staffs

projection at the December FOMC meeting. Much of this strength in M2 has likely been

associated with recent gains in nominal income. In addition, M2 has been boosted by a

pickup of mortgage refinancing and, perhaps, some substitution away from market instruments

whose yields have declined relative to those on M2 assets.3 M3 also accelerated in the last

quarter of 1997, and its growth over the year--at 8 1/4 percent--came in well above the upper

end of its annual range. M3 growth in January--now projected at 10 1/2 percent--also exceeded

the staff projection in December and was propelled by the strength in M2, a sharp jump in RP

2. The monetary data in this bluebook reflect benchmark revisions and new seasonal adjustment
factors. The revised data are scheduled to be released to the public on February 5. These revisions
have reduced M2 growth over the four quarters of 1997 by 0.1 percentage point and have raised M3
growth by 0.1 percentage point.

3. Noncompetitive tenders for Treasury securities have been weaker in recent months.

financing by a few banks, and continued solid expansion in bank credit. Business loan

growth at banks remained brisk in December and January; the strength was related to

financing needs associated with a spate of merger activity in recent months and perhaps rising

business inventories.

(6) Total domestic nonfinancial debt advanced at about a 5 percent pace in

December, putting its estimated annual growth over 1997 at about 4-1/2 percent--well within the

3 to 7 percent annual range for the debt aggregate. Federal debt growth stayed low and

nonfederal debt growth apparently remained elevated in December, bolstered by strong

business borrowing. Credit supply conditions have changed little on balance of late. In

securities markets, risk spreads have been about flat, except for a small firming of junk

spreads. At domestic banks, C&I loan standards were about unchanged, and spreads were

narrowed further, albeit by fewer banks than in previous quarters. At branches and agencies

of foreign banks, particularly Japanese institutions, however, the recent pace of tightening of

terms and standards picked up. The survey results also suggested a continued modest

tightening in standards on credit card and other consumer loans.

Longer-Term Scenarios

(7) This section considers alternative longer-term scenarios for monetary policy

and highlights some important risks over the Greenbook forecast horizon and beyond.

Starting from a "baseline" scenario that judgmentally extends the Greenbook forecast, the staff

model was used to gauge the effects of: 1) an alternative monetary policy designed to

achieve virtual price stability in around five years; 2) a delayed recovery in Asia; and 3) a

more favorable productivity trend.

(8) For the baseline extension, key domestic assumptions are that fiscal policy

gradually moves the federal budget to a position of modest surplus and that the NAIRU is 5-1/2

percent. Owing to the potential for an unsustainable widening of the current account deficit,

the baseline extension builds in a real depreciation of the dollar. Specifically, we have

assumed a 1-1/2 percent real depreciation each year, which is sufficient to stabilize the current

account deficit relative to GDP. Foreign real GDP growth picks up to an above-trend pace in

2000 and 2001, as the economic difficulties in Asia unwind, and gradually returns to trend

over the next several years.

(9) In the baseline scenario, shown by solid lines in Chart 3, core PCE inflation

remains below 2 percent through the end of the Greenbook projection period. By 2000,

however, the Committee faces some upward pressures on inflation: The unemployment rate

remains below the staff estimate of the NAIRU, and the dollar and foreign GDP swing from

depressing to buoying U.S. GDP and inflation. The Committee can hold inflation to a little

more than 2 percent by increasing the nominal federal funds rate from 5-1/2 to 6 percent in

2000.4 This relatively modest increase in the funds rate is sufficient to contain inflation in

large part because it is associated with a more pronounced rise in bond yields as the yield

curve reverts to a more normal slope. The unemployment rate needs to move up to slightly

above the NAIRU to offset the inflationary impacts of the continuing decline in the dollar.5

Because the favorable supply shocks that have brought inflation down in recent years are

assumed not to persist in the baseline, further disinflation requires that the unemployment rate

exceed the NAIRU by even more for a time.6 To achieve virtual price stability--defined as

1 percent PCE inflation--in around five years, the Committee could increase the funds rate by

1 percentage point starting early next year in order to raise the unemployment rate

temporarily above the NAIRU by a full percentage point.

4. In these exercises, the unemployment rate alone is taken as the index of resource pressures in
the economy. As noted in the Greenbook, the staff believes that capacity utilization in manufacturing
is likely to drop over the next two years, damping price increases. Capacity expansion should slow
considerably by 2000, however, and the baseline extension implicitly assumes that a continuation of
modest capacity growth would tend to raise the utilization rate to help bring about a more normal
alignment with the unemployment rate over time.

5. Although the baseline extension builds in a steady depreciation in the dollar over the whole
period, it seems likely that the decline would be more abrupt at times. Increases in the prices of goods
and services that result from a sharp decline that promised a period of subsequent stability may more
likely be viewed as one-time events and less likely to be built into inflation expectations than those
resulting from the steady decline assumed in the baseline. If so, the extent to which policy has to hold
the unemployment rate above the NAIRU to contain the effects of a dollar depreciation may be
overstated in the baseline. Sharp declines in the dollar, however, may run a higher risk of elevating
uncertainty and causing economic and financial dislocations.

6. In the version of model used for these simulations, inflation, as well as other expectations,
adjust gradually to economic conditions as households and businesses form expectations using some,
but not complete, knowledge of the underlying structure of the economy. Under this expectation
mechanism, the model has a sacrifice ratio over five years of about 2-1/2; that is, a one percentage point
reduction in inflation can be achieved only by pushing the unemployment rate above the NAIRU by
the equivalent of 2-1/2 percentage points for one year.



9

(10) Chart 4 presents a prolonged Asian shock scenario in which the difficulties in

the economies of Asia unwind much more gradually than in the baseline, where they start to

diminish in 1999 and then largely disappear by 2001. 7 The U.S. economy is affected by both

a lower level of foreign GDP and a dollar that, at least initially, falls more slowly than in the

baseline, though it then depreciates more rapidly toward the end of the period. The relatively

higher dollar contributes to better near-term inflation performance, even though the

Committee is assumed to lower interest rates to cushion the contractionary effect on output.

A federal funds rate that drops as much as 75 basis points below the baseline trajectory is

sufficient to keep output close to the baseline path.

(11) Chart 5 presents two scenarios in which trend productivity growth is

permanently raised one percentage point. In the staffs model, higher trend productivity

growth will over time increase the rate of growth of real wages by an equivalent amount and

raise the level of the real interest rate associated with a normal level of resource utilization

and stable inflation. Real rates must be higher because faster economic growth boosts

permanent income, thereby stimulating consumption relative to current income, and because

investment must rise to ensure that the capital stock keeps pace with production, which is

growing faster. In the fixed unemployment path scenario, the Committee raises rates

immediately to keep aggregate demand in line with aggregate supply. This limits the demand

for labor and any upward pressure on wages. Moreover, wages are inherently less flexible

than prices, so firms with reduced unit labor costs compete to expand output and this puts

7. At its maximum, the added impact of the assumed delay of the recovery in Asia on the U.S.
economy amounts to about three-quarters of the impact of the Asian crisis expected in 1998.

downward pressure on price inflation. Alternatively, the Federal Reserve could keep real

rates the same for awhile, allowing the increase in demand to reduce the unemployment rate

(fixed long-run inflation scenario). The resulting rise in labor compensation does not push

up inflation for a time because the increase in productivity holds down unit labor costs. This

configuration might make it appear that the economy has a lower NAIRU, but ultimately the

unemployment rate must return to the true, unchanged NAIRU to avoid ever-rising inflation.



Long-Run Ranges for 1998

(12) As background for the Committee's discussion of the annual ranges for 1998,

the table below presents staff projections for money and debt consistent with the Greenbook

forecast, as well as three alternative sets of ranges for Committee consideration.

(13) M2 growth is expected to decline appreciably from 5 percent over the four

quarters of last year to 3-1/2 percent this year. The slowing in the rate of expansion of M2

reflects projected deceleration in nominal GDP from growth of 5-3/4 percent last year to 3-1/2

percent this year, and the Greenbook assumption of an unchanged stance of monetary policy,

which keeps the opportunity cost of holding M2 balances unchanged. As shown in the lower

panel of Chart 6, from mid-1994 to mid-1997 a small uptrend in M2 velocity was associated

with a stable spread, on balance, of the three-month Treasury bill rate over the weighted-

average own rate on the components of M2. However, over the final two quarters of last

year, V2 remained near its second-quarter level, with little change in M2's opportunity cost.

In the staff forecast, the period of no velocity trend is extended, as nominal GDP and M2

grow at the same rate this year. One source of the previous uptrend in V2, and associated

downtrend in M2 demand, may well have been continued allocation of savings into the equity

market; in 1998, owing to the downdraft of equity prices predicted by the staff, we expect

slower inflows to stock mutual funds and greater preference for more secure M2 assets, which

have fixed principal values.

(14) The staff expects most of the deceleration in nominal GDP and M2 in 1998 to

show through to M3. The growth in this aggregate is projected to decline from 8-1/4 percent

last year to 6-3/4 percent this year. Even so, the expansion of M3 relative to that of GDP

remains high, implying a further appreciable decline in M3 velocity (Chart 7). The forecast

of M3 has been elevated by the rapid growth in both bank credit and M3 in recent months

and by the projection of a relatively robust pace of depository credit expansion this year. As

discussed below, total debt growth is likely to be strong relative to GDP this year, and with

profit margins and capitalization of depositories at high levels, these instititutions are expected

to remain sufficiently accommodative suppliers of credit to hold on to their share of lending.

Also, heavy inflows to institution-only money funds likely will boost M3 growth again this

year, as businesses further increase their reliance on these money funds as an attractive cash

management instrument.

(15) Unlike the deceleration foreseen for nominal GDP and the broader money

aggregates, growth of the debt of domestic nonfinancial sectors is anticipated to pick up from

a 4-1/2 percent rate last year to a 5-1/4 percent rate this year. Thus, debt velocity is expected to

drop in 1998, after increasing on balance over the last two years (Chart 7). To a minor

extent, the rise in debt relative to spending reflects the evident surge in home mortgage

refinancings, which is likely to entail some cashing out of equity. More important, business

borrowing should be boosted relative to capital spending this year by weaker growth of

internal funds as profits lag as well as by increased net retirements of equities associated with

merger and acquisition and share repurchase activity. With debt rising relative to income for

businesses, lenders may become somewhat wary of prospective repayment performance.

However, the staff does not anticipate a significant deterioration in business or household

credit quality or a substantial pullback in credit availability, in part because refinancing of

outstanding debt at lower rates will reduce debt-service obligations.

Issues related to money and debt ranges

(16) In recent years, the Committee has selected ranges for both of the broad

monetary aggregates on the rationale that, given continued heightened uncertainty about

money demand, the ranges should represent benchmarks for average money growth over time

under conditions of price stability and normal velocity behavior, not forecasts of money

growth over the specific upcoming year or two. The debt range by contrast has been used to

convey projected growth over the particular upcoming year or two. The Committee's choice

of ranges at this meeting would seem to boil down to whether to continue past practice, as in

alternative I, to switch the rationale for the M3 range from the one previously used for the

broader monetary aggregates ranges to the one that in the past applied mainly to the debt



14

range, as in alternative I, or to switch the rationale for the debt range to one more consistent

with price stability, as in alternative III.

(17) In the past, one source of conflict between the two rationales for choosing

annual ranges for the money and credit aggregates has been the fact that nominal GDP was

anticipated to grow at a pace that differed from what would be expected under conditions of

price stability. This conflict does not arise this year. The staff estimates that in future years

measured potential real GDP will grow at an annual rate of 2-1/2 percent and broad GDP price

indexes will have a bias of a bit more than a 1/2 percentage point per year. Thus, under

conditions of true price stability, nominal GDP would grow at about a 3 percent rate--very

close to the 3-1/2 percent nominal GDP growth that the staff is projecting for 1998.

(18) With M2 velocity anticipated to be about flat in 1998, as it would be under

conditions of sustained price stability, M2 as projected for 1998 and under conditions of price

stability are very close, and both fall well within the Committee's provisional range. Even if

the stance of policy needs to be substantially tightened or eased, M2 is likely to be in its

current range. Under the tighter or easier scenarios of the Greenbook, Part I, in which the

FOMC's federal funds rate intention is adjusted upward or downward by 25 basis points in

each quarter of this year, annual M2 growth in 1998 likely would vary from 3-1/2 percent by

less than one percentage point.

(19) The current provisional range for M3 is consistent with the behavior of that

aggregate under price stability if it grows nearly one percentage point faster than GDP, as it



15

did on average over the three decades prior to the 1990s.8 Nonetheless, the staff forecast

places M3 growth well above this provisional range, as relatively rapid credit growth, a

healthy depository share of that growth, and continued structural shifts toward using M3

money funds for cash management result in a further steep decline in M3 velocity this year

that is not likely to persist in the long run. A question for the Committee is whether to move

the range to encompass likely growth (alternative II) or to leave it at the provisional, price

stability, range.

(20) The provisional debt range readily encompasses the staff projection for 1998,

but it is not likely to be consistent with the behavior of debt under conditions of price

stability. In the steady state, the stock of business capital and consumer durables--and the

debt used to finance them--probably would be growing at close to the rate of GDP. To be

sure, there are a number of influences that might cause the velocity of debt to trend one way

or another for a considerable period--for example, changes in tax laws or tastes that shifted

the debt/equity mix, or financial innovation that promoted greater intermediation and a

concomitant increase in both financial assets and liabilities on balance sheets. On average

beginning in 1960, debt growth has exceeded that of nominal GDP somewhat. But that

overage is entirely accounted for by the 1980s, when firms and households greatly increased

their leverage, and innovation and deregulation encouraged the expansion of financial

intermediation. Hence, going forward, absent evidence of ongoing disturbances to the

8. However, there is considerable uncertainty about longer-term trends in M3 velocity. On the
one hand, M3 growth over the past three years has been on the order of 1-3/4 percentage points faster
than that of nominal GDP. On the other hand, it is hard to envision why nominal magnitudes would
grow at differing rates in the very long run, implying that all the monetary and credit aggregates
should be centered around the expected 3 percent growth rate of nominal GDP.



- 16-

relationship between debt and spending, the best estimate of steady-state debt growth would

seem to be equal to the growth rate of nominal GDP. If the Committee wanted to adopt the

same price-stability rationale for the debt aggregate that it has in the past for M2 and M3, a

significant reduction of the range would seem to be called for, perhaps to 1 to 5 percent or, as

a halfway house, 2 to 6 percent, as in alternative III, matching the ranges for debt and M3.

However, even this alternative would leave the midpoint of the range well below the staffs

projection for debt this year.



- 17-

Short-Run Policy Alternatives

(21) The staff is projecting reasonably steady measured CPI inflation at around 2

percent over the second half of 1998 and in 1999, after increases of only about half that size

over the first half of this year. In this forecast, upward pressure on inflation associated with a

tight labor market is offset by downward pressures emanating importantly from the rise in the

dollar and decline in oil prices in 1997 and early 1998 and from declining capacity utilization.

The staff forecast is built on an unchanged federal funds rate, and if the Committee agrees

that this is both a reasonable and desirable outcome under those conditions, retaining the

current stance of policy under alternative B would be appropriate. Even if the Committee

suspects that the staff forecast has misjudged the likely economic situation, in the current

circumstances waiting for additional information might be seen as unlikely to have

significantly destabilizing effects on the economy. If, for example, the damping effects of the

Asian crisis turn out to be greater than is built into the forecast, since the economy still would

be operating beyond its sustainable potential for a while, the Committee should have enough

time to take appropriate countervailing action before the resulting economic weakness and

disinflation proceeds further or faster than the Committee would find desirable. On the other

hand, even if inflation pressures turn out to be more intense than the staff expects--perhaps

because persistent tightness in labor markets continues to boost the growth of compensation

increasingly beyond that of productivity--downward price pressures already in the pipeline

will still keep inflation quite low for a time. In these circumstances, the Committee should be

able to head off a potential upturn in inflation before higher actual inflation gets built into

wage and price decisions.



- 18-

(22) Because markets put very low odds on any move at the February meeting,

interest rates should not react significantly if the Committee keeps the stance of policy

unchanged. A portion of the flight-to-quality effects seems to have unwound in the last two

weeks as conditions in parts of Asia appeared to improve. Markets, though, are likely to

remain highly sensitive to developments abroad and at home that bear on the strength of final

demands and pressures on prices in the United States, given unusually divergent views on the

outlook among market participants. Rates on intermediate- and long-term Treasury securities

could retrace still more of their recent backup if incoming data, consistent with the staff

outlook, confirm the slowdown in growth, including a further buildup of inventories, and a

flattening of consumer prices. Worries about corporate earnings should mount, though not

enough to boost quality spreads appreciably in corporate bond markets or put much downward

pressure on equity prices, which would be bolstered by any downward drift in bond yields.

The dollar would be expected to trade around its levels of late, off some from its recent peak

(23) The Committee may see sufficient chances of a shortfall in activity from the

staff forecast to suggest a small easing at this time--as in the 25 basis point decline in the

federal funds rate under alternative A. The Committee has held the nominal federal funds

rate constant since March, even as inflation and inflation expectations have fallen, raising the

real funds rate to a high level. The rise in the real funds rate may have been viewed as a

beneficial development when risks in the economic outlook seemed tilted toward strong

economic growth and a rising output gap. However, given forecasts that now see appreciably

slower growth and lower inflation than was earlier foreseen, the Committee may now interpret

the recent increase in the short-term real rate as risking tighter financial conditions than would



- 19-

be consistent with satisfactory economic performance. Indeed, the very damped behavior of

the CPI over the first half of this year in the staff forecast may portend a further reduction in

inflation expectations and an additional rise in real short-term rates over coming months if the

nominal funds rate were left unchanged. To date, the steady nominal funds rate does not

seem to have appreciably impeded the drop in nominal, and possibly real, long-term rates as

the market took out expected tightening and built in a small ease. But at some point, failure

to ratify current expectations might put upward pressure on rates, nominal and real, and more

certainly would inhibit the pricing in of further easing. This suggests that an easing of policy

could have an unusually pronounced effect on long-term rates over time because it would

facilitate building in further easing, as well as reduce short-term rates by nearly the full 25

basis point decline in the funds rate. The drop in yields would tend to boost equity prices

and depress the dollar.

(24) Alternative C might be favored if the Committee saw the economy as

continuing to operate beyond its potential, with the risk that sustained pressures on labor

markets might show through more forcefully than in the staff forecast to higher labor costs

and prices, perhaps hinted at in the recent employment cost report. Domestic spending

continues to be supported by very favorable conditions in debt and equity markets. The

decline in long-term rates should spur spending, in part as borrowers free cash flow by

refinancing higher cost debt. In this environment, counting on Asian developments to defuse

enough of the momentum in the economy may be viewed as too risky, especially as the

rebound in Asian stock markets and in commodity prices may suggest that limits to Asian

turmoil may be in sight. In response to the tightening, short-term rates would rise by at least



-20-

the 25 basis point increase in the federal funds rate. Intermediate- and long-term yields

would also rise, although market participants are unlikely to build in much further tightening

in light of the situation in Asia, thereby constraining the extent of the increase. Stocks would

come under some selling pressure, accentuated perhaps by the uncertainty precipitated by such

a surprise in policy. The dollar would tend to rise on foreign exchange markets.

(25) As discussed in detail in the Long-Run Ranges section of this bluebook, we

would expect growth of the broad money aggregates to slow this year relative to last year and

relative to their pace of expansion in recent months. That deceleration is expected to start

soon, in keeping with the moderation in nominal income. By June, M2 would be 4-1/4 percent

at an annual rate above its fourth-quarter level--in the upper portion of its provisional range.

M3 would be 7-1/2 percent above its base, well above the upper end of its provisional range.

Borrowing by domestic nonfinancial sectors is expected to be well maintained in coming

months, paced by the business sector. Household debt growth will continue to be led by

mortgage financing, owing in part to the burst in refinancing activity and accompanying cash-

outs, and to continued aggressive promotion to subprime borrowers. The very small federal

deficit implies that, on balance, Treasury debt issuance will only about replace maturing debt.

As a consequence, debt of domestic nonfinancial sectors is projected to grow at a 5 percent

annual rate over the first half of 1998, at the midpoint of its provisional range.

Directive Language

(26) Presented below for the members' consideration is draft wording relating

to the Committee's ranges for the aggregates in 1998 and the operational paragraph for the

intermeeting period.

1998 RANGES

The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions

that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output. In furtherance of

these objectives, the Committee at THIS [DEL:its] meeting [DEL: in July reaffirmed the] ESTABLISHED

ranges [DEL: it had established in February] for growth of M2 and M3 of ____ TO ___ [DEL: 1 to 5] percent

and ____ TO ____ [DEL: 2 to 6] percent respectively, measured from the fourth quarter of 1997 [DEL: 1996] to

the fourth quarter of 1998 [DEL: 1997]. The range for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt

was SET AT ____ TO ____ [DEL: maintained at 3 to 7] percent for the year. [DEL: For 1998, the Committee

agreed on a tentative basis to set the same ranges as in 1997 for growth of the monetary

aggregates and debt, measured from the fourth quarter of 1997 to the fourth quarter of 1998.]

The behavior of the monetary aggregates will continue to be evaluated in the light of progress

toward price level stability, movements in their velocities, and developments in the economy

and financial markets.

OPERATIONAL PARAGRAPH

In the implementation of policy for the immediate future, the Committee seeks

conditions in reserve markets consistent with maintaining/INCREASING/DECREASING the

federal funds rate at/TO an average of around ____ [DEL: 5-1/2] percent. In the context of the

Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and



-22-

giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, a

SOMEWHAT/slightly higher federal funds rate WOULD/MIGHT or a SOMEWHAT/

slightly lower federal funds rate WOULD/might be acceptable in the intermeeting period.

The contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be consistent with some moderation in

the growth in M2 and M3 over coming months.

NOTE: Numbers in parentheses are actual growth rates as reported at end of policy period in February Monetary
Policy Report to Congress. Subsequent revisions to historical data (not reflected above) have altered growth rates
by up to a few tenths of a percent.

n.s. -- not specified.
Footnotes on following page



1. Targets are for bank credit until 1983; from 1983 onward targets are for domestic nonfinancial sector debt.

2. The figures shown reflect target and actual growth of M1-B in 1980 and shift-adjusted M1-B in 1981. M1-B was
relabelled M1 in January 1982. The targeted growth for M1-A was 3-1/2 to 6 percent in 1980 (actual growth was
5.0 percent); in 1981 targeted growth for shift-adjusted M1-A was 3 to 5-1/2 percent (actual growth was 1.3 percent).

3. When these ranges were set, shifts into other checkable deposits in 1980 were expected to have only a limited
effect on growth of M1-A and M1-B. As the year progressed, however, banks offered other checkable deposits more
actively, and more funds than expected were directed to these accounts. Such shifts are estimated to have decreased
M1-A growth and increased M1-B growth each by at least 1/2 percentage point more than had been anticipated.

4. Adjusted for the effects of shifts out of demand deposits and savings deposits. At the February FOMC meeting,
the target ranges for observed M1-A and M1-B in 1981 on an unadjusted basis, expected to be consistent with the
adjusted ranges, were -(4-1/2) to -2 and 6 to 8-1/2 percent, respectively. Actual M1-B growth (not shift adjusted)
was 5.0 percent

5. Adjusted for shifts of assets from domestic banking offices to International Banking Facilities.

6. Range for bank credit is annualized growth from the December 1981 - January 1982 average level through the
fourth quarter of 1982.

7. Base period, adopted at the July 1983 FOMC meeting, is 1983 QII. At the February 1983 meeting, the FOMC
had adopted a 1982 QIV to 1983 QIV target range for M1 of 4 to 8 percent.

8. Base period is the February-March 1983 average.

9. Base period, adopted at the July 1985 FOMC meeting, is 1985 QII. At the February 1983 meeting, the FOMC
had adopted a 1984 QIV to 1985 QIV target range for M1 of 4 to 7 percent.

10. No range for M1 has been specified since the February 1987 FOMC meeting because of uncertainties about its
underlying relationship to the behavior of the economy and its sensitivitiy to economic and financial circumstances.

11. At the February 1990 meeting, the FOMC specified a range of 2-1/2 to 6-1/2 percent. This range was lowered
to 1 to 5 percent at the July 1990 meeting.

12. At the February 1993 meeting, the FOMC specified a range of 2 to 6 percent for M2, 1/2 to 4-1/2 percent for
M3, and 4-1/2 to 8-1/2 percent for domestic nonfinancial debt. These ranges were lowered to 1 to 5 percent for M2,
0 to 4 percent for M3, and 4 to 8 percent for domestic nonfinancial debt at the July 1993 meeting.

13. At the February 1995 FOMC meeting, the FOMC specified a range of 0 to 4 percent. This range was raised
to 2 to 6 percent at the July 1995 meeting.
