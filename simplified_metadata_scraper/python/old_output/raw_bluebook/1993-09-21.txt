MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Recent Developments

(1) The federal funds rate averaged close to the Committee's

expectation of 3 percent during the intermeeting period. Short-term

interest rates have edged down since the August meeting, while interme-

diate- and long-term rates have decreased 20 to 30 basis points, on

23
balance. These declines extended the drop in longer-term

rates since their recent highs, posted just after the July Humphrey-

Hawkins testimony, to nearly 3/4 percentage point. A sizable portion of

these reductions in rates appears to incorporate a moderation in infla-

tion expectations, a notion supported by survey data. Revisions to the

inflation outlook were probably prompted by generally favorable data on

broad price indexes and evidence of continuing sluggishness in economic

activity. The market response to the cast of data on aggregate demand

and to greater assurance of fiscal restraint suggests that real long-

1. The Desk's allowance for adjustment plus seasonal borrowing was
kept unchanged at $250 million, while actual borrowing, which was
boosted by technical difficulties at two large banks, averaged $425
million in the two full maintenance periods since the August FOMC
meeting.

2. Rate movements are calculated using quotes through noon,
September 17. At that time a few banks had reduced their prime rates
from 6 to 5-3/4 percent, but none were money-center banks and the
action had not become general.

3. The thirty-year constant maturity Treasury yield has dropped a
bit more than rates on corporate bonds and mortgages. However, this
differential primarily reflects movements in the exceptional premium
for the most recently auctioned Treasury bond--the security used in
the construction of the constant maturity yield. Owing to the Trea-
sury's decision to reduce the volume of such securities offered and
the frequency of auctions in the future, the yield on the thirty-year
bond auctioned in early August has been unusually far below nearby
securities on the yield curve, and the gap has widened on balance over
the intermeeting period. Indeed, private securities underwriters are
said to be using a more seasoned issue as a benchmark for pricing
decisions.



term interest rates may also have fallen since late July; this inter-

pretation of rate movements is consistent with the reduced foreign

exchange value for the U.S. dollar and continued strength in stock

markets. Market perceptions, in light of incoming data, that the

Federal Reserve would raise nominal short-term rates later and by less

than was previously foreseen probably contributed to declines in real

yields on bonds and equity. Apparently, investors turned increasingly

to longer-term assets to preserve returns, which has helped to lift most

major stock market indexes 1 to 2 percent since the August meeting.

(2) On balance, the weighted average foreign exchange value of

the dollar fell about 3 percent since the last meeting, depreciating

even more against the mark and other European currencies, while appreci-

ating about 3 percent against the yen. The dollar was buoyed against --

the yen early in the period by U.S. intervention sales of yen ($165

million equivalent) and the accompanying public statement by the Trea-

sury Department, which the market apparently read as signalling a new

attitude--that further strengthening of the yen was not desirable.

The mark's strength was partly related to the

unexpectedly slow pace of interest rate reductions by the Bundesbank;

while the discount and Lombard rates were cut 50 basis points on

September 10, the key RP rate was lowered only 10 basis points. German

three-month market rates were essentially unchanged and long-term rates

declined 25 basis points over the intermeeting period. Other ERM

monetary authorities continued to be cautious in reducing interest

rates, despite the additional leeway offered by the wider, 15 percent,

exchange rate margins. Japanese three-month interest rates fell 30

basis points and long-term rates 10 basis points.



(3) Appetites for longer-term securities continue to weaken M2

demand. Bond and stock mutual funds posted a record gain in July, and

weekly data indicate an even stronger advance in August. M2 grew at the

subdued rate of 1-3/4 percent in August, close to the forecast in the

last bluebook, leaving the aggregate slightly above the lower end of its

annual growth cone. A temporary dip in mortgage refinancing likely

restrained M2 growth last month. Components generally followed recent

trends: M1 again grew rapidly--at a 10-1/2 percent rate for the

month;4 savings and MMDAs posted a moderate gain, while there were

runoffs in small time deposits and money market mutual funds, the

closest substitutes for capital market investments. 5

(4) M3 growth was slow in August, although it rose for the

first time in three months and was somewhat above the staff projection

at the last meeting. This aggregate is now at the lower end of its

growth cone. Sluggish depository credit continued to depress M3 growth.

With credit demands continuing to be concentrated in capital markets,

bank credit decelerated to a 3-1/4 percent rate of growth in August.

Most of the increase was in bank securities portfolios; business loans

4. Total reserves and the monetary base grew at 9-3/4 and 11-1/2
percent rates, respectively, in August.

5. M2 plus bond and stock mutual funds (excluding institutional
holdings and IRA/Keogh accounts) is estimated to have grown at about a
5 percent rate in August, the same as its average pace for the year to
date.

6. The unexpected pickup in M3 in August owed primarily to a
decline in money fund holdings of large CDs, which resulted in a rare,
albeit small, increase in net CDs in this aggregate. (The aggregates
are constructed on a consolidated basis by subtracting deposits held
by money-stock issuers--depository institutions and money funds--from
reported deposit liabilities.) Expansion of M3 continued to be held
down by the decline in institutional money funds that began in
September of 1992; the stable short-term interest rate environment
since then has eliminated the yield advantage of their slowly-
adjusting average returns over direct investment in money market
instruments.



were little changed, while real estate and consumer loan growth slowed,

and security loans ran off.

(5) The growth of nonfederal debt, though still subdued,

appears to have picked up a little in recent months, with both business

and household borrowing strengthening somewhat. In the business sector,

commercial paper issuance has been strong of late, but the bulk of net

borrowing remained focused on bond markets. Receptive financial markets

readily absorbed heavy bond issuance and a pickup in initial public

offerings of equity, the proceeds of which financed considerable

retirement of higher-cost bonds and probably the paydown of bank loans.

The improvement in household financial positions has supported higher

debt growth. Consumer credit picked up to a 7 percent pace in July (on

a month-average basis), and bank data for August suggest further

appreciable growth. Mortgage debt is estimated to be expanding

moderately, as households do not appear to be taking out significant

additional cash in refinancing their mortgages. From the fourth quarter

of 1992 through July, nonfederal debt grew at only a 3 percent rate.

Federal debt growth eased over the summer from its rapid second-quarter

rate on a seasonally adjusted basis. Total domestic nonfinancial debt

is estimated to have grown at a 5-1/2 percent rate in July, and at a

4-1/2 percent rate from the fourth quarter through July, leaving this

aggregate somewhat above the lower bound of its monitoring range for

1993.

Policy Alternatives

(6) Three policy alternatives are presented for consideration

by the Committee. Under alternative B, federal funds would continue to

trade around 3 percent in combination with an initial allowance for

adjustment plus seasonal borrowing of $250 million. Under alterna-

tive A, the federal funds rate would decline to 2-1/2 percent, either

through a reduction in the initial borrowing allowance or a cut in the

discount rate by 50 basis points and an unchanged initial borrowing

allowance. Under alternative C, the federal funds rate would rise to

3-1/2 percent in association with a boost in the initial borrowing

allowance.

(7) Alternative B is consistent with the staff's economic

forecast. In that forecast, short-term rates are assumed to remain at

current levels through the end of 1994. Growth in output settles into a

pace broadly in line with that of potential output, preserving the

current modest slack in resource markets. Accordingly, core inflation

edges lower. Market participants apparently believe that the federal

funds rate will remain at 3 percent, at least for the next several

months, and under alternative B, money market interest rates would

remain around current levels. However, participants seem to expect

stronger economic growth over coming months than implicit in the staff

forecast and little further progress in reducing inflation. In the

absence of stronger growth, intermediate- and longer-term rates might

well drift lower as incoming data tilt market sentiment and investors

continue to reach for yield. Bond yields could remain unusually

volatile for a time as market participants continue to assess the

7. Demands for seasonal credit are likely to diminish over the
intermeeting period, as they typically do in the fall, calling for
downward technical adjustment to the borrowing allowance.



sustainability of the much reduced levels of long-term rates that have

recently been reached. This skittishness may focus particularly on

indicators bearing on the outlook for prices, partly in light of their

possible implications for monetary policy going forward. Consistent

with the staff forecast of policy easings in Germany and Japan, the

dollar should trade on the high side of recent levels under alterna-

tive B.

(8) While lower long-term rates and tight quality spreads

should continue to spur considerable activity in capital markets, net

growth in debt is expected to remain moderate. Debt of nonfederal

sectors is projected to grow more rapidly over the balance of the year

than in the first half but more slowly than nominal output. In the

business sector, net equity issuance should stay around the elevated

levels of late, restraining borrowing. Households likely will respond

vigorously to recent declines in mortgage rates, but mainly to refinance

existing mortgages. Mortgage and consumer debt is expected to continue

to increase at a moderate rate. Including the federal government, the

debt of nonfinancial sectors is projected to expand at a bit more than a

4 percent pace over the final five months of the year, leaving its

growth for the year at 4-1/2 percent, a little above the lower bound of

its annual range.

(9) As shown in the table below, M2 under alternative B is

projected to grow at a 2 percent average rate over the final four months

of this year. Special factors, especially mortgage refinancings.

should boost M2 growth a little over this period. Underlying

growth in this aggregate, however, will remain quite sluggish.

Although the flatter yield curve should eventually damp the shift from

M2 to capital market assets, we do not expect any slowing in the near

term: indeed, with recent capital gains enhancing the advertised

returns on mutual funds, inflows could remain quite brisk. On a

quarterly average basis, growth in M2 would slow to a 1-1/2 percent

rate in the fourth quarter, implying growth for the year on a Q4-to-Q4

basis of 1-1/4 percent.9 Growth in M2 velocity would pick up to a

4 percent rate in the fourth quarter, bringing the increase for the

year to 3 percent. Under alternative B, M3 would grow at a 3/4

percent rate over the remainder of this year, leaving this aggregate

just above both its fourth-quarter 1992 level and the bottom of its

8. We expect that NationsBank will transfer its government secur-
ity dealer operations, with associated RPs, to a nonbank affiliate in
October, reversing the transaction it made in July and depressing M2.
In part reflecting the surge in refinancing, M1 is projected to ac-
celerate to a 12-1/4 percent pace over the August-to-December period.
Accompanying this strength in M1, total reserves are expected to
increase at a 16-3/4 percent pace over the period and the monetary
base at a 10-3/4 percent rate.

9. The growth of M2 continues to fall short of staff money demand
models by substantial margins. More conventional models are predict-
ing about 5 percent growth this year; even the expanded models that
include the effects of the steep yield curve call for about 3-1/2
percent growth in 1993.

annual range. Sluggish demand for bank loans is expected to hold down

banks' needs for funds. Moreover, the RTC, with new funding author-

ity, is expected to begin working down its backlog of resolutions in

coming months, leading to more rapid shrinkage of thrift institutions

and the substitution of Treasury financing for deposit financing to

carry acquired assets.

(10) Under alternative A, money market interest rates would

drop by the full 50 basis point decline in the federal funds rate.

The prime rate would also decrease by this amount. Intermediate-term

rates would fall appreciably, as expectations of the path of short-

term rates in the months ahead were revised down, and the dollar would

weaken on foreign exchange markets. Real long-term rates would move

lower as well, and the drop in interest and exchange rates would

provide additional stimulus to spending over time. The extent of the

decline in nominal bond rates, however, would depend importantly on

how the market interpreted the Committee's rationale for this action.

(11) This alternative might seem attractive if the Committee

saw the lack of progress toward full employment in the staff outlook

as unsatisfactory and was willing to settle for essentially no further

disinflation in this expansion; market perceptions that the Committee

had down-weighted its price stability objective could limit declines

in nominal long-term rates. Alternative A might also be chosen if the

Committee saw economic activity and inflation as possibly coming in

below the staff forecast; market perceptions that the Committee was

signalling an expectation that the outlook for real activity had

deteriorated and for disinflation had improved could result in sub-

stantial declines in bond yields. Although the longer-term effects of

lower interest rates on money demand may be uncertain, over the next

several months deposit rates would lag declines in market rates,



-11-

boosting money growth under this alternative and providing a little

more assurance that the broad monetary aggregates would finish the

year within their ranges. Given the staff spending forecast, M2 would

expand at a 2-1/2 percent rate over the remainder of the year, ending

the year 1-1/2 percent above its fourth-quarter 1992 base. The boost

to growth in income beginning late in the year would tend to lift this

aggregate further into its tentative 1994 range early next year. Some

of the more rapid growth in M2 would show through to M3 under alterna-

tive A, but expansion of this aggregate would remain quite weak as

borrowers continued to direct their credit demands toward long-term

markets.

(12) Under alternative C, interest rates would rise and the

dollar would strengthen on foreign exchange markets. Money market

rates would increase by the full 50 basis point rise in the federal

funds rate. Although markets seem still to expect a tightening in

policy at some point, action under this alternative would come much

sooner than now built into the yield curve. Intermediate-term rates

would increase significantly, especially if the tightening were seen

as signalling a more aggressive posture of the Federal Reserve against

inflation and a higher trajectory of short-term rates for a considera-

ble period. However, lower prospective inflation might decrease far-

ahead forward rates, limiting advances in nominal bond yields.

(13) Alternative C might be favored if the modest degree

of price deceleration in the staff forecast were viewed to be unsatis-

factory. Tighter money market conditions might also be sought if the

Committee were concerned that low nominal and real short-term rates

were fostering runups in capital market prices that were unsustain-

able, risking either excessive stimulus to spending and inflation down

the road or a sharp correction in financial markets with potential



-12-

systemic implications. M2 under this alternative is projected to grow

at a 1-1/2 percent rate over the final four months of the year,

restrained primarily by higher opportunity costs and less robust

mortgage refinancings. M2 growth could be faster than this if

declines in bond and stock prices prompted a reassessment of the

relative risks of deposits and capital market instruments. M3 would

expand at only a 1/2 percent rate over this period, held down in part

by sizable outflows from institution-only money market funds. These

growth rates would place both aggregates near the bottom of their

annual ranges for this year, and on a lower trajectory going into 1994

than under alternative B, partly reflecting damped income growth.

Directive Language

(14) Presented below is draft wording for the operational

paragraph that includes the usual options for Committee consideration.

OPERATIONAL PARAGRAPH

In the implementation of policy for the immediate

future, the Committee seeks to DECREASE SOMEWHAT/maintain/

INCREASE SOMEWHAT the existing degree of pressure on re-

serve positions. In the context of the Committee's long-

run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic

growth, and giving careful consideration to economic,

financial, and monetary developments, slightly (SOMEWHAT)

greater reserve restraint (WOULD/MIGHT) or slightly (SOME-

WHAT) lesser reserve restraint (WOULD) might be acceptable

in the intermeeting period. The contemplated reserve con-

ditions are expected to be consistent with modest growth in

M2 and [DEL: little net change in] M3 over the balance of the YEAR

[DEL: third quarter].
