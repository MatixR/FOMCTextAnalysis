Prefatory Note 
 
 
The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version available 
based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the Board 
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was created 
through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned 
versions text-searchable.2   Though a stringent quality assurance process was 
employed, some imperfections may remain. 
 
Please note that some material may have been redacted from this document if that 
material was received on a confidential basis.  Redacted material is indicated by 
occasional gaps in the text or by gray boxes around non-text content.  All redacted

1  In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic 
format.  All scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced 
tilting) and lightly cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other 
blemishes caused after initial printing). 
 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optical character recognition computer program (OCR) 
first created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, 
staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.  Please note that the numbers and text in charts and 
tables were not reliably recognized by the OCR process and were not checked or corrected by staff.

Recent developments

(1) M1 appears to be growing at about a 4¼ per cent annual

rate in the January-February period--slightly above the lower limit of the

Committee's two-month range of tolerance--as the table shows. On the other

hand, M2 is expanding at around a 12 per cent rate--somewhat above the

upper limit of its range. The larger than expected increase in M2 mainly

reflects the sizable expansion in savings deposits that has occurred

since early January, when yields on some key short-term market securities

dropped below the 5 per cent ceiling rate on such accounts. In January, M1

grew at only a 1.6 per cent annual rate, but the pace of expansion picked

up during the early weeks of February.

(2) The adjusted bank credit proxy declined somewhat on balance

in January and is projected to expand at no more than about a 2¼ per cent

annual rate in February. Bank loans have increased only modestly since the

beginning of the year, and banks have permitted CD's to run-off in large

volume. While most major banks cut their prime lending rate to 6¾ per cent

during the intermeeting period, the adjustment to earlier declines in

market rates was only partial, so that spreads of the prime over commercial

paper rates remained unusually wide.

(3) With strength in M2 offsetting weakness in M1 , the Desk

continued throughout the intermeeting period to aim at the 4¾ per cent

Federal funds rate prevailing at the time of the last meeting. Other

short-term market rates did drift down another 10-15 basis points in late

January when market participants were still anticipating some further

reduction in the funds rate, but these declines were reversed once it

became clear that such a cut was unlikely. As a result, most market

interest rates showed little net change over the intermeeting period.

However, the strong performance of deposit flows at thrift institutions

encouraged some additional decline in mortgage rates.

(4) The announcement of terms on the Treasury's February

refinancing--which involved a fixed price offering of a 7-year note and

auctions of a 3-year note and a re-opened long bond--exerted less upward

yield pressure on the market for outstanding issues than many had antici-

pated. As a result, the 8 per cent coupon on the offering of 7-year notes

at par was particularly attractive. Tenders were huge, and the Treasury



issued $6 billion of the note rather than the $3½ billion originally

planned. This issue has moved to about a 1½ point premium. Meanwhile,

the new 3-year note and the re-opened long bond have moved to small

discounts relative to their auction averages. Dealers were awarded

negligible amounts of the 8 per cent note and have acquired only modest

amounts through the secondary market. Awards of the short note and the

bond were fairly large. While reasonably good progress has been made in

distributing the issues, dealers' over-all position in coupon issues is

still sizable. Moreover, their holdings of Treasury bills are unusually

large, reflecting the cumulative impact of large Treasury cash raising

activities in that area.

(5) The table on the following page shows (in percentage annual

rates of change) selected monetary and financial flows over various time

periods.

Prospective developments

(6) Summarized below for Committee consideration are alternative

shorter-run operating ranges for the monetary aggregates and the Federal

funds rate.

(7) Each of these short-run alternatives is consistent with

a 6 per cent growth rate for M1 over the period from QIV '75 to QIV '76--

the mid-point of the longer-run M1 growth range adopted by the Committee

at its last meeting. Growth rates for M2 and M3 over the longer-run

for each of the alternatives are also around the middle of the 12-month

ranges for these aggregates adopted at the last meeting. There are some

minor differences in growth rates for the broader aggregates among the

alternatives because of projected differences in interest rate patterns.

Longer-run growth rates, as well as more detailed figures, are shown in

the tables on pp. 5a and 5b.

(8) Under alternative B, the Federal funds rate range is centered

on the recently prevailing 4¾ per cent level. Given such a funds rate, M1

growth over the February-March period is expected to be within a 5 to 9 per

cent, annual rate, range. Tax refunds are projected to be very large

beginning in the second half of February--even a little larger than a

year ago, when refund payments in this period were unusually high. In

addition, the projected strength in economic activity in the first quarter

should involve rising transactions demands.

(9) Even if M1 growth in February-March is as rapid as implied

by the mid-point of the range stipulated for alternative B, M1 would

expand at only about a 3¼ per cent annual rate from the fourth quarter of

1975 to the first quarter of this year. Thus, given projected GNP growth

of about 12 per cent annual rate, another sizable rise in velocity appears

in store--as would be consistent with a further downward shift in the demand

for money. The staff is assuming only a small further downward shift after

the first quarter, and as a result interest rates can be expected to begin

rising in the spring if M1 growth is to be kept to around a 6 per cent rate

over the year. The funds rate under alternative B is expected to reach

an average level of around 6¾ per cent by the fourth quarter of this year.

Rate pressures would, of course, be stronger if the demand for money began

strengthening relative to GNP. Appendix Table IV shows Federal funds rates

expected over the course of the year for each of the alternatives.

(10) M2 growth in the February-March period under alternative

B is likely to be in a 10 to 13 per cent annual rate range. The rate of

growth in time and savings deposits (other than large CD's) may moderate

over the next few weeks from its recent exeptionally rapid pace, partly

in consequence of withdrawals in connection with payment for the new 8 per

cent 7-year Treasury note. A further slowing in such deposit flows can be



expected as the year progresses in view of the anticipated rise in

short-term market interest rates.

(11) Little further change in market interest rates would be

expected between now and the mid-March Committee meeting under the

specifications of alternative B. The 3-month bill rate could rise

somewhat because a substantial part--perhaps half--of the Treasury's

very heavy cash need of around $15 billion between now and mid-April may

be raised in the bill area, where dealer bill positions are already large.

Upward adjustment of interest rates in the 2 to 7 year maturity area may

also develop, since the Treasury will be offering additional notes

for cash in the forthcoming period; a $2 billion 21-month note to be

auctioned next Friday was announced today. Yields in the corporate bond

market are likely to fluctuate within a narrow range, with little signifi-

cant change anticipated over the next few weeks in the flow of new issues

coming to market. The municipal market is still subject to substantial

uncertainty because of persisting doubts as to how New York State and

certain other borrowers will cover forthcoming financing needs.

(12) Alternative A involves a decline in the Federal funds rate

to the mid-point of a 3¾ to 4¾ per cent range, and slightly higher growth

rates for M1 and M2 over the near-term than under alternative B. Such a

drop in the funds rate might be accompanied by only a modest decline in the

3-month Treasury bill rate, given the large Treasury cash needs noted

earlier. Long-term market rates would probably decline only temporarily,

if at all, in response to a drop in the funds rate, in view of the wide-

spread market expectations of continuing economic recovery and the

likelihood that borrowers would accelerate bond offerings should rates

soften noticeably.



(13) The staff would not expect a decline in the funds rate to

be sustainable, given the FOMC's longer-run monetary growth ranges. If

alternative A were adopted, the funds rate would probably have to start

rising by early spring, and during the third and fourth quarters would

reach levels somewhat above those resulting under alternative B. However,

reflecting the initially somewhat more accommodative reserve policy under

alternative A, growth in the aggregates would be a little stronger in the

first half of 1976 than under alternative B. Monetary growth would, of

course, be somewhat less rapid in the second half.

(14) Alternative C involves a rise in the Federal funds rate to

the mid-point of a 4¾ to 5¾ per cent range over the next few weeks. This

may engender increases of as much as 50 to 100 basis points in other

short-term rates and in yields on Treasury notes, given current market

expectations of near-term rate stability and the heavy prospective volume

of Treasury financing. Rate increases on longer-term market securities

would probably be less pronounced. The prospect for reduced flows to

thrift institutions would forestall any further decline in mortgage rates

and may set the stage for some back-up.

(15) However, under this alternative, mortgage markets, and

credit markets generally, may tighten less over the course of the year

than under either alternatives A or B. Given response lags, an early

tightening of the funds rate would mean that less pressure would have to

be exerted on markets later in the year to constrain growth in money. The

lower average level of market rates achieved under this alternative would

thus tend to limit pressures on thrift institutions during the second

half of the year compared with the other alternatives.



Proposed directive

(16) Given below is a proposed operational paragraph if the

Committee wishes to formulate its instructions in terms of desired growth

in monetary aggregates over the months ahead. No alternatives are presented

for this formulation, in the expectation that the reference to desired growth

will be taken to apply to the longer-term targets and that at this meeting

the Committee will not reconsider those targets.

"Monetary aggregates" proposal

To implement this policy, while taking account of developments

in domestic and international financial markets, the Committee seeks

to [DEL: maintain-prevailing] ACHIEVE bank reserve and money market conditions

CONSISTENT WITH MODERATE GROWTH IN MONETARY AGGREGATES over the

period [DEL: immediately] ahead [DEL: , provided that monetary aggregates appear

to be growing at about the rates currently expected.]

(17) Should the Committee desire to continue placing main

emphasis on bank reserve and money market conditions, the language needed

would depend on the specific conditions sought. Three alternative "money

market" directives intended to correspond to the similarly lettered policy

alternatives are given below.
