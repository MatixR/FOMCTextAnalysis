Recent developments

(1) Growth of M1 slowed markedly in July, as expected, but

was a little stronger than the slightly negative number that had been

projected in the last blue book. Data for the first week of August showed

only a moderate pick-up in M1 expansion. For the July-August target period,

M1 growth is now projected at an annual rate of about 3½ per cent, in

the lower part of the range of tolerance specified by the FOMC at its

last meeting. Inflows of consumer-type time and savings deposits also

moderated significantly in July and slowed still further in early August.

For July and August combined, M2 now appears likely to expand at an

annual rate of 8½ per cent, also in the lower part of the Committee's

specified growth range.

(2) Early in the intermeeting period, incoming deposit data

seemed to be indicating a substantially less pronounced slowdown than

had been forecast, and the key aggregates seemed likely to expand

at rates close to or above the upper limits of the Committee's two-month

ranges of tolerance. In these circumstances, the Desk raised its operating

target for the Federal funds rate from around 6 per cent to a range of

6-1/8 to 6-1/4 per cent. In the final week of July, although an over-

shoot in monetary growth still seemed likely, the Desk sought no

further increase in the funds rate because of uncertainties with respect

to the behavior of the monetary aggregates and the approach of the Treasury's

August refunding. The average funds rate did, nevertheless, move up to

6-1/4 per cent in that week. Since late July, incoming deposit data

have been weaker than expected and projected aggregate growth rates

have been moved down progressively to the lower part of their ranges

of tolerance. Consequently, there was no further tightening of

the funds rate, and most recently the Desk did not overtly respond

when the rate tended to edge down to a little below 6-1/8 per cent.

(3) Other short-term rates responded to the initial rise

in the funds rate and have increased appreciably further in recent

weeks, due in part to the announcement of larger than expected Treasury

financing operations. Over the full period, Treasury bill rates have

advanced 3/8 to 3/4 of a percentage point, and private short-term rates have

moved up 1/4 to 1/2 of a percentage point. Bank prime rates have also



-3-

been raised, to 7-3/4 per cent, notwithstanding the persistence

of generally weak business loan demands.

(4) In longer-term securities markets, interest rates have

also moved higher since the July FOMC meeting. Quotes on Treasury

issues have led the advance, reflecting the weight of Treasury financings--

including the three-part August refunding and the subsequent auctions

of two- and four-year notes. Upward pressures on corporate bond yields

have been dampened to some extent by the July drop-off in new-issue

volume. More recently, unsettled market conditions resulted in the

postponement or cancellation of about 1/2 a billion of new

issues that had been scheduled for marketing in August. In the

municipal market, yields have risen to new records, reflecting the com-

bination of a continued sizable volume of offerings and the impact on

market attitudes of the financing problems of New York City and the

New York State agencies. The last-minute coverage of August financing

requirements for "Big Mac" and the New York State Housing Finance Agency

may have provided some temporary relief, but both borrowers will

require large additional amounts of credit again in September.

(5) The table on the following page shows (in percentage

annual rates of change) selected monetary and financing flows over

various time periods. Appendix Table III compares money supply growth

rates computed on a quarterly-average basis with those computed on

a last-month-of-quarter basis.

Prospective developments

(6) Summarized below for Committee consideration are specifica-

tions for three alternative short-run policy courses. More detailed

figures--including levels and quarterly growth rates of the monetary

aggregates associated with the Committee's 5-7½ per cent long-run growth

target for M1--are presented in the tables on pages 5a and 5b. Alternative

operating guides expressed in terms of nonborrowed reserves, as well as

other related reserve measures, are shown in appendix table IV.

(7) Since nominal GNP is now projected to expand at an average

rate of 15 per cent through the second quarter of 1976, it seems highly

probable that longer-run growth in M1 can be contained within the Committee's

5-7½ per cent long-term target range only if money market rates rise

further as the period progresses. For this reason none of the short-run

policy options presented contemplates an easing of money market rates

from recent levels. Under alternative A, the average funds rate would

remain close to recently prevailing levels for the time being, but

Alternatives B and C would both involve some immediate further

tightening of money market conditions.

(8) The short-run specifications for alternative C--which

contemplate a near-term rise in the Federal funds rate to around

7-1/4 per cent (the mid-point of the range presented)--are thought

to be consistent with a policy strategy geared to ultimate attainment

of the 6-1/4 per cent mid-point of the Committee's 5--7-1/2 per cent

long-run target range for M1. If the staff projection of significantly

more rapid growth in nominal GNP proves correct, we believe that

efforts to hold M1 expansion to the 6-1/4 per cent long-run target

will require further substantial increases in the Federal funds rate

during the fall and early winter--perhaps to 10 per cent or more

by early 1976.

(9) Alternative B--which contemplates a rise in the Federal

funds rate during the intermeeting period to 6-3/4 per cent (the

mid-point of the 6--7-1/2 per cent range presented)--is thought

to be consistent with the first stage of a possible longer-run

strategy that would hold M1 growth within the Committee's 5--7-1/2 per

cent target range--but near the top end of that range. It conforms

with the monetary assumptions underlying the Greenbook economic

projection and is thought likely to imply a Federal funds rate

approaching 9 per cent by early 1976. As noted in the Greenbook, a

rate of money growth in the upper part of the Committee's

long-run target range would help accommodate the special price



-7-

effects resulting from decontrol of old oil and the worsening

international outlook for food prices.

(10) Alternative A is also consistent with a longer-run

strategy that would allow growth in M1 near the top of the 5--7-1/2 per

cent target range. In this case, however, some delay is envisaged

in moving to limit monetary growth, in order to avoid near-term

money market tightening while the economy is still in the beginnings

of recovery. Holding money market conditions about unchanged for the

present, however,would probably require a more aggressive tightening

later on, after the recovery gathers momentum. Therefore, the staff

believes that this strategy would imply somewhat higher money market

rates early in 1976 than under alternative B.

(11) During the immediate August-September period, growth

in the monetary aggregates is expected to pick up from the depressed

July pace. The limited data available for early August suggests

only a moderate acceleration, but the improvement in economic

activity apparently underway seems likely to result in more rapid

monetary expansion later in the month and in September. Under

the unchanged money market conditions contemplated for alternative

A, M1 growth in September is thought likely to rise to around a

7-1/2 per cent annual rate--resulting in an August-September average

of about 6-1/4 per cent. Under alternative B, the average 50 basis

point advance in the funds rate would probably exert only a small

dampening influence on the aggregates during the two month projection



-8-

period; the average M1 growth rate for August-September might be reduced

to nearly 5-3/4 per cent. The steep rise in the funds rate contemplated

under alternative C--to a 7-1/4 per cent average in the weeks immediately

ahead--would be expected to exert a more pronounced restraint on near-

term monetary growth. M1 expansion might be held to an annual rate of

about 5-1/2 per cent in September, giving an August-September average

of 5-1/4 per cent.

(12) Although we anticipate that interest rates would need

to rise substantially as the year progresses under any of the longer-

run scenarios described above, the unchanged money market conditions

of alternative A would probably encourage general interest rate

stability for a time. In the absence of additional money market firming

there might even be some little rally if there are no disquieting

financial developments. Private credit demands remain quite weak on

balance, although there have been some fragmentary indications of the

beginnings of a pickup in recent weeks. The market appears to have

made its adjustment to the higher funds rate now prevailing, and the

Treasury announcement of its somewhat increased third quarter needs

has already been taken into account by market participants.

(13) The 50 basis points rise in the Federal funds rate

contemplated under alternative B would probably trigger roughly

commensurate advances in other short-term rates, and long-term

markets would also come under renewed upward rate pressure. Moderate



further tightening would tend to confirm the widespread expectation

that interest rates are now in a firming trend, and market professionals

could be expected to continue their recent generally cautious approach

to underwriting of new issues. Rising market interest rates would

exert further pressure on the bank prime rate, and rates on Treasury

and Federal agency securities would become increasingly competitive

for savings funds now flowing into the thrift institutions. Market

repercussions from the rise in the Federal funds rate of 100 basis points

or more contemplated under alternative C, of course, would be more

extreme. Securities markets for a time might experience difficulties

in handling flows of new debt offerings. The problem of disintermediation

at depositary institutions would become more serious and would arise

sooner than anticipated in the staff economic projection. This

would make early action on Regulation Q ceilings more urgent but,

even with such action, the general availability and cost of mortgage

financing could be significantly affected.

(14) Under any of the alternatives time deposit inflows

would be expected to moderate from those of the recent past. Some

slowing is already evident in the recent data, mainly because the

special Treasury payments to individuals have terminated. Increasingly,

however, higher market interest rates will come to impinge on savings

inflows to the intermediaries, and under alternative C this impact

would probably be quite pronounced by the fourth quarter. Because

of the developing squeeze, we have assumed an increase in Regulation Q



ceilings amounting to one-half a percentage point for longer-term certifi-

cates (to become effective by year-end) under all alternatives presented.

This assumption reduces, but does not eliminate, the marked slowing

that would otherwise have been projected in the rate of expansion

of consumer-type time deposits and the more broadly defined measures

of money supply.

(15) In the August-September period, we would expect savings

inflows to continue at the more moderate recent pace, but perhaps to

be drifting lower, particularly under alternative C. The bank credit

proxy is expected to remain quite weak, since banks are unlikely

to become aggressive in seeking funds through issuance of CD's

and non-deposit liabilities until business loan demand strengthens

materially.

(16) The continuing serious financing problems of New York

City--and, increasingly, of the State--pose major uncertainties for

the intermeeting period, with respect to both credit market develop-

ments and necessary policy responses. It is not inconceivable that the System

would have to give temporary priority to general liquidity needs rather

than to its objectives for the monetary aggregates. Short of this, the

directive phrase calling for account to be taken of developments in

financial markets may assume particular importance in the conduct

of Desk operations in this period.



-11-

Proposed directive

(17) Presented below are four alternative formulations for

the operational paragraph of the directive. The first three are

intended to correspond to the similarly lettered policy alternatives

discussed in the preceding session, while the fourth may be associated

with any of the policy alternatives. In all of the alternatives the

reference to "the forthcoming Treasury financing" included in the July

directive is deleted, since the Treasury's August refunding has been

completed.

Alternative A

To implement this policy, while taking account of [DEL: the

forthcoming Treasury and of] developments in domestic

and international financial markets, the Committee seeks to main-

tain about the prevailing bank reserve and money market conditions

over the period immediately ahead, provided that [DEL: growth in] monetary

aggregates [DEL: appears] APPEAR to be GROWING AT ABOUT THE RATES

CURRENTLY EXPECTED [DEL: slowing substantially from the bulge during

the second quarter].

Alternative B

To implement this policy, while taking account of [DEL: the

forthcoming Treasury financing and of] developments in domestic

and international financial markets, the Committee seeks to

[DEL: maintain about the prevailing] ACHIEVE SOMEWHAT FIRMER bank

reserve and money market conditions over the period immediately



-12-

ahead, provided that [DEL: growth in] monetary aggregates DO NOT [DEL: appears

APPEAR to be GROWING AT RATES BELOW THOSE CURRENTLY EXPECTED

[DEL: slowing substantially from the bulge during the second quarter].

Alternative C

To implement this policy, while taking account of [DEL: the

forthcoming Treasury financing and of] developments in domestic

and international financial markets, the Committee seeks to

[DEL: maintain about the prevailing] ACHIEVE FIRMER bank reserve and

money market conditions over the period immediately ahead,

provided that [DEL: growth in] monetary aggregates DO NOT [DEL: appears

APPEAR to be GROWING AT RATES BELOW THE SPECIFIED SHORT-

RUN RANGES OF TOLERANCE [DEL: slowing substantially from the bulge

during the second quarter].

Possible substitute wording for all alternatives

To implement this policy, while taking account of [DEL: the

forthcoming Treasury financing and of] developments in domestic

and international financial markets, the Committee seeks to

[DEL: maintain about the prevailing] ACHIEVE bank reserve and money

market conditions CONSISTENT WITH MODERATE GROWTH IN MONETARY
