Recent developments

(1) Weekly deposit data now available on a preliminary basis

through December 30 and on a partial basis through January 6 indicate

that growth in the narrowly-defined money supply was at an annual rate

of about 6.7 per cent on average in December, and only about 3.6 per

cent for the fourth quarter. While the rate of growth in money supply

during December exceeded that of any previous month since August, it

still fell appreciably short of the projected 9.5 per cent rebound that

was indicated at the last meeting of the Committee. Moreover, the

November money supply growth rate was revised downward to 2.8 per cent

from the 4.5 per cent rate estimated in mid-December. The combination

of these developments resulted in a fourth quarter money supply growth

rate that was about 1-1/2 percentage points below the roughly 5 per

cent rate of growth that had been expected in consequence of the FOMC's

decision at the last meeting. In the case of the adjusted bank credit

proxy, it too grew somewhat less in December than had been indicated

at the mid-December meeting, but the rate of growth was still substan-

tial as extremely strong time deposit growth more than offset further

declines in non-deposit funds. The latest estimates and the original

target paths for the various monetary aggregates are compared in the

following table:

(2) That there might be a significant shortfall in money supply

did not become evident until December 28, although there were some tentative

indications of the direction of movement just before the long Christmas

weekend. During the final days of December, it was still not known

whether the preliminary estimate of a shortfall for the week of the



-3-

23rd would be revised upward--as_had happened at times in the past--or

how much of a year-end bulge in deposits might develop from the widely

predicted heavy seasonal repatriation of Euro-dollars by corporations

seeking to comply with balance of payments regulations. By January 4,

however, more complete data indicated that the drop in the week of the

23rd was even larger than suggested earlier; the drop apparently re-

flected the accompanying very large pay-off of business loans and a

marked increase in the Treasury balance.

(3) The day-to-day behavior of the Federal funds rate since

the last meeting of the Committee has been particularly volatile, as is

often the case during the period around year-end. During the last two

statement weeks of December the funds rate averaged 4.83 per cent, and

then in the week ending January 6 it dropped to 3.82 per cent, largely

because bank reluctance to borrow on the year-end statement date produced

a low Federal funds rate which carried through the turn-of-the year holiday

weekend. In the past two days, Federal funds have been trading mostly

in a range of 4-3/8--4-3/4 per cent, with the Desk aiming most recently

at about 4-1/2 per cent rate in view of the weakness that has developed

in the aggregates. Net free reserves averaging about $120 million were

published for the last two statement weeks, with year-end maneuvering

and bad weather conditions leading to sizable excess reserves.

(4) After a period of hesitation and even back-up in the

last half of December, interest rates have declined in the last two

days, with the largest drop in corporate bond yields. In early

January the bank prime loan rate was reduced to 6-1/2 per cent, following

the reduction to 6-3/4 per cent just before Christmas. The Federal

Reserve discount rate was cut another 1/4 point to 5-1/4 per cent



-4-

effective January 8; this reduction had already been well discounted by

the market. Most recently the 3-month bill was quoted around 4.75 per

cent.

(5) The following table summarizes seasonally adjusted annual

rates of change in major financial aggregates for selected periods.

Prospective developments

(6) Taking the December figures as a starting point, the

table on the next page shows three patterns of growth for the monetary

aggregates over the first quarter which the Committee may wish to

consider. The three growth paths shown for the narrowly-defined money

supply present alternatives that take account in differing ways of the

recent shortfalls relative to expectations, as follows:

(A) Alternative A shows a pattern consistent with a 6 per

cent annual rate of growth for M1 over the first quarter of 1971. This

would be equal to the rate of growth for the quarter that the Committee

indicated as the minimum acceptable at its last meeting, at a time when

it was expected that fourth quarter growth would be 5 per cent. Thus

alternative A does not make up for the fourth quarter shortfall. The

growth rate for the fourth and first quarters taken together would be

only about 4-3/4 per cent, as compared with the 5-1/2 per cent previously

desired. As a result, under alternative A the March level of the money

supply would be about $1 billion below previous expectations.

(B) Alternative B shows a growth path for the first quarter

which makes up for the shortfall in December and in the fourth quarter.

The first quarter growth rate in this alternative is 7-1/2 per cent,

which would lead to a March level for the money stock equal to that

resulting from the earlier 5-1/2 per cent path for the fourth and first

quarters taken together.

(C) Alternative C, which has an 8-1/2 per cent annual rate of

growth in the first quarter for M1, makes up for the shortfall and raises

the growth rate in money supply for the September-to-March period back up

to the 6 per cent rate of expansion experienced over the first three

quarters of 1970.

(7) The range of money market conditions, as typified by

the Federal funds rate, expected to be consistent over the next few

weeks with the various paths for the aggregates are noted below. The

large increases in the money stock, given the Federal funds rate, depend

mainly on the resurgence in economic activity expected to result from the

catch-up in GM auto output during the first quarter. How strong a

resurgence will develop and how such a temporary bulge will affect

money demand are additional uncertainties that compound the usual

difficulties of specifying relationships between money market conditions

and monetary aggregates.

Alternative A 5 --5-3/4 6 8

B 4 --4-3/4 7-1/2 10-1/2

C 3-1/4-- 4 8-1/2 11-1/2

(8) The weekly paths between now and the next meeting for the

various alternatives are shown in the table on the next page.

(9) Realization of alternative A aggregates would require, in

the staff's judgment, pushing the Federal funds rate up from its recent

trading range of around 4-1/2 per cent. With nominal GNP projected to

rise at an 11.7 per cent rate in the first quarter, strong transaction

demands for money and a pick-up in short-term private credit demands are

expected. Should the GNP projection and these money and credit demands

be realized, short-term rates would rise in the process of keeping money

growth down to 6 per cent. Although a tightening of the money market

following a reduction in the discount rate would be rather puzzling

to the market, it would probably be interpreted as an effort to keep

short rates up, and, with some lag, the 3-month bill rate would likely

move back up toward the new 5-1/4 per cent discount rate. Marginal

reserve measures would be tighter than recently prevailing.

(10) Under alternative B, the money market may have to be

eased from currently prevailing conditions; the funds rate was around

4-1/2 per cent on Friday and might have to be moved down into the lower

half of the 4--4-3/4 per cent range specified. The 3-month bill rate

would likely go into a 4--4-5/8 per cent range, but may not drop to the

lower end of the range unless the Federal funds rate falls to 4 per cent

or below for a sustained period of time. Under alternative C, which

would probably require a funds rate below 4 per cent, the bill rate might

also decline below 4 per cent, although expectations that rates were

bottoming out might tend to inhibit such a decline in the 3-month rate.

In either case, movements in the bill rate would be influenced by ex-

pectations as to future discount rate actions as well as by the nature of

forthcoming Treasury financings.

(11) The Treasury is expected to announce its mid-February

refunding on January 20. Books will be open until Wednesday, January 27

on the exchange portion, and if there is a cash portion, an auction would

be likely and would be held in early February. About $5 billion of

publicly-held securities mature in February, but the Treasury is also

likely to include in the exchange $1 billion of maturing March coupon

issues, and may pre-refund other later maturing issues. A large refunding

that accomplishes a noticeable amount of debt extension would tend to



-11-

lower short-term interest rates,-partly as a result of demand for bills

from holders of maturing issues not wishing to lengthen. Recent upward

adjustments in interest rates on intermediate-term Government securities

were partly in anticipation of such an enlarged refunding.

(12) With the forthcoming Treasury refunding probably largely

discounted by the market, with recent corporate issues well received, and

in light of the still large spread of long- over short-term rates, it

seems likely that longer-term interest rates will drop further, except

under conditions specified for alternative A. Interest rate declines

would tend to accelerate should the Federal funds rate move down

significantly from prevailing levels.

(13) Banks over the period ahead are likely to continue to be

aggressive buyers of municipal and U.S. Government securities in order to

lock in existing yields, Even though business loan demand may rise, net

inflows of total deposits to banks are likely to be sufficiently strong

to leave them with a substantial surplus of investment funds. Growth

in time and savings deposits other than CD's, as well as large CD's, may

slow somewhat from the advanced rate of the last half of 1970, in light

of the projected acceleration in consumer durable goods spending, but

is still likely to remain vigorous. Relatively more expansion in time

deposits would be expected under alternatives B and C, in view of the

anticipated further declines in market interest rates. With respect to

nondeposit sources, banks will become even less willing holders of Euro-

dollars to the extent that domestic short-term interest rates decline

further relative to Euro-dollar rates. The actual movement of bank Euro-

dollar holdings will depend in large part on any further official action



-12-

that may be taken to affect them. For the present projection, we have

assumed a further drop in Euro-dollar holdings of about $300 to $400

million per month under Alternatives B and C.

Possible directive language

(14) This section presents possible language for the second

paragraph of the directive for the three alternative policy courses dis-

cussed above. As will be noted, all three alternatives have the same

second sentence, calling for bank reserves and money market conditions

consistent with the objectives described in the first sentence. Also,

the second sentence includes a reference to the forthcoming Treasury

financing; as mentioned in paragraph (11), above, an announcement of

the terms of this financing is expected on January 20. Finally, it will

be noted that the structure of all three alternatives is similar to that

in the directives the Committee was issuing before the December 15 meet-

ing; it has been assumed that the Committee adopted a different structure

in the second paragraph of the December 15 directive primarily because of

special circumstances it expected to prevail during the period, encompass-

ing the year-end, to which that directive applied.

(15) Alternative A. This alternative is proposed for possible

use if the Committee decides upon a 6 per cent target growth rate for the

money supply in the first quarter, despite the shortfall in the fourth

quarter from the 5 per cent rate that had been expected at the time of the

last meeting.

money market conditions CONSISTENT WITH THOSE OBJECTIVES,

TAKING ACCOUNT OF THE FORTHCOMING TREASURY FINANCING [DEL: until

the next meeting of the Committee, provided that the expected

rates of growth in money and bank credit will at least be

achieved].

Unlike alternatives B and C below, the first sentence of this alternative

does not indicate that the Committee desires to promote easier conditions

in credit markets. Such a statement has been omitted since this directive

might entail tighter money market conditions with potential consequences

for credit markets generally.

(19) Alternative B. This alternative is proposed for possible

use if the Committee decides that the fourth-quarter shortfall in money

should be made up in the first quarter. As indicated in paragraph (6B)

above, attainment of the average March level of money contemplated by the

Committee at the December 15 meeting would involve a growth rate for money

over the first quarter of about 7-1/2 per cent.

To implement this policy, THE COMMITTEE SEEKS TO PROMOTE

SOME EASING OF CONDITIONS IN CREDIT MARKETS AND MODERATE GROWTH

WITH THOSE OBJECTIVES, TAKING ACCOUNT OF THE FORTHCOMING

TREASURY FINANCING [DEL: until the next meeting of the Committee,

provided that the expected rates of growth in money and

bank credit will at least be achieved].

The phrase "some easing of conditions in credit markets" has been

reintroduced here in line with the expectation noted in paragraphs (10)

and (12). That interest rates--encompassing intermediate- and longer-

term as well as short-term rates--would decline under this alternative.

(20) Alternative C. This alternative is proposed for

possible use if the Committee decides to seek growth in money over the

first quarter at a faster rate than would be required simply to make

up the fourth quarter shortfall. One possible growth rate under this

alternative--8-1/2 per cent--was noted in paragraph (6C) above.

To implement this policy, THE COMMITTEE SEEKS TO

PROMOTE EASING OF CONDITIONS IN CREDIT MARKETS AND MORE

RAPID GROWTH IN MONEY, WITH ATTENDANT BANK CREDIT

EXPANSION, OVER THE MONTHS AHEAD. System open market

operations UNTIL THE NEXT MEETING OF THE COMMITTEE shall

be conducted with a view to maintaining BANK RESERVES

CONSISTENT WITH THOSE OBJECTIVES, TAKING ACCOUNT OF THE



-15-

FORTHCOMING TREASURY FINANCING [DEL: until the next meeting of the

Committee, provided that the expected rates of growth in

money and bank credit will at least be achieved].

Whereas alternative B includes a statement to the effect that "the

Committee seeks to promote some easing of conditions in credit markets,"

the word "some" is omitted in the corresponding statement in this alter-

native. This difference reflects the expectation that interest rates

would decline somewhat more under this alternative--which calls for

"more rapid growth in money"--than under alternative B.
