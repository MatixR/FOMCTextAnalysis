RECENT DEVELOPMENTS 

SUMMARY 

Financial conditions generally remained supportive of economic growth over the 

intermeeting period.  Equity prices increased about 5½ percent, while spreads on 

corporate bonds edged down amid modest further improvement in indicators of 

corporate credit quality.  Yields on Treasury securities rose slightly.  Partly as a result 

of somewhat weaker-than-expected incoming economic data, TIPS-based inflation 

compensation decreased at all horizons and the expected path of the target federal 

funds rate flattened a bit.  Although the broad dollar index changed little, on balance, 

weak incoming data for Europe and concerns about fiscal strains in some European 

countries contributed to a significant appreciation of the dollar relative to the euro 

and the British pound.  Market functioning was generally stable, even as the Federal 

Reserve continued to close many of its liquidity facilities.  Interest rates on residential 

mortgages and mortgage-backed securities (MBS) were about flat despite the 

continued tapering of Federal Reserve purchases of agency debt and MBS as those 

programs neared completion.  Bank loans to both businesses and households declined 

sharply further in January and February, but bond issuance remained solid over that 

period, and consumer credit increased in January for the first time in a year.   

MONETARY POLICY EXPECTATIONS AND TREASURY YIELDS 

The FOMC’s decision to keep the target range for the federal funds rate 

unchanged at the January meeting and its retention of the “extended period” language 

in the statement were widely anticipated by financial market participants and elicited 

little reaction.1

                                           
1 The effective federal funds rate averaged 0.13 percent over the intermeeting period. 

  Financial markets also responded little to the release of the minutes of 

the January FOMC meeting on February 17, although investors reportedly took note 

March 11, 2010 Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 1 of 68



of the discussion of potential asset sales and the indication that it would “soon be 

appropriate” to raise the discount rate.  Investors were highly attuned to Federal 

Reserve communications that could be seen as related to exit strategy.  For example, 

Eurodollar rates moved up and equity futures declined noticeably when the Federal 

Reserve announced an increase in the primary credit rate from 50 basis points to 75 

basis points on February 18.  However, that reaction proved transitory as market 

participants later focused on the part of the announcement that stated the action did 

not signal any change in the outlook for monetary policy, a message that was 

reinforced by communications from several Federal Reserve officials.  Reaction to the 

Chairman’s testimony accompanying the semiannual Monetary Policy Report was also 

muted, in part because the material focusing on the exit strategy had been previewed 

in written testimony released on February 10. 

Although Federal Reserve communications had little net effect on the outlook for 

policy, incoming economic data—particularly lower-than-expected readings on 

consumer confidence, consumer price inflation, and home sales—led investors to 

mark down the expected path of the federal funds rate.  Futures quotes combined 

with the staff’s standard assumption of a 1-basis-point-per-month term premium in 

interbank rates imply that the federal funds rate will first increase to more than 25 

basis points near the end of the third quarter of 2010 (Chart 1).  Market participants 

now anticipate that the target will reach about 1¾ percent by the end of 2011, roughly 

20 basis points lower than at the time of the January FOMC meeting.  Market quotes 

for interest rate caps suggest that investors’ assessment of the mode of the funds rate 

distribution, rather than the mean, was little changed over the intermeeting period, 

and it appears not to move above 25 basis points until mid-2011.  Likewise, the results 

from the March survey of primary dealers were mostly in line with those from the 

January survey.  The median expectation was for the first increase in the target federal

funds rate to occur in the fourth quarter of this year.  Dealers do not anticipate any 

major changes in the statement at the upcoming meeting.   

Yields on 2-year and 10-year nominal Treasury securities edged up, on net, over 

the intermeeting period.  Yields may have been supported by a modest reduction in 

perceived downside risks to the economic outlook as the economy continued to 

recover, and by greater optimism that fiscal strains in peripheral Europe will be 

resolved without undue disruption.  Yields on TIPS rose somewhat more than those 

on their nominal counterparts.  Those yields were reportedly buoyed in part by supply 

pressures, as well as signs of diminished interest in TIPS from retail investors.  

Reflecting these developments, inflation compensation declined over the period, a 

move that is consistent with the somewhat weaker-than-expected economic data in 

addition to the supply factors that contributed to the increase in real yields.  Survey 

measures of long-term inflation expectations also decreased slightly.  

The Treasury auctioned more than $300 billion in coupon securities of various 

maturities over the intermeeting period and indicated that it expected nominal auction 

sizes to stabilize around their current levels.  The auctions were generally well 

received.  Treasury replaced the 20-year TIPS auction with an auction of 30-year 

TIPS—the first since 2001—and signaled in its mid-quarter refunding statement that 

it might increase the frequency of TIPS auctions across the curve.  On February 12, 

the President signed legislation that raised the debt ceiling by $1.9 trillion to $14.3 

trillion.2

                                           
2 According to projections by the staff, the debt ceiling will not become binding again until 
well into 2011. 

  Treasury’s subsequent announcement that it would increase the 

Supplementary Financing Program (SFP) to $200 billion by April initially generated

some market speculation about its relationship to the onset of policy tightening; as of 

March 10 these balances totaled $50 billion.3  

CAPITAL MARKETS  

Broad equity price indexes rose 4½ to 6½ percent, on balance, over the 

intermeeting period, with financial shares gaining about 9 percent (Chart 2).4  Equity 

prices were supported by a strong finish to the fourth-quarter earnings season, a 

development that may also have contributed to a small upward revision in analysts’ 

forecasts of year-ahead earnings through mid-February.  The equity premium, 

measured as the staff’s estimate of the expected real return on equities over the next 

10 years relative to the real 10-year yield on Treasury securities, remained well above 

levels observed during the past decade.  Option-implied volatility on the S&P 500 

index fell back to a fairly low level. 

                                           
3 On March 11, the SFP increased to $75 billion. 
4 Some financial markets experienced large price movements in the three business days 
between the publication of the Bluebook on January 21 and the second day of the January 
FOMC meeting, January 27.  Those movements owed in part to concerns about the 
announcement of monetary policy tightening in China, greater concerns about fiscal strains 
in peripheral European countries, and proposed new regulations on U.S. financial 
institutions.  Broad equity price indexes declined about 2¼ percent, on balance over that 
period, and bond spreads widened noticeably, with yields on investment-grade corporate 
securities rising almost 10 basis points and yields on speculative-grade debt increasing about 
15 basis points, while Treasury yields changed little.  

March 11, 2010 Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 5 of 68

Yields on investment-grade corporate bonds were about unchanged over the 

intermeeting period, and their spreads over yields on comparable-maturity Treasury 

securities remained near the levels that prevailed late in 2007.  Consistent with 

improved investor sentiment toward risky assets, yields and spreads on speculative-

grade bonds edged down, and secondary market prices of leveraged loans rose 

further.  Indicators of the credit quality of nonfinancial firms continued to improve, 

on balance.  Firms’ holdings of liquid assets rose and leverage declined in the fourth

quarter of last year; the rate of increase in the delinquency rate on C&I loans slowed 

considerably.  Meanwhile, the six-month trailing corporate bond default rate has 

declined further in January and February, reaching a level consistent with those seen 

in the previous two expansions.  Ratings upgrades of nonfinancial bonds continued 

over the past two months at the same modest pace as in the second half of last year, 

and downgrades so far this year have not been material.  The year-ahead expected 

default frequency for nonfinancial firms from Moody’s KMV moved down on 

balance in January and February, but remained elevated.  

Overall, net debt financing by nonfinancial businesses was near zero in January 

and February (Chart 3).  Gross issuance of investment- and speculative-grade bonds 

stayed robust over that period, but the steep runoff in C&I loans continued, and 

commercial paper outstanding decreased further.  Net equity issuance by nonfinancial 

firms turned negative in the fourth quarter.  Gross equity issuance so far this year has 

weakened from its fourth-quarter pace, while announcements of equity repurchases 

and cash financed mergers and acquisitions appear to have risen a bit.  For financial 

firms, gross public equity issuance dropped off following the fourth-quarter surge 

associated with the repayment of TARP capital by some large banking organizations, 

and financial bond issuance remained strong. 

Over the intermeeting period, the average interest rate on 30-year conforming 

fixed-rate residential mortgages was about unchanged, on net, at 4.95 percent.  Yields 

on agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) were little changed, and the option-

adjusted spread stayed at very low levels.  Net issuance of MBS by Fannie Mae and 

Freddie Mac remained sluggish through the end of January.  The volume of Federal 

Reserve purchases of MBS has left certain issues relatively scarce, particularly those 

with coupons of 5 percent and 5½ percent.  Moreover, the cost of failing to deliver 

MBS collateral is very low, a situation that contrasts with that in the Treasury market, 

where a fails charge was instituted in May 2009.  As a result, investors appear to have

been reluctant to deliver the portions of those MBS issues that remain available in the 

secondary market, generating a high rate of fails in those segments.   

Market-based indicators of forward spreads in the MBS market do not appear to 

have priced in an increase in spreads at the end of the purchase program.  Market 

participants attribute the near-term tightness in MBS spreads to several factors, 

including the expectation that traditional investors that are significantly underweight 

in MBS will return to the market when the purchase program ends, the reinvestment 

by investors of the proceeds from the agencies’ purchases of delinquent loans from 

existing MBS pools, and the slow pace of recent mortgage originations.  An informal 

survey conducted by the Desk indicates that on average market participants anticipate 

that MBS spreads will initially widen about 10 to 15 basis points following the end of 

the purchase program, a range that is somewhat lower than in the January survey.   

Consumer credit increased slightly in January, the first monthly increase since 

January 2009.  The contraction in revolving consumer credit moderated and was more 

than offset by a modest gain in nonrevolving credit.  Although delinquency rates on 

consumer loans remain very elevated, they have edged down from their recent peaks.  

Interest rates on new auto loans at dealerships declined over the intermeeting period 

to about 4¾ percent.  By contrast, interest rates on credit cards rose further, on 

balance, likely reflecting several factors, including lenders’ preparations for 

implementation of the Credit CARD Act in mid-February, regulatory and accounting 

changes that increase the cost of funds, and the continued high rate of charge-offs.  A 

paucity of asset-backed security (ABS) issuance backed by credit card receivables—

reportedly reflecting declines in outstanding balances and a decision by some large 

banks to fund the loans on their balance sheets amid the implementation of new 

accounting regulations—held down total consumer ABS issuance during January and 

February.

MARKET FUNCTIONING AND FEDERAL RESERVE PROGRAMS 

Conditions in short-term funding markets remained generally stable over the 

intermeeting period.  One- and three-month Libor-OIS spreads stayed low while six-

month spreads edged down further.  Spreads of rates on A2/P2-rated commercial 

paper and AA-rated ABCP over the AA nonfinancial rate were also little changed at 

low levels.  Indicators of functioning in other markets were largely unchanged.   

No signs of stress emerged in short-term funding markets following the 

expiration of several Federal Reserve liquidity facilities on February 1 and the final 

TAF auction on March 8.  (See box entitled “Balance Sheet Developments during the 

Intermeeting Period.”)  Consistent with these developments, borrowing from Federal 

Reserve liquidity facilities for multiple borrowers (including primary, secondary, and 

seasonal credit; TAF; and CPFF) totaled $38 billion as of March 10, down $26 billion 

since the latest FOMC meeting.  However, in early March, the effective federal funds 

rate temporarily firmed a few basis points, reflecting an uptick in general collateral 

repo rates related to increased Treasury issuance.5   

                                           
5 Market participants also pointed to rumors that the Federal Reserve was considering paying 
interest on reserves to the GSEs, and that the GSEs had been cutting their deposit lines 
with foreign banks as reasons for the firming. 

March 11, 2010 Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 10 of 68

The Federal Reserve Bank of New York announced on March 8 that it was 

beginning a program to expand its list of counterparties for conducting reverse repos 

to increase the capacity of such operations to drain reserves beyond what could likely 

be done through the Primary Dealers.  Along with the announcement, it published the 

eligibility criteria for the first set of expanded counterparties—domestic money 

market mutual funds—and stated that in coming months it would include additional 

types of firms and expand eligibility within previously identified types of firms.  The 

announcement reportedly generated little reaction from market participants and no 

shift in policy expectations. 



Balance Sheet Developments during the Intermeeting Period 

The Federal Reserve’s total assets continued to edge up over the intermeeting 
period, reaching $2.3 trillion, as the net increase in securities held outright more 
than offset the net decline in lending through liquidity and credit facilities.1 

During the intermeeting period, securities held outright rose, on net, 
$65 billion.  The Open Market Desk purchased $77 billion, on net, in agency 
mortgage-backed securities (MBS).2  The Desk also purchased $5.4 billion in agency 
debt securities; only one additional operation is planned.  The increase in outright 
securities holdings was only partially offset by a $29 billion decline in lending 
through the System’s liquidity and credit facilities.3  Foreign central bank liquidity 
swaps, the Primary Dealer Credit Facility (PDCF), the Commercial Paper Funding 
Facility (CPFF), the Asset-Backed Commercial Paper Money Market Mutual Fund 
Liquidity Facility (AMLF), and the Term Securities Lending Facility (TSLF) all 
expired on February 1, 2010.  The net portfolio holdings of CPFF LLC declined by 
$1 billion, to $8 billion, of which only $3 billion is outstanding commercial paper, 
all of which will mature on April 21, 2010; the LLC will hold other assets until it is 
dissolved.4  The final Term Auction Facility (TAF) auction occurred on March 8 
with a minimum bid rate of 50 basis points; only $3.4 billion in TAF loans were 
extended, all of which will mature on April 8, 2010.  The increase in the primary 
and secondary credit rates on February 19 had no noticeable impact on borrowing.   

Lending through the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF) 
declined $2 billion, on net, over the intermeeting period as three TALF operations 
settled.  About $2.5 billion in loans backed by commercial mortgage-backed 
securities (CMBS) and about $1 billion in loans secured by non-CMBS were 
extended.  This increase in lending, however, was more than offset by $5.5 billion 
in loan prepayments.  The last non-CMBS TALF subscription, which took place on 
March 4, saw $4.1 billion in loan requests, all settled on March 11.   

                                           
1 These data are through March 10, 2010.  
2 The figures for securities holdings reflect only trades that have settled.  Over the intermeeting period, the 

Open Market Desk committed to purchase, but has not settled, an additional $86.2 billion of MBS, on net. 
3 Press releases over the intermeeting period discussed the pending sale of certain subsidiaries of American 

International Group (AIG), with the proceeds intended to pay down the Federal Reserve Bank of New 
York’s preferred interest in American International Assurance Group (AIA) LLC and American Life 
Insurance Co. (ALICO) LLC, as well as the credit extension to AIG.  These transactions are reflected in the 
projections found in the Long-Run Projections of the Balance Sheet and Monetary base section.   

4 The other assets of CPFF LLC are investments of the fees paid by issuers that have sold commercial paper 
to the facility.

On the liability side of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet, the U.S. Treasury’s 
general account, which is a volatile balance sheet item, declined $111 billion, while 
the Treasury’s supplementary financing account increased $45 billion with the 
resumption of bill issuance under the Supplementary Financing Program after the 
debt ceiling was raised in early February.  Reserve balances of depository 
institutions increased by $87 billion over the intermeeting period.

The final TALF subscription for non-mortgage asset-backed securities (ABS) 

settled on March 11.6  TALF-eligible ABS issuance picked up in February and March, 

as issuers sought to benefit from TALF financing before the expiration of the 

program.  In total, 14 new TALF-eligible ABS deals totaling $11.4 billion were 

brought to market during the final two subscriptions—a bit above the average level 

over the preceding four months.  Only about one-fifth of ABS issuance (including 

non-TALF deals) has been financed by TALF loans on average this year.  The final 

TALF subscription for legacy commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) will 

take place on March 19 and is expected to garner TALF loan requests of about the 

same moderate amounts seen in recent months.  TALF financing for newly issued 

CMBS will be available through June, but it is unclear if there will be any loan 

requests.  Market participants expect at most a modest uptick in ABS and CMBS 

spreads in response to the closing of TALF.   

FOREIGN MARKET DEVELOPMENTS 
Foreign financial markets and the trade-weighted value of the broad nominal 

dollar were volatile but generally little changed, on net, since the January FOMC 

meeting (Chart 4).  Much of the volatility was related to concerns spurred by Greece’s 

fiscal problems. 

Sovereign risk concerns have continued to focus on Greece and, to a lesser extent, 

a few other European countries, leading their sovereign bond yields to remain at 

elevated levels.  Spreads on Greek debt relative to German bunds widened as much as 

90 basis points early in the intermeeting period.  However, they have fallen back more 

recently, as press reports that euro-area countries are discussing a possible aid package 

for Greece and the announcement of further deficit reduction measures by the Greek 

government have helped assuage investor concerns about a Greek default.  Spreads 

                                           
6 Including the subscription on March 11, TALF loans rose over the intermeeting period to 
$48.6 billion, as new loan requests were again partially offset by early repayments.

on debt issued by several other European countries with high budget deficits were 

also volatile but ended the intermeeting period close to their levels at the time of the 

January FOMC.  The fiscal situation in the United Kingdom, particularly the 

possibility that upcoming elections may result in a politically weak government unable 

to work towards deficit reduction, also drew some market attention and boosted 

British sovereign yields.  Benchmark sovereign yields in other countries were little 

changed.   

Reflecting these fiscal concerns as well as weak incoming data in Europe, the 

dollar appreciated notably against sterling and the euro over the intermeeting period, 

rising 7½ percent against the British pound and 3¼ percent against the euro.  

Offsetting the appreciation against the euro and sterling, the dollar fell against the 

Canadian dollar and most emerging market currencies, as data for these countries 

came in stronger than expected.  On net, the major currencies index is up a little less 

than 1 percent, and the broad nominal index of the dollar is unchanged.   

The Bank of England (BOE) and the ECB held rates steady over the period, and 

the BOE elected not to expand the size of the Asset Purchase Facility, which reached 

its £200 billion limit at the end of January.  In early March, the ECB announced 

several steps to normalize its provision of liquidity:  It will discontinue its six-month 

refinancing operations after March, and future three-month operations will revert to a 

fixed-allotment, competitive-rate structure.  Shorter-term operations will continue to 

be fixed-rate and full-allotment through the third quarter.  These moves toward 

normalization notwithstanding, weak incoming data in Europe pushed back market-

based expectations for policy tightening by the BOE and the ECB to the first and 

fourth quarters of 2011, respectively, about two quarters later than at the time of the 

January FOMC.

Equity markets in most foreign countries are up modestly, on net, since the 

January FOMC meeting, with equities in some emerging markets leading the way, 

boosted by strong economic data in those regions. 

DEBT, BANK CREDIT, AND MONEY 

Aggregate debt of the private domestic nonfinancial sectors fell in the fourth 

quarter as a result of further declines in business and household debt (Chart 5).  By 

contrast, federal government debt expanded significantly, although its rate of growth 

slowed relative to earlier in 2009.  State and local government debt continued to 

expand at a moderate pace.  All told, the growth rate of domestic nonfinancial sector 

debt declined from an annual rate of almost 3 percent in the third quarter to about 

1½ percent in the fourth quarter. 

Bank credit continued to contract sharply during January and February, with both 

loans and securities moving lower.7

                                           
7 These numbers have been adjusted to remove the effects of consolidations of assets under 
FAS 166 and FAS 167.  The box entitled “Effect of FAS 166 and FAS 167 on Commercial 
Banks” on pages 10-11 of the December 10, 2009, Bluebook provides additional 
information. 

  C&I loans tumbled further, and, according to the 

February Survey of Terms of Business Lending, the spread of C&I loan rates over 

Eurodollar and swap rates of comparable maturity increased again.  Significant 

declines in outstanding commercial real estate loans also persisted, reflecting the weak 

fundamentals in the sector as well as paydowns and charge-offs of existing loans.  

Banks’ holdings of residential mortgages fell over the past two months, as originations 

reportedly stayed weak and sales of such loans to the GSEs contributed to a large 

decline in February.  Credit card loans originated by banks fell steeply in January and 

February, reflecting weak demand as well as tight terms.  Other consumer loans were 

about flat on average over the same period, reportedly boosted in part by tax refund 

loans.  However, growth in banks’ holdings of Treasury and agency debt securities

remained robust, especially at large banks.  Despite the decline in bank credit, total 

commercial bank assets edged up in February as banks’ cash and equivalent assets (a 

category that includes reserve balances) increased sharply. 

According to Call Reports, bank profitability remained very weak in the fourth 

quarter.  The most significant drag on earnings continued to be the very elevated level 

of loan loss provisions, although provisions declined noticeably.  This decline 

appeared to be conditioned upon some signs of stabilization in the credit quality of 

several categories of loans in the fourth quarter, particularly credit card loans.  Modest 

profits at banks in the 25 largest bank holding companies were about balanced by a 

sixth consecutive quarterly loss at all other banks.  The better results at larger banks in 

2009 primarily reflected their broader sources of noninterest income, such as trading 

revenue and mortgage servicing; however, net interest margins at the largest banks 

also moved up over the course of 2009 as they benefited particularly from significant 

inflows of low-cost core deposits.  Amid weak demand and tight supply conditions, 

the capacity of households and businesses to borrow from banks contracted further in 

the fourth quarter, as both loans and unused loan commitments shrank.  The drop in 

bank assets combined with additional capital infusions from parent holding 

companies pushed up regulatory capital ratios from already-high levels. 

M2 decreased at about an 8½ percent annual rate in January and increased at 

roughly an 8 percent pace in February, reflecting, in part, a swing in the growth rate of 

liquid deposits.8

                                           
8 Staff estimates suggest that tax refunds are running a bit above last year’s pace, and they are 
estimated to be boosting M2 growth by roughly 1 percentage point at an annual rate in the 
first quarter. 

  The robust growth in liquid deposits seen throughout 2009 paused 

in January, in part because several large depository institutions opted out of the 

FDIC’s Transaction Account Guarantee Program when participation became more 

expensive after the turn of the year.  In response, depositors reportedly moved 

March 11, 2010 Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 19 of 68



uninsured funds to alternative investments outside of M2.  These transfers apparently 

did not continue in February, and liquid deposits returned to double-digit growth.  

Small time deposits and retail money market mutual funds continued to run off in 

both January and February, perhaps contributing to strong flows to longer-term 

mutual funds so far this year.  Currency growth remained solid on average in January 

and February, and the monetary base increased further as a result of continued large-

scale asset purchases by the Federal Reserve.  

  

March 11, 2010 Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 20 of 68



ECONOMIC OUTLOOK 

Incoming economic data over the intermeeting period—including readings on real 

activity and inflation that were somewhat lower than expected on net—led the staff to 

mark down the forecast for economic growth a little and to trim the inflation 

projection.  Nonetheless, the broad contours of the staff projection are similar to 

those in the January Greenbook: a gradual recovery in economic activity, 

unemployment declining slowly from an elevated level, and subdued rates of inflation 

through 2014.   

The staff forecast assumes that the current target range for the federal funds rate 

will not be raised until the first quarter of 2012—one quarter later than in the January 

projection—and that no asset purchases will be executed beyond those previously 

announced.9  As in January, the staff expects fiscal policy to add about 1 percentage 

point to real GDP growth this year but to exert a slight drag on growth next year.   

                                           
9 The staff expects that the Federal Reserve will have purchased a total of slightly more than 
$1.7 trillion of longer-term securities by the end of the current quarter—$300 billion of 
Treasury debt, about $175 billion of agency debt, and $1.25 trillion of agency mortgage-
backed securities (MBS).  The System’s holdings of these securities are assumed to run off 
gradually thereafter, declining to just under $1.4 trillion by the end of 2011, as the proceeds 
from maturing issues and prepayments on agency MBS are not reinvested. 

March 11, 2010 Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 21 of 68

Interest rates on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages and longer-term Treasury securities 

are projected to rise moderately through 2011, with the spread between them 

gradually widening about 30 basis points over coming months in response to the 

cessation of purchases of agency MBS by the Federal Reserve.  By contrast, yields on 

investment-grade corporate bonds are expected to remain about flat this year and to 

increase less than Treasury yields next year, as risk spreads narrow somewhat further 

against a backdrop of continued improvements in the economic outlook.  With the 

equity risk premium also expected to narrow, stock prices are projected to rise at an 



annual rate of around 15 percent over the next two years.  Bank lending conditions 

are anticipated to ease slowly over time but to remain tighter than their ten-year 

average prior to the recent crisis.  House prices are projected to decline somewhat 

further this year in response to an increased pace of foreclosures and then to rise a bit 

in 2011 as demand gradually picks up.   

The spot price of West Texas intermediate crude oil currently stands at about $82 

per barrel, up a little over the intermeeting period, and the staff projects a small 

further rise to about $86 per barrel by late next year.  The real foreign exchange value 

of the dollar is expected to depreciate at an average annual rate of about 3 percent 

over the balance of 2010 and 2011 after an appreciation of about 3½ percent in the 

first quarter of this year.  

Against this backdrop, the staff expects real GDP to grow about 3¼ percent this 

year and about 4½ percent next year, about ¼ percentage point below the January 

projections.  In light of the incoming data, the trajectory for the unemployment rate 

has been lowered marginally compared to the last Greenbook, with the projection 

now declining slowly to about 9½ percent at the end of 2010 and 8¼ percent at the 

end of 2011, well above the staff’s estimate of the effective NAIRU over this period.10

                                           
10 As discussed in the Greenbook, the staff’s estimate of the NAIRU for the next two years 
accounts for the effects on the measured unemployment rate of emergency and extended 
unemployment benefits, which currently appear to be boosting the NAIRU by almost a 
percentage point.  The staff anticipates that this effect will only diminish a bit through next 
year.  Absent these temporary factors, the NAIRU would currently be estimated at 5¼ 
percent. 

  

With inflation expectations stable and economic slack forecast to remain substantial, 

the staff projects core PCE inflation to slow from 1½ percent last year to about 1 

percent this year and in 2011.  Total PCE inflation is expected to moderate to rates 

close to those of core inflation later this year and in 2011, after having been boosted 

by increasing oil prices to 2½ percent in the second half of last year. 

March 11, 2010 Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 22 of 68



Looking further ahead, the staff forecasts above-trend output growth, falling 

unemployment, and slowly rising inflation.  The federal funds rate is assumed to start 

rising in early 2012 and to reach 3½ percent by late 2014.  Real GDP is anticipated to 

expand 4¾ percent in 2012 before decelerating to 3½ percent in 2014, while potential 

output is expected to advance about 2½ percent per year on average.  As a result, the 

projected unemployment rate declines to 5¼ percent in 2014, about in line with the 

staff’s estimate of the NAIRU at that time.  With a steadily closing output gap and 

stable expectations for longer-term inflation, total PCE inflation rises slowly after 

2011 and by 2014 reaches 1½ percent—a rate still somewhat below the central 

tendency of policymakers’ long-run projections for inflation.

MONETARY POLICY STRATEGIES 

Chart 6 displays estimates of short-run r*, defined as the real federal funds rate 

that, if maintained over time, would return output to potential in twelve quarters.  All 

but one of the current estimates are lower than their counterparts in the January 

Bluebook, reflecting the downward revision in the outlook for aggregate demand.  

The Greenbook-consistent short-run r* estimate generated by the FRB/US model is  

-1.9 percent, 40 basis points lower than its value in January and well below the actual 

real funds rate of -1.2 percent.  The Greenbook-consistent r* estimate derived using 

the EDO model is now -3.8 percent, 150 basis points below its January value.  The 

Greenbook-consistent r* estimate from EDO has decreased significantly more than 

the corresponding estimate from FRB/US because aggregate demand in EDO is less 

sensitive to changes in the real funds rate, implying that any revision to the output gap 

requires a relatively greater revision to short-term interest rates in EDO to bring 

output in line with potential. 

While the Greenbook-consistent r* estimates take as given the staff outlook and 

assessment of the current degree of slack, the four model-based estimates are 

conditioned on the respective models’ projections of the output gap.  The single-

equation model, the small structural model, and the EDO model each project a wider 

output gap for the current quarter than in the previous Bluebook; hence, the r* 

estimates from these three models are lower now than in January and, with the 

exception of the EDO model estimate, lower than the actual real funds rate.  In 

contrast, the FRB/US model-based r* estimate is little changed, mainly because the 

data received since January have not significantly affected the FRB/US model’s 

estimate of the underlying level of aggregate demand over the next twelve quarters. 

Chart 7 shows the results of optimal control simulations of the FRB/US model.  

These simulations use the extended staff baseline projection, which incorporates the

Federal Reserve’s large-scale asset purchases, as a starting point.  Policymakers are 

assumed to place equal weight on keeping core PCE inflation close to a 2 percent 

inflation goal, on keeping unemployment close to the NAIRU (adjusted for the 

temporary effects of emergency and extended unemployment benefits on the 

measured unemployment rate), and on minimizing changes in the federal funds rate.  

As in recent Bluebooks, optimal monetary policy in these simulations is constrained 

by the effective lower bound, and the nominal funds rate does not leave this bound 

until early 2013 (black solid lines).  Under this policy, the unemployment rate would 

be projected to remain above the NAIRU through late 2012, while core PCE inflation 

would stay appreciably below the 2 percent goal through late 2014.  The chart also 

displays the optimal-control results obtained if the nominal funds rate were not 

constrained by the effective lower bound (blue dashed lines).  Absent the constraint, 

the nominal funds rate would move down to about -3½ percent early next year; the 

more accommodative policy stance would return the unemployment rate to the 

NAIRU more quickly and bring the inflation trajectory closer to the assumed 2 

percent goal.   

As noted in the March Greenbook, the projected gap between actual output and 

potential output over the forecast period is somewhat wider than in January—

consistent with the decrease in the Greenbook-consistent r* estimates—but, reflecting 

incoming data, the unemployment projection was revised down.  Since the optimal-

control simulations use the unemployment rate gap as the measure of real activity and 

the downward revision to the unemployment rate path roughly offsets the impact of 

lower inflation, the contour of the unconstrained policy path changed little apart from 

shifting out by a quarter relative to January (red dotted lines).  This shift occurred 

because this Bluebook’s optimal-control simulations jump off from the 2010Q1 level 

of the federal funds rate, while the previous Bluebook took 2009Q4 as the jumping-

off point. 

March 11, 2010 Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 27 of 68



According to Chart 8, the outcome-based policy rule prescribes a trajectory for 

the federal funds rate somewhat below the one in the previous Bluebook, reflecting 

the modestly lower paths for output and inflation in this projection (upper-left panel).  

The nominal funds rate starts rising above the effective lower bound in 2012Q2, two 

quarters later than in the January Bluebook.  According to money-market futures 

quotes, market participants’ expectations regarding the path of the funds rate also 

shifted down somewhat over the intermeeting period; the expected funds rate 

between 2011 and 2013 averages about 30 basis points lower than at the time of the 

previous Bluebook (upper-right panel).   

The lower panel of Chart 8 provides near-term prescriptions from simple policy 

rules.  The two variants of the Taylor rule and the two estimated policy rules would 

keep the federal funds rate at its effective lower bound over the next two quarters.  

The first-difference rule—because it responds to economic growth rather than to the 

estimated level of economic slack—prescribes a funds path above the lower bound; 

still, the prescribed funds rates are below those in the previous Bluebook, reflecting 

the slightly weaker economic outlook.  Likewise, the unconstrained policy 

prescriptions from the two variants of the Taylor rule are now lower than in January.  

In contrast, the two estimated policy rules prescribe higher funds rates than in the 

previous Bluebook, entirely because of the shift in the jumping-off quarter for the 

rules calculation.11 

  

                                           
11 The two estimated rules include lags of the funds rate and prescribe a funds rate path that 
is decreasing over the next several quarters.  In this Bluebook, the rules calculation is 
conditioned on the funds rate at the effective lower bound in 2010Q1.  In contrast, the 
January simulations jumped from the funds rate at the lower bound in 2009Q4.

POLICY ALTERNATIVES 

This Bluebook presents three main policy alternatives—labeled A, B, and C—for 

the Committee’s consideration.  A variant of C, labeled as C´, is also presented.   

The characterization of current conditions and the economic outlook differs 

somewhat across the alternatives, and each alternative presents a different set of 

judgments about the appropriate path of policy.12  Table 1 provides an overview of  

the key elements of these alternatives.  Draft statements are provided in subsequent 

pages, followed by a summary of the case for each alternative. 

Alternative A notes that the deterioration in the labor market is abating but points 

to prospects for a subpar recovery in the absence of further monetary stimulus.  

Alternative B suggests that the labor market is stabilizing and states that the pace of 

recovery is likely to be moderate.  Alternative C indicates that the economy is 

expanding and that the labor market is beginning to stabilize and concludes that a 

sustainable recovery is now under way.   

Alternatives A and B each indicate that substantial resource slack continues to 

restrain cost pressures, that longer-term inflation expectations remain stable, and that 

as a consequence inflation is likely to be subdued for some time.  Alternative B could 

include an additional sentence—shown in brackets—stating the Committee’s 

expectation that “over time and with appropriate monetary policy, inflation will run  

at rates consistent with price stability.”  Alternative C points out the recent modest 

pickup in headline inflation due to energy prices, while noting that underlying 

inflation pressures remain muted; this alternative also states that the Committee  

“will adjust the stance of monetary policy as necessary over time to ensure that 

                                           
12 All three alternatives note that the TALF is scheduled to close on June 30 for loans backed 
by new-issue CMBS and on March 31 for loans backed by all other types of collateral. 

March 11, 2010 Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 30 of 68



longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored and that inflation outcomes 

are consistent with price stability.” 

All of the alternatives would maintain the target range of 0 to ¼ percent for the 

federal funds rate during the upcoming intermeeting period.  Alternatives A and B 

indicate—as in recent FOMC statements—that the Committee expects the funds rate 

to remain exceptionally low “for an extended period.”  Alternative C modifies that 

forward guidance by substituting the phrase “for some time” and could also include 

the modifier “at least through the end of the second quarter.”  This alternative also 

notes that monetary conditions will need to be tightened “at the appropriate time”  

to prevent a buildup of inflationary pressures.     

Each of the alternatives states that the Federal Reserve’s previously announced 

purchases of agency MBS and agency debt will be executed by the end of this month.  

Alternative A announces that an additional $150 billion of agency MBS will be 

purchased during the second quarter—roughly the same pace of purchases as in the 

first quarter—and indicates that the Committee will be continuing to evaluate its 

purchases of securities, thereby leaving the door open to further purchases should 

circumstances warrant.  Alternatives B and C do not make reference to the possibility 

of further purchases of securities but instead indicate that the Committee will employ 

its policy tools “as necessary to promote economic recovery and price stability.”     

Alternatives A and B do not refer to the Federal Reserve’s exit strategy, whereas 

Alternative C and Alternative C´ provide overviews of key elements of that strategy.  

Both versions of Alternative C put additional emphasis on the prospects for policy 

tightening by stating that the Committee will monitor the economic outlook and 

financial developments “in determining the timing and sequence of its measures  

for policy firming.”

January FOMC Statement 

Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in December suggests that 
economic activity has continued to strengthen and that the deterioration in the labor market is 
abating.  Household spending is expanding at a moderate rate but remains constrained by a weak 
labor market, modest income growth, lower housing wealth, and tight credit.  Business spending  
on equipment and software appears to be picking up, but investment in structures is still contracting 
and employers remain reluctant to add to payrolls.  Firms have brought inventory stocks into better 
alignment with sales.  While bank lending continues to contract, financial market conditions remain 
supportive of economic growth.  Although the pace of economic recovery is likely to be moderate  
for a time, the Committee anticipates a gradual return to higher levels of resource utilization in a 
context of price stability. 

With substantial resource slack continuing to restrain cost pressures and with longer-term inflation 
expectations stable, inflation is likely to be subdued for some time. 

The Committee will maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent  
and continues to anticipate that economic conditions, including low rates of resource utilization, 
subdued inflation trends, and stable inflation expectations, are likely to warrant exceptionally low 
levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period.  To provide support to mortgage lending 
and housing markets and to improve overall conditions in private credit markets, the Federal 
Reserve is in the process of purchasing $1.25 trillion of agency mortgage-backed securities and 
about $175 billion of agency debt.  In order to promote a smooth transition in markets, the 
Committee is gradually slowing the pace of these purchases, and it anticipates that these 
transactions will be executed by the end of the first quarter.  The Committee will continue to 
evaluate its purchases of securities in light of the evolving economic outlook and conditions in 
financial markets.     

In light of improved functioning of financial markets, the Federal Reserve will be closing the  
Asset-Backed Commercial Paper Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility, the Commercial 
Paper Funding Facility, the Primary Dealer Credit Facility, and the Term Securities Lending Facility 
on February 1, as previously announced.  In addition, the temporary liquidity swap arrangements 
between the Federal Reserve and other central banks will expire on February 1.  The Federal 
Reserve is in the process of winding down its Term Auction Facility:  $50 billion in 28-day credit 
will be offered on February 8 and $25 billion in 28-day credit will be offered at the final auction  
on March 8.  The anticipated expiration dates for the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility 
remain set at June 30 for loans backed by new-issue commercial mortgage-backed securities and 
March 31 for loans backed by all other types of collateral.  The Federal Reserve is prepared to 
modify these plans if necessary to support financial stability and economic growth.

March FOMC Statement—Alternative A 
 
1.   Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in January suggests that 

economic activity has continued to strengthen and that the deterioration in the labor market is 
abating.  Household spending is expanding at a moderate rate but remains constrained by high 
unemployment, modest income growth, lower housing wealth, and tight credit.  Business 
spending on equipment and software has risen significantly.  However, investment in 
nonresidential structures is still contracting, housing activity continues to be sluggish, and 
employers remain reluctant to add to payrolls.  In light of the weakness in labor markets and 
prospects for a subpar economic recovery, the Committee judges that further monetary 
stimulus is warranted. 

2.   With substantial resource slack continuing to restrain cost pressures and with longer-term 
inflation expectations stable, inflation is likely to be subdued for some time. 

3.   To provide further support to mortgage lending and housing markets and to promote a more 
robust economic recovery in a context of price stability, the Committee decided to 
extend its program for purchasing agency mortgage-backed securities.  The previously 
announced purchases of $1.25 trillion of those securities will be executed by the end of  
this month, and the Committee now anticipates that an additional $150 billion of such 
securities will be purchased during the second quarter.  The Federal Reserve has been 
purchasing about $175 billion of agency debt, and those transactions will be executed by the 
end of this month.  The Committee will continue to evaluate its purchases of securities in light 
of the evolving economic outlook and conditions in financial markets.  The Committee will 
maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent and continues to anticipate 
that economic conditions, including low rates of resource utilization, subdued inflation trends, 
and stable inflation expectations, are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal 
funds rate for an extended period. 

4.   In light of improved functioning of financial markets, the Federal Reserve has been closing 
the special liquidity facilities that it created to support markets during the crisis.  The 
only remaining such program, the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility, is scheduled 
to close on June 30 for loans backed by new-issue commercial mortgage-backed securities and 
on March 31 for loans backed by all other types of collateral.

Household spending is expanding at a moderate rate but remains constrained by high 
unemployment, modest income growth, lower housing wealth, and tight credit.  Business 
spending on equipment and software has risen significantly.  However, investment in 
nonresidential structures is declining, and housing starts have been flat at a depressed 
level.  While bank lending continues to contract, financial market conditions remain supportive

March FOMC Statement—Alternative C 
 
1.   Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in January indicates  

that economic activity has continued to advance and that the labor market is beginning to 
stabilize.  Consumer spending is expanding, business spending on equipment and software 
has risen appreciably, and firms have brought inventory stocks into better alignment with 
sales.  While bank lending continues to contract, financial market conditions remain supportive 
of economic growth.  With a sustainable economic recovery now under way, the Committee 
anticipates a gradual return to higher levels of resource utilization. 

2.   Higher energy prices have been reflected in a recent modest pickup in inflation, but 
underlying inflation pressures remain muted.  The Committee will adjust the stance of 
monetary policy as necessary over time to ensure that longer-term inflation expectations 
remain well anchored and that inflation outcomes are consistent with price stability. 

3.   The Committee will maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent and 
continues to anticipate that economic conditions, including low rates of resource utilization, 
subdued inflation trends, and stable inflation expectations, are likely to warrant exceptionally 
low levels of the federal funds rate for some time [, at least through the end of the second 
quarter].  The Federal Reserve has been purchasing $1.25 trillion of agency mortgage-backed 
securities and about $175 billion of agency debt; those purchases are nearing completion, 
and the remaining transactions will be executed by the end of this month. 

4.   Although the federal funds rate is likely to remain exceptionally low for some time,  
the Federal Reserve will need to begin to tighten monetary conditions at the appropriate 
time to prevent the development of inflationary pressures.  Over coming months,  
the Federal Reserve will continue to test its tools for draining reserves.  In due course, 
those operations will be scaled up to drain more significant volumes of reserve balances, 
and then the Federal Reserve will increase the interest rate paid on reserves and  
its target for the federal funds rate.  The Committee anticipates that any sales of the 
Federal Reserve’s securities holdings would be gradual and would not occur until  
after policy tightening is under way and the economic recovery is sufficiently advanced.   
The Committee will monitor the economic outlook and financial developments in 
determining the timing and sequence of its measures for policy firming and will  
employ its tools as necessary to promote economic recovery and price stability.

THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE B 

If policymakers expect the pace of economic recovery to be moderate and 

inflation to be subdued for some time, and if they judge that the potential benefits of 

further large-scale asset purchases would not outweigh the costs, then the Committee 

might choose to finish its securities purchases while reiterating that the federal funds 

rate is likely to remain exceptionally low for an extended period, as in Alternative B.   

Committee participants may see data releases and financial market developments 

over the intermeeting period as broadly consistent with the outlook embedded in their 

January projections; that is, like the staff, they may have made only modest revisions 

to their forecasts for economic activity and inflation.  Policymakers may view recent 

readings on nonfarm payrolls as providing tentative evidence of labor market 

stabilization and pointing toward a gradual decline in unemployment going forward.  

Nonetheless, they may continue to anticipate that elevated unemployment, tight credit 

conditions, and waning fiscal stimulus will weigh on aggregate demand over coming 

quarters.  Consistent with that outlook, both of the Greenbook-consistent measures 

of short-run r* indicate that extraordinarily accommodative monetary policy—that is, 

a real funds rate well below zero, and even more negative than at present—would be 

required to close the output gap by the end of 2012.      

Although policymakers may view the anticipated pace of economic recovery as 

unappealing, the Committee might conclude that expanding its agency MBS purchases 

would not materially improve that outlook and that further expansion of the Federal 

Reserve’s balance sheet could be associated with significant adverse consequences.   

In particular, the spread between conventional mortgage rates and comparable 

Treasury yields has remained quite narrow over recent weeks, even with the 

approaching completion of the previously announced purchases of agency MBS; 

consequently, members may see little benefit to extending those purchases beyond the 

March 11, 2010 Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 38 of 68



 

end of this month.  Moreover, they may be concerned that such an extension could 

undermine the confidence of some investors in the Federal Reserve’s exit strategy and 

hence result in higher premiums on inflation risk in nominal lending contracts.  

As in its recent statements, the Committee may continue to judge that “economic 

conditions, including low rates of resource utilization, subdued inflation trends, and 

stable inflation expectations, are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the 

federal funds rate for an extended period.”  Readings on core inflation over the past 

several months have been at annual rates below 1 percent, consistent with the view 

that substantial resource slack is continuing to reduce cost pressures, and the 

Reuters/Michigan survey of longer-term inflation expectations has edged downward 

and is now close to the lower end of its historical range.  In light of that incoming 

information, members may remain reasonably confident that overall inflation—which 

has picked up modestly as a result of higher energy prices—is likely to moderate 

significantly within the next few months and to be subdued for some time. 

Even if Committee participants are concerned about the possibility that inflation 

expectations could drift upward in response to highly accommodative monetary 

conditions, they may view risk management considerations as warranting a reiteration 

of the Committee’s forward guidance at this juncture.  Members might anticipate that 

the effective lower bound on the funds rate would bind severely if a move toward 

tighter policy proved premature and led to a substantial deterioration in the economic 

outlook, especially given the likely limits on the scope for further stimulus from  

fiscal policy or unconventional monetary policies.  Such considerations would be 

particularly compelling if members are reasonably confident about the Committee’s 

ability to advance the timing and pace of its policy firming in the event of a significant 

acceleration in the economic recovery or a sudden surge in inflation expectations. 

March 11, 2010 Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 39 of 68



 

The financial market reaction to a statement like that of Alternative B would likely 

be muted.  The Desk’s survey indicates that primary dealers are not anticipating any 

changes in the Committee’s forward policy guidance at this meeting and that they do 

not expect any further changes in the size or composition of the Federal Reserve’s 

LSAPs.  Moreover, market quotes on fed funds futures and options are broadly 

consistent with the Desk’s survey in indicating that investors expect the funds rate to 

remain within the current target range at least through the third quarter, and hence 

investors would probably not be surprised if the Committee’s announcement at this 

meeting expresses the same forward guidance as in recent statements.  Thus, the 

adoption of a statement along the lines of that proposed in Alternative B would likely 

result in little change in bond yields, equity prices, or the foreign exchange value of 

the dollar.     

THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE C 

If policymakers are confident that a sustainable economic recovery is now  

under way and see substantial upside risks to the medium-term inflation outlook in 

the absence of appropriate monetary policy adjustments, then the Committee might 

choose to issue a statement suggesting a somewhat shorter period over which 

monetary conditions are likely to remain extraordinarily accommodative, as in 

Alternative C.  In particular, if members anticipate that policy tightening is not likely 

to be necessary this spring but might well be appropriate over the summer, they could 

modify the forward guidance given in recent statements by indicating that 

exceptionally low levels of the funds rate are likely to be warranted “for some time,  

at least through the end of the second quarter.”13

                                           
13 Such language would be roughly similar to the Bank of Canada’s current forward guidance, 
which states that its policy rate is likely to remain at ¼ percent “until the end of the second 
quarter of 2010.”  The Bank of Canada introduced this forward guidance last April—at the 
point when the policy rate was reduced to its effective lower bound—in order to convey 

  Alternatively, if members would 

March 11, 2010 Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 40 of 68



 

prefer to avoid such specificity about the period over which its guidance applies,  

the wording could employ only the phrase “for some time.”     

In light of that outlook for the likely timing of policy firming, the Committee 

might also wish to convey the key elements of the Federal Reserve’s exit strategy, 

including the testing of new balance sheet tools over coming months and the 

anticipated sequence in which large-scale draining operations will be followed by 

increases in the interest rate on reserves and the target federal funds rate.  The draft 

statement for Alternative C does not announce any changes in the Federal Reserve’s 

management of its securities holdings and indicates an expectation that asset sales will 

be gradual and will not be initiated until after policy firming has begun.  In contrast, 

Alternative C´ states that the Federal Reserve will be redeeming all maturing Treasury 

securities and points to the possibility that gradual asset sales could commence fairly 

soon.   

To the extent that inflation outcomes are seen as linked mainly to expected 

inflation rather than to resource slack, Committee participants may view the level of 

forward inflation compensation (which is at the high end of its historical range) and 

the substantial degree of dispersion in professional forecasters’ longer-run inflation 

projections as worrisome indicators that inflation expectations may not be anchored 

very firmly.  Indeed, members may view prompt policy firming as needed to maintain 

the public’s confidence in the Federal Reserve’s commitment to foster price stability, 

thereby avoiding outcomes in which inflation expectations become unhinged, as in 

the Greenbook’s “Impaired Credibility” alternative scenario.     

                                                                                                                                        
the relatively long period over which the policy rate was expected to remain at that level.  
By contrast, the phrase “at least until the end of the second quarter” in Alternative C may 
be seen as indicating that the Committee’s expectation of exceptionally low rates extends 
only a few more months while at the same time suggesting that the Committee sees the 
likelihood of policy firming within that interval as quite low.   

March 11, 2010 Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 41 of 68



 

Participants may view the pace of economic recovery over coming quarters as 

mainly determined by the speed of structural adjustments and see a substantial risk 

that attempting to bolster the economic recovery by keeping the real funds rate below 

zero for an extended period would instead primarily result in higher expected and 

hence actual inflation.  Moreover, in light of the extraordinarily high level of excess 

reserves held by the banking system, some members may be concerned about the 

possibility that a brisk turnaround in lending and rapid growth in broad monetary 

aggregates could exert significant upward pressure on inflation or that a buildup of 

excessive financial market speculation might trigger another credit boom-bust cycle.  

Even if the probabilities of such outcomes are judged to be low, the adverse 

consequences might be seen as sufficiently severe to warrant a reduction in the size  

of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet over coming months. 

The adoption of a statement like that of Alternative C would surprise financial 

market participants.  In particular, a statement indicating that conditions would 

warrant an exceptionally low funds rate “for some time” and that presented the key 

elements of the Federal Reserve’s exit strategy would likely be read by market 

participants as signaling that the Committee plans to initiate policy firming at least a 

quarter or two earlier than currently anticipated by most investors.  Thus, short- and 

intermediate-term interest rates would shift up significantly and longer-term yields 

would likely rise as well.  Forward measures of inflation compensation might decline  

if investors became less concerned about risks to the longer-term inflation outlook.  

Equity prices would likely decline, and the foreign exchange value of the dollar 

increase.   

Longer-term yields would likely rise even further in response to a statement like 

that of Alternative C´.  The Desk’s survey indicates that primary dealers do not expect 

the Federal Reserve to engage in any substantial sales of its securities holdings before 

March 11, 2010 Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 42 of 68



 

the middle of 2012.  Consequently, term premiums on agency MBS and Treasury 

securities would likely shift upward as a result of heightened prospects that the 

Federal Reserve might actively reduce its holdings of securities over the next several 

quarters, and the levels of actual and implied volatility in these markets would also 

tend to move up.   

THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE A 

 If meeting participants are concerned about prospects for a subpar economic 

recovery and judge that additional monetary stimulus would help improve the outlook 

for economic activity and inflation, then they might wish to extend the Federal 

Reserve’s agency MBS purchase program and reiterate that the federal funds rate is 

likely to remain exceptionally low for an extended period, as in Alternative A.  This 

alternative would entail an additional $150 billion of agency MBS purchases during the 

second quarter, implying a purchase rate of around $10 billion per week—roughly 

equal to the average pace of purchases over the past several months.    

Policymakers may judge that further monetary stimulus is warranted if they, like 

the staff, see the unemployment rate remaining above 8 percent through the end of 

next year and inflation running persistently below the rates that they view as most 

consistent with the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate.  Policymakers might feel that the 

simulations of constrained and unconstrained optimal monetary policy depicted in 

Chart 7 of the Bluebook support the conclusion that increased stimulus is warranted.  

Moreover, recent staff work on developing a variety of tools for draining reserves in a 

timely manner may have strengthened participants’ confidence that the Committee’s 

purchase program can be augmented without undermining policymakers’ ability to 

withdraw monetary stimulus at the appropriate time.   

March 11, 2010 Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 43 of 68



 

Members might perceive an even stronger case for providing additional monetary 

stimulus if their assessment of the outlook is substantially weaker than that of the staff 

or if they judge the risks to economic activity and inflation to be tilted predominantly 

to the downside.  Incoming data on housing activity might be read as suggesting that 

the economic recovery will be more protracted than previously thought, and some 

participants may be concerned that the recovery of the labor market will be 

particularly slow, perhaps along the lines of the “Stronger Productivity and Weaker 

Consumption” alternative scenario in the Greenbook.  Moreover, recent low readings 

on core inflation may have underscored the downside risks to price stability.  Indeed, 

while the staff expects core inflation to remain fairly steady at a rate of about  

1 percent over coming quarters, participants may assign a higher probability to 

alternative scenarios—such as the Greenbook’s “Greater Disinflation” scenario—in 

which persistently large resource slack weighs more heavily on labor compensation 

and hence generates stronger downward pressure on prices. 

Policymakers may also judge that augmenting the Federal Reserve’s agency MBS 

purchases would be helpful in postponing prospective increases in mortgage rates that 

could impair the recuperation of housing markets and undermine the economic 

recovery.  With the approaching completion of the previously announced purchases, 

the staff expects the spread of conventional fixed-rate mortgage yields over long-term 

Treasury rates to widen by about a quarter percentage point over the next few 

months; however, some analysts have pointed to factors that could generate much 

sharper increases in spreads going forward.14

                                           
14 The Federal Reserves’ purchases of agency MBS have been associated with historically low 
levels of the option-adjusted spread (OAS), that is, the spread of agency MBS yields over 
those on comparable Treasuries adjusted for potential variations in prepayment speeds.  
While the staff anticipates that over coming months the OAS will rise gradually towards its 
historical mean, this spread might well widen much more sharply; for example, a 75 basis 
point increase would bring the OAS to the same level as in the wake of the 2001 recession.   

  Committee participants may view the 

March 11, 2010 Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 44 of 68



 

risk of such a jump in mortgage rates as particularly undesirable at the current 

juncture, given that housing activity remains sluggish, foreclosures are likely to pick up 

over coming months, and house prices have not yet stabilized. 

A statement like Alternative A would come as a surprise to financial market 

participants, who appear to anticipate that the Federal Reserve’s LSAP program will 

be completed on schedule at the end of this month.  The statement would likely cause 

a modest decline in longer-term yields as a direct consequence of the additional 

LSAPs; in particular, the staff estimates that a $150 billion increase in agency MBS 

purchases might reduce mortgage rates and other longer-term yields by about 5 to  

15 basis points.  Moreover, investors would be likely to lengthen the horizon over 

which they expected the federal funds rate to remain at exceptionally low levels, 

pushing down short- and intermediate-term yields.  However, any decline in longer-

term yields might be offset by an increase in inflation compensation if the 

Committee’s statement undermined investors’ confidence in a successful execution of 

the Federal Reserve’s exit strategy.  Equity prices would probably rise, while the 

foreign exchange value of the dollar would likely fall.

LONG-RUN PROJECTIONS OF THE BALANCE SHEET AND MONETARY BASE 

In this section, scenarios for the balance sheet are presented that correspond to 

the paths for large-scale asset purchases (LSAPs) of agency debt securities and agency 

MBS proposed in the alternatives discussed in the “Policy Alternatives” section of the 

Bluebook.  The baseline scenario corresponds to Alternative B in this Bluebook.  For 

the baseline, we assume that agency MBS purchases of $1.25 trillion and agency debt 

securities purchases of about $175 billion are executed by the end of March.  

Additionally, legacy Treasury securities, those securities in the SOMA portfolio prior 

to the start of the LSAP program, are rolled over as they mature.  We also present a 

projection for Alternative A, in which agency MBS purchases are increased by $150 

billion to a total of $1.4 trillion; this additional $150 billion in agency MBS purchases 

is executed over the second quarter of 2010.  Purchases of agency debt securities 

under this alternative remain at about $175 billion and are executed by the end of 

March.  We do not present balance sheet projections for Alternative C in this 

Bluebook, because the Committee is continuing to evaluate its strategy for asset sales 

and the use of other reserve draining tools.  The announced LSAP purchases in 

Alternative B and Alternative C are the same, so the baseline projections for assets 

and reserve balances can serve as a reference for Alternative C.  Each alternative 

assumes that assets decline gradually over time due to redemptions and prepayments 

of securities holdings. 

Projections for the scenarios are based on assumptions about each component of 

the balance sheet.15

                                           
15 The Greenbook projection assumes that the federal funds rate lifts off in 2012.  The 
baseline balance sheet projection assumes that the tools to drain reserve balances are not 
used, except on a very small scale to test the ability of the Open Market Desk to conduct 
tri-party reserve repurchase agreements with counterparties other than the primary dealers. 

  Details of these assumptions are described in Appendix C.  

March 11, 2010 Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 46 of 68



 

Substantive revisions to these assumptions, relative to the January Bluebook, are 

noted below.  

Under the baseline, total assets are lower over most of the projection period than 

in the January Bluebook.  A significant portion of the downward revision in the size 

of the balance sheet is the result of a decrease in the projected holdings of agency 

MBS.  In the near term, the downward revision to the path for agency MBS is a result 

of fewer MBS settling over the intermeeting period than expected; in the long term, 

the revision is driven by a pace of MBS prepayments that is somewhat higher than 

assumed in January.  The forecast for loans extended through the Term Asset-Backed 

Securities Lending Facility (TALF) has also been marked down, reflecting a higher 

assumed path for the prepayment of asset-backed securities pledged as collateral for 

TALF loans.16  The assumed timing of the sales of two AIG subsidiaries and the 

resulting disposition of preferred interests in AIA Aurora LLC and ALICO Holdings 

LLC has been adjusted.  The net effect of this timing difference is that support to 

AIG through 2012 is higher than in the last Bluebook.17  Alternative A projects a 

higher contour of total assets because of the assumed larger purchases of agency 

MBS. 

                                           
16 Over the intermeeting period, staff changed the methodology with which it estimates the 
prepayment of asset-backed securities pledged as collateral for TALF loans.    

17 Consistent with press releases over the intermeeting period referring to Prudential’s 
purchase of AIA and MetLife’s purchase of ALICO, the forecast assumes that these two 
transactions will take place in 2010 and will result in a pay down of the Federal Reserve’s 
support to AIG. 

March 11, 2010 Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 47 of 68

On the liability side of the balance sheet, the increase in the Treasury’s 

Supplementary Financing Account (SFA) has begun sooner than was anticipated at 

the time of the last Bluebook.  In response to the increase in the federal debt ceiling, 

Treasury announced a schedule of auctions for Supplementary Finance Program bills 



 

that results in the SFA reaching $200 billion by April 2010.  The forecast reflects this 

schedule and assumes that the SFA remains at $200 billion until the second quarter of 

2015 when it is reduced to keep the aggregate level of reserve balances from falling 

below $25 billion.  On net, the revisions in the asset and liability components of the 

balance sheet imply a moderate downward revision in the level of reserve balances 

over the majority of the projection period. 

Balance Sheet Projections Summary 

 Alternative A Baseline  

Agency Debt Securities   

   Total purchased About $175 billion About $175 billion 

   December 2016 $16 billion $16 billion 

Agency MBS   

   Total purchased $1.4 trillion $1.25 trillion 

   December 2016 $0.80 trillion $0.70 trillion 

Total Assets

   Peak month February 2010 February 2010 

   Peak amount $1.23 trillion $1.23 trillion 

For the baseline scenario, the balance sheet reaches a peak of a little over 

$2.3 trillion in June 2010.  The balance sheet continues to edge up after the March 31 

conclusion of large-scale asset purchases because of substantial lags in the settlement 

of MBS purchases.  In Alternative A, the size of the balance sheet peaks at a little over 

$2.4 trillion, with the peak occurring a few months after the additional MBS purchases

conclude in the second quarter of 2010.  By the end of 2016, the size of the balance 

sheet under both scenarios declines to roughly $1.5 trillion.18 

  

                                           
18 The composition of Federal Reserve assets in these projections differs notably from 
historical patterns.  Prior to August 2007, U.S. Treasury securities were about 90 percent of 
assets and the Federal Reserve did not hold any agency mortgage-backed securities.  By 
contrast, under the baseline scenario, Treasury securities are projected to account for only 
around 35 percent of total assets at the end of 2010 and rise to just 44 percent of total 
assets at the end of the projection period.  

March 11, 2010 Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 49 of 68

Reserve balances decline at the end of the first quarter of 2010, largely as a result 

of increases in the SFA and the Treasury’s General Account.  The contraction in the 

monetary base from the second quarter of 2010 through 2016 is a result of a decline 

in reserve balances owing to maturing large-scale asset purchases and the prepayment 

of agency MBS.  Since the monetary base is derived from the balance sheet 

projections of Federal Reserve notes in circulation and reserve balances, and because 

currency is projected to follow a fairly gradual trajectory, the path of the monetary 

base in each scenario largely mirrors the path of reserve balances.  Specifically, in each 

scenario, the monetary base peaks at essentially the same time as reserve balances, and 

as reserve balances decline, the monetary base contracts.  Toward the end of the 

projection period, when reserve balances are assumed to stabilize at $25 billion, the 

level of the monetary base moves more in line with changes in Federal Reserve notes 

in circulation.

DEBT, BANK CREDIT, AND MONEY FORECASTS 

The staff projects that domestic nonfinancial sector debt will expand at an annual 

rate of about 4¾ percent in the first quarter of 2010, reflecting a large increase in 

government debt and essentially no change in private-sector debt.  This pattern is 

expected to extend over 2010 and 2011, as total domestic nonfinancial debt is 

projected to increase at an average annual rate of 5½ percent, with rapid growth in 

federal government debt, a moderate expansion in state and local government debt, 

and sluggish increases in household and business sector debt.  After contracting last 

year, household debt is projected to be about flat this quarter and to expand slowly 

over subsequent quarters.  Staff expects debt of the nonfinancial business sector to 

tick down in the current quarter, as robust bond issuance is more than offset by a 

further contraction in bank loans and other forms of debt.  We project only a modest 

rise in nonfinancial business debt over the forecast period, reflecting relatively small 

external financing needs and tight credit terms and standards in the banking sector. 

Commercial bank credit is expected to contract at an annual rate of about 7¼ 

percent in the first quarter of 2010, and to decline by roughly 1 percent for 2010 as a 

whole.  Persistent declines in loans over the next couple of quarters are expected to be 

only partially offset by increases in securities holdings.  Real estate loans are expected 

to contract until late this year due to weak fundamentals and tighter lending standards 

for commercial real estate, as well as continued strains in residential housing markets.  

C&I loans are also projected to contract into the second half of 2010, amid 

nonfinancial firms’ subdued demand for bank loans and banks’ tight credit policies, 

while consumer loans continue to run off until mid-year.  Total bank loans are 

expected to resume growth by the fourth quarter, and bank credit is projected to grow 

around 4¼ percent in 2011. 

March 11, 2010 Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 52 of 68



 

M2 is expected to be about flat in the current quarter, as a reallocation of 

household wealth toward higher-yielding non-M2 assets continues to damp money 

demand.  As that process wanes, we expect M2 to increase at a pace closer to that of 

nominal GDP, given that the opportunity cost of holding money is not projected to 

change appreciably over the forecast horizon.  Small time deposits and retail money 

market mutual funds are expected to continue declining through 2011, however, the 

contraction slows through time.  A portion of the outflow from these two 

components is reallocated within M2, boosting liquid deposits, which expand 

somewhat rapidly through 2011 but nevertheless slow from the pace recorded in 

2009.  Currency is also predicted to slow from its 2009 pace as precautionary holdings 

continue to unwind.

DIRECTIVE 

The directive from the January meeting and draft language for the March directive 

are provided below.   

JANUARY FOMC MEETING 

The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that 

will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output.  To further its 

long-run objectives, the Committee seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent 

with federal funds trading in a range from 0 to ¼ percent.  The Committee directs  

the Desk to purchase agency debt and agency MBS during the intermeeting period 

with the aim of providing support to private credit markets and economic activity.  

The timing and pace of these purchases should depend on conditions in the markets 

for such securities and on a broader assessment of private credit market conditions.  

The Desk is expected to execute purchases of about $175 billion in housing-related 

agency debt and about $1.25 trillion of agency MBS by the end of the first quarter.  

The Desk is expected to gradually slow the pace of these purchases as they near 

completion.  The Committee anticipates that outright purchases of securities will 

cause the size of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet to expand significantly in  

coming months.  The Committee directs the Desk to engage in dollar roll transactions 

as necessary to facilitate settlement of the Federal Reserve’s agency MBS transactions 

to be conducted through the end of the first quarter, as directed above.  The System 

Open Market Account Manager and the Secretary will keep the Committee informed 

of ongoing developments regarding the System's balance sheet that could affect the 

attainment over time of the Committee's objectives of maximum employment and 

price stability.

MBS and of about $175 billion in housing-related agency debt by the end of March.   

The Committee directs the Desk to engage in dollar roll transactions as necessary  

to facilitate settlement of the Federal Reserve’s agency MBS transactions.  The 

Committee directs the Desk to reduce the System's securities holdings by not 

reinvesting the proceeds of maturing securities or of prepayments from agency MBS.  

The System Open Market Account Manager and the Secretary will keep the 

Committee informed of ongoing developments regarding the System's balance sheet 

that could affect the attainment over time of the Committee's objectives of maximum 

employment and price stability.

APPENDIX A:  MEASURES OF THE EQUILIBRIUM REAL RATE 

The equilibrium real rate is the real federal funds rate that, if maintained, would be projected to 
return output to its potential level over time.  The short-run equilibrium rate is defined as the rate 
that would close the output gap in twelve quarters given the corresponding model’s projection of 
the economy.  The medium-run concept is the value of the real federal funds rate projected to keep 
output at potential in seven years, under the assumption that monetary policy acts to bring actual 
and potential output into line in the short run and then keeps them equal thereafter.  The TIPS-
based factor model measure provides an estimate of market expectations for the real federal funds 
rate seven years ahead.  

The actual real federal funds rate is constructed as the difference between the nominal rate and 
realized inflation, where the nominal rate is measured as the quarterly average of the observed 
federal funds rate, and realized inflation is given by the log difference between the core PCE price 
index and its lagged value four quarters earlier.  If the upcoming FOMC meeting falls early in the 
quarter, the lagged inflation measure ends in the last quarter.  For the current quarter, the nominal 
rate is specified as the target federal funds rate on the Bluebook publication date.   

Measure Description 

Single-
equation 

Model 

The measure of the equilibrium real rate in the single-equation model is based on an 
estimated aggregate-demand relationship between the current value of the output gap and its 
lagged values as well as the lagged values of the real federal funds rate. 

Small 
Structural 

Model 

The small-scale model of the economy consists of equations for six variables: the output 
gap, the equity premium, the federal budget surplus, the trend growth rate of output, the real 
bond yield, and the real federal funds rate. 

EDO 
Model 

Estimates of the equilibrium real rate using EDO—an estimated dynamic-stochastic-
general-equilibrium (DSGE) model of the U.S. economy—depend on data for major 
spending categories, price and wages, and the federal funds rate as well as the model’s 
structure and estimate of the output gap. 

FRB/US 
Model 

Estimates of the equilibrium real rate using FRB/US—the staff’s large-scale econometric 
model of the U.S. economy—depend on a very broad array of economic factors, some of 
which take the form of projected values of the model’s exogenous variables. 

Greenbook-
consistent 

Two measures are presented—based on the FRB/US and the EDO models.  Both models 
are matched to the extended Greenbook forecast.  Model simulations determine the value of 
the real federal funds rate that closes the output gap conditional on the extended baseline. 

TIPS-based 
Factor 
Model 

Yields on TIPS (Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities) reflect investors’ expectations of 
the future path of real interest rates.  The TIPS-based measure of the equilibrium real rate is 
constructed using the seven-year-ahead instantaneous real forward rate derived from TIPS 
yields as of the Bluebook publication date.  This forward rate is adjusted to remove 
estimates of the term and liquidity premiums based on a three-factor arbitrage-free term-
structure model applied to TIPS yields, nominal yields, and inflation.

Estimates of the real federal funds rate depend on the proxies for expected inflation used.  The table 
below shows estimated real federal funds rates based on lagged core PCE inflation, the definition 
used in the Equilibrium Real Federal Funds Rate chart; lagged four-quarter headline PCE inflation; 
and projected four-quarter headline PCE inflation beginning with the next quarter.  For each 
estimate of the real rate, the table also provides the Greenbook-consistent FRB/US-based measure 
of the short-run equilibrium real rate and the average actual real federal funds rate over the next 
twelve quarters.

APPENDIX B:  ANALYSIS OF POLICY PATHS AND CONFIDENCE INTERVALS 

RULE SPECIFICATIONS   
For the following rules, it denotes the federal funds rate for quarter t, while the explanatory variables 
include the staff’s projection of trailing four-quarter core PCE inflation (πt), inflation two and three 
quarters ahead (πt+2|t and πt+3|t), the output gap in the current period and one quarter ahead ( y y *t t−  
and y y− *t t+ +1| t t1| ), and the three-quarter-ahead forecast of annual average GDP growth relative to 
potential (∆4 4y y− ∆ * π *t t+ +3| t t3| ), and  denotes an assumed value of policymakers’ long-run inflation 
objective.  The outcome-based and forecast-based rules were estimated using real-time data over the 
sample 1988:1-2006:4; each specification was chosen using the Bayesian information criterion. Each 
rule incorporates a 75 basis point shift in the intercept, specified as a sequence of 25 basis point 
increments during the first three quarters of 1998.  The first two simple rules were proposed by 
Taylor (1993, 1999).  The prescriptions of the first-difference rule do not depend on assumptions 
regarding r* or the level of the output gap; see Orphanides (2003). 

Outcome-based rule it =  1.20it-1–0.39it-2+0.19[1.17  + 1.73 πt  + 3.66( *t ty y− )  – 2.72( *1 1t ty y− −− )] 

Forecast-based rule it =  1.18it-1–0.38it-2+0.20[0.98 +1.72 πt+2|t+2.29( *1| 1|t t t ty y+ +− )–1.37( *1 1t ty y− −− )] 

Taylor (1993) rule it = 2 + πt + 0.5(πt – *π ) + 0.5( *t ty y− ) 

Taylor (1999) rule it = 2 + πt + 0.5(πt – *π ) + ( *t ty y− ) 

First-difference rule it = it-1 + 0.5(πt+3|t – *π ) + 0.5( 4 4 *3| 3|t t t ty y+ +∆ − ∆ ) 

FRB/US MODEL SIMULATIONS   
Prescriptions from the two empirical rules are computed using dynamic simulations of the FRB/US 
model, implemented as though the rule were followed starting at this FOMC meeting.  The dotted 
line labeled “Previous Bluebook” is based on the current specification of the policy rule, applied to 
the previous Greenbook projection.  Confidence intervals are based on stochastic simulations of the 
FRB/US model with shocks drawn from the estimated residuals over 1969-2008.  

INFORMATION FROM FINANCIAL MARKETS   
The expected funds rate path is based on Eurodollar quotes and implied three-month forward rates 
from swaps, and the confidence intervals for this path are constructed using prices of interest rate 
caps.  

NEAR-TERM PRESCRIPTIONS OF SIMPLE POLICY RULES   
These prescriptions are calculated using Greenbook projections for inflation and the output gap. 
Because the first-difference rule involves the lagged funds rate, the value labeled “Previous 
Bluebook” for the current quarter is computed using the actual value of the lagged funds rate, and 
the one-quarter-ahead prescriptions are based on this rule’s prescription for the current quarter.

APPENDIX C:  LONG-RUN PROJECTIONS OF THE BALANCE SHEET AND 
MONETARY BASE  

This appendix presents the assumptions underlying the projections provided in the section entitled 
“Long-Run Projections of the Balance Sheet and Monetary Base.” 

GENERAL ASSUMPTIONS 
The balance sheet projections are constructed on a monthly frequency from March 2010 to 
December 2016.  The few balance sheet items that are not discussed below are assumed to be 
constant over the projection period at the level observed on February 26, 2010.  The projections for 
all major asset and liability categories are summarized in the charts and table that follow the bullet 
points.   

The Greenbook projection assumes that the federal funds rate increases in 2012.  The balance sheet 
projections assume that no draining of reserve balances is performed over the forecast horizon.   

ASSETS 

Asset Purchases 
• The baseline scenario, corresponding to Alternative B, incorporates large-scale asset 

purchases (LSAP) roughly in line with those that have been announced.   
o The Committee purchases about $175 billion in agency debt securities and $1.25 

trillion in agency MBS; both types of purchases are to be executed by the end of the 
first quarter of 2010. 
 Agency debt securities and agency MBS are held to maturity and are not 

replaced.  Prepayments of MBS are not reinvested. 
 Holdings of agency debt securities peak at $169 billion in March 2010, and 

decline slowly over the remainder of the forecast horizon as they mature.  
The peak is slightly below the announced purchase amount, reflecting 
maturing agency debt securities already in the SOMA portfolio.    

 Due to expected settlement lags and prepayments, agency MBS holdings 
peak at $1.1 trillion in June 2010, a somewhat lower level than the amount 
purchased.19  For agency MBS, the rate of prepayment is based on estimates 
from one of the program’s investment managers.  The historically low 
coupon on these securities implies a relatively slow prepayment rate.  As a 
result, at the end of 2016, $697 billion of the $1.25 trillion of MBS purchased 
remain on the balance sheet. 

                                           
19 Prepayments include regular payments of principal and repayments of mortgages. 

March 11, 2010 Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 63 of 68

o The Committee’s purchases of $300 billion in U.S. Treasury securities related to the 
LSAP program were completed in October 2009. 



 

 The maturity distribution of the Treasury securities purchased as a part of the 
LSAP program is based on data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New 
York’s Markets Group.  The current weighted average maturity is about six 
years.  The first maturity of an LSAP Treasury security will occur in April of 
this year. 

 No Treasury securities purchased as a part of the LSAP program are sold, 
and maturing securities are not rolled over.  As a result, total holdings of 
Treasury securities decline as issues mature.  Treasury securities held in the 
SOMA portfolio prior to the initiation of the LSAP program are assumed to 
be reinvested as they mature.   

• In the scenario corresponding to Alternative A, the Committee increases its purchases of 
agency MBS by $150 billion to a total of $1.4 trillion and extends the timeframe for these 
purchases to the end of the second quarter of 2010.  The Committee completes its purchase 
of about $175 billion in agency debt securities by the end of the first quarter of 2010. 

• Projections for Alternative C are not presented in this Bluebook, because the Committee has 
not yet specified a detailed strategy for asset sales or the use of other reserve draining tools.  
The announced LSAP purchases in Alternative B and Alternative C are the same, so the 
baseline projections for assets and reserves can serve as a reference for Alternative C.  

• A minimum level of $25 billion is set for reserve balances.  To ensure that reserve balances 
do not fall below this minimum level, first the U.S. Treasury’s Supplementary Financing 
Account (SFA) is reduced.  If this does not generate enough reserve balances, then Treasury 
securities are purchased.  By the end of the projection period in both alternatives, the 
expansion of Federal Reserve notes in circulation and capital, combined with a runoff of 
assets, necessitates not only the reduction of the U.S. Treasury’s SFA to zero, but also the 
resumption of Treasury securities purchases to maintain reserve balances at a level of $25 
billion. 

Liquidity Programs and Credit Facilities 
• Primary credit declines gradually from its current level to $1 billion by the end of 2011 and 

remains at that level thereafter.  Secondary credit is assumed to be zero over the forecast 
period. 

• Credit extended through the Term Auction Facility (TAF) falls to zero by April 2010 and 
remains at zero thereafter.   

• Loans through the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF) peaked at $48 billion 
in December 2009.  Credit extended through this facility is assumed to reach zero in the first 
quarter of 2015, reflecting loan maturities and prepayments. 

o TALF loans are extended with either a three-year or a five-year term. 
 Until loans with a three-year term begin to mature in 2012, the decline in 

TALF is attributable to prepayments.   
 In 2012, TALF loans outstanding begin to decline more rapidly, reflecting 

both prepayments and the maturing of three-year loans.   

March 11, 2010 Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 64 of 68



 

 After all three-year loans have matured in 2013, TALF declines at a less rapid 
pace as five-year loans—the amount of which is smaller than three-year 
loans—prepay  and mature. 

o TALF three- and five-year loans backed by asset-backed securities other than 
commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) plateau at around $37 billion from 
March 2010 to January 2011.  A portion of these loans are expected to prepay, and 
the quantity outstanding reaches zero by the end of the second quarter of 2014. 

o TALF three- and five-year loans backed by CMBS peaked at $11 billion in February 
2010.  A portion of these loans are expected to prepay, and the quantity outstanding 
reaches zero by the end of the first quarter of 2015. 

• The assets held by TALF LLC increase to $1 billion by June 2012 and remain at that level 
through the second quarter of 2015, before dropping down to zero in the third quarter of 
2015.  Assets held by TALF LLC comprise investments purchased with commitment fees 
collected by the LLC, and from the U.S. Treasury’s initial funding.  In this projection, the 
LLC does not purchase any ABS received by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in 
connection with a decision of a borrower not to repay a TALF loan.  

• The Commercial Paper Funding Facility (CPFF) and central bank liquidity swap lines 
expired on February 1, 2010.  Central bank liquidity swaps are now zero.  CPFF LLC retains 
its current holdings of commercial paper until maturity, after which the LLC is dissolved.  
The net portfolio holdings of the CPFF LLC decline to zero in the first half of 2010. 

• No credit through either the Asset-Backed Commercial Paper Money Market Mutual Fund 
Liquidity Facility (AMLF) or the Primary Dealer Credit Facility (PDCF) was outstanding 
when the facilities expired on February 1, 2010. 

• Credit extended to AIG, the sum of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s extension of 
revolving credit and its preferred interests in AIA Aurora LLC and ALICO Holdings LLC, 
drops to $41 billion by December 2010 and then declines to zero by the end of 2013. 

• The assets held by Maiden Lane LLC, Maiden Lane II LLC, and Maiden Lane III LLC are 
sold over time and reach either zero or a nominal level by the end of 2016.   

Other Assets 
• The Special Drawing Rights (SDR) certificate account increases by $2 billion, to $7 billion, 

by the third quarter of 2011, as a result of an assumed monetization of the recent allocation 
of SDRs. 

LIABILITIES AND CAPITAL 
• All liability and capital assumptions in the baseline scenario are the same across scenarios 

except where noted below. 
• Federal Reserve notes in circulation grow in line with the staff forecast for money stock 

currency through the end of 2011.  From 2011 to the end of the projection period, Federal 
Reserve notes in circulation grow at the same rate as nominal GDP, as projected in the 
extended Greenbook forecast. 

March 11, 2010 Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 65 of 68



 

• Reverse repurchase agreements remain roughly at the current level of reverse repurchase 
agreements with foreign official and international accounts, with some minor fluctuations in 
the near-term that reflect testing by the Open Market Desk of triparty reverse repurchase 
agreements with counterparties other than primary dealers.  

• The U.S. Treasury’s general account (TGA) follows the staff forecast for end-of-month U.S. 
Treasury operating cash balances through September 2010.20  Thereafter, the TGA drops 
back to its historical target level of $5 billion by the end of this year as it is assumed that the 
Treasury will have implemented a new cash management system that allows it to invest 
funds in excess of $5 billion.  The TGA remains constant at $5 billion over the remainder of 
the forecast period. 

• In response to the increase in the federal debt ceiling, Treasury announced a schedule of 
auctions for Supplementary Finance Program bills that results in the SFA reaching $200 
billion by April 2010.  The balances in the SFA remain at this level in each of the scenarios 
until the SFA is reduced to ensure reserve balance levels do not fall below $25 billion.  The 
timing of when the SFA is reduced to maintain reserve balance levels of $25 billion varies 
across the scenarios. 

• Federal Reserve capital grows 15 percent per year, in line with the average rate of the past 
ten years. 

• In general, the level of assets of the Federal Reserve drives the level of reserve balances.  
Increases in the levels of other liability items, such as Federal Reserve notes in circulation 
and the SFA, along with increases in the level of Reserve Bank capital, drain reserve 
balances.  Reserve balances peaked in February 2010.  Though reserve balances fall more 
rapidly in the baseline scenario than in Alternative A, reserve balances fall back to $25 billion 
by the end of the forecast horizon in both scenarios. 

 

 

 

 

 

                                           
20 The staff forecast for end-of-month U.S. Treasury operating cash balances includes forecasts of both the TGA and 

balances associated with the U.S. Treasury’s Tax and Loan program.  Because balances associated with the Tax and 
Loan program are $2 billion, for the time being, this forecast is a good proxy for the level of TGA balances.
