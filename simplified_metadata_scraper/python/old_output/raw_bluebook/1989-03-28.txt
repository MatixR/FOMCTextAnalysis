Prefatory Note 

 
 

The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain. 
 

Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a redaction process that removed information obtained on a

1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked

MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

CLASS I - FOMC

MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Recent developments

(1) Monetary policy was tightened in two steps over the intermeet-

ing period. On February 14, in view of mounting evidence of inflationary

pressures, the borrowing assumption was raised to $700 million from the

$600 million level that had been continued after the February FOMC meet-

ing. Federal funds were expected to trade around 9-1/4 to 9-3/8 percent,

up from 9 to 9-1/8 percent at the time of the meeting. Although federal

funds did trade mostly in this higher range, borrowing averaged only $366

million in the maintenance period ending February 22. In association with

the increase in the discount rate to 7 percent on February 24, federal

funds moved up to average a little above 9-3/4 percent. Borrowing con-

tinued to fall short of the $700 million allowance, coming in at just $550

million for the maintenance period ending March 8. In light of these

indications of additional weakening in borrowing demands, the borrowing

assumption was reduced to $500 million in the maintenance period beginning

March 9 as a technical adjustment to make it more consistent with expected

conditions in reserve markets. In that maintenance period, which ended

March 22, adjustment plus seasonal borrowing was $422 million and the

federal funds rate averaged 9.85 percent.

(2) The tightening of policy, together with renewed concerns about

inflation and associated future policy moves, propelled other interest

rates higher across the maturity spectrum over the intermeeting period.

Increases in private short-term rates have totaled nearly 1 percentage



point, including two half-point increases in the prime rate, somewhat more

than the almost 3/4 percentage point rise in the funds rate. The addi-

tional increase in these rates followed release of the second large jump

in producer prices, which was seen as raising the odds of a further near-

term firming of policy. It may also have reflected greater supplies of

short-term paper, especially bank CDs to fund stronger bank credit and

sponsored agency obligations to meet demands for FHLB advances as thrift

deposits ran off. By contrast, Treasury bill supplies have been flat, and

with substantial retail demand for these instruments through noncompeti-

tive tenders, bill rates rose only about half a percentage point.

(3) Long-term rates rose immediately following the FOMC meeting,

when an unchanged Federal Reserve policy stance in the face of strong

economic data apparently led to renewed concerns about the possible inten-

sification of inflation, especially since the dollar weakened as well.

Further increases in long-term rates were registered as incoming price

data--both broad indexes and prices of oil and other commodities--were

interpreted as signalling an actual pickup in inflation and a need for

further policy firming. On balance, yields on Treasury bonds are 40 to 50

basis points higher over the intermeeting period. Actual and anticipated

sales of mortgages and mortgage-backed securities by thrifts may have

contributed to larger increases in yields on these instruments in both

primary and secondary markets. In the primary market, rates on fixed-rate

mortgages rose nearly 70 basis points to 11.22 percent over the intermeet-

ing period, while the spread between secondary market mortgage securities

and Treasuries widened around 15 to 35 basis points.



(4) The dollar's weighted-average foreign exchange value rose

marginally on balance over the intermeeting period. The dollar weakened

early in the period, given the restrained response of the Federal Reserve

to incoming economic and price data and in view of expected further

monetary tightening by foreign central banks, especially the Bundesbank.

Market perceptions reversed and the dollar strengthened substantially,

however, shortly after the Federal Reserve's discount rate increase and

amid clear signals from the Bundesbank and other central banks that they

would not raise rates in the near term. As the dollar moved back toward

its earlier peak against the Deutschmark, the Desk sold

$650 million for marks.

(5) After considerable weakness in January, growth of M2 and M3

strengthened in February and is estimated to have picked up further in

March. Still, expansion of the aggregates so far this year has remained

subdued, reflecting high opportunity costs and probably also the problems

of the thrift industry. M2 growth of 1-1/2 percent since December is

slightly slower than the 2 percent specification of the Committee, which,

however, did not embody the policy tightening that occurred. Growth of M3

for the December-to-March period at a 3-3/4 percent rate is in line with

the Committee's expectations for this interval. The levels of M2 and M3



in March are estimated to be a little below and a little above the lower

bounds of their respective annual growth cones.

(6) Within M2, liquid deposits have remained quite weak--M1 was

about unchanged over February and March--and small time deposits rela-

tively strong. Offering rates on retail time deposits have moved up sub-

stantially, but remain unusually low relative to Treasury yields, espe-

cially at thrifts. Deposits at thrift institutions with FSLIC insurance

have continued to decline, though outflows in late February and early

March may have abated from earlier in the quarter. While most of these

funds seem to have remained within M2, the thrift situation still appears

to have depressed growth of this aggregate in the first quarter. Some

apprehensive depositors seem to have opted for market instruments, and

regulatory pressures on deposit rates at thrifts have held down offering

rates more generally and widened the opportunity cost of holding M2

assets. Thrift behavior may also have affected M3. S&Ls have substituted

non-M3 sources--FHLB advances--for deposits and probably have restrained

credit expansion; S&L assets declined in January, the latest month for

which data are available. On the other hand, the expansion of M3 over the

past two months has been supported by the strong reliance of commercial

banks on managed liabilities, particularly large time deposits, to fund

increased lending. Bank credit growth was spurred in February by

borrowing used to retire shares in RJR Nabisco.

(7) Even abstracting from the RJR Nabisco deal, business borrowing

has shown renewed vigor in February and March. Concerns about event risk

and the higher level of interest rates have pushed these demands into

shorter-term areas: both bank lending and commercial paper issuance net

of merger effects picked up in February, and at least for commercial

paper, this strength has continued into March. In addition, recent weeks

have seen a flurry of new investment-grade industrial bonds concentrated

in short maturities, often of one year. Mortgage lending has strengthened

somewhat from late 1988, and consumer borrowing has held steady. With

government borrowing also picking up in February, overall domestic non-

financial debt accelerated that month, lifting this aggregate to the mid-

point of its range.



Policy alternatives

(8) Three alternatives are presented below for Committee consider-

ation. Alternative B maintains the current degree of reserve market pres-

sure, with federal funds trading around 9-3/4 percent or slightly higher

in association with adjustment plus seasonal borrowing of $500 million.

Alternative A entails federal funds around 9-1/4 percent and borrowing of

$300 million, and alternative C involves funds around 10-1/4 percent and

borrowing of $700 million. These relationships assume that the heightened

reluctance of banks to tap the discount window of recent weeks will per-

sist over the intermeeting period. Uncertainties about the relationship

between borrowing and the spread of the funds rate over the discount rate

suggest a continued flexible approach to the borrowing objective in open

market operations. Even with this approach, funds could temporarily trade

above expected levels in coming days should significant quarter-end

pressures emerge and again in the latter half of April should individual

income tax payments prove to be larger than anticipated, leading to a

sharper advance in required reserves and a larger drain in bank reserves.

(9) Projections of growth in the monetary aggregates for March to

June are presented below for the three alternatives, together with implied

growth from the fourth-quarter base to June. (Detailed data are pre-

sented on the table and charts on the following pages.) Under all three

alternatives, monetary growth would remain subdued, largely reflecting

1. The funds rate range suggested for alternatives B and C is a per-
centage point above the 7 to 11 percent range now in the directive,
better centering the range on current (alternative B) or somewhat higher
(alternative C) expected funds rates.



recent increases in market interest rates and slow adjustment of offering

rates on liquid accounts. In addition, the thrift situation is expected

to depress growth of the broader aggregates in the second quarter, though

to a lesser extent than in the first quarter. The reduced impact should

result from a tendency for the most concerned depositors to flee first,

and assumes no new information that would exacerbate depositors' fears,

such as a Congressional stalemate on the proposed legislation. It also

assumes no greater regulatory pressure on thrift deposit offering rates;

changes in the average own rate on M2 components are likely to respond in

more typical ways to changes in market rates, although the level of oppor-

tunity costs should remain unusually wide. M2 growth rates under the

alternatives are a bit lower than would be suggested by various models of

money demand given the staff GNP forecast. At the M3 level, further sub-

stitutions of FHLB advances for deposits and restraint on asset growth at

thrifts are expected to have a continuing but diminishing effect on

growth.2

2. Tax payments are not expected to have much impact on the pattern of
monetary growth over the March-to-June period, in contrast to the last
two years. There are no extraordinary influences on tax payments this
year and current seasonal adjustment factors capture expected tax- and
refund-related deposit swings.

However, M2 and M3 growth is expected to be depressed slightly in
May by a transfer of the government securities trading operation of a
major bank dealer, with associated RP financing, to a nonbank affiliate.
RP liabilities of nonbank dealers are not included in the definition of
the money aggregates.

(10) The existing structure of interest rates appears to incor-

porate some expectation that monetary policy may be a little firmer in the

near term than is assumed under alternative B. As a consequence, with

federal funds continuing around 9-3/4 percent or even a little above under

alternative B, money market rates might tend to decline a bit. Three-

month Treasury bills at the current level of 9 percent would seem appro-

priately priced in relation to the prevailing federal funds rate under

usual supply and demand conditions; but if strong retail demands continue,

these rates also might edge lower, especially once the early-April cash

management bill is absorbed. The dollar might come under some downward

pressure as short-term rates softened and the prospects for further near-

term monetary tightening in the United States were reassessed. Given

recent mixed signals about the strength of the expansion, bond markets are

likely to be especially sensitive to incoming information about devel-

opments in the economy. Should the incoming data point more clearly to

continued strength in the economy and prices, consistent with the

greenbook forecast, bond yields would be unlikely to fall with an

unchanged System policy stance and could even move higher.

(11) Growth in M2 under alternative B, at 3 percent from March to

June, would be stronger on average than over the first three months of

this year. As discussed above, deposit weakness at thrifts is expected to

continue, but to abate. In addition, with short-term market rates moving

a bit below current levels and rates on deposits edging higher in response

to previous increases in market rates, opportunity costs would be narrow-

ing, rather than rising as in recent months. Even so, the lagged effects

of earlier substantial increases in opportunity costs would continue to

restrain M2 growth and result in a 4-1/2 percent increase in its velocity

in the second quarter, somewhat faster than in the second half of 1988.

M1 would continue about flat over the March-to-June period as outflows of

transactions deposits about match growth in currency; consequently, its

velocity would increase at around the projected 7-3/4 percent increase in

nominal GNP.

(12)- M3 is projected to grow at a 5 percent annual rate over the

March-to-June period under alternative B, somewhat faster than from

December to March. Commercial banks are expected to continue issuing

substantial amounts of large CDs to fund still strong merger-related loan

demands. At thrifts, even if asset growth doesn't pick up, M3 could still

be boosted relative to earlier this year as less weakness in retail



-12-

deposits is reflected in reduced reliance on FHLB advances. Contributing

to the pickup in M3 growth would be a resumption of inflows to institu-

tion-only money funds as their returns catch up to market rates. On a

quarterly average basis, M3 would grow at a 5 percent rate, implying an

increase of 2-1/2 percent in its velocity.

(13) In credit markets, the smaller role of thrifts in acquiring

and perhaps even originating mortgage loans is not expected to have a

material impact on overall mortgage debt growth, which is projected to

taper off only a little in the second quarter in response to the recent

climb in mortgage rates. Business borrowing should diminish as corporate

restructuring activity and associated borrowing to finance share retire-

ments fall off somewhat from the record first-quarter pace. Reflecting

elevated bond rates and investor concern about event risk, firms are

likely to continue to focus their credit demands on bank loans and

shorter-term paper. Aggregate growth in the debt of nonfinancial sectors

is projected at an 8 percent annual rate over the second quarter, bringing

expansion through June to around the middle of its 6-1/2 to 10-1/2 percent

annual monitoring range.

(14) The extent of immediate policy tightening embodied in alter-

native C is more than currently seems to be built into market interest

rates. In response to the federal funds rate moving into the 10-1/4 per-

cent area, other short-term market rates would be expected to rise some-

what less; the prime rate would be hiked again, probably by 1/2 percentage

point. The dollar would be expected to firm. Bond rates are likely to

increase under this alternative, but the extent of any rise might be



-13-

limited, and over time yields could drop back, if market participants saw

the tightening action as reducing the risks of greater inflation and

raising the odds on an appreciable moderation in economic growth. With

the further rise in market rates, M2 would expand at a 2 percent annual

rate over the March-to-June period under alternative C, only a bit faster

than the December-to-March pace. Growth at this rate would place this

aggregate noticeably below its 3 to 7 percent growth cone by June. Higher

market rates along with the lagged adjustment of offering rates on M3

type-money market mutual funds would weaken inflows to such funds. M3

expansion, at 4-1/2 percent over the March-to-June period, while picking

up some from the sluggish rate of recent months, would remain in the lower

portion of its long-run range.

(15) With the lower money market rates of alternative A, M2 growth

would strengthen to a 4 percent pace, lifting it above the lower bound of

its growth cone by June. M3 would move more into the middle portion of

its range. The decline in other short-term market rates might be less

than the one-half point drop in the federal funds rate, depending on per-

ceptions of the sustainability of the policy easing. The dollar could

fall substantially. Investors are likely to be confounded by this

policy action, which would be seen as reversing the thrust of policy over

the past year. Unless subsequent data suggested substantial weakness in

the economy and price pressures, inflation expectations and bond yields

ultimately could rise under this alternative.

Directive language

(16) Draft language for the operational paragraph, including

the usual options and updating, is shown below.

OPERATIONAL PARAGRAPH

In the implementation of policy for the immediate future, the

Committee seeks to DECREASE SOMEWHAT/maintain/INCREASE SOMEWHAT

the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions. Taking

account of indications of inflationary pressures, the strength

of the business expansion, the behavior of the monetary aggre-

gates, and developments in foreign exchange and domestic

financial markets, somewhat (SLIGHTLY) greater reserve restraint

would (MIGHT), or (SOMEWHAT) slightly lesser reserve restraint

(WOULD) might, be acceptable in the intermeeting period. The

contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be consistent

with growth of M2 and M3 over the period from December through

March THROUGH JUNE at annual rates of about ____ [DEL: 2] and ____ [DEL: 3-1/2]

percent, respectively. The Chairman may call for Committee

consultation if it appears to the Manager for Domestic Oper-

ations that reserve conditions during the period before the next

meeting are likely to be associated with a federal funds rate

persistently outside a range of ____ TO ____ [DEL: 7 to 11] percent.
