MONEY MARKET AND RESERVE RELATIONSHIPS

Recent Developments

(1) Yields in short-term credit markets have shown little net

change since the January 14 Committee meeting, although longer-term

interest rates have recently come under increased upward pressure.

The Treasury on Wednesday afternoon announced a "rights" exchange of its

February maturities, offering holders the option of either a 15-month

note priced to yield 6.42 per cent or a 7-year note priced to yield

6.29 per cent. The refunding announcement was received quietly in the

market, with minor price adjustments. The System's subsequent publication

of a large net borrowed reserve number Thursday night resulted in some

further price declines in the note and bond market.

(2) After declining to near the lower end of the 6 - 6-1/4

per cent range specified in the last Blue Book in the wake of heavy

early January investor demands, the 3-month Treasury bill rate moved

up to near 6.20 per cent, a shade higher than the level prevailing around

the time of the last Committee meeting. System sales of bills for both

its own and foreign accounts, a waning of investor demands, and the

liquidation of Treasury bills in the market by banks, including relatively

rapid sales out of the $1-3/4 billion of additional June tax bills

auctioned on January 15, contributed to the firming of bill yields.

(3) Despite continued large CD and other time deposit

attrition in January, the major money market banks in New York have

moved into a comfortable money position--swinging, partly for seasonal

reasons, from a large basic reserve deficit to, in recent days, a basic

reserve surplus. These banks have built up their net borrowing from the

Euro-dollar market to a new high (although in the past several days such

borrowings have shown little further net change), demands on them for

day-to-day money from the dealer market have remained relatively light,

and they have apparently reduced holdings of earning assets. Under the

circumstances, with major banks no longer large net borrowers in the

funds market, the Federal funds rate tended to decline, requiring

sizeable offsetting System open market operations. Over the past two

statement weeks the Desk made nearly $3 billion of matched sale-

purchase transactions, in addition to selling outright or redeeming

more than $500 million of bills. Member bank borrowings from the

System rose to an average of $835 million over the period, but with

reserve distribution temporarily skewed in favor of major money market

banks, borrowing was concentrated at country banks and reserve city

banks other than major money market banks. The Federal funds rate was

generally around 6-1/4 - 6-3/8 per cent, and net borrowed reserves in a

$570 to $750 million range.

(4) The continued sizeable CD run-offs at major banks in

January was accompanied by a weaker than expected deposit expansion at



-3-

other banks. As a result, the bank credit proxy is now estimated to

show a decline of 4-1/2 per cent, annual rate, in January on average.

Bank borrowing in the Euro-dollar market would add back about 3 per-

centage points, so that the adjusted proxy would decline at a 1-1/2 per

cent annual rate.-

(5) With large CD run-offs, and with weakness developing in

flows of other time deposits, the total of time and savings deposits

in January is estimated to have declined at a 10-1/2 per cent annual

rate, almost twice as much as earlier projected. Money supply growth

was also slower than anticipated, rising, on current estimates, at

about a 4-1/2 per cent annual rate. The bulge in money supply in the

weeks about year-end has faded rather rapidly, reflecting the transitory

nature of year-end money flows as well as recent net transfers from

private demand to U.S. Government deposits as banks sold out the new

June tax bills.

(6) The following table shows rates of change in major

reserve and deposit aggregates estimated for January, as compared with

other recent periods. The growth in January of total and nonborrowed

liabilities to foreign branches for all banks involved; the

previous series used represented an average of Wednesday figures
for all banks during the month. The previously used series
would show a 4 percentage point increase in Euro-dollar

borrowings from December to January.

in about equal parts, the impact of lagged reserve requirements and the

shift in January in deposit composition from time to demand deposits.

Prospective Developments

(7) As February progresses, the basic reserve position of

major money market banks can be expected to worsen, partly as the recent

seasonal easing reverses and possibly also because of increased demands

for day-to-day funds which might stem from the Treasury refunding. The

Federal funds and dealer loan rates may, therefore, tend to rise somewhat

from recent levels, for any given level of total member bank borrowings.



Moreover, continued CD run-offs may tend to impel somewhat greater

borrowing demands from the Federal Reserve. If borrowings are in a

$600-$850 million range in February, the funds rate might be most

frequently around 6-3/8 - 6-5/8 per cent. The 3-month bill rate, under

these conditions, may be expected to be in a 6 - 6.30 per cent range.

(8) A little downward pressure on bill rates could develop

out of the Treasury financing. Given the current market atmosphere,

the staff is not expecting sizeable bill demands by holders of "rights",

but part of the attrition--projected around $1-1/4 billion--could find

its way into the bill market. However, the Treasury has made known its

expectation of raising $2-$3 billion of cash before early April; some

part of this may be raised through a bill strip offering at an earlier

date, particularly if attrition in the refunding is sizeable. This

prospect should lead dealers to remain willing sellers of bills over

the next few weeks. Market attitudes also appear highly sensitive to

many of the cross-currents in economic and financial news. A more

widespread conviction that monetary policy will be restrictive should

keep bill rates under upward pressure; however, news of economic weakness

could tend to have a countervailing effect.

(9) Assuming the bill rate averages around the mid-point of

the range, the bank credit proxy (as measured by total member deposits)

in February is expected to decline further--perhaps in a 3 to 6 per cent

annual rate range. The principal factor in this decline continues to



be relatively rapid run-off in large negotiable CD's, but private

demand deposits in February are also expected to decline on average.

Even if Euro-dollar borrowings by U.S. banks rise no further from the

level to which they had advanced in the course of January, they would

still add about 3 percentage points on average to the February credit

proxy projection. In that case the adjusted bank credit proxy would

be in a 0 to -3 per cent range for February.

(10) The CD run-off for February is projected at around

$1-1/4 billion. This represents a smaller absolute decline than in

January, reflecting for the most part smaller maturities estimated for

February. Other time and savings deposits are expected to continue

weak, although not as weak as in January when one-time asset shifts

were made following the year-end interest-crediting period.

(11) While the extent of CD run-off remains, as always,

uncertain, perhaps the greater uncertainty in coming weeks concerns the

behavior of private demand deposits and the money supply. Despite

sizeable attrition in the Treasury refunding, U.S. Government deposits

are expected to rise substantially further, on average, during the

month, partly as receipts from the $1-3/4 billion June tax bill issue

paid for in late January affect the February monthly average figures.

This rise would be associated with some net transfers out of private

demand deposits. The outstanding money supply in February is expected

to decline, probably in a 1 - 4 per cent, annual rate, range. However,



a smaller than projected attrition in the Treasury refunding and/or a

marked slowing of business loan demand could enlarge the decline in

money supply. Some slowing of banks' business loan growth from the

recent rapid pace is anticipated, in any event, as inventory accumula-

tion is expected to moderate.

(12) The continued reduction in bank credit outstanding, on

average, will probably be accompanied by further liquidation of U.S.

Government securities--including some attrition of bank holdings in

the refunding--and limited, if any, bank net purchases of municipals.

Thus, prospects are for further upward pressure on long-term rates.

although postponements or cancellations of capital issues, particularly

by State and local governments, may moderate the upward course of

yields.
