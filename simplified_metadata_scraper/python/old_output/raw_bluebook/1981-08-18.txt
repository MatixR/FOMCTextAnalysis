Prefatory Note 

 
 

The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain. 
 

Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a redaction process that removed information obtained on a 
confidential basis.  All redacted passages are exempt from disclosure under applicable 
provisions of the Freedom of Information Act.    

 

                                                 
1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked 
and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not 
reliably recognized by the OCR process and were not checked or corrected by staff.

Recent developments

(1) M1-B, adjusted for shifts into NOW accounts, expanded at

a 3½ percent annual rate in July, after contracting at nearly a 7 percent

annual pace in the previous two months. Available data for the first

two weeks of August are very strong, however; part of that increase,

perhaps one-quarter, seems to reflect the transitory influence of demand

balances accumulated to pay for stock tendered in connection with mergers.

Even after allowance for this, M1-B in early August appears to be back to

a level more nearly in line with the 7 percent June to September target

path. M2 expanded at an 8 percent annual rate in July, as its non-

transactions component rose more rapidly last month than had been previously

anticipated. Fragmentary data for early August suggest a further strength-

ening in that component. This strengthening, together with the sizable

increase in M1-B so far this month, suggests that M2 has moved to a

level above its third-quarter target path.

(2) Through July, as shown in the last column of the table on

the next page, growth in Ml-B was well below the lower end of its 3½ to

6 percent range for the year, M2 was just below the upper end of its 6 to

9 percent range, and M3--though its growth had decelerated in July--remained

well above the 9½ percent upper end of its range. The early August data

would place M1-B a little closer to the long-run path this month, but

still well below it, and would probably place M2 at/or somewhat above,

the upper end of its range.

1/ Growth rates for reserve measures are adjusted to remove the effects
of discontinuities from breaks in the series when Regulations D and M
are changed. In addition, such measures are adjusted to remove dis-
continuities associated with the distorting effects of weekend reserve
avoidance activities in late 1980.

(3) Credit growth at U.S. banking offices was at a 5¾ percent

annual rate in July. Business loan growth accelerated somewhat, as

businesses chose to meet an increased share of their credit needs at

banks rather than in the commercial paper or capital markets, where net

issuance slowed. Merger activity was an insignificant factor in July

loan expansion at U.S. banking offices, since virtually all of such loans

were booked offshore by both U.S. and foreign banks. However, in early

August business loans at large banks expanded sharply, with a little over

half the growth reflecting merger loans.

(4) In line with the Committee's decision to strengthen growth

in M1-B, the reserve aggregates expanded rapidly in July (as shown in

the table on the preceding page). Nonborrowed reserves rose particularly

sharply. At the same time, borrowings declined, dropping by about

$350 million in July on average and another $500 million in the first half

of August, as weakness of M1-B in the latter part of July reduced required

reserves (with a lag) relative to the nonborrowed reserve path.1/ Member

bank borrowing averaged about $1.2 billion in the first two statement

weeks of August.

(5) The federal funds rate, which averaged a bit over 19 percent

in June and July, recently has traded in a 17½ to 18½ percent range.

Despite this decline, most other interest rates--both short- and long-term--

have risen by ½ to 1¼ percentage points on balance since the July

Committee meeting. The upward pressure on interest rates generally

reflected increasing concern about the Treasury's longer-run financing

1/ See Appendix I for adjustments made to the reserves path during the
intermeeting period.

needs following enactment of the Administration's tax proposals, a slower

than expected drop in the funds rate, incoming economic news that has been

less weak than many had anticipated, and the market's need to absorb a

large amount of new Treasury issues in a relatively short period in late

July and early August. Since late July the Treasury has announced issues

to raise $7.9 billion of new money, with issues ranging from a 23-day

cash management bill to a 30-year bond in the current mid-August refunding.

(6) The dollar strengthened further in foreign exchange

markets over the intermeeting period, rising on balance 3 percent on a

weighted average basis, reflecting relatively high and rising interest

rates here and political uncertainties abroad.



Prospective developments

(7) Shown below for Committee consideration are two alternative

monetary policy strategies for the current quarter. The upper panel of

the table shows growth rates for the June-to-September interval covered

by the Committee's short-run targets adopted at the last meeting, while

the next panel shows implied July-to-September growth rates, given last

month's actual growth. Possible intermeeting ranges for the federal funds

rate also are shown. More detailed data on these and other aggregates may

be found on pages 6 and 7, and charts indicating the relationship of the

alternative two-month targets to the Committee's existing longer-run

ranges for 1981 may be found on the next three pages.

(8) Alternative A retains the Committee's 7 percent June-to-

September target for M1-B adopted at the last meeting, a target that would

require an 8½ percent annual rate of growth over the two-month July-to-

September period. However, in view of the greater than expected strength

of the nontransactions component of M2, it seems likely that attaining the

M1 target for the third quarter will result in M2 expansion in excess of

the growth rate of 9 percent or less desired by the Committee at its last

meeting. We would now expect growth in M2 from June to September under

alternative A to be on the order of 10½ percent. Alternative B provides

an option that would exert greater restraint on M2 growth, involving a

lower target for M1-B growth in the third quarter, one of 6 percent.

(9) Both alternatives call for an acceleration of growth of

M1-B (adjusted for shifts into NOW accounts) from its modest July pace,

an increase which appears to be well in train in early August. Both would

reach a level of M1-B in September below the low end of the Committee's

longer-run range for this aggregate, and would imply a very slow annual

growth rate on a quarterly average basis, 1¼ to 1¾ percent. On the other

hand, both alternatives involve an acceleration of M2 over the balance of

the quarter that would place this aggregate somewhat above the upper end

of its longer-run range in September, though less so under B than A. The

specifications for alternatives A and B assume that MM growth slows a bit

from its recent extremely rapid pace, while small time deposit growth

strengthens relative to July, owing to growth of the 30-month SSC, whose

ceiling rate since August 1 can fluctuate in line with Treasury yields.

M3 is expected to remain well above its longer-run range under both

alternatives, reflecting continued CD growth to finance loan expansion.

(10) To achieve the alternative A specifications, total reserves

probably would have to expand at about a 13 percent annual rate in August

and September, considerably more than in July. Even such a rapid expansion

in reserves, and the associated faster money growth, would likely be con-

sistent with short-term interest rates holding near current levels.

Nominal GNP is expected by the staff to expand at a 7 percent annual rate

in the third quarter, suggesting strong transactions demands for money over

the balance of the quarter. Even with the alternative A target specifi-

cations, income velocity of M-B would rise at a relatively rapid annual



rate of about 5 percent this quarter. It seems reasonable to expect that

under alternative A the federal funds rate over the next few weeks might

be in the area of 18 percent. With the current level of discount and

surcharge rates, borrowing at the discount window could be in a $1 to $1

billion range.

(11) It is possible that long-term interest rates could decline

some over the next several weeks, as investors become increasingly

interested in bonds at the unusually high level of rates currently pre-

vailing. However, the projected stability in short-term rates and the

large prospective demands on bond markets would tend to limit the size--

and perhaps the duration--of any drop in rates. The Treasury is likely

to raise another $7½ billion of new money this quarter, sponsored agency

borrowings will also probably continue to be relatively large, and the

Treasury and sponsored agencies may need to borrow about $44 billion in

cash in the fourth quarter. In addition, any improvement in rates can

be expected to call forth a substantial volume of corporate issues to fund

short-term debt. Tax-exempt and foreign borrowings in U.S. capital

markets are also projected to remain large.

(12) The alternative B specifications imply growth of total

reserves from July to September at an 11 percent annual rate. The federal

funds rate probably would be around 19 percent or higher during the

intermeeting period, and, given the present discount rate structure,

borrowing would likely run around $1½ to $2 billion. Under alternative B,

market interest rates, especially short-term rates, are likely to rise,

perhaps appreciably. Pressure on thrift institution earnings would be

more intense under this alternative than under alternative A, and mortgage

rates would probably rise further. Longer-term market rates may also rise,



-10-

at least temporarily, in reflection of higher costs of financing positions;

business credit demands would continue to be centered on short-term markets.

The dollar would remain under upward pressure in foreign exchange markets.



-11-

Directive language

(13) Given below are two alternative operational paragraphs

for the directive. Alternative I retains the structure of the current

directive, focusing on the June to September growth rate for M1-B, with

the proviso adopted at the last meeting related to M2. The language

would be consistent with either alternatives A or B (with the directive

indicating under B that the Committee had lowered its third quarter

M1-B target). In this directive structure, it would need to be recognized,

however, that the proviso clause for M2 might well be promptly triggered

given the staff's current expectation of a strengthening in M2 growth.

The language of alternative II would be consistent with a

decision by the Committee to choose an M1-B growth rate over the balance

of the quarter presently thought needed to exert desired restraint on M2,

without prejudging that a lower growth in M1-B than earlier targeted for

the quarter will in practice be required. Thus, if this directive included

the July to September growth rate for M1-B in alternative B, the language

of the directive would permit the higher growth in M1-B needed to meet the

7 percent quarterly target should M2 remain at or fall below the upper

bound of its longer-run range. This language is similar to the approach

adopted by the Committee at the last mid-quarter meeting on May 18.

Alternative I

In the short run the Committee seeks behavior of reserve

aggregates consistent with growth of M1-B from June to September

at an annual rate of [DEL: 7] ____ percent after allowance for the impact

of flows into NOW accounts (resulting in growth at an annual rate

of about [DEL: 2] ____ percent from the average in the second quarter to



-12-

the average in the third quarter), provided that growth of M2

remains around the upper limit of [DEL:, or moves within,] its range for

the year. It is recognized that shifts into NOW accounts will

continue to distort measured growth in M1-B to an unpredictable

extent, and operational reserve paths will be developed in the

light of evaluation of those distortions. The Chairman may call

for Committee consultation if it appears to the Manager for

Domestic Operations that pursuit of the monetary objectives and

related reserve paths during the period before the next meeting

is likely to be associated with a federal funds rate persistently

outside a range of [DEL: l5 to 21] ____ TO ____ percent.

Alternative II

In the short run the Committee seeks behavior of reserve

aggregates consistent with a pick-up in growth of M1-B from July

to September to an annual rate of ____ percent, or somewhat

higher, after allowance for the impact of flows into NOW accounts.

Provided that growth of M2 remains around the upper limit of, or

moves within, its range for the year, growth of M1-B at an annual

rate somewhat higher than the ____ percent specified above would

be acceptable, in light of the relatively weak growth experienced

in July and the objective adopted by the Committee at its July

meeting for growth from June to September at an annual rate of

7 percent (resulting in growth at an annual rate of about 2 percent

from the average in the second quarter to the average in the third

quarter). It is recognized that shifts into NOW accounts will

continue to distort measured growth in M1-B to an unpredictable



-13-

extent, and operational reserve paths will be developed in the light

of evaluation of those distortions. The Chairman may call for

Committee consultation if it appears to the Manager for Domestic

Operations that pursuit of the monetary objectives and related

reserve paths during the period before the next meeting is likely

to be associated with a federal funds rate persistently outside

a range of [DEL: 15 to 21] ____ TO ____ percent.

NOTE: Weekly data for columns 1, 2, 3, and 5 through 10 are statement week averages of daily data. Weekly data in column 4 are average rates set in the auction

of 6-month bills that will be issued on the Thursday following the end of the statement week. For column 11, the weekly date is the mid-point of the calendar

week over which data are averaged. Columns 12 and 13 are 1-day quotes for Friday and Thursday, respectively, following the end of the statement week. Column 14

is an average of contract interest rates on commitments for conventional first mortgages with 80 percent loan-to-value ratios made by a sample of insured savings

and loan associations on the Friday following the end of the statement week. The FNMA auction yield is the average yield in a bi-weekly auction for short-term

forward commitments for government underwritten mortgages; beginning July 7, 1980, figures exclude graduated payment mortgages. GNMA yields are average net

yields to investors on mortgage-backed securities for immediate delivery, assuming prepayment in 12 years on pools of 30-year FHA/VA mortgages carrying the

coupon rate 50 basis points below the current FHA/VA ceiling.

NOTE: Government securities dealer cash positions consist of securities already delivered, commit-
ments to buy (sell) securities on an outright basis for immediate delivery (5 business days or less), and
certain "when-issued" securities for delayed delivery (more than 5 business days). Futures and forward
positions include all other commitments involving delayed delivery; futures contracts are arranged on
organized exchanges. Underwriting syndicate positions consists of issues in syndicate, excluding
trading positions.

Weekly data are daily averages for statement weeks, except for corporate and municipal issues in
syndicate, which are Friday figures. Monthly averages for excess reserves and borrowing are weighted
averages of statement week figures. Monthly data for dealer futures and forwards are end-of-month
figures for 1980.
