Prefatory Note 

 
 

The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain. 
 

Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a redaction process that removed information obtained on a 
confidential basis.  All redacted passages are exempt from disclosure under applicable 
provisions of the Freedom of Information Act.    

 

                                                 
1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked 
and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not 
reliably recognized by the OCR process and were not checked or corrected by staff.

STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL (FR) September 18, 1987
CLASS I - FOMC

MONETARY POLICY ALTENATIVES

Recent Developments

(1) Following the August 18 FOC meeting, nonborrowed reserve paths

continued to be constructed assuming $500 million of adjustment plus seasonal

borrowing at the discount window; actual borrowing in the maintenance period

ending in late August exceeded this level owing to unanticipated demands for

excess reserves. With this degree of reserve pressure, federal funds generally

traded in a 6-1/2 to 6-3/4 percent range, though the rate moved a bit higher

around the end of August when markets began to expect a near-term System tight-

ening. In light of the potential for greater inflation, associated in part

with weakness in the dollar, the objective for borrowing was raised in early

September to $600 million and, on September 4, the discount rate was increased

from 5-1/2 to 6 percent. Borrowing averaged below the higher path level in the

most recent complete maintenance period, as required reserves fell well short

of estimates. (Through the first eight days of the current period, borrowing

has averaged $360 million.) Subsequent to the discount rate increase, federal

funds have traded mainly in the 7 to 7-1/4 percent area. Total and nonborrowed

reserves resumed expansion in August, primarily in association with higher

levels of excess reserves.

(2) In often volatile markets, other interest rates rose substan-

tially over the intermeeting period. Bond yields moved up sharply in the first

part of the intermeeting period, as further declines in the dollar against a

backdrop of strength in the economy spurred concerns about inflation and

anticipation of some tightening of monetary policy. Short-term market rates

also were rising, though by less, as at least a slight firming of policy was



perceived to be in train. After the announcement of the discount rate increase,

short-term rates increased considerably further, and commercial banks raised

the prime rate by 1/2 percentage point. On balance, private short-term rates

are up around 3/4 of a percentage point since the August meeting, while Treasury

bill rates have increased somewhat less, perhaps benefitting partly from the

approach of another debt ceiling deadline that could disrupt supply. Bond

rates have risen somewhat further after the discount rate action, but the bulk

of the net increase of more than 1/2 of a percentage point over the intermeet-

ing period was registered before that time. Rates on fixed-rate mortgages have

climbed about 5/8 of a percentage point since the meeting, but ARM rates have

risen relatively little, as lenders have sweetened terms to attract borrowers

to their variable-rate instruments. Most stock price indexes reached new highs

in late August, but have retreated since then to levels about 1 to 5 percent

below those at the last FOMC meeting.

(3) The dollar's exchange value against the G-10 currencies came

under substantial downward pressure in the second half of August and by early

September had declined by 2-1/2 percent from the last FOMC meeting to a level

5 percent below its August 11 peak. The main factor in the dollar's depreci-

ation appeared to be greater pessimism about the pace of adjustment of external

imbalances, sparked by the release of U.S. trade figures for June. In addition,

prospects for growth abroad relative to the U.S. implied little contribution

from this source to external adjustment. More recently the dollar has traded

somewhat above levels prevailing around the time of the discount rate increase,

leaving the net decline for the intermeeting period at 2 percent.

, while the Desk purchased about $400 million, primarily against yen

in the period before the change in the discount rate.



-3-

(4) Growth of M2 picked up further in August to about a 6 percent

annual rate and expansion of M3 increased to a 7-1/2 percent pace. Neverthe-

less, M2 remained well below the parallel band associated with its annual range,

while M3 was just at the lower edge of its parallel band. Data for early Sep-

tember suggest that expansion in both of the broader aggregates this month may

approach the August pace, which would imply growth for the three-month June-to-

September period consistent with the FOMC's specification of around 5 percent.

Ml advanced at a 5-1/4 percent pace in August, but seems to have slackened some-

what in September. Reflecting in part the effect of earlier interest rate

increases, the velocity of M2 appears to be growing at about a 3-1/2 percent

annual rate in the current quarter, based on the staff GNP forecast, and M3

velocity is projected to increase at a 2 percent rate. M1 velocity appears to

be rising at a 6-1/4 percent annual rate this quarter, the first substantial

increase in 3 years.

(5) The acceleration of M2 in August reflected stronger growth of

its retail deposit components, a cessation of runoffs in demand deposits, and

a pickup of growth in overnight RPs. The relatively steep yield curve for

retail deposits continued to encourage growth in small time deposits, which

accounted for much of the increase in the household component of M2, although

growth of total liquid retail instruments--OCDs, savings, MMDAs, and money mar-

ket mutual funds--more than reversed the previous month's net runoff. The

leveling off of demand deposits likely represented some tapering off of the

effects of previous interest rate increases on compensating balances and mort-

gage refinancing activity. Overnight and term RPs increased strongly at com-

mercial banks last month, helping to finance heavy purchases of government

securities.

(6) M3 growth was bolstered in August by strong expansion in bank

credit, as both securities acquisitions and lending picked up considerably.

In addition to increasing term RPs, domestic banking offices borrowed heavily

from foreign branches, which evidently obtained funds by issuing Eurodollar

deposits-some of which are included in M3. Thrift institutions increased CD

issuance while running off RPs for the first time in more than a year. The

change in thrift funding patterns likely reflects reduced reliance on FHLB

advances as well as increased acquisitions of adjustable-rate mortgages, which

are less readily securitized and financed through RPs than are fixed-rate

mortgages.

(7) The debt of domestic nonfinancial sectors appears to have

expanded in August at around the reduced 8 percent pace of July, placing this

aggregate near the middle of its 8 to 11 percent annual range. The pattern

of credit demands has reflected the effects of rising long-term rates. Bond

issuance, by both businesses and state and local governments, was reduced in

August and September. Borrowing by businesses through bank loans and in the

commercial paper market also has remained weak, and the moderation in overall

credit usage may partly reflect some easing of the pace of financial restruc-

turing in the third quarter. Though the rise in mortgage rates has curtailed

fixed-rate mortgage financing, household borrowing appears to have been sup-

ported by a shift to adjustable-rate financing and by some strength in consumer

credit, which has been bolstered recently by auto sales incentives. Federal

borrowing picked up sharply in August, after the temporary extension of the

debt ceiling. The Treasury has continued a normal pattern of borrowing in

September, despite the prospect of a surplus in the federal budget this month.

The Treasury's cash balance surged after mid-month, reflecting unusually

individuals.

Policy alternatives

(8) The table below presents three alternative specifications for

growth of the monetary aggregates from August to December based on the usual

differences in pressures on reserve positions. (August, rather than Septem-

ber, is used as the base, as monetary data for September are still incomplete.

More detailed data, including implied growth from September to December, are

shown on the table and charts on the following pages.)

(9) Under alternative B, reserve paths would continue to be drawn

with adjustment plus seasonal borrowing at the $600 million level that has

been specified since early September. Money markets do not yet appear to

reflect this higher level of borrowing, and the federal funds rate would be

expected to firm a little, into a 7-1/4 to 7-3/8 percent range, as borrowing

came to average around $600 million and the market perceived the Federal

Reserve's intentions. The three-month Treasury bill rate would climb by

-9-

about 1/4 percentage point toward 6-3/4 percent, consistent with the slight

firming of the federal funds rate and an unwinding of distortions associated

with potential debt-ceiling disruptions. Private short-term rates also would

rise, but by even smaller amounts. In light of the higher federal funds rate

compared with its level expected at the last FOMC meeting, the federal funds

range associated with alternative B, given in the last line of the table, is

suggested at 5 to 9 percent; this would be 1 percentage point above the range

now in the directive, and more nearly centered on the federal funds rates

thought likely to prevail under this alternative.

(10) The slight further firming of short-term rates likely under

alternative B would tend to support trading of the dollar on foreign exchange

markets at around current levels for a while. Under these circumstances, the

Treasury bond rate would be expected to continue to fluctuate a little above

9-1/2 percent, although corporate bond yields and rates on fixed-rate mort-

gages could drift higher into more normal alignment with Treasuries. Legis-

lative developments could have a significant effect on the dollar and domestic

financial markets over coming weeks, however. Agreement on a mechanism for

substantial and continuing budget deficit reductions would tend to bolster

bond prices and possibly the dollar. However, should little substantive

progress be made on the budget, or should relatively restrictive trade mea-

sures seem to be in train, bond yields could come under upward pressure.

In addition, if incoming information pointed to continued massive current

account deficits, significant downward pressure on the dollar could well

reemerge. In this event, long-term rates would be expected to rise in re-

flection of associated concerns about inflation and demand for dollar assets,



-10-

while short-term rates also would tend to move higher in anticipation of

further monetary restraint. Indeed, the staff GNP forecast envisions further

declines in the dollar over coming quarters and upward movements of short-

term interest rates; in that forecast a portion of these movements has been

assumed to occur in the fourth quarter. 1

(11) The monetary aggregate specifications of alternative B assume

that the reserve pressures of this alternative are maintained through year-

end. Under these conditions, M2 is expected to grow at a 4-1/2 percent rate,

near its pace of recent months. This would bring growth in M2 for the year

to 4 percent, well below the lower end of the Committee's 5-1/2 to 8-1/2

percent long-run range. Adjustments of portfolios to the recent increase in

open market rates would act to restrain M2 growth over the months ahead,

especially its more liquid components, resulting in a further rise in M2

velocity. Opportunity costs of holding OCDs, savings deposits and MMDAs have

risen appreciably over recent weeks and are likely to remain high owing to

sluggish adjustment of offering rates. Moreover, similar to the experience

thus far this year, demand deposits could well remain about flat, as the

effects of the expected growth in economic activity over the remainder of the

year are about offset by the impact of the recent upward movement in interest

rates. Growth in small time deposits, in contrast, should be well maintained

as banks and thrifts have been adjusting yields on these accounts more promptly

to those in the open market. Given its relatively large interest sensitivity,

M1 would be expected to grow at only a 3 percent rate over August to December,

1. This forecast might be considered consistent with the reserve conditions
of alternative B over the intermeeting period followed by a firming later in
the quarter, or with a path intermediate between alternatives B and C.



-11-

implying quarterly average growth of 3-1/4 percent in the fourth quarter and

a 2-1/4 percent rate of velocity expansion.

(12) Growth in M3 from August to December is anticipated at a 6

percent rate under alternative B. This would be a little stronger than its

pace earlier in the year, and would move this aggregate close to, though not

quite within, its longer-run range. Bank credit growth, and associated

issuance of managed liabilities in M3, should be buoyed by additional reli-

ance by businesses on short-term sources of funds, given increasing financing

needs and the rise in bond rates. Despite some moderation in total mortgage

flows owing to higher interest rates and reduced housing market activity, the

renewed borrower interest in ARMs should support growth in thrift assets and

managed liabilities in M3. Consumer credit growth may slacken substantially

after the current round of automobile incentive programs ends and spending

on cars and other durables weakens. Total borrowing by domestic nonfinancial

sectors is expected to strengthen a bit in the fourth quarter, reflecting

entirely a pickup in federal borrowing to finance a larger deficit. For the

year, debt of domestic nonfinancial sectors is expected to rise by 9-1/2

percent on a quarterly average basis, in the middle of the annual range for

this aggregate.

(13) Under alternative C, the borrowing assumption would be raised

to $800 million. The federal funds rate would move up to 7-3/4 percent or a

little above, after the markets had adjusted to this further tightening of

pressures on reserve positions. Other short-term market rates might also

rise by around 1/2 percentage point, with the 3-month bill rising to about

7 percent. The prime rate would be boosted, perhaps by even more, given the

relatively narrow spread of this rate over CDs now prevailing. The dollar



-12-

could firm a little, at least in the near term, and the perceived willingness

to tighten policy could postpone emergence of any subsequent downward pressure

on the dollar. Bond yields probably would move higher, although if the mar-

kets were to view this measure as forestalling future inflationary pressures,

any rise in long-term rates could be rather small.

(14) Under alternative C, M2 growth over the August-to-December

period would slow to about a 3-1/2 percent pace, as opportunity costs of

holding M2 balances widened substantially further. At the most liquid end of

the spectrum, M1 might expand only a little over this period, with demand

deposits declining. Banks and thrifts, faced with even smaller inflows to

core deposits, would step up their issuance of managed liabilities to fund

only marginally weaker credit demands, and M3 would expand at a 5-3/4 percent

rate over the August-to-December period, leaving growth for the year at 5-1/4

percent.

(15) Alternative A assumes that reserve paths would be constructed

with borrowing of $400 million. Since markets have not yet adjusted to the

current $600 million objective, this alternative implies only a modest drop

in money market rates from current levels. The federal funds rate would

drift lower to below 7 percent, somewhat above its trading range before the

recent run-up in rates. Other private short-term rates also would decline,

perhaps by a quarter of a percentage point. Bill rates might drop very little

on balance once potential supply constraints eased. Even so, absent a clear

indication of weakness in the economy or lessened inflation concerns, market

participants probably would be surprised by any easing action caning on the

heels of the discount rate hike. The dollar might well come under consider-

able downward pressure, and this would tend to limit possible declines in

bond yields.



-13-

(16) Under alternative A, all of the monetary aggregates likely

would accelerate from their pace of recent months, bringing M3 to the lower

bound of its long-run range. Both M2 and M3 would be expected to end the

year growing at rates that fall within, but in the lower portions of, their

tentative ranges for next year. As short-term rates retraced much of their

recent advances, opportunity costs would act as only a minor drag on M2 in

the caning months, especially on its M1 and other liquid components. Con-

sequently, M1 and M2 would expand at rates more in line with income over the

fourth quarter. M3 would be expected to strengthen to a 6-1/4 percent rate

over the August-to-December period as larger core deposit inflows to banks

and thrifts would not be offset completely by smaller issuance of managed

liabilities.



-14-

Directive language

(17) Draft language for the operational paragraph, with the usual

options for alternative specifications of reserve pressures, is presented be-

low for Committee consideration. The proposed addition of the phrase "sought

in recent weeks" at the end of the first sentence would take account of the

difference between actual reserve pressures recently and those specified in

the reserve paths since the intermeeting adjustment in early September. The

sentence on possible intermeeting adjustments provides for the usual options

with regard to the symmetry or asymmetry of such adjustments with appropriate

use of "would" or "might" and "somewhat" or "slightly." New language is

suggested to update the M1 sentence.

OPERATIONAL PARAGRAPH

In the implementation of policy for the immediate future,

the Committee seeks to DECREASE SOMEWHAT (Alt. A)/maintain (Alt. B)/

INCREASE SOMEWHAT (Alt. C) the [DEL: existing] degree of pressure on reserve

positions SOUGHT IN RECENT WEEKS. Somewhat (SLIGHTLY) greater

reserve restraint would (MIGHT), or (SOMEWHAT) slightly lesser reserve

restraint (WOULD) might, be acceptable depending on indications of

inflationary pressures, the strength of the business expansion,

developments in foreign exchange markets, as well as the behavior of

the aggregates. This approach is expected to be consistent with growth

in M2 and M3 over the period from [DEL: June through September] AUGUST

THROUGH DECEMBER at annual rates of around [DEL: 5] ____ and [DEL: 7-1/2] ____

percent, RESPECTIVELY. {DEL: Growth in M1 while picking up from-recent

levels, is expected to remain well below its pace during 1986.] M1



-15-

IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE TO GROW RELATIVELY SLOWLY. The Chairman

may call for Committee consultation if it appears to the Manager

for Domestic Operations that reserve conditions during the period

before the next meeting are likely to be associated with a federal

funds rate persistently outside a range of [DEL: 4 to 8] ____ TO ____

percent.
