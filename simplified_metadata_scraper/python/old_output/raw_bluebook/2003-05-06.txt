2  These changes in Treasury yields and equity prices followed sharp increases
in the run-up to the March meeting after questions about the timing of the onset of
the war were largely resolved.  Since March 12 (the day the previous Greenbook
closed) broad equity indexes have gained about 14 percent and Treasury coupon yields
have risen 6 to 24 basis points.

MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Recent Developments

(1) Favorable developments regarding the war in Iraq and disappointing

economic data releases produced notable crosscurrents in financial markets over the

intermeeting period.  The rapid military gains, as well as the associated substantial

decline in oil prices, appear to have led to an unwinding of previous flight-to-quality

flows and tended to brighten the economic outlook, working to boost Treasury yields

and equity prices.1  That impetus has been offset, however, by soft economic data that

were read by investors as indicating that the economic upturn may be a bit more

delayed than previously anticipated.  On balance, the two-year Treasury yield has

declined 15 basis points, but longer-dated Treasury yields are little changed since the

March meeting (Chart 1).  Broad equity indexes, which have also benefited from

better-than-expected corporate earnings reports, have risen about 6 percent.2 

Inflation compensation implied by the spread of the nominal over the inflation-

indexed ten-year Treasury yield has declined 15 basis points, probably spurred in part

by the considerable drop in oil prices, although a survey-based measure of

households’ long-term inflation expectations has remained around 2¾ percent.

The Effects of War-Related News on Treasury Yields

On balance, the yield on the two-year Treasury note (the thick line in the
upper panel of Chart 2) has fallen 63 basis points since September 11, 2002, the day
before President Bush’s speech at the U.N. General Assembly that first called on
the world to disarm Iraq.  Financial market commentary suggests that some of the
movements in the yield (and other asset prices) during this period were driven by
changing views regarding the prospect for war with Iraq and, in the event, by its
relatively quick resolution.  Presumably, the channels of such influence on Treasury
yields include effects on investors’ outlook for economic activity and inflation, the
attendant consequences for monetary policy, and changes in the perception of and
attitude toward bearing risk.

Quantifying these effects, and the extent to which they have unwound, is
complicated because other factors also have left their imprint on Treasury yields. 
To control for the systematic effect of macroeconomic information, daily changes
in the two-year Treasury yield over the past 15 years were regressed on the surprise
component of 15 data releases, where the surprises were measured using the
median expectation from surveys conducted by Money Market Services.  According
to this regression, incoming news since the fall of last year have pulled down the
two-year yield about 60 basis points (the thin line in the upper panel).  The
unexplained portion of the yield movements varied quite a bit over this period and,
on net, left the yield little changed (the dotted line in the middle panel).

By no means is war-related news likely to account for all these unexplained
movements.  Indeed, before mid-December, the words “Iraq” or “war” were
mentioned only occasionally in the Credit Markets column of the Wall Street Journal 
(the bottom panel).  Beginning in December, however, mention of war with Iraq as
an explanation of Treasury yield movements stepped up considerably.  From
September 11, 2002, to March 5, 2003, the nadir of most Treasury yields, the two-
year note rate fell about 70 basis points, with most of that decline attributable to the
unexplained component on days in which war news was prominent.  Similarly, the
rebound in that yield since then is mainly accounted for by influences other than
the predictable responses to economic data surprises on days when financial
reporters, at least, were focusing on the war, with the most dramatic move
occurring in the run-up to the March 18th FOMC meeting.  Over the intermeeting
period itself, a diminution of war effects apparently offset some, but not all, of the
drag on yields associated with mostly softer economic data.

3 Over the intermeeting period, the federal funds rate averaged close to its
1¼ percent target.  The Desk has purchased $7.6 billion of Treasury securities in
outright operations: $5.3 billion of Treasury coupon securities and bills in the market
and $2.3 billion of bills from foreign official institutions.  The outstanding volume of
long-term System RPs was unchanged, on net, at $16 billion.

(2) The abatement of war-related risks has been reflected in sizable declines

in forward-looking measures of uncertainty in short- and long-term interest rates,

exchange rates, and oil and equity prices (Charts 1 and 3).  Risk spreads on corporate

debt securities have narrowed across the credit quality spectrum–probably pulled

down also in part by expectations of improved default and recovery rates–and flows

into high-yield bond mutual funds have been substantial.  The spread between the

forward earnings-price ratio and the real longer-term Treasury yield, a measure of the

equity premium, has narrowed only slightly, but there have been sizable flows into

equity mutual funds of late.

(3) The decision to leave policy on hold at the March meeting was mostly

anticipated by market participants, and interest rates edged higher on the afternoon of

the announcement.3  The FOMC’s decision not to characterize the balance of risks

and to mention “heightened surveillance” in the announcement was apparently read as

indicating that the Committee was poised to react quickly to evolving economic news

and global events, elevating market participants’ expectation of the possibility of an

intermeeting action.  Indeed, at one point in late March, futures prices suggested a

significant chance of an ease sometime before May 6th.  As time passed and the speed

and extent of military success in Iraq became evident, such expectations unwound. 

On net, the term structure of money market futures rates has rotated since the March

meeting, with the expected path for the target federal funds rate revised upward

through the summer but downward thereafter in light of the downbeat economic

news.  The current configuration of futures rates suggests that market participants

now place about one-in-three odds on a 25-basis-point cut in the target federal funds

rate at the upcoming meeting and that the expected amount of policy tightening by

the end of next year has been trimmed about 50 basis points, placing the expected

funds rate then at about 1¾ percent.

(4) After recording a sharp rise in the days just before the March FOMC

meeting in anticipation of the start of military operations in Iraq, the dollar fluctuated

widely during the first half of the intermeeting period, driven largely by news from the

battlefield and other global trouble spots (Chart 4).  Following the capture of Baghdad

in early April, the dollar came under downward pressure that has intensified in recent

days.  On balance, the dollar has lost about 3¾ percent against an index of major

foreign currencies since the March FOMC meeting.4  The dollar fell particularly

steeply—about 5¾ percent—against the euro, but it also declined 4½ percent versus

the Canadian dollar.  The Bank of Canada raised its overnight interest rate 25 basis

points on April 15, citing inflationary pressures, although it also acknowledged the

possibility of some near-term weakness in the economy.  Much as was the case in U.S.

markets, stock prices in most major foreign markets benefited from the reduction of

geopolitical uncertainty and from some better-than-anticipated earnings reports, while

yields on most foreign long-term government securities rose slightly.  In Japan, by

contrast, the ten-year government bond yield slumped to a record low of 57 basis

points, stock prices moved essentially sideways, and the yen was unchanged against

the dollar over the period. 

(5) Since the March FOMC meeting, the dollar has depreciated 

2¾ percent against the currencies of our other important trading partners.  The

Mexican peso gained about 6 percent as the Bank of Mexico tightened policy again

near the end of March.  Favorable developments in Brazil, including an

announcement that the primary budget surplus in 2002 exceeded its target and some

progress on fiscal and pension reform, buoyed financial markets there.  Extending

recent trends, the real appreciated almost 17 percent, Brazilian stocks moved up

15 percent, and Brazil’s EMBI+ spread narrowed 230 basis points.  Markets in some

Asian countries were buffeted noticeably by news about the SARS epidemic and

menacing rhetoric from North Korea.  The most visible market reaction to SARS was

in Hong Kong, where stock prices declined sharply midway through the period but

recouped much of that loss in recent days.  For a time, Korean markets were

supported by building optimism that diplomatic progress would be made on the

impasse with North Korea, but those gains were knocked back somewhat when such

hopes waned in recent days.

(6) Despite improvements in market conditions, domestic business demands

for credit have remained sluggish in recent months, owing importantly to a continuing

narrow gap between capital expenditures and internal sources of funds.  Gross

issuance of corporate bonds slowed somewhat in the past couple of months from its

relatively robust pace earlier in the year, and borrowers continued to use much of the

proceeds to pay down other debt, especially commercial paper and C&I loans. 

Indeed, according to responses to the April Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey,

demand for C&I loans has weakened further over the past three months.  However, a

notably smaller net percentage of banks reported tightening loan terms and standards

than in recent surveys.  Household debt is estimated to have grown 9½ percent in the

first quarter, only a touch below the average pace in 2002, propelled by continued

rapid growth of mortgage debt that has been fueled by record levels of refinancing

activity.   Consumer credit expanded moderately in the first quarter, at about the same



6

rate as last year, but consumer loans at banks are estimated to have weakened in April. 

Facing growing financing needs, the Treasury announced yesterday additional changes

to its auction schedule.  (See the box on the next page on Treasury debt management

developments.)

(7) M2 growth slowed over March and April, but most of the deceleration

appeared to be attributable to tax-related factors.  A shift toward earlier electronic

filing pushed refund distributions into February, thereby weakening the level of M2 in

March.  In addition, final tax payments by individuals in April ran below the average

of recent years, and the resulting buildup of deposits in anticipation of tax payments

was lower than what was incorporated in seasonal factors.  M2 growth may also have

been held down somewhat in recent months by substantial net flows to capital market

mutual funds.  In the first quarter, M2 velocity continued to fall roughly in line with

movements in opportunity costs.



7

Treasury Debt Management Developments

The average maturity of Treasury debt held by the public has been falling since late
2001, nearly reversing an uptrend that had started in the mid-1990s.  This decline is partly
attributable to the expectation of Treasury debt managers that the surge in federal
borrowing in late 2001 and early 2002 would be short-lived and thus better
accommodated through increased offerings of short-term securities.  As deficits have
apparently become more persistent, the Treasury has announced measures to increase its
borrowing capacity in longer-dated securities in recent quarterly refunding statements. 
For instance, quarterly auctions of three-year notes will be reintroduced next week with
the primary purpose of allowing the Treasury to reduce its borrowing in bills and two-year
notes.  In addition, the Treasury announced at yesterday’s quarterly refunding press
conference that, starting in August, it will issue five-year notes on a monthly basis,
introduce regular reopenings of the ten-year note (to take place about a month after each
refunding auction) and increase the number of ten-year indexed note auctions from three
to four times a year.  In total, the Treasury will sell $58 billion of notes at the upcoming
quarterly refunding auctions—the largest refunding offering since 1996.

Given that the Congress has not yet taken action to raise the Treasury’s statutory
borrowing limit of $6.4 trillion, the Treasury has been engaging in extraordinary measures
to keep its statutory debt under the limit and avoid any disruptions to the May refunding
auctions.  On April 4, the Treasury invoked its authority to suspend issuing debt to the
Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund until July 11, 2003.  In addition, the Treasury
has been underinvesting two other trust funds: the Thrift Savings Plan of Federal
Retirement Thrift Investment Board (the “G-fund”) and the Exchange Stabilization Fund. 
Yesterday, the Treasury indicated that these measures will allow it to stay within its
statutory debt limit only until the second half of May.

Policy Alternatives

(8) The contours of the staff outlook for this meeting are generally similar to

those in the previous few projections in that near-term sluggishness in economic

growth is anticipated to give way to more vigorous expansion over the balance of the

forecast period.  This time round, projected growth in economic activity is a bit

weaker in the near term in light of generally disappointing economic data released in

the past seven weeks and slightly stronger next year, given a higher track for wealth

and more fiscal stimulus than anticipated in March.  The projection is again premised

on the assumption that the FOMC keeps the target federal funds rate flat at

1¼ percent through the end of next year.  While yields on longer-term Treasuries are

expected to edge up slightly over the next few quarters, those on lower-tier

investment-grade and speculative-grade securities fall further as the expansion gains

firmer footing.  Equity prices again are anticipated to rise steadily, but from a base that

is considerably higher than in the March Greenbook.  These financial conditions are

projected to spur business investment, which, together with a bit larger and more

front-loaded fiscal stimulus than assumed in the March Greenbook, contributes to a

gradual acceleration in overall activity, with real GDP growth reaching 4¾ percent

over next year.  Still, with productivity rising briskly, the unemployment rate edges up

over the next several quarters, peaking just above 6 percent before beginning to slip

lower in the second quarter of next year.  Reflecting the persistent slack in product

and labor markets, core consumer price inflation is expected to continue to edge

down, but along a slightly lower trajectory that reflects the surprisingly subdued price

data of late.  In this quarter and next, declines in energy prices are projected to pull the

rate of overall PCE inflation down to ½ percent.  Over 2004, both total and core

inflation average 1 percent. 



9

(9) Should the Committee believe the staff forecast likely and be attracted to

the projected combination of accelerating output and some further decline in

inflation, it might wish to leave the stance of policy unchanged at this meeting. 

The projected pickup in the growth of activity, albeit gradual, does suggest that

maintaining the current stance of policy would be consistent with a narrowing of the

output gap by the end of next year.  Indeed, the Committee might anticipate that

economic slack will be worked down more quickly, and downward pressures on

inflation diminished correspondingly sooner, than in the Greenbook.  In particular,

the Committee might see substantial odds that aggregate demand will grow more

vigorously than portrayed in the Greenbook.  With the war concluded, business

confidence could rebound sharply and, combined with the improvement in consumer

sentiment and financial market conditions already seen, prove more supportive of

growth than projected by the staff.  In addition, the forthcoming degree of fiscal

stimulus, which currently is being debated in the Congress, could well turn out to be

greater than assumed in the Greenbook.  Even if the Committee expects aggregate

demand growth about in line with that of the staff forecast, it might still expect the

output gap to shrink more quickly if it is less optimistic about productivity growth.  If

so, the Committee may regard the further disinflation projected by the staff as less

likely, despite the recent subdued price data, a view that might be reinforced by the

observation that core PCE inflation shows no discernable trend over the past few

years and other readings on inflation show mixed changes (Chart 5).

(10) If the Committee instead found the Greenbook projection of only

sluggish progress in closing the output gap over the next six quarters with a PCE

inflation rate of 1 percent at the end of the projection period to be credible but

undesirable, it might choose to ease monetary policy at this meeting.  In particular,

concerns about a protracted output gap may be especially pressing in the current

circumstances of surprisingly low inflation.  Indeed, as shown in Chart 6, the real

short-term federal funds rate does not differ much from the level prevailing before

the Committee’s November 6th policy easing.  Cutting the nominal funds rate at this

meeting may be appropriate to reestablish the previously sought spread of the actual

real funds rate below its estimated equilibrium.  Going forward, a further decline in

inflation from its already low level, by limiting the scope for reductions in short-term

interest rates, could inordinately constrain the ability of monetary policy to provide

stimulus in response to an adverse shock to spending at some later date.  Even if the

Committee saw the risks surrounding the projected paths of aggregate demand and

inflation in the Greenbook as symmetric, it might view the costs of falling

unexpectedly short of either of those paths in coming quarters as larger than the costs

of an overage.  In that case, the regret associated with easing policy and subsequently

discovering that it was unnecessary would presumably be small relative to that of

holding the funds rate at 1¼ percent and eventually learning that a lower level would

have been appropriate. 

(11) The evident reduction in “Knightian uncertainty” in recent weeks may

incline the Committee to return to its practice of announcing an assessment of the

balance of risks.  If so, and if it elects to leave the stance of policy unchanged, an

outlook in which resource slack remains substantial and inflation declines slightly over

the next several quarters, such as in the Greenbook, might suggest that the balance of

risks is weighted toward economic weakness for the foreseeable future.  However, if

the Committee either were to interpret the “foreseeable future” as referring to a

period extending beyond the next few quarters or were to judge aggregate demand as

likely to be notably stronger or aggregate supply weaker than in the Greenbook, then

it might characterize the risks to its objectives as balanced.  The appropriate balance

of risks following an easing move would depend partly on the Committee’s economic

outlook and perhaps partly on the forcefulness of its action.  Particularly if members’

basic outlook was more pessimistic than that of the Greenbook or the cost of a

downside surprise to that outlook loomed especially large, the risks might be viewed

as weighted toward economic weakness—especially if the easing action was limited to

25 basis points.  A 25-basis-point easing coupled with a more sanguine outlook for the

economy, however, or a 50-basis-point action, by providing appreciably more

stimulus, arguably could equalize the risks, especially if the “foreseeable future” was

interpreted as extending well into next year.

(12) Financial markets have incorporated a one-in-three chance of a policy

easing at this meeting.  As to the balance-of-risks statement, one-half of the

respondents to a recent survey of primary dealers expected the FOMC to adopt a

neutral assessment, but the other half were about evenly split between expecting one

tilted toward weakness and a deferral of any assessment.  If this reflects broader

market thinking, a decision to leave the stance of monetary policy unchanged and to

issue a neutral balance-of-risks statement would likely elicit only a modest backup in

yields on money market instruments and have little effect on bond yields, equity

prices, and the foreign exchange value of the dollar.  However, a statement that the

balance of risks was tilted toward economic weakness, coupled with an unchanged

stance of policy, would prompt investors to reexamine their own forecasts and would

probably lead to a decline in interest rates across the yield curve, especially at

intermediate maturities, and a depreciation of the dollar.  In view of the countervailing

effects of lower interest rates and the chance of a weaker earnings outcome implicit in

such a statement of risks, the response of equity prices is more difficult to judge, but

some decline cannot be ruled out.  An easing of policy would come as some surprise

to financial markets, and short-term yields would fall substantially.  Bond yields likely

would drop as well, and equity prices should increase.  A judgment that the risks were



12

weighted toward weakness likely would give pause to equity investors, while a neutral

balance of risks and a generally optimistic statement that stressed an “insurance”

motive for the action would be more likely to fuel a stock market rally.

(13) Under the Greenbook projections of income and interest rates, domestic

nonfinancial sector debt is expected to expand about 7 percent this year, close to last

year’s pace and distinctly above the rate of expansion of nominal GDP.  This

relatively rapid growth primarily reflects federal debt, which at 10 percent this year

expands a bit faster than forecasted in the March Greenbook because of wider

projected budget deficits.  Business sector debt is forecast to accelerate gradually to

finance a widening financing gap, but debt growth in this sector still is only

4¼ percent in 2003.  While business borrowing is expected to remain concentrated in

bond and mortgage markets, the acceleration is accounted for entirely by a sizable

swing from runoffs to increases in shorter-term debt such as bank loans and

commercial paper.  Household sector debt growth should slow somewhat as stimulus

from previous declines in mortgage rates tapers off and increases in home prices

moderate further.  Still, households are expected to continue to rely mainly on

mortgage debt over the balance of this year.  M2 is projected to grow 6 percent this

year, down from last year’s 7 percent advance.  With that performance, the velocity of

that aggregate would decline, but a little less rapidly than in 2002 as the effects of past

monetary policy easings begin to ebb.

Directive and Balance-of-Risks Language

(14) Presented below for the members' consideration is draft wording for

(1) the directive and (2) the “balance of risks” sentence that the Committee may want

to include in the press release issued after the meeting (not part of the directive).

(1) Directive Wording

The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial

conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth

in output.  To further its long-run objectives, the Committee in the

immediate future seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with

maintaining/INCREASING/REDUCING the federal funds rate at/TO

an average of around ___1-1/4 percent.

(2) “Balance of Risks” Sentence

(Not adopted at March meeting)

Against the background of its long-run goals of price stability and

sustainable economic growth and of the information currently available,

the Committee believes that the risks [ARE WEIGHTED MAINLY

TOWARD CONDITIONS THAT MAY GENERATE ECONOMIC

WEAKNESS]  [ARE BALANCED WITH RESPECT TO

PROSPECTS FOR BOTH GOALS] [ARE WEIGHTED MAINLY

TOWARD CONDITIONS THAT MAY  GENERATE

HEIGHTENED INFLATION PRESSURES] in the foreseeable future.
