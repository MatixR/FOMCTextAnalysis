Prefatory Note 

 
 

The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain. 
 

Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a redaction process that removed information obtained on a 
confidential basis.  All redacted passages are exempt from disclosure under applicable 
provisions of the Freedom of Information Act.    

 

                                                 
1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked 
and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not 
reliably recognized by the OCR process and were not checked or corrected by staff.

CLASS I - FOMC

MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Recent developments

(1) M2 grew at around a 24½ percent annual rate in February,

but is estimated to have decelerated considerably to about an 11½ percent

annual rate in March. To a degree, the reduced growth of M2 appears to

reflect a slowing in funds shifted into money market deposit accounts

(MMDAs) from sources outside M2.1/ In addition, however, growth of M2

appears to be "basically" slowing in March, as its nontransactions

component, abstracting from shifts, seems to be decelerating markedly.

(2) M3 grew at about a 13½ percent annual rate in February;

its growth, too, is estimated to have slowed markedly in March--to about

a 6½ percent annual rate. The level of M3 in March places it near the

upper end of the FOMC's annual target range of 6½ to 9½ percent. Because

depository institutions have responded to the strong net inflows into core

deposits in part by running off large CDs, this aggregate has been much

less affected by the introduction of the new instruments than M2.

(3) M1 advanced at a record annual rate of just above 22 percent

in February. Preliminary data indicate that growth in March remained

strong--at about a 16 percent annual rate--bringing this aggregate even

1/ The average weekly increase in MMDAs declined from $33 billion in
January to $17 billion in February, and to $10 billion in the first
half of March. About 15 percent of these funds are estimated to
have been shifted from outside of M2 in February and March, down
from roughly 20 percent in January. Such shifts likely boosted M2
growth in February by about 8 percentage points and may have
boosted M2 growth in March by only about 3½ percentage points.

further above its 4 to 8 percent longer-term range. With shifts into

super NOW accounts from outside of M1 in February and March estimated

to be comparatively small and roughly offset by transfers of funds

from M1 to MMDAs, the underlying strength in transactions deposits

apparently continues to be considerable. In addition, M1 growth has

been bolstered by unusually strong increases in currency throughout

the first quarter. The large increase in M1 during the first quarter

as a whole--14 percent at an annual rate on a quarter-over-quarter

basis--appears to represent a continuation of the upward shift in M1

demand (given income and interest rates) that developed last year. In

the first quarter, the velocity of M1 dropped by about 6 percent at an

annual rate.

(4) The debt of nonfinancial sectors is projected to have

increased over the first quarter at a rate near the lower end of FOMC's

8-1/2 to 11-1/2 percent range, and somewhat below the pace of the

fourth quarter. Private borrowing is estimated to have remained close

to the reduced fourth-quarter pace; although funds raised in credit

markets by the federal government declined a little, they continued

to account for nearly half of the total of such borrowing. Bolstered

by a sharp increase in inflows of funds as a result of aggressive

offerings of MMDAs, depository institutions are estimated to have

accounted for around 60 percent of net credit extended to domestic non-

financial sectors in the first quarter, up from an average of a little

over 30 percent in the last three years. Bank credit growth rose from

6-1/4 percent in the fourth quarter to around 10-1/2 percent in the



first, and loans and investments at thrift institutions apparently have

picked up as well. At banks, acquisition of Treasury securities is

estimated to have accounted for about half of the increase in their

assets. The greatly enlarged intermediation through depository institu-

tions last quarter was accompanied by substantial disinvestment of money

market mutual fund shares and a considerable slowing in direct acquisitions

of credit market instruments by private domestic nonfinancial sectors.

(5) Total and nonborrowed reserves declined at 14¼ and 12½

percent annual rates, respectively, in February after growing slowly in

January. Preliminary data indicate a modest rebound in growth for these

measures in March. The declines in total and nonborrowed reserves since

December mainly reflect reductions in required reserves because of

shifts out of savings and small time deposits into MMDAs and the run-

off of large CDs. The monetary base has grown much more strongly than

these reserve measures in each of the past three months, owing to the

rapid growth in currency. The level of adjustment plus seasonal borrowing

implied by the reserve paths was kept at $200 million throughout the

intermeeting period. Actual borrowing, however, has averaged about $390

million per week, reflecting such influences as unexpectedly strong

demands for excess reserves (apparently related at times to unusually

slow responses by banks to reserve requirement reductions) and misses

in projections of factors affecting reserves at the end of a statement

week (caused at times by computer and wire transfer problems).1/

(6) While borrowing ran higher than anticipated, free reserves

were generally positive, and the federal funds rate continued to fluctuate

1/ See appendix I for detailed data on weekly reserve paths.



around the 8 percent discount rate over most of the intermeeting period,

though trading was around 8 1/4 percent in the most recent statement week.

After declining in the weeks immediately following the FOMC meeting,

other short-term interest rates began rising in early March, reflecting

concerns that sustained rapid growth of the monetary aggregates had, at a

minimum, made a near-term discount rate cut much less likely. On balance,

short-term rates have risen as much as 35 basis points since the February

meeting. Long-term rates, on the other hand, have declined about 45 to

60 basis points over the intermeeting period, and stock prices have

increased further, partly in response to continued moderation in inflation

and favorable implications for the economy of the break in oil prices.

(7) The dollar has appreciated by about 1 1/2 percent on a weighted

average basis since the last Committee meeting. The dollar has declined

by 3/4 percent against the mark as the latter currency benefited from a

solid conservative party victory in the March general election, and has

remained about unchanged against the yen. However, it has risen by

about 5 percent against the French franc and a similar amount against the

pound.

. Short-term interest rates abroad declined

somewhat, on average, reflecting cuts in German, Swiss, and Dutch official

lending rates.



Prospective developments

(8) Alternative short-run specifications of the monetary

aggregates for the March to June period are shown in the table below,

along with federal funds rate ranges. (More detailed data for the

alternatives are shown in the charts and table on the following pages.

The quarterly interest rate path consistent with the staff's GNP pro-

jection is contained in Appendix II.)

(9) The alternatives are designed so that M2 over the second

quarter stays around or below the upper bound of the FOMC's 7 to 10 per-

cent target range (based on February-March). M2 under alternative A

would be just a bit above the upper end of the range by June, and

would be down within the range under alternatives B and C, as shown in

Chart 1. Under all three alternatives M3 would be at the top of, or

within, its longer-run range, but M1, though its growth is expected to

diminish in the months ahead, would remain well above its range by

June--as shown in Charts 2 and 3.

(10) The staff expects a further slowing of M2 growth as the

shifts to MMDAs from non-M2 assets moderate with the ebbing of the

initial stock adjustment to the new accounts and with the decline in

MMDA offering rates. We have assumed that M2 growth will be increased

by about 1 percentage point or a little more over the the March to June

1/
interval because of such shifts. - M3, which had been considerably

less distorted than M2 by new deposit instruments, is expected to

expand at a pace only somewhat slower than in the first quarter; CDs

are expected to stop running off, as depository institutions continue

to finance moderate expansion in credit demands and also further build

up holdings of U.S. Government securities, though at a slower pace than

in the first quarter.

(11) Partly because lagged effects of earlier market rate

declines have dissipated, we expect broad money growth to slow over the

months ahead (even abstracting from MMDA shifts). Nonetheless, judging

from recent behavior, we would expect demand to be sufficiently strong

so that an effort to bring M2 growth down to the pace of alternative C

might be associated with rising interest rates. However, a deceleration

to the pace of B or A might be accomplished with stable or declining

rates.

1/ Specifically, the staff is expecting that weekly total MMDA inflows
will slow from the about $10 billion average pace of recent weeks
to about $5 billion early in the second quarter and less than $2
billion by late in the quarter. By the end of June, we anticipate
a level of MMDAs of around $375 billion. For the March to June
interval staff assume that only 10 to 15 percent of MMDA growth
will reflect shifts from non-M2 assets.



(12) More clearly than in the case of M2, M1 growth basically

appears to be running strong (given income and interest rates). However,

all the alternatives assume a considerable slowing in M1 expansion over

the March to June period, as our models suggest. Even with the assumed

slowing, the velocity of M1 in the second quarter would still decline,

though by much less than in earlier quarters, rather than rise sub-

stantially as is typical of the early stages of a cyclical recovery.

(13) The debt of domestic nonfinancial sectors in the second

quarter is expected to grow at a 9 percent annual rate, remaining some-

what above the growth of GNP. Borrowing, seasonally adjusted, by both

the federal government and by private sectors is projected to strengthen

in the second quarter. The federal government will have to raise a sub-

stantial volume of funds in credit markets in a quarter when seasonal

tax inflows have frequently in the past allowed it to repay debt. The

increase in household borrowing is expected to be concentrated in the

mortgage area. In the business sector, with inventories no longer running

off, borrowing needs also will rise. With the shift to MMDAs largely

completed, the bank and thrift share of lending to nonfinancial sectors

is expected to decline from the extraordinary level of the first quarter,

but to remain above the average of the last few years.

(14) Alternative B contemplates a federal funds rate fluctuating

around the current 8-1/2 percent discount rate, assuming adjustment (includ-

ing seasonal) borrowing at the discount window of around $200 million. Total

and nonborrowed reserves can be expected to rise from March to June at

annual rates of 6 and 7-1/2 percent, respectively, after declining on



-10-

balance over the previous three-month period largely because of deposit

mix changes related to introduction of MMDAs. The monetary base is

expected to grow about as rapidly as in the first quarter.

(15) Other short-term interest rates may decline moderately

from current levels as the stability of the funds rate around the present

discount rate and slowing of growth in the aggregates reduce fears of a

near-term tightening of monetary policy. This also seems consistent

with greatly reduced net issuance of Treasury bills in the second quarter,

reflecting a seasonal reduction in cash needs. Longer-term interest rates

might also decline, if favorable market expectations generated by slower

money growth and incoming evidence of moderate economic activity over-

come continuing supply pressures. Treasury coupon offerings are expected

to remain about as large as in the first three months of 1983, and

businesses also can be expected to offer a fairly large volume of inter-

mediate- and long-term securities in an ongoing effort to improve balance

sheet structures.

(16) Alternative A, which calls for 10 percent M2 growth from

March to June, would probably be associated with a drop in the federal

funds rate to the 7 to 8 percent area. Adjustment borrowing of around

$150 to $200 million would be consistent with such a funds rate range if

the discount rate were cut to 8 percent. Or such a funds rate might

emerge, or be approached, if borrowing were dropped to the $50-100

million range at the current discount rate.

(17) Short-term interest rates may decline considerably under

alternative A, as market fears of any near-term tightening are allayed

and current dealer financing costs drop along with the funds rate. The



-11-

3-month bill rates might trade around 7½ percent, and the generally lower

short-term rates would lead to a further decline in the bank prime rate.

Longer-term rates may also decline, but the declines may be limited by

a resultant step-up in corporate bond offerings.

(18) Alternative C is assumed to involve a rise in the federal

funds rate to the 9 to 9½ percent area, and an increase in the level of

borrowing to the $500 to $700 million range. Short-term interest rates

would rise somewhat further, since the market would not appear to have

fully discounted such a tightening. The 3-month bill rate could rise to

around 9 percent and large CDs would probably be offered at 9½ percent

or higher, exerting upward pressure on the prime rate. Longer-term rates

would also rise, and the spread of the mortgage rate over the bond rate

may also widen, as lenders contemplated the cost impacts of rising deposit

rates, especially with such a large proportion of their deposits in the

form of MMDAs and MMCs. Higher U.S. interest rates would probably lead

to further upward pressure on dollar exchange rates.



-12-

Directive language

(19) Given below are two alternative drafts for the operational

paragraph of the directive. The first retains the general approach adopted

at the February meeting, but with the language updated to take account of

developments since that time, with M3 now apparently just above the upper

limit of its long-run range, and M2 starting just above its range. The

second is proposed in the event the Committee decides to return to specifi-

cation of numerical objectives for the monetary aggregates. This alternative

also includes language in brackets that might be considered, depending

on how or whether the Committee wishes to condition the Desk's response

to incoming data on the aggregates.

Alternative I - Existing Language

For the more immediate future, the Committee seeks to maintain

the existing degree of restraint on reserve positions. Lesser re-

straint would be acceptable in the context of appreciable slowing of

growth in the monetary aggregates [DEL: to or below] RELATIVE TO the paths

implied by the long-term ranges, taking account of the distortions

relating to the introduction of new accounts. The Chairman may call

for Committee consultation if it appears to the Manager for Domestic

Operations that pursuit of the monetary objectives and related reserve

paths during the period before the next meeting is likely to be

associated with a federal funds rate persistently outside a range

of [DEL: 6 to 10] ____ TO ____ percent.



-13-

Alternative II - Language Incorporating Numerical Objectives for Second

Quarter

In the short run, the Committee seeks restraint on reserves

consistent with a slowing from March to June in growth of M2 and M3

to annual rates of about ____ and ____ percent respectively. The

Committee anticipates that M1 growth at an annual rate of about

____ percent would be consistent with its objectives for the broader

aggregates. [The Committee agreed that somewhat faster monetary

growth would be tolerated if it appeared to be associated with

continuing distortions from growth of the new deposit accounts or

unusual demands for liquidity.] [Lesser restraint on reserves would

be acceptable in the context of a more pronounced slowing in the

growth of the aggregates.] The Chairman may call for Committee

consultation if it appears to the Manager for Domestic Operations

that pursuit of the monetary objectives and related reserve paths

during the period before the next meeting is likely to be associated

with a federal funds rate persistently outside a range of ____ to

____ percent.
