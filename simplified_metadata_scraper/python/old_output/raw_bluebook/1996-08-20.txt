MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Recent Developments

(1) By the time of the July 2-3 FOMC meeting, market

participants had mostly become convinced that no action to tighten

reserve market conditions would be taken at that meeting. As a

result, the decision to keep the federal funds rate at 5-1/4 percent

prompted only modest declines in rates at short maturities and no

reaction further along the yield curve. Maintaining the funds rate at

that intended level over the intermeeting period, however, proved

difficult at times in light of unpredictably high demand for reserves

at the end of July and in early August, and perhaps pressures spilling

over from the financing market. As a consequence, the federal funds

rate averaged a shade more than its intended level over the

intermeeting period.1

(2) Most market interest rates have declined 15 to 25 basis

points, on net, over the intermeeting period (chart). Rates rose

sharply in the days just after the July FOMC meeting as incoming data

were read by market participants as indicating that the economy was

straining its productive resources and pressures on labor costs were

mounting. Futures quotes (chart) indicated a presumption that the

funds rate would be hiked at the August FOMC meeting, and there was

even some market chatter that an intermeeting move was a distinct

possibility. While Chairman Greenspan's Humphrey-Hawkins' testimony

1. Reserve shortfalls--from the supply as well as the demand
side--were met in part by borrowing at the discount window, so that
adjustment plus seasonal borrowing averaged about $30 million over its
allowance in the four maintenance periods completed since the July
meeting. The allowance was raised twice, to $325 million, to reflect
the normal upsurge in seasonal borrowing at this time of year.

conveyed to the market the notion that inflation risks were clearly

tilted to the upside, it also raised the possibility that the economy

could settle into a sustainable growth path without policy action and

it flagged several upcoming data releases as important in assessing

that possibility. As those reports became available, they were seen,

by and large, to be pointing to a slowing in demand growth and only a

mild upturn in labor compensation, and a considerable decline in in-

terest rates ensued. Market participants have mostly discounted the

possibility of action at the upcoming FOMC meeting, and further-ahead

futures quotes seem consistent with high odds that policy would be on

hold for a considerable stretch. Yields on Treasury coupon securities

have declined 25 to 35 basis points since the Chairman's testimony.

While some of this decline probably reflects an easing of inflation

expectations, the sharp rebound in equity prices in recent weeks--

which were also helped by favorable earnings reports--and the easing

of the dollar in foreign exchange markets support the assessment that

much of the drop in interest rates represented a downward movement in

real rates. The decline, reflecting a reassessment of the path of

real rates needed to keep inflation pressures contained, likely

reversed only a fraction of the run-up in long-term real rates since

January.

(3) The dollar's foreign exchange value has decreased 1-1/4

percent on a weighted-average basis since the July FOMC meeting. The

dollar moved down 2-1/4 percent against the mark and 2 percent against

the yen. Japanese and German monetary policies remained on hold dur-

ing the period, and short-term interest rates in Japan and Germany

were little changed. Bond yields in Japan were also essentially un-

changed. Surprising the market by failing to reduce its RP rate,



Bundesbank officials stated that above-target money growth is still a

concern, although some of those officials apparently believe a further

easing might still be possible. Despite disappointed expectations

about German monetary policy, German bond yields decreased somewhat

during the period, possibly reflecting a reduction in inflation and

uncertainty premiums in German financial markets as doubts about the

implementation of European Monetary Union resurfaced.

The Desk did not intervene.

(4) The expansion of the monetary aggregates slowed more

abruptly in July than the staff had anticipated at the last FOMC meet-

ing. M2 grew at a 2-1/4 percent pace last month, down from a 5-1/2

percent rate in June, but still remained in the upper portion of its

annual range. Much of the weakness in July was accounted for by an

unexpected drop in demand deposits, which had posted unusually strong

growth in the first half of this year. Offsetting part of the recent

slowdown, currency growth has picked up some, apparently fueled by

shipments abroad. Contacts with currency shippers have indicated that

much of this cash is destined for Russia, but growing worldwide accep-

tance of the new hundred dollar bill also may have played a role.2

M2 apparently has not benefitted much from investors' recent skittish-

ness about long-term investments. Net inflows to stock and bond funds

fell off substantially in July, but little of that financial capital

2. M1 contracted at an 8-3/4 percent rate in July, but the initial
effects of new sweep activity accounts for about all of that decline.
Bolstered by strength in currency, the monetary base grew at a 7-1/2
percent rate last month and would have expanded at a 9-1/2 percent
rate absent sweeps.



appears to have been redirected toward money market mutual funds or

retail deposits.

(5) The weaker growth of M2 showed through to M3, which ex-

panded at a 3-3/4 percent rate in July, about a percentage point

slower than in the previous month. This slower growth opened a little

room between M3 and the upper end of its annual range. Bank funding

needs apparently were weak, with bank credit growing at only a 1 per-

cent rate in July. Banks ran off their securities holdings at a 6-1/2

percent pace, even as lending diminished. The growth rates of both

real estate and consumer loans edged lower, but the former seems to

have been pulled down by a step-up in the pace of securitization.

Banks continue to pull back from their aggressive stance in seeking

consumer loans: In a recent survey, about half of the banks said that

they tightened their standards for approving credit card applications

and about a quarter tightened standards for other consumer installment

loans.

(6) Data on credit flows for July and early August, apart

from those provided by commercial banks, are sparse. The available

information suggests that the expansion of debt of nonfederal sectors

has slowed in recent months. In the household sector, consumer credit

growth fell off to around a 8-3/4 percent rate in the second quarter,

and mortgage borrowing remained moderate. Net bond issuance by non-

financial firms in July was a touch above its second-quarter rate, but

most of this reflected lessened reliance on shorter-term borrowing.

Credit continues to be readily available to business borrowers, with

spreads in securities markets still narrow and banks continuing to

3. With inflows to capital market funds estimated to be weak and
equity prices, on average, lower, M2 plus stock and bond funds likely
was at a standstill in July, putting that measure about 7 percent
above its level in the fourth quarter of 1995.

offer accommodative loan terms. The runoff of the debt of state and

local governments persisted, with particularly hefty retirements

bunched at the beginning of July. Surprisingly strong tax inflows

allowed the Treasury to slash its borrowing in the second quarter, but

borrowing has since picked up. Overall, domestic nonfinancial debt

grew at a 4-3/4 percent pace in the second quarter. From the fourth

quarter to June, debt of the nonfinancial sectors expanded a 4-3/4

percent pace, putting the aggregate a tad below the midpoint of its

3 to 7 percent annual range.

Policy Alternatives

(7) Reports since the last FOMC meeting have suggested that,

on balance, aggregate measures of spending, production, and inflation

are coming in fairly close to staff projections. Wage and total labor

compensation figures, though, have seemed more clearly to point to an

acceleration in recent quarters. Even with economic expansion pro-

jected by the staff to slow to around the growth rate of potential

output over the next year and a half, resource utilization would re-

main high. Moreover, the just-passed federal minimum wage hike, not

previously assumed in the staff forecast, will add to future labor-

cost pressure on prices. As a result, the staff envisions that an

uptrend in core CPI inflation will become apparent over the coming

year, even after methodological improvements in that price measure.

The increase in the CPI for 1997 in the staff forecast would be a

little above the central tendency range of FOMC members in the

Humphrey-Hawkins' report, even though the real growth and unemployment

outcomes for 1997 would be consistent with the central tendencies for

these measures.

(8) Nonetheless, the Committee may well feel that it can

afford to wait, as in alternative B, for additional data to accumulate

to allow a more confident judgment concerning whether an underlying

process of rising inflation seems to be taking hold. Arguably, the

upturn in the compensation trend is not firmly established in a

statistical sense, leaving questions about the level of the NAIRU.

And even if wages have begun to accelerate, the profit share may be

sufficiently high to cushion the extent to which faster increases in

labor compensation are passed through to prices for a time. Even if

the staff assessment of emerging price pressures is confirmed, with



the economy still close to its potential, the pickup in inflation

would be gradual. Consequently, as long as a slowdown in real GDP

growth of the dimension foreseen by the staff still appears to be in

train, the case for an immediate policy tightening may not be seen as

compelling. While keeping policy on hold for a time in these cir-

cumstances might imply the need for a greater tightening later to

reverse the pickup in inflation, so long as the action were not post-

poned too long, a wrenching adjustment to output should be avoidable.

(9) The decision at this FOMC meeting to leave the policy

stance unchanged would accord with the current market consensus.

Still, the elimination of the small perceived chance of a tightening

at this FOMC meeting could cause interest rates to slip off, but only

a bit, and the exchange value of the dollar would remain around recent

levels. Over the next few weeks, when new information on the economy

will be relatively sparse, market interest rates probably would be

little changed. Subsequently, markets could be quite volatile in

response to the heavier flow of economic news, as participants sort

out its implications against the background of a Federal Reserve

characterized by Chairman Greenspan as "especially vigilant to in-

cipent inflation pressures." A partial retracing of the recent bond

market rally cannot be ruled out, if, consistent with the staff fore-

cast, incoming indicators suggest prospective inflation pressures.

(10) The Committee instead may wish to implement the 25 basis

point increase in the intended federal funds rate involved in alterna-

tive C. Especially in light of the recent low level of initial claims

and the upside potential for inventory stocking, the Committee may

question the staff forecast that economic activity is likely to down-

shift in the near term by enough to stabilize resource utilization.



Alternatively, even if the Committee does expect growth in real ag-

gregate demand soon to line up with that of potential output, it may

be troubled by the strains on resource availability and the uptrend in

core inflation embodied in the staff forecast. Particularly with the

upward pressure on prices from the minimum wage hike, a rise in the

nominal funds rate would be necessary at some point just to keep the

real rate from falling and thus the stance of policy from effectively

easing, unless the economy is appreciably weaker or output-price

tradeoffs considerably more favorable than the staff predicts. An

immediate tightening of 1/4 percentage point would increase the like-

lihood of holding the line against an upcreep in core inflation by

better ensuring an eventual relief of pressures on resources. Such a

tightening might be viewed as a fairly typical policy reaction to the

revision to the outlook since the Committee last eased at the end of

January. From the February monetary policy report to that in July,

the members' central tendencies for real GDP growth and CPI inflation

for 1996 were revised up by 1/2 and 1/4 points, respectively. In

light of these revisions and their implications for the longer-term

outlook, an immediate 25 basis point tightening, or perhaps one of 50

basis points, would be even more warranted if the Committee were seek-

ing to move policy over time to a stance restrictive enough to put a

downward tilt to the inflation rate in 1997 and beyond.

(11) Given the recent adjustment to their expectations for

monetary policy, market participants would be somewhat surprised by a

Committee decision to raise its intended federal funds rate by 25

basis points, as under alternative C. Other short-term market rates

would immediately adjust upward by a like amount. Because the likely



-10-

trajectory of short-term interest rates would be higher over the in-

termediate run than previously expected by the market, some increases

in longer-term interest rates and in the exchange value of the dollar

would occur. The size of the upward adjustments would depend in part

on whether the market saw the policy firming as an isolated event or

the first of a series of policy tightenings. Some market participants

apparently sense that the Committee may require extra evidence to

change direction in monetary policy, and hence might assume that

Committee members now see the potential inflationary situation as

having worsened appreciably and may be contemplating more than one

small move. In that regard, the announcement accompanying the policy

tightening presumably could provide some guidance to the market on

these matters.

(12) The debt of domestic nonfinancial sectors is projected

by the staff to expand at about a 4-1/4 percent rate over the second

half of this year, slower than the first-half pace and leaving growth

for the year a little below the midpoint of its annual range. The

moderation is concentrated in the household sector. Still-high fixed-

rate mortgage costs should begin to bite more into residential housing

activity and mortgage lending. Consumer credit should also decelerate

over the second half in keeping with diminished growth in outlays on

durables and a more cautious approach to such credit by both house-

holds and banks. Meanwhile, credit for business should remain avail-

able on favorable terms both from banks and in securities markets.

Business borrowing should continue to be moderate, supported by large

equity retirements and inventory restocking.

(13) The staff has revised down its projection of the growth

of M2 and M3 for this year under the unchanged funds rate of the



-11-

greenbook forecast by 1/4 percentage point each to 4-3/4 percent and

5-3/4 percent, respectively (see table). The slight downward revi-

sions primarily reflect weaker than expected money growth in July.

The recent lull in M2 growth is not expected to persist, however. For

one thing, demand deposits should return to a more normal pace of

expansion. More fundamentally, M2 growth will be buoyed by moderate

growth in nominal GDP while opportunity costs experience little fur-

ther change. The projected strengthening in M2 is expected to show

through to M3, but the pickup in M3 growth likely will be restrained

to a degree by a sluggish projected advance in bank credit. M1 will

continue to be depressed by additional sweeps; M1 adjusted for the

initial effects of such sweeps is projected to grow at a 6-1/2 percent

pace this year.4

Directive Language

(14) Presented below is draft wording for the operational

paragraph that includes the usual options for Committee consideration.

OPERATIONAL PARAGRAPH

In the implementation of policy for the immediate

future, the Committee seeks to DECREASE (SOMEWHAT/SLIGHTLY)/

maintain/INCREASE (SOMEWHAT/SLIGHTLY) the existing degree of

pressure on reserve positions. In the context of the Com-

mittee's long-run objectives for price stability and sus-

tainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration

to economic, financial, and monetary developments, somewhat

(SLIGHTLY) greater reserve restraint would (MIGHT) or

slightly (SOMEWHAT) lesser reserve restraint (WOULD) might

be acceptable in the intermeeting period. The contemplated

reserve conditions are expected to be consistent with moder-

ate growth in M2 and M3 over coming months.
