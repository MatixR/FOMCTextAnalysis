MONEY MARKET AND RESERVE RELATIONSHIPS

Recent developments

During the past four weeks money market conditions have

eased further, including declines in key short-term interest rates.

Intermediate and long-term bondyields, however, have risen considerably.

The reduction in discount rates on April 7 from 4 to 4 per cent had

its most immediate impact, as expected, on Federal funds and dealer

loan rates, on CD offering rates, and on Treasury bill yields. Since

the discount rate cut, Federal funds have averaged close to 4 per cent

and have often traded somewhat below the discount rate. Rates on new

dealer loans in New York have moved down into a 4-1/8 - 4 per cent

range.

In the bill market, the 3-month Treasury bill has declined

about 20 basis points to around 3.75 per cent from its level just

before the discount rate was cut. Longer-term bill rates have

registered smaller declines, and are currently 10 - 15 basis points

above the 3-month bill rate. This follows a sustained period when

longer-term bill rates were below or about equal to the 3-month

bill rate. The changes that have occurred within the structure of

bill rates are indicative of the shift in market attitudes away from

expectations of further rate declines toward a feeling that, with the

discount rate reduction accomplished and with business news appearing

more optimistic, rates may have eased about as much as is likely over

the near term.

CONFIDENTIAL (FR) -2- April 28, 1967.

Such a shift in market attitudes, in conjunction with the

continued large corporate calendar and the sizable U.S. Government

financing program, has had a pronounced influence on long-term markets.

Yields on new high grade corporate bonds and long-term U.S. Government

securities have risen 15 - 25 basis points since the discount rate was

cut. Yields on State and local government issues have also risen, and

dealer inventories of such securities have increased.

Banks have reduced rates on large denomination CD's in

line with reductions in other short-term rates, and outstanding CD's

have declined by almost $600 million over the tax period (measured

by the three weeks ending April 19). This decline is more than we

had expected; it apparently reflects a deliberate policy of banks

in light of continued rapid increases in other time and savings

deposits, the ready availability of Federal funds at reduced rates,

and the prospect of reduced loan demand following the mid-April tax

borrowing. On average in April, total time and savings deposits rose

at a 14.5 per cent annual rate accounting for the bulk of the 13.5

per cent rise in the bank credit proxy. (The rise would be about 1

percentage points less after including a decline on average in Euro-

dollar borrowings.)

Bank credit expansion moderated in the course of April.

From the week ending March 29 to the week ending April 26, the proxy

rose at a 9.5 per cent annual rate; bank credit outstanding is projected

to decline in the current statement week ending May 3 as U.S. Government

deposits begin to decline sharply.



CONFIDENTIAL (FR) -3- April 28, 1967.

U.S. Government deposits rose in April about in line with

earlier expectations and contributed to a 6 per cent annual rate of

decline in private demand deposits on average (and a 5 per cent rate

of decline in the money supply). The decline in such private deposits

was slightly greater than projected, as loan demands around the tax

period were relatively moderate despite the large accelerated tax

payments.

In general, money markets and banks accommodated tax

period churning with relative ease. This may have reflected not

only the availability and lower cost of reserves to banks but also

probably the partial use of capital market proceeds to finance tax

payments.

Nonborrowed reserves on average in April increased at a

7.5 per cent annual rate, sharply down from the previous month. There

was a decline in bank excess reserves, as the effects of the March

reserve requirement reductions apparently worked themselves through.

Member bank borrowings also declined in April, and the increase in

total reserves was even less than for nonborrowed on average during

the month.

During the past four weeks, free reserves averaged $210

million and borrowings averaged $150 million. During the previous

four weeks, free reserves had averaged $218 million and borrowings

$203 million.



CONFIDENTIAL (FR) -4- April 28, 1967.

Prospective developments

Maintenance of prevailing money market conditions over the

next three weeks would involve a Federal funds rate averaging 4 per

cent or a shade below and a 3-month bill rate fluctuating generally

in a 3.65 - 3.85 per cent range. Member bank borrowings are likely

to be in the $100 - $200 million area. Free reserves could vary

more widely, perhaps in a $150 to $300 million range, depending in

part on bank reserve management policies, on dealer financing needs

and reinvestment flows associated with the Treasury refunding, and the

need to maintain an "even keel" monetary posture.

Books will be open for the current Treasury refunding and

pre-refunding operation from May 1 through May 3, with settlement

date on May 15. The issues were attractively priced but, as of this

writing, their ultimate market reception is uncertain.

The yield outlook is even more uncertain in other capital

markets. Some observers are beginning to conclude that the recent

rise in long-term rates has been overdone, and that a minor bond

market rally is a possibility. But others point to the continuing

large supply of corporate, municipal, and Federal agency issues in

the market or in prospect and to expected large Treasury financing

in the second half and see the odds favoring some further yield rise.

On balance, it would seem that maintenance of prevailing money market

conditions could permit--but not ensure--a rally in the bond market.

Such a development would be less likely if the financing calendar were



CONFIDENTIAL (FR)

to expand further, or if money market conditions were permitted to

drift toward the tight end of the ranges specified above.

With an even keel maintained in the money market, growth

in nonborrowed reserves is likely to slow further in May on average.

Expansion in bank credit, as measured on a daily-average basis by

the proxy, may slow to an annual rate in the 1 - 4 per

cent range. With the March-April tax period passed, net business

loan demands in May are expected to be quite moderate. Projected

needs for inventory financing are small and--given the continuing

large corporate calendar and the sharp recent uptrend in use of the

commercial paper market--bank loan repayment may rise. Needs of

Government security dealers for bank financing will largely depend

on general interest in the refunding. If bank credit expansion in

May is in the range projected, the annual rate of increase in the

proxy over the 6 month December-May period would be around 11 per

cent (and 2 percentage points less after including the decline in

Euro-dollar borrowings).

The May projections allow for a sharp reversal of the April

rise in U.S. Government deposits, only partially offset by a rise

in private demand deposits. The money supply is currently projected

to rise in May on average at an annual rate of 8 - 10 per cent, bringing

the annual rate of growth over the December-May period to around 5

per cent.

April 28, 1967.



CONFIDENTIAL(FR) -6- April 28, 1967.

Time deposits are expected to show a somewhat slower growth

rate in May, perhaps in a 10 - 13 per cent range, if commercial banks

continue to exhibit only mild interest in increasing the volume of

outstanding CD's. However, it is possible that attractive yields

emerging in securities markets and additional indications of strong

economic expansion may encourage some banks to seek additional

investible funds. The rate of growth in other time and savings

deposits may moderate, especially if consumer spending continues to

pick up.
