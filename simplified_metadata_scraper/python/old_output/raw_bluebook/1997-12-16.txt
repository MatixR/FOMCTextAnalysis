Prefatory Note 

 
 

The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain. 
 

Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a redaction process that removed information obtained on a

1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked 
and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not

MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Recent Developments

(1) U.S. financial markets have settled down some over the intermeeting period,

but further turmoil in a number of foreign markets has engendered an underlying sense of

unease, and, on occasion, has left its imprint on trading and prices. Implied volatility

measures for both bond and equity markets have dropped back to levels prevailing before the

October disturbances, and, though share prices for companies with significant exposures to

Asian economies have been hit hard, broad measures of equity prices are mainly somewhat

higher (Chart 1). The wider yield spreads on some private securities that opened up in late

October have persisted, although they remain low by historical standards, and premiums paid

by Japanese banks for short-term dollar funding have increased, on net, during the

intermeeting period. Although data releases over the period, on balance, signaled stronger

economic activity than had been anticipated by most private analysts, yields on most Treasury

securities have declined somewhat. 1 Investors apparently have come to the view that, with

future U.S. exports to Asia restrained by slower growth in that region and a stronger dollar,

inflation news will continue to be favorable. The prices of Treasury securities were also

1. The widely anticipated decision to keep the Committee's intended federal funds rate at
5-1/2 percent in November elicited no market reaction, and the effective federal funds rate
generally has averaged close to the intended rate over the intermeeting period. The upward
trend in excess reserves evident in recent months has become more pronounced, and the Desk
raised the formal path allowance for excess reserves to $1.4 billion. Also during the period,
Yamaichi International (America), Inc., a primary dealer, ceased operations, along with its
Japanese parent. After winding down its positions in an orderly fashion, the dealer, at its
request, was dropped from the list of primary dealers on December 4.

buoyed by demands for safe assets on occasions when foreign problems seemed to intensify.

Adjusting for estimated year-end effects, federal funds futures rates suggest that investors

view the possibility of a change in monetary policy at this FOMC meeting as essentially nil.2

(2) Over 1997, nominal yields on long-term Treasury securities have fallen about

80 basis points; short-term Treasury bill rates have changed little, despite the March policy

tightening, which raised the intended federal funds rate by 25 basis points.3 As a result, the

Treasury yield curve has flattened considerably this year, with the spread between the yields

on the ten-year note and three-month bill now at a level last seen in January 1996, when

market participants expected a policy easing (Chart 2). Some of the flattening this year may

stem from reduced uncertainty about future long-term rates, perhaps reflecting less concern

about the small possibility of sharply higher inflation. Expected volatility of bond prices

inferred from options on futures contracts has declined appreciably on net this year. The real

federal funds rate has moved up over the year, but the increase has not been mirrored at

longer maturities. Real one-year interest rates, constructed as the nominal rate less the mean

of survey-based measures of inflation expectations at that maturity, have changed little, and

real rates at the ten-year maturity have been unchanged or somewhat lower, depending on the

measure used. Thus, the substantial decline in nominal long-term yields this year seems to

2. Domestic banks reportedly are paying premiums of 2 to 3 percentage points for federal
funds over the turn of the year, about in line with recent years.

3. Three- and six-month Treasury bill rates may have been held down by net paydowns of
those bills in three of the four quarters this year.

stem importantly from a drop in inflation expectations. As calculated, both one-year and ten-

year real rates are well within their ranges of the last two years.

(3) Most East Asian currencies--the main exceptions being those of China and

Hong Kong--have continued to depreciate against the dollar since the November FOMC

meeting. A weighted average of the exchange value of the dollar vis-a-vis the currencies of

ten (mostly Asian) developing economies, based on multilateral exports shares, has increased

about 11-1/2 percent over the intermeeting period (Chart 1). In Korea, the central bank

expended most of its foreign exchange reserves in the weeks before the country reached an

agreement with the IMF on December 3--as the government tried to avoid making

fundamental policy changes ahead of national presidential elections on December 18.

However, the willingness of the Korean government to implement the IMF program has been

called into question, contributing to a precipitous further decline in the won and doubts about

the ability of many Korean borrowers to meet their obligations--especially on foreign currency

debt. Many southeast Asian currencies have continued to weaken against the dollar over the

last month owing to the effects of the deteriorating Korean situation and investor

disappointment over the slow pace of reforms in those countries. Meanwhile, Russian

financial markets have sold off in recent weeks as the spillover from Asia has been

intensified by a scandal that has undermined the standing of key economic reformers.

(4) Relative to the currencies of the other G-10 countries, the dollar has

appreciated about 3-1/2 percent over the intermeeting period. Investors apparently have

revised upward their estimates of the effects of the financial market turmoil in Asian and

other emerging market economies, including those in Eastern Europe, on many of the G-10



-4-

countries. With inflation also continuing to be subdued in these industrial countries, prospects

for monetary tightening appear to have ebbed and interest rates generally have fallen. The

one major exception is Canada where concerns over the exchange value of the Canadian

dollar in an environment of continued strong growth led the Bank of Canada to raise its Bank

rate by 75 basis points over the intermeeting period. Downward pressures on interest and

dollar-exchange rates in Continental Europe also have been fostered by data releases

indicating that German economic growth has been moderate and by statements of European

central bank officials that interest rates will converge at the low end of the current spectrum

of European interest rates as monetary union approaches next year. Relative to the yen, the

dollar has appreciated 5-1/4 percent as worries about the Japanese economy have intensified

in the wake of widening domestic financial difficulties, punctuated by failures of a top-twenty

bank and a major securities firm. Nonetheless, long-term government bond yields in Japan

have been little changed on balance as investors have anticipated some fiscal stimulus and

government expenditures to resolve troubled financial institutions.

(5) Growth of the broad monetary aggregates accelerated in November. M2

advanced at a 6-3/4 percent pace, stronger than the projection in the previous bluebook, as

currency and liquid deposits surged. Preliminary data suggest a notable rise in U.S. currency

shipments to Russia, likely stemming from concerns related to the financial turmoil already

mentioned as well as the pending ruble redenomination. Liquid deposits have been boosted

by a pickup in mortgage refinancing activity and perhaps by robust income growth. M3

climbed at a 10-3/4 percent pace, well above the rate anticipated in the previous bluebook, as

bank credit growth strengthened and a few banks greatly stepped up their RP borrowing.



-5-

(6) From the fourth quarter of 1996 through November, M2 expanded at a

5-1/4 percent annual rate, placing this aggregate just above the upper bound of its 1 to 5

percent range.4 M2 growth was about 3/4 percentage point faster in 1997 than forecast by the

staff in February, despite the March policy tightening, reflecting stronger-than-projected

growth in nominal income. The staff had anticipated that M2 velocity would be unchanged in

1997; however, the staff now estimates that M2 velocity will tick up 3/4 percent, reflecting

the March policy firming and perhaps some ongoing portfolio allocations away from deposits

and into capital market instruments. Through November, M3 grew at an 8-1/2 percent rate in

1997, well above both the upper end of its 2 to 6 percent range and the staffs expectation in

February. Depository credit grew more rapidly than anticipated, and banks increased their

reliance on the liabilities in M3 and scaled back their borrowing from foreign offices to a

greater extent than envisioned by the staff. Inflows into institution-only money funds were

also well above expectations.

(7) Growth of domestic nonfinancial debt picked up a little in October, to a 5

percent rate. Net debt issuance by the federal government in recent months has been virtually

zero, on a seasonally adjusted basis, as the favorable budget picture has continued to hold

down financing needs. Borrowing by the household sector appears to have increased recently,

accounted for by a strengthening of consumer credit. Business borrowing has remained brisk

against the backdrop of continued ample availability of credit. From the fourth quarter of

4. Through November, M1 contracted at a 1-1/2 percent pace, but it expanded at a
6 percent rate after adjusting for the initial effects of retail sweep accounts. For 1997 as
a whole, the initial effects of new retail sweeps are projected to total about $85 billion, re-
ducing required reserves by about $7-3/4 billion and required reserve balances by about
$7-1/2 billion.



-6-

1996 through October, domestic nonfinancial debt increased at a 4-1/2 percent pace, placing

this aggregate somewhat below the midpoint of its 3 to 7 percent monitoring range. Debt

growth was about 1/2 percentage point slower than forecast by the staff in February. The

markedly weaker-than-projected expansion of federal debt was only partly offset by higher

than anticipated business borrowing. The slowing of household credit expansion was more

pronounced than anticipated.

Short-run Policy Alternatives

(8) The staff now reads the effect of intensifying strains in Asia and emerging

markets elsewhere as shaving enough from aggregate demand to hold the growth of GDP

over the next two years below that of its potential by more than in the last Greenbook, even

without any increase in the federal funds rate. The unemployment rate currently is slightly

lower than anticipated in the last forecast, but it is at a higher level at the end of the forecast

in 1999. Still, it remains low by historical standards throughout the forecast period. The

tight labor markets tend to put upward pressure on costs and prices. Those pressures are

tempered in the forecast relative to November by more ample industrial capacity than had

been anticipated and by faster growth in productivity in 1999. Over the near term, price

pressures also are damped by lower import prices and greater competition from foreign

producers, as the negative spending shock abroad is transmitted to the U.S. economy in part

through recent dollar appreciation. In addition, a decline in oil prices resulting from softer

Asian demand and a higher level of OPEC production helps to hold down inflation over the

next few quarters. By the second half of 1998, most of the effects of these favorable supply

shocks wear off and reported CPI inflation edges up; during 1999, the CPI increases about

2-1/4 percent-a little below the November forecast. (The acceleration relative to this year is

damped a few tenths by technical changes to the index.)

(9) While the economy continues to operate in the staff forecast at a level above

estimates of its potential, inflation remains quiescent for some time with no change in the

federal funds rate and stays relatively low over the forecast period. Even if the Committee is

concerned about the pressures on labor resources and finds the eventual uptrend in underlying



-9-

inflation unacceptable, it may be willing to keep the funds rate constant at this meeting, as

under Alternative B. In the staff forecast, the emergence of inflation has been pushed back

enough to suggest that delaying possible firming to await further information about global and

national economic developments runs minimal risk of embedding higher inflation and

inflation expectations in economic decisionmaking. The situation in a number of foreign

markets and economies remains quite unsettled, amplifying uncertainties about the extent of

the global retrenchment and its implications for the U.S. financial markets and economy. The

circumstances are sufficiently fluid that the Committee might see some possibility of a major

economic retrenchment, which could be exacerbated by a preemptive tightening of U.S.

monetary policy at this time. Under alternative B, the Committee would be buying time to

assess the extent to which developments abroad restrain aggregate demand, depress oil prices,

and support the dollar, as well as the degree to which recent momentum in the economy

might be sustained. More data might also be seen as especially useful in sorting out some of

the questions about underlying pressures on labor compensation and the extent to which

productivity behavior might damp the feed-through of higher compensation to profit margins

and prices.

(10) The markets expect no policy action over the next few months and would react

little, if at all, to the choice of alternative B. Apart from year-end effects, interest rates--

especially Treasury yields--should fluctuate close to recent lows over the intermeeting period.

Any tendency for rates to edge higher if foreign markets settle down should be offset by the

effects of more moderate economic growth, as in the staff forecast. Stock prices, however,

could drift down as economic reports begin to undermine the prospects for profits. In these



- 10-

circumstances, investors might reevaluate credit risk more generally, and spreads on bonds

could widen a touch further. The market for Treasury securities might, from time to time, be

buffeted by the fallout from developments in Asia. On occasion in recent weeks, the

Treasury market has weakened temporarily on the expectation of official and private sales of

Treasuries for purposes of addressing financial difficulties in Asia, and such events could well

recur over the weeks and months ahead. However, by themselves, such sales are unlikely to

have much lasting effect on dollar yields because they do not change the fundamental outlook

for prices and spending in the United States. Moreover, they should be easily absorbed into

markets benefiting from demands for safer assets and from reduced borrowing by Asian

financial institutions to the extent they repay dollar liabilities with the proceeds of their asset

sales.

(11) The 25 basis point tightening of Alternative C might be favored if the

Committee wanted to lean against the inflationary bias that may well be inherent in the

current and prospective tautness of labor markets. The further tightening of labor markets

this fall indicates that financial conditions prevailing over recent quarters have not been

sufficiently restrictive to hold economic growth to a sustainable pace. With real bond rates

no higher--and perhaps even a bit lower--than over the last few quarters, equity prices still

high, and monetary growth above expectations, only the rise in the dollar gives any hint of

the firmer financial conditions needed to damp strong aggregate demands. Against this

background, and with labor markets already extremely tight, the Committee might perceive

that counting on sufficient additional restraint coming from Asian developments runs an

unacceptable risk of a rebound in inflation in 1998 that would be disruptive to reverse.



- 11 -

(12) Indeed, the Committee may believe that fragile financial markets abroad may

be better positioned to weather a small tightening now than a larger increase later. A

tightening at this time would catch the markets by surprise and money market interest rates

and the prime rate would increase around 25 basis points. The impact on the longer end of

the market would depend on the degree to which market participants extrapolated further

tightening. Indeed, market participants might read action at this time, when financial markets

remain unsettled in many parts of the globe, as evidence that the Committee was quite

worried about unsustainable strength in the U.S. economy. At a minimum, market

participants would be unlikely to expect a reversal of the tightening for a considerable period,

and with the yield curve at this time arguably embodying no rise in short-term rates, interest

rates should ratchet noticeably higher, at least through the intermediate-term maturities. The

stock market likely would come under substantial selling pressure, especially if the move

were seen to be only the first in a series of tightenings.

(13) The 25 basis point easing of Alternative A might be favored if the Committee

were concerned that turmoil abroad might have an even greater impact on the U.S. economy

than the staff has built into the forecast. Given the favorable near-term inflation outlook for

the United States, the Committee might see insurance against such an outcome to be

relatively inexpensive in that the easing likely could be reversed, if that proved necessary,

before it boosted inflation and inflation expectations. Indeed, such an easing, by lowering

real dollar interest rates might contribute a little toward stabilizing foreign markets, helping to

forestall some repercussions in the United States. Moreover, the recent weakness in



- 12-

commodity prices and the shallow slope of the yield curve may support the view that real

short-term rates are high relative to their equilibrium.

(14) An easing at this time would also catch the market by surprise, and short-

term interest rates would decline by around the 25 basis point reduction in the funds rate.

The extent of the decline in longer-term rates would depend on whether market participants

were convinced that an easing could be sustained because of damped export demand and

lower import prices stemming from recent developments overseas or whether they viewed the

Committee to be taking undesirable inflation risks in order to stabilize global markets in the

short run. The dollar likely would give back some of its recent gains while stock prices

probably would rise, especially if investors were to see the easing as sustainable.

(15) Growth of the broad money aggregates is expected to moderate from the recent

rapid pace, as the expansion of nominal GDP slows in the first quarter. M2 growth is

projected at around a 4 percent annual pace over the November-to-March period under

alternative B, leaving this aggregate near the upper end of its provisional 1998 range.

Nonetheless, growth in M2 would again outpace that of nominal GDP in the first quarter of

1998, and M2 velocity would edge lower. M3 should slow by more than M2 over the

November-to-March period, as growth in bank credit ebbs and some of the shifting in the

composition of bank managed liabilities diminishes. Nonetheless, growth in M3--at a 6-1/2

percent rate--is expected to run above the upper end of its provisional range for 1998.

(16) Borrowing by domestic nonfinancial sectors other than the federal government

is projected to remain substantial in late 1997 and early 1998. Continued favorable

conditions in capital markets should tilt borrowing toward longer-term sources. Rising



- 13 -

external financing needs of corporations, as capital outlays continue to advance while internal

funds level out, will be boosting business credit demands. Household debt growth is expected

to stay around the moderate pace of the past year. Credit supply conditions should continue

to be generally accommodative as any reassessment of risk by business creditors should be

limited. Moreover, U.S. banks and other financial intermediaries appear sufficiently strong to

absorb losses stemming from their exposure to Asia and other emerging markets without

facing significant funding difficulties. The federal government should continue to be a light

borrower, as the deficit stays narrow. Growth in overall debt of domestic nonfinancial sectors

over the coming months is expected to average around 4-3/4 percent at an annual rate, a bit

below the midpoint of its provisional range for 1998.

NOTE: Weekly data for columns 1 through 12 are statement week averages. As of September 1997, data in column 6 are interpolated from data on certain commercial paper trades settled by the Depository Trust Company; prior
to that, they reflect an average of offering rates placed by several leading dealers. Columns 13 and 14 are 1-day quotes for Friday or Thursday, respectively, following the end of the statement week. Column 14 is the
Bond Buyer revenue index. Column 15 is the average contract rate on new commitments for fixed-rate mortgages (FRMs) with 80 percent loan-to-value ratios at major institutional lenders. Column 16 is the average initial
contract rate on new commitments for 1-year, adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) at major institutional lenders offering both FRMs and ARMs with the same number of discount points.
