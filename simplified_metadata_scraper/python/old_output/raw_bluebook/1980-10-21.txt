Prefatory Note 

 
 

The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain. 
 

Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a redaction process that removed information obtained on a 
confidential basis.  All redacted passages are exempt from disclosure under applicable 
provisions of the Freedom of Information Act.    

 

                                                 
1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked 
and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not 
reliably recognized by the OCR process and were not checked or corrected by staff.

Recent developments

(1) The growth of M-1A and M-1B continued rapid in September,

and was substantially above the pace targeted by the Committee for the

August to December period (as shown in the table below). In terms of their

September levels, M-1A was just above the midpoint and M-1B above the upper

end of their respective longer-run ranges. Despite the rapid expansion of

M-1B, a much slower growth for nontransactions accounts limited the

September rise in M-2 growth to an 8¼ percent annual rate, just below the

target pace for the last four months of the year. Nonetheless, the level

of M-2 in September remained above the upper end of its longer-run range,

reflecting the sharp growth in this aggregate over the late spring and

summer. With loan growth strong, both banks and thrifts stepped up their

issuance of managed liabilities, and M-3 grew more rapidly than M-2 in

September for the first time since the spring.

in member bank borrowings.1 / Although nonborrowed reserves (defined to

include special borrowing) declined slightly on average last month, total

reserves increased at the most rapid rate in ten years as banks borrowed

to obtain the reserves required by the surge of deposits. The increased

demand for reserves was associated with further upward pressure on the

federal funds rate, which was intensified by the increase in the discount

rate from 10 to 11 percent announced on September 25. Federal funds,

which were generally trading in the 10½ to 11 percent area at the time of

the September Committee meeting, most recently have been trading in the 12½

to 13 percent zone.

1/ See Appendix I for the pattern of reserve targets over the intermeeting

period.



(3) Other short-term interest rates also moved up sharply in

late September, but these increases were pared in early October as the

growth of the monetary aggregates slowed and at least some measures of

inflation moderated. On balance, short-term rates are presently about ½

to 1½ percentage points higher than their mid-September levels, with the

largest increases in private short-term rates. At current levels, short-

term interest rates have retraced roughly half of the decline from their

spring peaks.

(4) Bond yields also fluctuated widely during recent weeks,

but on balance have shown little net change since the last Committee meeting.

At current levels they have retraced almost two-thirds to three-quarters of

their declines during the spring. The high level of bond yields has continued

to deter new corporate offerings and to encourage a shift into shorter

maturity borrowing by businesses. The Treasury sold a $1.5 billion 15-year

bond in early October, all for new money, and raised another $2.4 billion

in coupon offerings with additions to its regular 2- and 4-year notes

auctioned in late September.

(5) Following several months of weakness, business loans at

banks expanded rapidly in August and again in September. Even with

another contraction in outstanding nonfinancial commercial paper last month,

owing in part to more competitive pricing of short-term loans by banks,

total short- and intermediate-term business borrowing was much larger in

August and September than in earlier months. This apparently reflects both

the strengthening in economic activity and some rate-induced shift in

borrowing out of capital markets. Other lending at commercial banks about

maintained its August pace. At thrift institutions it is reported that

the demand for mortgage commitments has fallen off in recent weeks as mort-

gage rates increased sharply.



-4-

(6) The foreign exchange value of the dollar has risen by about

1 percent on a weighted average basis since the last Committee meeting,

reflecting a relative increase in short-term U.S. interest rates over this

period, and the further indication of a strengthening of the U.S. trade

balance. The dollar's strength against the DM and other Continental

currencies was partially offset by a decline against the yen and a small

decline against sterling, currencies that have been quite strong generally.

. The United States sold about $1 billion, mainly

to acquire DM used to repay swap drawings and to add to balances.

rates of change, in percent, for selected monetary and financial flows over

Prospective developments

(8) Shown below for Committee consideration are alternative

sets of monetary aggregate targets for the fourth quarter. Alternative A

retains the Committee's September target of a 4 percent annual growth rate

for M-1A over the last four months of the year. Given September growth,

this implies M-1A expansion from September to December at an annual rate

of 1¼ percent, as shown in the upper panel of the table. Alternative B

is designed to achieve the 4¾ percent midpoint of the Committee's QIV '79

to QIV '80 range for M-1A, which implies growth over the last three months

of 1980 of this aggregate at an annual rate more than 2 percentage points

faster than under alternative A. The lower panel of the table shows growth

for the two alternatives on a quarterly average basis. Associated federal

funds rate ranges for the intermeeting period are also shown. (Detailed

and longer-run data for the monetary aggregates--including implied growth

for the one year QIV '79 to QIV '80 period--are contained in the tables on

the following two pages.)

NOTE: The following annual rates of growth in bank credit for the year and for the
quarters are expected under alternative A: year 1980, 6t; QI, 9k; QII, -k;
QIII, 61; QIV, 101. Only minor variations in growth rates would be expected
under alternative B.



(9) The relationships of the September-to-December targets to

the Committee's longer-run ranges are depicted in the charts on the following

pages. Under alternative A, M-1A growth would be somewhat below the mid-

point of its longer-run range, but the staff believes that in the fourth

quarter M-1B would be at, and M-2 slightly above, their respective longer-

run upper bounds. Under alternative B, both M-1B and M-2 would exceed their

longer-run upper bounds, though differences from the one-year growth rates

implied by alternative A are slight because of the short time period

remaining in the year. Under both alternatives, M-3 is expected to be a

shade below the upper end of its longer-run range.

(10) Under either of the alternatives, the monthly growth rates

in M-1A over the last three months of the year would represent a substantial

slowing from the third quarter pace. There are reasons to believe that

considerably slower growth could be achieved without strong upward interest

rate pressures. Even with the staff's projection of rapid growth in

nominal GNP for the current quarter, much of the money needed to conduct

the expanded transactions of this quarter may already be in the hands of

the public due to rapid growth of money late in the third quarter. In

addition, the 4½ to 5½ percentage point increase in short-term interest

rates that has occurred since June is likely to be restraining the quantity

of money demanded relative to income in the fourth quarter.

(11) The growth of M-1A for September to December under

alternative A is so low, however, that it may be expected to be associated

with further, relatively moderate,upward interest rate pressures in the

fourth quarter.1/ To achieve the specifications for the aggregates of

alternative A, total reserves would probably have to remain about unchanged

from September to December and, given the near-term pattern of growth,

expand at only about a 1 percent rate from September to November.2/ Assuming

adjustment borrowing of about $1½ billion, nonborrowed reserves would be

expected to decline at about a 3 percent annual rate from September to

November. Such borrowing is likely to be reflected in a federal funds rate

in the 13 to 14 percent area, given the present 11 percent discount rate.

(12) The higher federal funds rate and increased member bank

borrowing likely to be associated with alternative A would probably be

accompanied by an upward adjustment in both short- and long-term market

interest rates. Upward rate pressures would be intensified by the need to

finance a substantial Treasury deficit in prospect for the fourth quarter.

However, the pressures on rates could abate as the quarter progresses. A

rising level of long-term yields is likely to inhibit further the pace of

new corporate and municipal bond offerings. And if signs of a weakening

in economic activity emerge, as would be consistent with the staff's GNP

projections, expectations of future rate declines would become more prevalent

and influence the actual market rate structure.

(13) Under alternative B there is less chance that interest

rates will rise in the near term. To achieve the aggregates specified

1/ Appendix II displays the quarterly interest rate and monetary aggregates
pattern underlying alternative A and the staff's GNP projection for 1981,
contained in the current Greenbook.

2/ Effective with the statement week beginning November 13--the last week

of the forthcoming intermeeting period--the phase-down of required reserves
will begin for member banks, as will the phase-in for nonmember depository
institutions. The targeted reserve growth rates in the text are cal-

culated so as to eliminate the discontinuity from the change in reserve

requirements.



-11-

for this alternative, total reserves would have to expand at a 2¼ percent

annual rate from September to November. Assuming adjustment borrowing

of $1¼ billion, about the same as the September average, nonborrowed

reserves would expand at only about a 1¾ percent rate. The federal funds

rate is likely to remain within its recent 12½ to 13 percent zone. Under

such circumstances, other market rates would likely fluctuate around current

levels.

(14) Even with no further rise in most market rates, the rate

on new home mortgage commitments, now about 13¾ percent, would be expected

to edge up further in the weeks ahead as such rates continue to adjust with

a lag to the higher level of interest rates generally. Owing in part to

the adjustment in MMC and SSC ceiling rates last spring, disintermediation

pressures at depository institutions are likely to be less than at similar

interest rates last winter. Even so, the expected level of mortgage

rates is likely to damp housing demand and mortgage borrowing. While

borrowers may have grown more accustomed to the higher nominal mortgage

rates, monthly housing payments represent a substantial barrier to many

potential home buyers.

(15) Under both alternatives A and B the non-transaction component

of M-2 is expected to continue increasing at a moderate rate. A turn-

around in MMMF growth is expected as their portfolio yields catch up with

short-term market rates. However, flows into small denomination time

and savings deposits may be somewhat weaker as an acceleration of time

deposits might not fully offset the slower growth, and possible outflows,

of savings accounts that is expected at the sustained higher level of market

rates in the fourth quarter. With slower demand and small denomination

time and savings deposit growth, both banks and thrifts are expected to



-12-

continue to place reliance on managed liabilities--especially large CD's--

to finance their portfolio growth. Bank credit growth is expected to

remain relatively large over the balance of the year, though slowing from

the unusually rapid pace of the past two months. The projected increase

in bank credit will place this aggregate in the fourth quarter at a level

in the lower half of its longer-run range.



-13-

Directive language

(16) Given below are suggested operational paragraphs for

the directive consistent with the form of the directive adopted at

recent meetings. The language calls for expansion of reserve aggregates

at a pace consistent with the desired rate of monetary growth over the

last three months of the year, provided that the weekly average federal

funds rate remains within a specified range. The specifications adopted

at the September meeting are shown in strike-through form.

In the short run, the Committee seeks expansion of reserve

aggregates consistent with growth of M-1A, M-1B, and M-2 over the

[DEL: August] SEPTEMBER to December period at annual rates of about [DEL: 4]

percent, [DEL: 6½] ____ percent, and [DEL: 8½] ____ percent respectively, provided

that in the period before the next regular meeting the weekly average

federal funds rate remains within a range of [DEL: 8-to-14] ____ TO ____

percent.

If it appears during the period before the next meeting that

the constraint on the federal funds rate is inconsistent with the

objective for the expansion of reserves, the Manager for Domestic

Operations is promptly to notify the Chairman, who will then decide

whether the situation calls for supplementary instructions from the

Committee.

NOTE: These rate projections are based on the assumption that M-A

will grow 4-1/2 percent in 1980 (consistent with Bluebook alternative A),

and 4-1/4 percent in 1981 abstracting from the impact of nationwide NOW/ATS

accounts. Such growth would imply M-1A velocity increases in the two

years of 3-1/2 and 5-1/2 percent, respectively. The Board's quarterly

econometric model indicates that historical money demand relationships

would require almost 3-1/2 percentage points greater growth of M-1A

in 1981 to achieve the GNP and interest rates in the staff's judgmental

Greenbook projection. Thus, these interest rate projections assume a

further so-called downward shift in money demand as judged from the

prediction error in the Board's model.
