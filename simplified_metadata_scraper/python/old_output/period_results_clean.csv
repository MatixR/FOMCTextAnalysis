  But markets might read an announcement along the lines of Alternative A as an indication that the Committee is willing to forego a medium-term moderation in inflation in order to sustain economic growth
  Especially if Friday’s inflation report proves markedly higher than expected, the Committee may be less confident than the staff that core inflation will decline from its uncomfortably high level with no further increase in the federal funds rate, inclining members toward the quarter-point policy firming of Alternative C

 (15) The growth of M2, M3, and debt through June would be little affected by either the easing or tightening of reserve conditions under alternatives A or C
 If the lower funds rate of alternative A is maintained through year-end, growth of M2 for the year could be expected to come in around 4 percent
 If alternative C is adopted and the higher rates maintained, a 3 percent annual pace for M2 would be more likely

 THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE C If policymakers are confident that a sustainable economic recovery is now under way and see substantial upside risks to the medium-term inflation outlook in the absence of appropriate monetary policy adjustments, then the Committee might choose to issue a statement suggesting a somewhat shorter period over which monetary conditions are likely to remain extraordinarily accommodative, as in Alternative C

  In contrast, Alternative C´ states that the Federal Reserve will be redeeming all maturing Treasury securities and points to the possibility that gradual asset sales could commence fairly To the extent that inflation outcomes are seen as linked mainly to expected inflation rather than to resource slack, Committee participants may view the level of forward inflation compensation (which is at the high end of its historical range) and the substantial degree of dispersion in professional forecasters’ longer-run inflation projections as worrisome indicators that inflation expectations may not be anchored very firmly
   By contrast, the phrase “at least until the end of the second quarter” in Alternative C may  be seen as indicating that the Committee’s expectation of exceptionally low rates extends  only a few more months while at the same time suggesting that the Committee sees the  likelihood of policy firming within that interval as quite low

 The statement suggested for Alternative B begins by noting that recent information indicates that the economy has continued to contract and that, although the outlook has improved modestly, economic activity is likely to remain weak for a time
  If so, Committee members may want to adopt a slightly different statement, such as the one suggested under Alternative B´
  This statement is identical to the one for Alternative B, except that it adds two sentences in the middle of the third paragraph to specify that the Committee expects that the Federal Reserve’s holdings of Treasury and agency securities will increase at an average pace of about $160 billion per month over the reminder of 2009, which would be equivalent to an average monthly growth rate of around 20 percent from the end of March through the end of the year
  Accordingly, the market reaction to the release of a statement such as that suggested for Alternatives B or B´ should be muted
 THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE A If the Committee is concerned that the near-term outlook for economic activity might be worse than that presented in the staff forecast and that the subsequent recovery might be unduly sluggish, it may prefer to apply additional monetary stimulus by expanding its purchases of long-term assets at this meeting, along the lines of Alternative A
 The first paragraph of the statement that accompanies Alternative A is similar to the one for Alternative B, but its description of the economic outlook is more downbeat
  The rest of the statement is identical to that for Alternative B, including language to communicate the possibility of future adjustments to the timing and overall amounts of purchases of long-term assets in light of the evolving economic outlook and financial market conditions, the maintenance of the current range for the federal funds target rate, the expectation that short-term rates will remain exceptionally low for an extended period, and the references to other liquidity programs and the Committee’s intention to monitor the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet carefully
 Since market participants reportedly see only small odds that the Committee will announce a further expansion of its securities purchases at this meeting, it is likely that asset prices would move substantially following the release of a statement like that accompanying Alternative A
  Even though Alternative A more than doubles the quantity of Treasury purchases announced in March, the immediate response of Treasury and corporate yields may be substantially smaller than the one observed after the release of the March statement because that statement also announced large increases in the purchases of agency securities

 Very short-term rates might thus increase slightly under alternative D
 The behavior of rates on instruments of a few months' maturity or longer would depend importantly on whether the market interpreted the larger increase of alternative D as indicating a steeper trajectory of future policy actions, and perhaps the need for greater cumulative tightening
 Bond yields could still back up somewhat in the aftermath of an announce- ment of the Federal Reserve's choice of alternative D, but these other influences should limit any increase and work to reduce yields over time
 (13) The case for increasing the intended federal funds rate only 25 basis points as under alternative C would seem to hinge on the judgment that financial market participants have exaggerated the like- ly strength of future spending relative to the economy's potential and hence of prospective inflation pressures
 (14) The case for standing pat, alternative B, is a more extreme version of the rationale for alternative C: In this case, the market assessment, and even that of the staff, of the strength of aggregate demand would be judged to be seriously off the mark, perhaps because the rise in long-term rates, along with the decline in house- hold wealth, will have a more significant restraining influence on aggregate demand
 Choice of alternative B would come as a consider- able surprise--and disappointment--to financial markets; very short- term interest rates would be likely to fall appreciably, but this alternative risks a significant sell-off in the bond market before weakness in aggregate demand becomes apparent

  Apart from updating the description of the current economic situation, the announcement associated with Alternative B is little changed from that issued after the May meeting
  The announcement accompanying Alternative A would indicate that policy accommodation had been substantially reduced and would hint at less tightening going forward
  Under Alternative C, the Committee would raise the federal funds rate 50 basis points at this meeting, eliminate all forward-looking language, and make other significant changes to the announcement

  In this case, the FOMC may be attracted to Alternative A’s combination of a 25-basis-point hike in the funds rate at this meeting and statement wording that hints that the Committee could soon pause, at least for a time, in its process of policy firming
 (17) The draft statement associated with Alternative A could be explicit that “The Committee believes that the degree of monetary policy accommodation has been substantially reduced
  Accordingly, a statement employing the draft wording shown in Alternative A would likely produce a noticeable downward shift in money market futures quotes, a rally in bond and equity markets, and some depreciation in the foreign exchange value of the dollar
 (19) If the Committee, by contrast, has become more concerned about the potential for an upcreep in inflation in response to developments over the intermeeting period, then it may favor the 50-basis-point increase in the federal funds rate of Alternative C

 (21) With nary a hint heretofore of an upshift in the pace of policy tightening, market participants would be shocked by the combination of a 50-basis-point increase in the funds rate at this meeting and the announcement suggested for Alternative C

 Thus, if funds continue to trade around the prevailing 11-3/8 percent--the midpoint of the alternative B range--both short- and long-term market rates could decline
 With the Federal funds rate unchanged and no significant decline expected in other money market rates, adoption of Alternative B should in itself have no substantial impact on the value of the dollar in exchange markets

 The anticipated decline in interest rates under alternative A is likely to be associated with only a slight easing of mortgage markets, especially since short-term interest rates would not be expected to decline sufficiently to restore the differential on MMC's favoring thrift institutions

  As incorporated in the third paragraph of Alternative A, the Committee could explicitly state that it anticipates that short-term interest rates will remain low for some time
  To mitigate this concern, the Committee could phrase the commitment in implicitly conditional terms by indicating its anticipation that “weak economic conditions are likely to warrant federal funds rates near zero for some time,” as suggested in the statement accompanying Alternative A
 (32) The statement suggested for Alternative A begins by acknowledging the further weakening of the outlook for economic activity rather than with a sentence about the federal funds rate
 (34) If the Committee shares the staff view that the economic outlook has deteriorated markedly and thinks that, given the circumstances, moving the federal funds rate near the zero bound on nominal interest rates is desirable, but it wants to continue to provide an explicit target for the federal funds rate, then it might choose to establish a target range of 0 to ¼ percent as in Alternative B
  As in Alternative A, the Committee may also be concerned that the sharp contraction in economic activity and the steep declines in the prices of energy and other commodities may cause inflation to fall to an uncomfortably low level

  The paragraph on inflation reiterates, as in October, that the Committee expects inflation to moderate because of the weaker economic outlook and the decline in the prices of energy and other commodities, but also, as in Alternatives A and B, that there are risks that inflation will fall to rates below those that would best foster economic growth and price stability

 (44) The rationale portion of the statement accompanying Alternative D acknowledges that the pace of economic activity appears to have slowed further and that the near-term outlook has deteriorated
  The language on inflation remains unchanged from the October meeting, and the last paragraph acknowledges, as in Alternative C, that federal funds may continue to trade below the target for some time
  As noted earlier, the proposed statement for Alternatives C and D acknowledge that the same will likely be true in the future, at least so long as the amount of excess reserves in the system remains elevated

  If it were to choose Alternative C, the Committee may also want to direct the Desk to purchase $100 billion in housing-related GSE debt and up to $500 billion in agency-guaranteed MBS, as already announced, and to do so by the end of the second quarter of next year to provide a more specific time frame than the “several quarters” indicated in the November 25 press release
  Such a directive is not included under Alternative D because if the Committee were optimistic enough about the outlook to select that alternative, it might not want the desk to complete the full amount of the announced (50) Under Alternative B, the Committee would direct the Desk to seek conditions in reserve markets consistent with federal funds trading in a range of 0 to ¼ percent

 At one limit, (alternative A), we have shown an expansion in monetary aggregates that involves essentially no change between now and the first quarter of 1973 in money market conditions from those recently prevailing
 At the other limit (alternative D), we have shown an M1 path under which growth is curtailed to a 6 per cent annual rate by the first quarter of next year; this path implies a full percentage point rise in the Federal fund rate between now and the next meeting
 Alternative B and C are two, and they involve both a more gradual slowing in the monetary aggregate and a more gradual tightening of money market con- (8) For each of the four alternatives noted above, the following table shows RPD growth rates and associated money market conditions that might be used as operating targets between now and the next meeting of the Committee
 7-1/2 6-3/4 6-1/2 6 (12) Under alternative A, the Committee would be aiming at a constellation of reserve and money market conditions--essentially involving no change through the first quarter of '73 in money market conditions from those prevailing on average in the past few weeks--that would reduce M1 growth only modestly from the rapid 10-1/2 per cent rate expected in the third quarter
 But by the end of the first quarter, operations under alternative A would probably have set in train forces leading to quite rapid M1 growth as 1973 progresses, assuming the rate of expansion in nominal GNP remains strong
 (13) The monetary aggregates under alternative B and C are con- sistent with progressive firming in reserve and money market conditions over the months ahead; however, alternative B moves in this direction more gradually than alternative C
 (14) Alternative D sets a path which is expected to result in a prompt upward move of interest rates
 Key developments affecting these aggregates are: (a) a slowing in the growth of time deposits other than large CD's in reflection of recent rises in market interest rates and, particularly in the cases of alternatives C and D, of further rises; and (b) continued sizable demand by banks for large CD funds associated with sustained strong loan demand
 A rise in the Federal funds rate to somewhat above 5 per cent, as contemplated in alternatives B or C, would very likely lead to further upward adjustments in short-term rates, with the 3-month bill rate moving up in a 4-3/4--5-1/2 per cent range
 Short rate increases would be greater under alternative C than under B, and the probability of reviving expectations of a discount rate increase would also be commensurately greater
 Upward market rate adjustments would, of course, be quite sharp under alternative D

 Alternative B indicates that the economic conditions on which the Committee’s anticipation of extraordinarily low interest rates is based are the low rates of resource utilization, subdued inflation, and stable inflation expectations that are expected to prevail over an extended period
  On the current trajectory, agency debt purchases will not reach the previously stated maximum, and the Committee may want to indicate that these purchases are likely to total $175 billion, as in Alternative B
  These factors could include the level of resource utilization, inflation, and inflation expectations, as in Alternative B
 A statement such as that suggested for Alternative B would be close to market expectations in terms of the LSAPs and federal funds rate target, but the change in forward guidance suggesting that resource utilization will be a factor in the Committee’s decisions regarding the stance of policy might be viewed as suggesting a longer period of very low interest rates than currently anticipated
  On average, agency debt traders now expect purchases of agency debt to reach a level near their previously stated maximum and higher than the $175 billion in Alternative B
  All in all, it seems likely that a statement along the lines of Alternative B would have only muted effects on most interest rates, equity prices, and the foreign exchange value of the dollar, October 29, 2009 Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 37 of 77 6 A possible subsequent step in preparing the public and markets for the  normalization of policy would be to include in the statement a description of the  tools that would be used to drain excess reserves or neutralize their effects on  broader measures of money and credit, and thereby on economic growth and  inflation
 THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE C If policymakers view the continued accumulation of positive data on spending as pointing to more underlying momentum in the recovery than they previously anticipated and are more concerned than the staff about the inflation outlook, they might choose to trim the size of the LSAPs and to adjust the language regarding the anticipated period over which the funds rate is likely to remain low, as in Alternative C
  Given the amounts purchased to date, the smaller quantities specified in Alternative C would allow for an earlier conclusion of the program—the end of January 2010 instead of the end of the first quarter— while still permitting the purchases to be tapered
”6 Participants might prefer Alternative C if they viewed the improvement in financial market conditions and economic activity in recent months as October 29, 2009 Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 38 of 77 suggesting that less monetary policy support from the Federal Reserve is required and, given the increase in activity in the housing sector in recent months, that a reduction in the maximum amount of purchases of mortgage- related assets, in particular, could be appropriate
  Indeed, Alternative C omits reference to resource utilization
 The adoption of Alternative C would certainly surprise market participants
  The release of a statement along the lines of Alternative C would likely cause short- and intermediate-term interest rates to rise sharply, and equity prices to drop, while the foreign exchange value of the dollar would probably rise
  The Committee might conclude that an effective way to provide such stimulus would be to expand the amount of agency MBS purchases and to extend the timeframe for October 29, 2009 Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 41 of 77 conducting agency MBS and agency debt transactions (thereby allowing a higher amount of agency debt to be bought without causing market disruption), as in Alternative A
 Expanding the amount of purchases of agency debt beyond $200 billion could generate significant distortions in the market for those securities, so this is not proposed in Alternative A
 An announcement along the lines of Alternative A would come as a considerable surprise to market participants
  The second entry includes key language from the draft statements for Alternatives A, B, and C in this Bluebook
  As noted above, Alternatives A and B change the forward guidance by being more specific about the economic conditions that the Committee anticipates will warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period

1/ (8) Under alternative B growth in M-2 over June-July would be expected to pick up somewhat, due mainly to the anticipated strengthening in M-1
 (10) Given this background, and assuming that Federal funds continue to trade at around 5-3/8 per cent as contemplated under alternative B, it seems probable that short-term rates will remain close to current levels in the near term
 (12) The staff projections suggest that under alternative B the Federal funds rate would have to advance to an average of about 6 per cent in the first quarter of next year if M-1 growth in the QI '77- QI '78 period is to be held near the mid-point of the Committee's 4 -6 per cent range
 Inflows of interest-bearing deposits are still expected to slow sufficiently to keep growth in M-2 and M-3 in the lower part of their respective one-year (13) The alternative C specifications involve an increase of the funds rate over the next few weeks to the mid-point of a 5½-6½ per cent range
1/ (14) The immediate tightening of the money market under alternative C would tend to lessen the degree of restraint that would be needed later to achieve growth in M-1 over the QI '77-QI '78 period near the mid-point of the Committee's one-year range
 Because short-term market interest rates also would be expected to be lower than under alternative B or A, banks and thrift institutions should be able to maintain stronger inflows of interest-bearing deposits at that time
 Although growth in M-2 and M-3 would consequently be stronger in late 1977 and early 1978 than under the other alternatives, even under alternative C the growth rates projected for M-2 and M-3 over the year ending QI '78 are in the lower part of their respective (15) An easing of the Federal funds rate over the near term to the mid-point of a 4½ to 5¼ per cent range--as called for under alternative A--and the associated decline in short-term rates might well be accompanied, at least temporarily, by significant declines in 1/ From July to October 1973 interest ceilings were removed on time deposits with minimum denominations of $1,000 and maturities of at least four years
 In order to achieve growth rates in M-1 at the mid-point of the Committee's one-year range, however, the Federal funds rate would have to begin to rise relatively soon and to reach a level above those envisioned under alternatives B and C
 Thus, under alternative A, the Federal funds rate would be expected to average around 7¼ per cent in the first quarter of 1978
 As suggested below, the particular language needed in the opening lines of the money market formulation would depend on the specific conditions sought; the three alternatives shown--calling, respectively, for somewhat easier, prevail- ing, and somewhat firmer money market conditions--are intended to be associated with the specifications discussed in the preceding section under alternatives A, B, and C",0,1977-06-21,3,[]

5 (8) Alternative A maintains money market conditions in a range around the average level of recent weeks; in the last few business days the Desk has been aiming at a rate around the upper end of that range
 The alternative A money market conditions would seem most likely to be associated with around a 10 per cent annual rate of growth in M1 over the third quarter
 Alternatives B and C provide for more scope to vary money market conditions in an effort to reduce rates of growth in the monetary aggregates
 Indeed, under alternative C, little or no growth in M 1 would be expected in the fourth quarter; and alternative B, if maintained, might provide a growth rate of only modest proportions
 Of course, to the extent money market conditions tighten further (as under alternatives B and C) and this is communicated to the broader structure of market yields, relatively more slowing of expansion in consumer-type time and savings deposits at banks and in M 2 would be expected
 If money market conditions tighten, as assumed under alternatives B and C, we would anticipate somewhat more rapid growth in CD's and greater use of Euro-dollar borrowings as banks make an effort to compensate, at least in part, for smaller inflows of funds through private demand and consumer-type time deposits
 (11) With the corporate calendar tending to moderate, corporate bond yields could decline under the conditions of alternative A, especially if there were no general rise in the prime rate, or if the rise was limited to only 1/4 of a percentage point
 Alternative B money market conditions(particularly if the funds rate moves to the upper end of the range) would reduce the likelihood of any rally in the corporate bond market over the near-term, and could cause such yields to back up somewhat, at least for a time
 Under alternative C, substantial across- the-board increases in long-term interest rates would be highly likely

  The draft statement for Alternative C uses the same structure as in the January FOMC statement
 (40) All three alternatives maintain an unchanged target range of 0 to ¼ percent for the federal funds rate and provide forward policy guidance; as in January, Alternatives B and C indicate that the funds rate is likely to remain exceptionally low “for some time” whereas Alternative A signals a somewhat longer duration by substituting the phrase “for an extended period

  As in January, Alternative C refers to last fall’s drop in energy and commodity prices and to “prospects for considerable economic slack” as factors explaining the outlook for inflation, which is expected to remain subdued “in coming quarters” before returning to rates consistent with the dual mandate; this alternative does not give an assessment of risks to the inflation outlook
  Alternative A indicates that the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet will be expanded further this year by the purchase of $500 billion in longer-term Treasury securities and by the acquisition of an additional $500 billion of agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS), bringing total MBS purchases to $1 trillion

 (12) In announcing Alternative A, the Committee might wish to state that “Even though output appears to have regained some traction after moderating earlier this year, the pace of improvement in labor market conditions remains modest
”  This wording is broadly similar to that proposed for Alternative B but puts more stress on the limited improvement in labor market conditions and less stress on energy price movements as the source of earlier economic weakness
  As part of the rationale for leaving rates unchanged, the Committee could employ the language for describing inflation developments that is proposed for Alternative B, that is, “Despite the rise in energy prices, inflation and inflation expectations have eased in recent months
  If the Committee put much weight on the possibility that growth will rebound sharply, it may believe that the scope of its future action is constrained on the upside by the “measured pace” language and may prefer to drop the last two sentences from the statement, as is considered in Alternative C
” Regarding price developments, the announcement could indicate, as in Alternatives A and B, that “Inflation and inflation expectations have eased in recent months” but add that “elevated energy prices continue to put upward pressure on costs and prices
”  The appropriate risk assessment under Alternative C poses a difficult issue

 The level of adjustment plus seasonal borrowing associated with alternative B, $250 million, is expected to entail federal funds trading around recent 6-1/2 to 6-3/4 percent levels
 Alternative A would be associated with a reduction in the federal funds rate of about 1/2 percentage point--achieved by a lowering of the borrowing objective to $100 million, a near-frictional level--or by a 1/2 percentage point cut in the discount rate

 (19) Although some easing of reserve conditions is now thought by market participants to be in train or at least in prospect, the reserve specifications of alternative A embody a larger move by the Federal Reserve than has been anticipated in market rates
 The easier conditions of alternative A are likely to put considerable downward pressure on the dollar, though the extent to which this would show through in dollar declines over the near-term would be affected by the incoming trade data

 Alternative B provides an option that would exert greater restraint on M2 growth, involving a lower target for M1-B growth in the third quarter, one of 6 percent
 The specifications for alternatives A and B assume that MM growth slows a bit from its recent extremely rapid pace, while small time deposit growth strengthens relative to July, owing to growth of the 30-month SSC, whose ceiling rate since August 1 can fluctuate in line with Treasury yields
 (10) To achieve the alternative A specifications, total reserves probably would have to expand at about a 13 percent annual rate in August and September, considerably more than in July
 Even with the alternative A target specifi- cations, income velocity of M-B would rise at a relatively rapid annual rate of about 5 percent this quarter
 It seems reasonable to expect that under alternative A the federal funds rate over the next few weeks might be in the area of 18 percent

 Under alternative B, market interest rates, especially short-term rates, are likely to rise, perhaps appreciably
 Pressure on thrift institution earnings would be more intense under this alternative than under alternative A, and mortgage rates would probably rise further

 Alternative C would imply a significant further easing of money market conditions from those that have recently evolved, with, for example, the Federal funds rate thought to be consistent with this alternative in a 3-7/8--4-1/2 per cent range
 (10) Under alternative A/B, we would expect the 3-month bill rate to be in a 4--4-5/8 per cent range between now and mid-December

) (12) The narrow money supply (M1) under alternative A/B is expected to show only a slight decline in November at a one per cent annual rate, but to resume growth beginning in December
 The lower interest rates and greater reserve supply under alternative C would likely lead to a more rapid 3 per cent rate of growth in December, followed by an 8 per cent expansion in the first quarter
 On balance, under alternative A/B, we would anticipate a growth rate in consumer-type time deposits of around 11 per cent in the fourth quarter, but slowing to about 7 per cent in the first quarter as consumer spending continues to rise
 Under alternative C there could be a pick-up in business borrowing from banks as lending terms ease further, but the increased inflow of demand and consumer-type deposits associated with that alternative would probably generate enough resources so that banks would not need to be more aggressive in that CD market
 Under alternative C, bank credit expansion would be somewhat more rapid in the last few weeks of the current quarter, and considerably larger than under alternative A/B in the first quarter of next year as growth in M2 accelerates
 (16) Assuming the tight end of the money market range for alternative A/B, it is possible that the technical position of markets will lead to an increase in interest rates over the near-term despite the recent discount rate reduction
 An easing on the money market toward the lower end of the alternative A/B range would likely offset such a tendency should it arise
 And if the money market moved into the alternative C range, the whole market would likely adjust downward in yield, impelled in part by expectations of a further decline in the discount rate

 1/ Alternative B
 Thus, with the need for reserves reduced, growth of member bank total reserves in July is falling substantially short of what was implied by the alternative B path at the time of the last Committee meeting, as shown in the table above, despite the sharp rise in member bank borrowings

 Specifications for alternative B, on the other hand, would envisage a gradual firming of the money market, to the extent permitted by the Treasury financing, to a Federal funds rate of 6 per cent by late in the inter-meeting period; a funds rate fluctuating around 6 per cent has been assumed for the alternative B paths for the monetary aggregates
 Under alternative B, growth is expected to be only about 1/2 percentage point lower than under alternative A in the third quarter, but about 1-1/2 percentage points lower in the fourth quarter
 Thus, under alternative A, growth in M2 is expected to drop to a 6-1/2 per cent annual rate in August, and to 8 per cent in the third quarter; growth would be a little slower under alternative B
 (15) The deposit patterns described above for alternative A imply a 7-1/2 per cent annual rate of increase in total reserves, seasonally adjusted, from June to September, assuming excess reserves average about $225 million
 Reserve growth would be somewhat less under alternative B, particularly for nonborrowed reserves, with part of the drop-off in nonborrowed offset by increased borrowing
 The following table shows monthly average levels of total and nonborrowed reserves (in millions of dollars)--both seasonally adjusted and unadjusted-believed to be consistent with alternatives A and B
 (16) The slowing of growth in M1 and accompanying reserve developments under alternative A would not be expected to lead to higher interest rates in either short- or long-term markets, at least in the immediate future
 (19) Alternative A
"" If the Committee adopts this alternative, it may wish to consider the money market conditions noted for alternative A in paragraph (9) as a description of ""prevailing"" conditions, and for purposes of the proviso clause to adopt the aggregate growth paths discussed earlier in connection with alternative A been as the ""expected"" paths

 unless the monetary aggregates appear to be increasing at rates well below those discussed earlier under alternative B

 Growth would be somewhat higher if measured from QI '77 since there was also an overshoot in the second quarter for which alternative D does not compensate
 Growth of 1/ Implications for growth over longer time periods are shown in appendix IV for alternatives B and D
 M-1 of around 5¼ per cent in the QIII '77-QIII '78 period, as called for under alternative B, would be associated with expansion over the 15-month QII '77-QIII '78 period at an annual rate of close to 6 per cent, in the upper part of the FOMC's current longer-run range

 (11) The staff expects, however, that even further increases in interest rates would be required as time goes on if growth in M-1 over the QIII '77-QIII '78 period is to be held to the mid-point of the longer-run 4-6 per cent range associated with alternative B
 (13) Growth in M-2 over the October-November period is likely to be in a 5 -9 per cent annual rate range under alternative B
 (15) A tightening of the funds market to the mid-point of a 6¾-7¼ per cent range over the next few weeks is contemplated under alternatives C or D--alternatives that over the longer-run involve lower growth ranges for the monetary aggregates than alternative B
 (16) Under both alternatives C and D, interest rates would probably have to rise further in late 1977 and in 1978 to achieve the mid-points of their respective longer-run ranges for the monetary aggre- gates
 Rate increases would, of course, be larger under alternative D, which involves M-1 growth over the QIII '77-QIII '78 period at a mid- point rate of 4¼ per cent
 The funds rate under this alternative would be expected to reach around 8¼ per cent by the third quarter of 1978, as compared with a level of 7-5/8 per cent under alternative C
 Under alternative D, we have assumed an upward adjustment in Regulation Q ceilings on time deposits of ¼ percentage point across the board in the second quarter of next year
 (18) The easing in money market conditions over the next few weeks under alternative A would be consistent with a shift to somewhat higher longer-run growth ranges than those of alternative B

 Alternative B reiterates the language from the April FOMC statement indicating that the Committee anticipates that economic activity “is likely to remain weak for a time” but that the policies now in train, together with market forces, “will contribute to a June 18, 2009 Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 39 of 79 gradual resumption of sustainable economic growth in a context of price stability
” These two alternatives are not specific about the likely timing of the recovery, whereas Alternative C indicates that a gradual recovery “is expected to begin later this year

  Alternatives B and C also note that the prices of energy and other commodities have risen “of late
” Following the language of the April statement, Alternative A indicates that the Committee still sees some downside risks to the inflation outlook, whereas Alternatives B and C do not comment on the risks to inflation
  As in the previous two FOMC statements, Alternative B indicates that economic conditions are likely to warrant an exceptionally low funds rate “for an extended period
”  Alternative A includes an option under which the Committee would specify that the funds rate will likely remain exceptionally low “at least through mid-2010
”  Alternative C states that the funds rate is likely to remain at exceptionally low levels “until late this year
 Alternative A expands the total size of the LSAP program by specifying that the Federal Reserve will purchase up to $750 billion in Treasury securities and indicating that those purchases will be conducted through the end of this year
  Alternatives B and C make no changes to the maximum amounts or timing of securities purchases
  Alternatives A and B indicate that any additional purchases beyond the announced amounts will be evaluated in view of “the necessity of assuring that policy accommodation can ultimately be withdrawn smoothly and at the appropriate time,” thereby underscoring the importance of the exit strategy in the Committee’s decision-making process

 (20) The substantial decline in short rates that appear to be implied by alternative A probably would be accompanied by significant downward pressures on the international value of the dollar, especially if the dollar also remains under pressure because of the crises in the mid-East
 For a given longer- run growth rate, interest rates would be at higher levels by year-end under this alternative than under alternatives B and C, partly because it will provide a little greater stimulus to economic activity and partly because the larger expansion of M-1 in the first quarter will allow less scope to accommodate the subsequent increase in the transactions demand for money as nominal GNP expands in the second half
 (22) In order to achieve the 5 percent rate of growth of M-1 in the first quarter specified under alternative B, a decline in interest rates from current levels would also be likely
 (23) Even the more modest decline in money market rates associated with alternative B is likely to induce a rally in bond markets as it becomes clear that interest rates have peaked
 Net inflows of funds to thrift institutions are likely to pick up only modestly from their second half of 1979 pace, and costs of such funds would not decline as much as under alternative A
 The exchange value of the dollar under alternative B is likely to decline somewhat as market participants focus on the decline of interest rates, but there would be less downward pressure than under alternative A, in part because any interest rate declines under alternative B would be associated with slower money growth
 (24) The more modest money growth over the next few months under alternative B provides more scope for expansion in M-1 in the second half of 1980 than does alternative A
 Moreover, the smaller reduction of interest rates, as compared with alternative A, would provide less stimulus to nominal GNP and money demand later this year

 Alternative B, for instance, shows a 7 per cent annual rate of growth for M1 over the second quarter and alternative C a 6 per cent rate of increase
 However, as indicated in the preceding paragraph, under alternative A, M1 would be expected to grow more rapidly in the second quarter than in the first
 Growth in M2 would be expected to moderate from the first quarter pace, even under alternative A, however, as the initial asset ad- justment by the public to the sharp drop of late 1970 and early 1971 in market rates relative to time deposit offering rates runs it course
 If money market conditions tighten--as may be required under alternatives B and C--expectations of rising short- term interest rates will give banks an added incentive to issue CD's in the near-term, especially longer-term CD's, offsetting in part expected slower growth under these conditions in demand and other time deposits
 (13) An effort to move onto growth paths for aggregates in the second quarter slower than shown for alternative A--given staff assumptions as to the strength of economic recovery and attendent credit demands--seems likely to require a rise in the Federal funds rate from current levels during the next four weeks
 The money market conditions now estimated to be con- sistent with alternative A through C are shown in the table below, using the second quarter annual rate of growth in M1 as a convenient index of the col- lection of monetary aggregates
 Federal Funds Member Bank Net M1 Rate Borrowings Reserves Alternative A 3-1/2 250-350 + 50 to -150 9% Alternative B 3-3/4--4-1/4 400-500 -150 to -300 7% Alternative C 4-1/4--4-3/4 500-600 -250 to -400 6% (14) Weekly paths for key monetary aggregates are shown in the table on the next page
 Under alternative B money market specifications, a 3-month bill rate in a 3-1/2--4-1/2 per cent range might be anticipated, and under alternative C a 4--4-3/4 per cent range
 Thus, a rise in short-rates of about the magnitude indicated for alternative B might not be accompanied by any appreciable rise in long rates over the second quarter as a whole, although an initial market reaction would be likely; money market tightening of the degree contemplated under alternative C might well bring a more lasting long-term rate advance
 If in these circumstances the Committee would wish to promote somewhat easier over-all credit conditions, including near- term declines in long-term rates, it could consider a policy alternative-- such as Alternative D--that would call for some further easing of money market conditions
 (19) As nearly as can be judged, the expected effect on monetary aggregates of a policy consistent with the money market specif- ications of alternative D would be as shown in the table below

 Thus, a further rise in the Federal funds rate appears needed under alternatives B and C if growth in the aggregates is to be held within their ranges
 Even under alternative A, some further increase in the funds rate might well be required
 (11) Under alternative B, we would expect the Federal funds rate to level off in a 9 to 10¼ per cent range by early next year if M-1 growth over the QIII '78-QIII '79 period is to be at around the upper end of a 4 to 6½ per cent range, abstracting from the effects of ATS
 The interest rate forecast might have been expected to decline because alternative B in effect forgives the ""overshoot"" in M-1 growth during the third quarter and, hence, does not imply as low a rate of monetary growth over the next few quarters as it did earlier

 Thus, under alternative B, M-2 growth for the year ahead is expected to be in a 7 to 9½ per cent range and M-3 growth in an 8 to 11 per cent range, ½ and 1 percentage point higher than current longer-run ranges
 (13) The longer-run alternative C ranges encompass growth rates for M-2 and M-3 nearer to those currently in place
 In addition, alternative C calls for a slower longer-run growth in M-1--in a 3 to 5 per cent range, abstracting from ATS
 This alternative appears particularly appropriate if the Committee opts for the slower longer-run growth in the aggregates encompassed by alternative C
 It would also be consistent with the longer-run policy stance indexed by alternative B, as well as with near-term efforts to support the dollar in exchange markets
 The tightening of the funds market over the weeks ahead envisaged by alternative II would--by introducing restraint earlier-- increase the likelihood that the funds rate would not have to rise into the upper part of the 9 to 10¼ per cent range projected for next year under alternative B",0,1978-10-17,3,[]

September FOMC Alternative A Alternative B Alternative C Policy  Decision The Federal Open Market Committee  decided today to keep its target for the  federal funds rate at 1¾ percent
  Under Alternative A, the federal funds rate target would be maintained at 1¾ percent at this meeting
  Alternative B would raise the target 25 basis points to 2 percent, but the language of the announcement would signal that the Committee might now be more inclined to pause in the process of removing policy accommodation
  Under Alternative C, the funds rate would also be raised to 2 percent, but the language of the announcement would be consistent with a firming of policy at least as rapid as currently embodied in market expectations
  If the Committee regarded the outlook for economic activity and inflation given these financial conditions as striking an appropriate balance between reducing slack and limiting inflation risks, it might wish to validate those expectations by tightening 25 basis points and issuing a statement similar to that of Alternative B in the table, which includes language intended to signal a possible pause in the removal of policy accommodation
 (10) Regarding the announcement of Alternative B, the Committee might signal the possibility of a pause by noting that the firming brings “the cumulative increase in the target rate over the past several months to 1 percentage point
 (11) The market reaction to the announcement for Alternative B is difficult to gauge precisely
  Faced with these developments, the Committee might wish to tighten policy a quarter-point and adopt the firmer statement language shown for Alternative C
 (13) The announcement of Alternative C could cite the increase in the target rate to 2 percent with no intimation of a pause any time soon
  In that circumstance, the Committee might see less need to continue removing policy accommodation at this meeting and choose to keep the funds rate at 1¾ percent and issue a statement like that shown in Alternative A
 (16) The announcement of Alternative A would indicate an unchanged target federal funds rate but otherwise might look fairly similar to the announcement for the September meeting
  Given the actual pause in policy adjustment, the “cumulative increase” wording employed in Alternative B would not seem necessary
  The revised table eliminates alternative A and incorporates a new variation on alternative B that is labeled alternative B’
 As a result, the language of alternative B’ incorporates only minimal changes to the wording of the September FOMC statement
  Alternatives B and C in the revised table are slightly revised for clarity, with material struck out in rows three and four

 We have, therefore, assumed that maintenance of pre- vailing money market conditions over the short-run would be more con- sistent with adoption by the Committee of higher longer-run growth objectives for the monetary aggregates, as shown under alternative A
 Tightening of the money market over the intermeeting period, as con- templated under alternative B, would work to lower these growth rates slightly, but most of the effect of higher interest rates on the monetary aggregates would develop later on
 Thus, expansion of M2 and M3 is expected to continue sizable--under alternatives A or B--over the next month or two

  Alternative C concludes that the risks to growth are the predominant policy concern and notes that “future policy adjustments will depend on the outlook for both inflation and economic growth, as implied by incoming information
 Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 21 of 43 Table 1: Alternative Language for the December 2007 FOMC Announcement October FOMC Alternative A Alternative B Alternative C Policy  Decision The Federal Open Market Committee  decided today to lower its target for the  federal funds rate 50 basis points to  4 percent
 Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 22 of 43 (17)  If the Committee judges that tighter financial conditions, higher oil prices, and soft incoming data point to a weaker economic outlook than previously anticipated, then it may deem a more accommodative stance of policy to be appropriate and ease policy 25 basis points, as in Alternative B
 (18) After noting that “economic growth is slowing” and that “strains in financial markets have increased,” the statement for Alternative B suggests that the 25 basis point reduction in the target funds rate, together with the two previous policy actions, is likely to help promote moderate growth over time
  As a result, short-term interest rates would likely rise modestly in response to Alternative B
  However, judging from the Desk’s survey of dealers, the statement under Alternative B would likely be read as broadly consistent with market expectations for additional policy easing
 (20) If the Committee views the renewed deterioration in financial markets and the sharper contraction in the housing sector as presenting a particularly severe threat to the economic expansion, it might want to lower the target funds rate 50 basis points, as in Alternative A
 (21) The draft statement for Alternative A begins with a reference to the further intensification of the housing correction and recent weakening in business and consumer expenditures, and it also mentions increased strains in financial markets
  It then notes that the outlook for economic growth has weakened somewhat and, unlike Alternative B, adds that the downside risks to growth have increased
  But if the Committee believes that, even after such a move, recent developments in financial markets have increased the uncertainty around the outlook for growth and inflation to such an extent that an assessment is not meaningful, it may wish instead to employ the risk assessment language used in Alternative B
 (23) If the Committee judges that the current stance of policy is likely to foster sustainable growth and acceptable inflation over time, then it might be inclined to choose Alternative C

 Under alternative B, and even more so under A, short-term market interest rates are likely to decline over the next few weeks as market expectations of further easing in policy are confirmed
 (12) Although the interest rate declines anticipated under the easing alternatives might be fairly sharp, it is quite likely that rates will turn around, particularly under alternative B
 Thus, under alternative B, bill rates might be back in the neighborhood of current levels, or perhaps above them, by around year-end

  Alternative B notes the continued strengthening of economic activity, the abatement of deterioration in the labor market, and the likelihood of a moderate pace of recovery
  Alternative C indicates that the economy is growing at a solid rate and that the labor market is stabilizing and concludes that a sustainable recovery is now under way
  Alternatives A and B each indicate that substantial resource slack continues to restrain cost pressures and that longer-term inflation expectations remain stable, making it likely that inflation will be subdued for some time
 Alternative C refers to appropriate monetary policy adjustments and stable longer- term inflation expectations—but not to resource slack—in projecting that inflation will return to levels consistent with price stability
  As in recent statements, Alternatives A and B indicate that the Committee expects the funds rate to remain January 21, 2010 Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 34 of 72 “exceptionally low
”  Alternative C modifies the forward guidance by using the phrase “low
” Alternative A expands the amount of agency MBS purchases by $250 billion and indicates that these transactions will continue through the end of the third quarter
 Alternatives B and C do not make any changes to the amounts or timing of the Federal Reserve’s previously announced securities purchases
  Alternative B states that the Committee will continue to evaluate its purchases of securities based on the economic outlook and financial conditions, leaving the door open to adjusting its purchases should circumstances warrant
  Alternative C indicates that the Committee will be evaluating the size and composition of its holdings of securities, thereby signaling that asset sales could be used to manage the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet

 January 21, 2010 Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 42 of 72 The financial market reaction to a statement like that of Alternative B would likely be muted
 Policymakers might also wish to consider a variant of Alternative B that refers to the Committee’s evaluation of its securities “holdings” instead of its “purchases”
 A statement like this variant of Alternative B would probably cause a substantial shift in investors’ expectations about the anticipated trajectory of the Federal Reserve’s securities holdings
 THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE C If policymakers are confident that a sustainable economic recovery is now under way and see substantial upside risks to the inflation outlook in the absence of appropriate near-term monetary policy adjustments, then the Committee might wish to issue a statement that shortens the horizon over which the funds rate is likely to remain low and that raises the possibility of active unwinding of the Federal Reserve’s securities holdings, as in Alternative C
 The adoption of a statement like that of Alternative C would greatly surprise financial market participants
  Moreover, Alternative C uses the phrase “for some time” to refer to the duration over which the funds rate target would remain at low levels—not the time horizon preceding the onset of funds rate firming
  Thus, investors would be likely to interpret a statement like that of January 21, 2010 Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 45 of 72 Alternative C as conveying the Committee’s intention to commence tightening quite soon—perhaps as early as March—and to move fairly quickly to raise the funds rate target to a level of around 1 or 2 percent
 THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE A If meeting participants are concerned about prospects for a subpar recovery and believe that further monetary stimulus would help improve the outlook for economic activity and inflation, then they might wish to expand the amount of the Federal Reserve’s agency MBS purchases by $250 billion and extend the horizon of those purchases through the third quarter of this year, as in Alternative A
 An announcement like that of Alternative A would come as a surprise to market participants, since they do not appear to be anticipating any changes in the overall size or composition of the Federal Reserve’s LSAPs
  The baseline scenario corresponds to Alternative B in this Bluebook
  We also present a projection for Alternative A, where the agency MBS purchases are increased by $250 billion to a total of $1
  We do not present balance sheet projections for Alternative C in this Bluebook because the Committee has not yet specified any strategy for asset sales or the use of other reserve draining tools
  The announced LSAP purchases in Alternative B and Alternative C are the same, so the baseline projections for assets and reserves can serve as a reference for Alternative C
  Alternative A projects a higher contour of total assets because of the assumed larger purchases of agency MBS

 Alternative A provides for somewhat more rapid growth in the aggregates and alternative C for somewhat less
 For example, in alternative B, the January-February M 1 growth is indicated at per cent, as compared with the 5--6 per cent longer-run target
 This reflects mainly (a) disappearance of the transitory upward effect on M1 from sizable Treasury refunds of taxes and smaller final payments by individuals, (b) the lagged effect on money demand of past interest rate increases, and (c) in alternatives B and C, particularly, reduced public interest in time and savings deposits other than large CD's as short-term rates rise further above ceiling rates
 (13) To achieve the aggregates of alternative B, the staff expects that money market conditions will tighten from around prevail- ing levels, given the continuing strong transaction demands for money implicit in the rapid growth in nominal GNP projected for the first and second quarters
 The potential for money market tightening implied by the alternative B monetary target paths is indicated by the 5-5/8--6-1/4 per cent Federal funds rate range shown for that alternative
 A rise in the funds rate of the dimensions contemplated in alternative B would likely be accompanied by a further rise in short-term rates generally, with the 3-month Treasury bill rate in particular moving upward in a 5-3/8--5-3/4 per cent range
 However, as borrowings continue large,many banks will wear out their welcome at the window and this will add further to pressure on open market rates and on banks to restrict acquisitions of loans and (15) Efforts to achieve the reserve and monetary aggregates of alternative C are likely to entail an even greater firming of money market conditions, with the Federal funds rate probably moving well above 6 per cent by the time of the next meeting
 (18) Alternative A indicates more expansive paths for the reserve and monetary aggregates which are not likely to entail any significant change in money market conditions from those recently pre- vailing; this alternative, therefore, has the greatest probability of minimizing conflicts between even-keel considerations and monetary objectives
 (19) Long-term interest rates may not rise very much under alternative A, but would probably show greater upward adjustments, at least in the short-run, under alternatives B and C
banks and other institutional investors find that their inflows of funds are dropping off or becoming significantly more expensive--conditions most likely to develop under alternatives B and C

 (16) Although the risk assessment paragraphs in Alternatives A and C are similar, the characterizations of the economy and prices in the rationale paragraphs are quite different
  Under Alternative A, the rationale paragraph would suggest that the Committee sees the stance of monetary policy as “somewhat” accommodative and regards the recent uptick in inflation readings as transitory, with underlying inflation and inflation expectations remaining well-contained
  In contrast, the language for Alternative C would suggest that output growth is proceeding at a pace that seems likely to eliminate resource slack in the near term and would note that inflation pressures have intensified, signaling a pickup in the pace of firming
 (17) Market participants would be caught off guard by the 50 basis point tightening of Alternative C
  The market reaction to the Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 21 of 37 language of Alternative C would be somewhat attenuated if the Committee boosted rates at this meeting by only a quarter point
  The market reaction to adoption of Alternative A is more difficult to gauge, but the mention of cumulative firming, upbeat assessment of inflation prospects, and the characterization of the stance of policy as only “somewhat” accommodative in the rationale paragraph should tend to put some downward pressure on yields",0,2005-03-22,6,[]

 (18) Other key assumptions in the monetary relationships pre- sented are: (a) continued strength in business loan demand on banks; (b) some reduction in demand for consumer and mortgage credit; (c) con- tinued active demand by banks for large CD funds, though perhaps less aggressive demand than in the past four months taken as a whole; (d) greater bank reluctance to participate in the securities market, par- ticularly under alternative C, in view of the wide spread of their bor- rowing costs over their return on portfolio

 Overall credit conditions--as typified by behavior of short- and long-term interest rates--might well ease somewhat between now and the next Committee meeting even under Alternative A
 On balance, we would expect the 3-month bill rate to be in a 4-1/4--4-3/4 per cent range between now and the next meeting of the Committee, given the money market specifications of alternative A
 The lower the Federal funds rate were to drop-- and particularly if it moved into the range of alternative C--the greater would be the possibility of a large speculative build-up in bond positions, especially during this forthcoming Treasury financing period
 (10) Our best present estimate is that under the money market conditions of alternative A, M1 will grow in the first quarter of next year at a 4-1/2 per cent annual rate following the 2-1/2 per cent rate indicated for the fourth quarter
 For alternative B, the annual rate of money growth rises from 3 per cent in the fourth quarter to 6 per cent in the first quarter,
andfor alternative C from a 4 per cent annual rate to a 7-1/2 per cent annual rate over the same period
 (11) The bank credit proxy in the fourth quarter is expected to grow less rapidly than in the third quarter under any of the alternatives; under alternative A, the growth rate is projected to drop below 5 per cent
 Growth in time deposits other than large CD's is expected to remain moderate in the fourth quarter, with growth rates somewhat larger under alternativesB and C as a result of the lower market interest rates likely to develop
 It is likely, though, that banks will lower CD offering rates if short- term market rates decline, but not so rapidly as to forestall a somewhat greater increase in CD's in November under alternatives B and C than under alternative A, with the additional funds used to build up positions in securities

 (16) Between now and the next meeting of the Committee, the 3-month bill rate under alternative A may be in a 3-3/4--4-1/4 per cent range
 (17) Alternative B--which assumes a funds rate centering on 4-3/4 per cent--leads to a somewhat slower growth in monetary aggregates over time
 Growth in M2 may be affected somewhat sooner by the higher funds rate, and over time the growth rate may diminish by about a percentage point relative to alternative A
 (18) The 3- onth bill rate would be likely to rise under alternative B, perhaps to around 4-1/2 per cent, or somewhat higher if expectations of an upward adjustment in the discount rate should develop
 (19) Alternative C presents the staff's best estimate as of this moment of the money market conditions required to rapidly move M 1 back to the growth path previously desired by the Committee for the second quarter, and assuming M1 growth at a 6 per cent rate in the third quarter
 (22) Alternative A

 A directive with this general structure-- putting primary emphasis on money market conditions rather than the aggregates--can, of course, be used in connection with specifications other than those shown for alternative A, with suitable language changes
 (23) Alternative B
 This language is proposed for possible use if the Committee decides (a) to formulate its primary instruction in terms of desired growth rates for the monetary and credit aggregates (subject to the constraints that might be imposed by the Treasury financing and foreign exchange market uncertainties), and (b) to adopt as targets the growth rates (including an 8-1/2 per cent second-quarter rise in M1) discussed earlier in connection with alternative B

  Alternative B would essentially maintain the current stance of monetary policy but specify a tapering strategy for the purchases of agency MBS and agency debt: The pace would gradually slow, with purchases completed either by the end of the first quarter of 2010 or, in a variant of this alternative, by sometime in the second quarter of 2010
  In recognition of the pending completion of Treasury security purchases and the gradual scaling down of the Federal Reserve’s liquidity programs, Alternative B notes that the Federal Reserve will use “a range of tools” rather than “all available tools” to promote economic recovery and preserve price stability
  Under Alternative C, the size of agency MBS purchases September 17, 2009 Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 31 of 73 would be reduced to “about $1 trillion” and that of agency debt to “about $150 billion,” from their previously announced maximums, and the pace of purchases would be gradually reduced until their completion by year-end
 Alternative C also makes more explicit the conditionality of the funds rate target on the evolution of the economic outlook by changing the language that characterizes the period over which the target range is likely to remain extraordinarily low
  Alternative A states that economic activity “is leveling out” but notes that the economic recovery could be relatively weak
  Alternatives B and C are progressively more optimistic, with Alternative B saying that economic activity has “picked up following its severe downturn” and Alternative C stating explicitly that the data suggest a “recovery in economic activity has begun

  Alternative B suggests two possible end dates for the purchases:  the end of the first quarter or sometime in the second quarter of 2010
 A statement such as that suggested for Alternative B would be close to market expectations and would likely have muted effects in financial markets
 THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE C If policymakers view the incoming data as pointing to more underlying momentum in the nascent recovery than they previously anticipated and are at least as optimistic as the staff regarding the economic outlook, they might choose to trim the size of the LSAPs and to adjust the language regarding the anticipated period over which the funds rate is likely to remain extraordinarily low, as in Alternative C
 Participants might prefer Alternative C if they viewed the continued improvement in financial market conditions and the significant upward revision in the staff forecast as suggesting that less monetary policy support from the Federal Reserve is required and, given the improvement in the housing sector, that a reduction in the maximum amount of purchases of mortgage-related assets, in particular, could be appropriate
 The adoption of Alternative C would surprise market participants
  Thus, the release of a statement along the lines of Alternative C would likely cause short- and medium-term interest rates to rise sharply, and equity prices to drop, while the foreign exchange value of the dollar would probably appreciate
  In this case, they could decide to expand the amount of agency MBS purchases, be more definitive about the total amount to be purchased, and extend the timeframe for conducting those transactions, as in Alternative A
  Expanding the amount of purchases of agency debt (or even buying the maximum $200 billion) could generate significant distortions in the markets for those securities, so this is not proposed in Alternative A
 An announcement along the lines of Alternative A would surprise market participants
 September 17, 2009 Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 46 of 73 10 Reflecting concerns that a higher level of purchases could distort pricing and compromise  market liquidity, agency debt purchases are projected to cumulate to $150 billion, below the  announced $200 billion upper limit of the program under Alternatives A and B
  The baseline scenario corresponds to the variant of Alternative B in the Policy Alternatives section, which has agency MBS purchases of $1
  The second scenario corresponds to Alternative A, in which purchases of agency MBS are increased by $250 billion to $1
10  The third scenario corresponds to Alternative C, in which the quantity of agency MBS purchases is reduced by $250 billion to $1 trillion and agency debt purchases stop at $150 billion
  For Alternative A, the peak also occurs in the second quarter of 2010 but at a higher level of $2
  For Alternative C, the balance sheet peaks at September 17, 2009 Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 49 of 73 12 The composition of Federal Reserve assets in all three of these projections differs notably  from historical patterns
12 Balance Sheet Projections Summary Alternative A Alternative B Alternative C Total Assets Peak month June 2010 June 2010 December 2009 Peak amount $2
  In the scenarios corresponding to Alternatives A and B, reserve balances peak in June of 2010, whereas in Alternative C, they peak in September 17, 2009 Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 50 of 73 13 The calculated growth rates of the monetary base presented in the table are based on an  approximation for month-average values
  Reserve balances decline as the balance sheet shrinks in all scenarios, but in Alternative C, a resumption of open market purchases is assumed in 2016 to maintain reserve balances at a level of $25 billion
  At a quarterly frequency, the monetary base continues to expand for the first three quarters of 2010 for Alternative A and B
 For Alternative C, in which asset purchases end in 2009, the monetary base begins to contract in the first quarter of 2010
 For Alternatives B and C, this contraction is reversed near the end of the projection Relative to the August Bluebook, there are a number of notable changes to the projections

 A considerably higher ultimate level for the funds rate is envisaged under alternative A, since it would be necessary to offset later the effects of near-term easing in reserve conditions contemplated by that alternative

 The stability of the funds rate around the current level under alternative B, especially if combined with incoming economic data in line with the greenbook forecast of sustained economic growth, would raise further doubts in securities markets about the likelihood of such an easing

 A rally in bond markets also would seem probable, espe- cially because inflation concerns do not now seem to be weighing on market psychology; however, should spending prove reasonably strong, there is some risk that such concerns would be reignited against the background of the further easing of policy in alternative A

 Alternatives A and C represent, respectively, somewhat more and somewhat less expansive policy alternatives
 (9) Each of the alternatives presupposes an upward adjustment in deposit ceiling rates at banks and thrift institutions of 50 basis points on small-denomination time deposits; the adjustments in ceiling rates are assumed to occur in April under alternative C, in May under B, and in June under A
 It shows, for instance, that growth in M-1 at around the 5¼ per cent mid-point of the proposed alternative B range would lead to a 5
 M-1 growth at around the 5 per cent mid-point of the proposed alternative C range would nearly compensate for the slight fourth quarter overshoot but not for the larger third quarter overshoot
0 (12) A Federal funds rate centered on the recently prevailing level of 6-3/4 per cent, as contemplated under alternative B, is likely to be associated with M-1 growth over February-March in a 1 to 6 per cent annual rate range
 Even assuming some further moderate downward shift in money demand relative to income, the Federal funds rate would probably have to begin rising again in April and reach 8 per cent by fall in order to constrain M-1 growth for the QIV '77-QIV '78 period to the mid-point of the 4 to 6-1/2 per cent alternative B range
1/ (14) Growth in M-2 over the February-March period is likely to be in a 4-1/2 to 8-1/2 per cent annual rate range under alternative B
 (16) With the Federal funds rate remaining near its present 6-3/4 per cent level, as envisioned under alternative B, interest rates generally are likely to fluctuate within a relatively narrow range over the intermeeting period
 (18) Under alternative C the Federal funds rate would rise over the intermeeting period to the mid-point of a 7 to 7-1/2 per cent range, and the February-March annual rate of growth of M-1 and M-2 would likely be in 1/2 to 5-1/2 and 4 to 8 per cent annual rate ranges, respec- tively
 (19) The tightening of money market conditions contemplated under alternative C would further slow the net inflow of deposits sub- ject to rate ceilings in the weeks immediately ahead and thus would increase the need for an adjustment in deposit ceiling rates
 However, given the projected strength of money demand, a further increase in interest rates would be required in order to limit M-1 expansion to the mid-point of the 4 to 6 per cent alternative C range over the QIV '77-QIV '78 period
 (21) Alternative A involves a reduction in the Federal funds rate over the intermeeting period to the 6-1/2 per cent mid-point of a 6 to 6-1/2 per cent range
 (22) The approach of alternative A appears most consistent with a monetary policy that encourages more rapid growth in the monetary aggregates over the longer-run than under either alternatives B or C
 Nevertheless, given the strength projected for economic activity, the near-term decline in the funds rate under A would probably soon have to be reversed to restrain growth in the aggregates to rates consistent with the mid-points of longer-run ranges for alternative A

 Alternative A, involving a reduction of the intended funds rate to 5-1/2 percent, could be effected by lowering either the borrowing allowance to $50 million or the discount rate by 50 basis points
 If the Committee believes such an outcome were both likely and acceptable, then it may be inclined to leave the current level of the federal funds rate in place, as under alternative B, unless and until incoming economic data or a clarification of prospective fiscal policy begin to point to a different outlook
 Consequently, there would likely be little change in interest rates in response to the choice of alternative B
 (10) A case for the 1/2 percentage point increase in the federal funds rate of alternative C could be made on the grounds that, with economic activity having already overshot its potential and the persistence of the slowdown in economic growth not yet firmly estab- lished, more insurance should be taken out against a serious deterior- ation in inflation trends
 (11) With financial markets having built in no near-term monetary policy tightening, choice of alternative C would come as a surprise
 In effect, choice of alternative A would imply a view that not only have longer-term interest and exchange rates not overshot on the downside, but that policy may still be too tight to allow markets to compensate fully for oncoming economic weakness

 If loan demands strengthen as expected, and assuming bank sources of funds become more costly and show only moderate growth (as is most likely under alternative C), banks would probably become more reluctant buyers of longer-term issues of securities

 Alternative A Alternative B Alternative C Federal funds rate 4-3/4 5-1/4 6 Member bank borrowings 250 - 350 350 - 450 450 - 600 Growth in M1: (10) Given a Federal funds rate of around 4-3/4 per cent, M1 growth in June would be expected at about a 9-10 per cent annual rate, and for the second quarter as a whole it would be around 12 per cent
 (11) A tightening of the money market between now and mid-year to the degrees indicated by the suggested specifications for alternatives B and C would have little effect on growth in M1 during June, but would begin to have more noticeable effects in ensuing months
1/ Under alternative B the M 1 growth rate in the third quarter would be expected to be reduced to 9-1/2 per cent and under alternative C to 8 per cent
 However, by late summer or early fall, it is our best estimate that the growth rate would be sharply reduced, perhaps in alternative C to only about a 3--4 per cent annual rate, although there are great difficulties of course in pinpointing exact months in which low growth rates would be likely to emerge
 (12) Alternative B, which indicates a somewhat more gradual deceleration of the aggregates than alternative C, is less likely to lead to sharp and sustained upward interest rate adjustments and hence to the need for a later easing in money market conditions
 However, over the near- term a funds rate around 5-1/4 per cent, as specified in alternative B, would likely induce a renewed increase in long-term interest rates, particularly as expectations of a discount rate increase became more prevalent and another rise in the prime rate more likely
 But the general interest rate increase would not carry as far as under alternative C and there would be a greater probability of a corrective market rally later on
 Under alternative A, we would expect the 3-month bill rate between now and mid-year to be in a 4-1/4--4-3/4 per cent range, and it may be expected to rise somewhat above that range in the summer as the Treasury finances large and partly seasonal cash needs
 Under alternative B, the 3-month bill would be likely to move into a 4-5/8--5-1/4 per cent range by or shortly after mid-year; and the rate would likely be substantially higher under alternative C
 Outstanding large CD's are expected to show little net change from current levels under alternative A, given the relatively comfortable liquidity position of banks
 But with tighter money market conditions--as under alternatives B and C--a moderate net growth in CD's might develop as banks attempt to compensate in part for slower growth in other time and demand deposits

  Alternative A indicates greater confidence that inflation will moderate and suggests that downside risks to growth and upside risks to inflation are now roughly balanced
 (23) If the Committee views the staff forecast, which is conditioned on unchanged policy through the middle of next year, as reasonable and acceptable in the circumstances and sees no compelling reason to change the statement materially, it may wish to leave the policy rate unchanged and issue a statement along the lines of that in Alternative B
  Indeed, the optimal policy simulations based on a 1½ percent inflation goal has the target federal funds rate just Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 28 of 41 Table 1: Alternative Language for the September 2008 FOMC Announcement August FOMC Alternative A Alternative B Alternative C Policy Decision The Federal Open Market Committee  decided today to keep its target for  the federal funds rate at 2 percent
 (24) In the statement under Alternative B, the rationale begins by noting that “Incoming information suggests that growth in economic activity has slowed in recent months,” which is changed from “Economic activity expanded in the second quarter” to shift the discussion to the current quarter and reflect the significant, albeit expected, deceleration that appears to be under way
  The remainder of the statement under Alternative B is unchanged from that released by the Committee in August, indicating that the Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 30 of 41 substantial easing of monetary policy will promote economic growth; that the Committee expects inflation to moderate, but the outlook is uncertain; and that, although downside risks to growth remain, upside risks to inflation are also of significant concern
  Investors read the statement released in August as consistent with an outlook for unchanged policy, so Alternative B, which is very similar, would probably not lead them to revise their views
  In sum, short- and longer-term interest rates, equity prices, and the exchange value of the dollar would probably be little changed in response to an announcement along the lines of Alternative B
 (26) If the Committee both thinks that it is important that it be seen to be responding to the continued high levels of inflation and has fairly high confidence in the resilience of financial markets and economic activity, it may prefer to tighten policy by 25 basis points at this meeting as in Alternative C
 (27) The discussion of economic activity in the statement proposed in Alternative C is similar to that in Alternative B
  However, Alternative C cites the “accommodative stance of monetary policy” rather than past policy easings as a factor that should support growth in the future because policy would be tightened under this alternative
  The inflation paragraph in Alternative C indicates that “inflation has remained high
 (28) Market participants are very confident in their outlook for no change in policy at this meeting and would be quite surprised by the adoption of Alternative C
  The policy surprise, along with the potentially large and unexpected movements in asset prices, would likely intensify strains in financial markets, perhaps (29) If the Committee sees recent developments as pointing to a weaker economic outlook and less pronounced inflation pressures, members may instead be attracted to the statement language of Alternative A
 (30) The statement under Alternative A differs from that under Alternative B only in its discussion of the inflation outlook and the assessment of risks

 The adoption of Alternative C would greatly surprise market participants and lead them to reevaluate, perhaps significantly, their beliefs regarding the Committee’s intentions
  Importantly, MBS and primary mortgage rates could well move sharply higher; Federal Reserve MBS purchases currently exceed the pace of new issues significantly, and the adoption of Alternative C would imply a dramatic scaling back of those purchases
 December 10, 2009 Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 45 of 72 Given the strong reaction that curtailing the purchases of securities might provoke, the Committee might prefer to consider combining the forward guidance on the federal funds rate path in Alternative C with the LSAP purchases proposed in Alternative B
  Another possible combination is to reduce the LSAPs as in Alternative C and maintain the forward guidance language from Alternative B
  To do so, the Committee could increase the quantity of agency MBS purchases and extend the timeframe for those purchases while continuing to signal that the federal funds rate will remain at the effective zero lower bound for an extended period, as in Alternative A
 An announcement such as that in Alternative A would come as a surprise to market participants
  Alternative A does not explicitly mention the expiration of the various liquidity facilities as do the other alternatives
  While this omission would in no way preclude policymakers from letting the facilities expire in February, participants may prefer to explicitly signal that the Federal Reserve’s support for financial markets is winding down by including in Alternative A the paragraph proposed on the facilities’ expiration proposed for Alternatives B and C
  The baseline scenario corresponds to Alternative B in which agency MBS purchases of $1
  Under Alternative A, the agency MBS purchases are increased by $250 billion to a total $1
  Under Alternative C, the quantities of agency MBS purchases and agency debt purchases are reduced to $1

 For example, under alternative B, the annual rate of M1 growth over the first quarter is indicated to be around 5-1/4 per cent--and in a 3-1/2 to 5-1/2 per cent range for January-February-- but to rise to 7 per cent in the second quarter
 (14) Net inflows of consumer-type time and savings deposits are expected to continue at about the November-December pace at banks and thrift institutions under alternative B, which does not contemplate significant changes in market rates
 Somewhat greater growth would be likely to evolve under alternative A
 There is risk of an appreciable reduction in savings flows under alternative C if the money market does in fact tighten as much as shown in paragraph (7)

 To hold M-1 growth over the coming year to a rate around the mid-point of the 4 to 6 per cent range of alternative B would, under the circumstances, require a larger increase in interest rates than the staff had earlier expected
 As indicated in Appendix I, we would anticipate a Federal funds rate averaging around 8¾ per cent by early next year if the mid- points of the longer-run ranges of alternative B are to be attained
 Interest rates would be slightly lower and slightly higher under alternatives A and C, respectively
 Assuming M-1 growth at the 5¼ per cent mid-point of the alternative B range, V-1 would be projected to rise by about 7 per cent over the coming four quarters, more than twice the average rate of the past two years
 For example, as shown in the table below, M-1 growth at around the 5¼ per cent mid-point of the alternative B range for the QI '78- QI '79 period would lead to a 6
- M-1 growth over the next four quarters at around the 5 per cent mid-point of the proposed alternative C range would still imply M-1 growth over the 24-month period beginning in QI '77 at a rate well above the mid-point of the current FOMC range
 As contemplated under alternative B, a Federal funds rate centered on the recently prevailing 6-3/4 per cent level is likely to be associated with M-1 growth over the two-month period at an annual rate in a 6 to 10 per cent range
 (13) Growth in M-2 over the April-May period is likely to be in a 6½ to 10½ per cent annual rate range under alternative B
 (14) Under alternative B, inflows to savings and loan associa- tions and mutual savings banks over the April-May period can be expected to remain at near the 6 to 7 per cent average monthly rate prevailing since year end
 (18) Under alternative C the Federal funds rate would rise over the intermeeting period to the mid-point of a 7 to 7½ per cent range
 The rise in short-term rates under alternative C may provide some support for the dollar in international exchange markets
 (19) The near-term increase in interest rates under alternative C would be a step toward reducing the longer-run rate of growth of the monetary aggregates, but further upward adjustments in interest rates over the coming year would be required to limit M-1 growth to the mid-point of its 4 to 6 per cent longer-run range
 (20) Alternative A calls for a reduction in the Federal funds rate over the intermeeting period to the mid-point of a 6 to 6 per cent range
 (21) Alternative A is consistent with a policy designed to encourage more rapid growth in the aggregates over the longer-run
 As suggested below, the particular language needed in the opening lines of the money market formulation would depend on the specific condi- tions sought; the three alternatives shown--calling, respectively, for somewhat easier, prevailing, and somewhat firmer money market conditions--are intended to be associated with the specifications discussed in the preceding section under alternatives A, B, and C",0,1978-04-18,4,[]

 The funds rates have been moved up more for alternatives B and C, since these alternatives involve a slowing in the M 1 growth rate over the second quarter from the recent pace and since there is one month less than there was at the time of the last meeting to affect public demand for cash balances in the second quarter
 Even at the higher funds rates specified under alternatives B and C, the slowing in the growth rate in April is likely to be modest, with more of an effect later in the quarter
 However, higher Federal funds rates--such as contemplated under alternatives B and C--would likely raise bill rates significantly--with the 3-month bill perhaps up to ranges of 3-3/4--4-1/2 per cent and 4-1/2--5-1/4 per cent, respectively--as dealers attempt to get out from under sizable bill positions
 Thus, attain- ment of the conditions specified in alternative A would be likely to re- inforce other trends in capital markets now expected to contribute to some further decline in long-term rates, as noted in the Greenbook
 On the other hand, if money market conditions are made firmer, as specified under alternatives B and C, shifts in market expectations about the course of short-term rates and monetary policy might tend to offset the under- lying trends
 A rise in long-term rates would seem likely if the Federal funds rate were to trend convincingly above 4 per cent, with the rise in long rates largest if money market conditions were to tighten as much as specified under alternative C
 Possible directive language (13) Alternative A
 If the Committee adopts this alternative, it may wish to consider the money market conditions noted for alternative A in paragraph (6) as a description of ""prevailing"" conditions, and for purposes of the proviso clause, to adopt the aggregate growth paths discussed earlier in connection with alterna- tive A as the ""expected"" paths

 (10) Under alternative B, and given the recent slowing in money growth, the staff expects that the Federal funds rate may decline a little further between now and the next meeting--centering around 11 per cent
 (11) Alternative A contemplates a significant further decline in the funds rate over the next few weeks, which would undoubtedly spur a sharp drop of interest rates generally
 Alternative C, on the other hand, envisions a return of the Federal funds rate to the 13 per cent area, and this would be accompanied by a re-emergence of market tensions and generally rising interest rates
 Taking account of the strengthening indicated by fragmentary early-August data, M1 would be expected to grow in a 4¾-6¾ per cent range in the August-September period under alternative B
 (13) Expansion in time deposits other than money market CD's at banks is expected to slow a little further over the months ahead under alternative B
 Growth in savings accounts at nonbank thrift institutions is expected to remain quite weak under alternative B, thus continuing sub- stantial constraint on the supply of private mortgage funds
 Growth in consumer-type time and savings at both banks and nonbank thrift institutions would be even more constrained under alternative C, whereas growth in such savings would begin to recover under alternative A

” (19) Alternative B would likely be seen by market participants as broadly consistent with their current expectations for the funds rate, because a 50 basis point easing of the target funds rate at this meeting appears to be their modal expectation and because the risk assessment would probably be read as indicating a substantial probability of further easing
 (20) If policymakers would prefer to move more aggressively to promote growth and mitigate downside risks, then they might choose to reduce the funds rate target by 75 basis points at this meeting, as in Alternative A
 (21) The first portion of the rationale for Alternative A is identical to that of Alternative B, but this alternative elaborates further about the prospects for inflation, pointing out that the projected moderation of inflation reflects “well-anchored inflation expectations, a projected leveling out of energy prices, and easing pressures on resource utilization,” and noting that “further increases in energy and commodity prices, as well as other factors, could put upward pressure on inflation
  As in Alternative B, the risk assessment states that the stance of policy should help promote moderate growth and mitigate the downside risks to economic activity

 (24) The discussion of the growth outlook in the statement proposed for Alternative B replaces the assessment in the April FOMC statement that economic growth remains weak by noting instead that overall economic activity continues to expand, and the firming in consumer spending data is cited as providing some support to aggregate demand
  The combination of an unchanged funds rate and the slight implicit tilt towards upside risks envisioned under Alternative B seems broadly consistent with these expectations, though it may cause investors to push back their expectations for the onset of policy tightening a bit

 Alternative A would characterize the downside risks to growth as outweighing upside risks to inflation, while Alternative B would not provide an assessment of the overall balance of risks
  Under Alternative C, the policy rate would be lowered 25 basis points to 5 percent, and the statement would indicate that the downside risks to economic growth outweigh the upside risks to inflation
  Alternative D would leave the target rate unchanged at 5¼ percent and report that the risks to growth and inflation are roughly balanced
  As for the rationale portion of the statement, Alternatives A, B, and C substantially modify the August 7 assessment of the outlook for growth and of the risks around that outlook in light of credit and housing market developments, using some of the wording from the August 17 statement
  In contrast, Alternative D recognizes the deterioration in financial conditions but repeats the judgment that moderate growth is likely over coming quarters
  In Alternative D, the inflation assessment is unchanged from the August 7 statement
  With such an outlook, and with inflation data continuing to be benign, members might see it as appropriate to counter the effect of tighter financial conditions by easing policy by 50 basis points at this meeting, as in Alternative B
 (21) The draft language of Alternative B repeats the observation from the August 7 FOMC statement that economic growth was moderate in the first half of the year
 Alternative B refrains from making any explicit characterization of the balance of risks, stating that “The Committee will continue to closely follow timely indicators of economic prospects and will act as needed” to attain its dual objectives
  If members find Alternative B attractive, but wish to adopt an explicit statement of balanced risks, then they might insert the sentence “After today’s action, the Committee judges that the downside risks to economic growth are now roughly balanced by the upside risks to inflation” at the start of the assessment of risk (22) Measuring market expectations is especially challenging in the current environment, but investors appear to place substantial odds on two possible target rate decisions at this meeting―a quarter-point cut and a half-point cut―and seem to envision cumulative easing of 75 to 100 basis points by the end of this year
  With Alternative B putting 50 basis points of easing in place and suggesting at least some possibility of further rate cuts, this alternative would likely prompt a modest decline in short-term interest rates and the foreign exchange value of the dollar might edge lower
 (23) If members are particularly pessimistic about the growth outlook, or see the downside risks as especially large, then they may prefer to both ease 50 basis points and explicitly point to downside risks in order to maximize the scope for further near-term policy action, as envisioned in Alternative A
 (24) The draft statement for Alternative A is similar to that for Alternative B, but with four main differences
  Second, Alternative A states that credit conditions and the housing correction “appear likely to exert appreciable restraint” on growth, which is stronger than the statement that they have “the potential  
  Finally, the draft for Alternative A is explicit that the downside risks to growth outweigh the upside risks to inflation
 (25) A 50 basis point rate cut and the adoption of the statement language in Alternative A would cause short-term interest rates to decline appreciably, as investors would be somewhat surprised by the magnitude of the policy action and would also infer that policy probably would be eased further
  As with Alternative B, the effect on equity, credit and term funding markets is ambiguous, but the negative growth outlook in this alternative might well spook investors and cause stock prices to fall and risk spreads to rise
  If the Committee finds the staff forecast to be both plausible and likely to be the best attainable outcome under the current difficult circumstances, then it may choose to ease policy 25 basis points at this meeting and issue a statement pointing to downside risks to the outlook, as in Alternative C

 Near-term growth, of course, would be somewhat more rapid under the easier money market conditions of alternative A and some- what less rapid under the tighter conditions of alternative C
 We would expect that the acceleration in money growth would be relatively modest under alternative C, however, since rising interest rates would be working to restrain money demand

 (11) The greater decline in the funds rate under alternative A, as compared with B, would intensify market expectations of declining interest rates
 (12) Among the assumptions we have made in working out the various monetary and interest rate relationships are: (1) moderate growth in large negotiable CD's, in some part reflecting the lower cost of those funds resulting from the recent reduction in marginal reserve requirements; (2) continued fairly strong short-term credit demands by business (at least in the early part of next year when inventory accumulation is expected to be strong), but only moderate business loan growth at banks unless the prime loan rate drops relative to the commercial paper rate; (3) no Treasury cash borrowing until March (unless foreign central banks find it necessary to redeem sizable amounts of Treasury specials) and sharply diminished Federal agency borrowing; and (4) moderate growth in consumer-type time deposits at banks (under alternative C) and more rapid growth as market interest rates decline (under alternatives B and A) as banks reduce time deposit offering rates only with a lag

7 Alternatives B and C would both involve some immediate further tightening of money market conditions
 (8) The short-run specifications for alternative C--which contemplate a near-term rise in the Federal funds rate to around 7-1/4 per cent (the mid-point of the range presented)--are thought to be consistent with a policy strategy geared to ultimate attainment of the 6-1/4 per cent mid-point of the Committee's 5--7-1/2 per cent long-run target range for M1
 (9) Alternative B--which contemplates a rise in the Federal funds rate during the intermeeting period to 6-3/4 per cent (the mid-point of the 6--7-1/2 per cent range presented)--is thought to be consistent with the first stage of a possible longer-run strategy that would hold M1 growth within the Committee's 5--7-1/2 per cent target range--but near the top end of that range
 (10) Alternative A is also consistent with a longer-run strategy that would allow growth in M1 near the top of the 5--7-1/2 per cent target range
 Therefore, the staff believes that this strategy would imply somewhat higher money market rates early in 1976 than under alternative B
 Under the unchanged money market conditions contemplated for alternative A, M1 growth in September is thought likely to rise to around a 7-1/2 per cent annual rate--resulting in an August-September average of about 6-1/4 per cent
 Under alternative B, the average 50 basis point advance in the funds rate would probably exert only a small dampening influence on the aggregates during the two month projection period; the average M1 growth rate for August-September might be reduced to nearly 5-3/4 per cent
 The steep rise in the funds rate contemplated under alternative C--to a 7-1/4 per cent average in the weeks immediately ahead--would be expected to exert a more pronounced restraint on near- term monetary growth
 (12) Although we anticipate that interest rates would need to rise substantially as the year progresses under any of the longer- run scenarios described above, the unchanged money market conditions of alternative A would probably encourage general interest rate stability for a time
 (13) The 50 basis points rise in the Federal funds rate contemplated under alternative B would probably trigger roughly commensurate advances in other short-term rates, and long-term markets would also come under renewed upward rate pressure
 Market repercussions from the rise in the Federal funds rate of 100 basis points or more contemplated under alternative C, of course, would be more extreme
 Increasingly, however, higher market interest rates will come to impinge on savings inflows to the intermediaries, and under alternative C this impact would probably be quite pronounced by the fourth quarter
 (15) In the August-September period, we would expect savings inflows to continue at the more moderate recent pace, but perhaps to be drifting lower, particularly under alternative C

 Given that assumption, alternative B proposes a 1-1/2 to 4-1/2 per cent range for M-1; this range assumes--unlike recent M-1 ranges--that the more likely growth of M-1 is at the mid-point rather than near 1/ Including a small allowance for introduction of POA accounts at S&L's this spring
 Alternatives A and C are more and less expansive, respectively
 However, the staff expects that the demand for M-1 will not be so strong over the year, on average, as to require a significant change in the prevailing Federal funds rate if M-1 growth at the midpoint of the alternative B range is to be achieved over the year 1979
 Alternative C, on the other hand, would probably involve an increase in the funds rate from current levels to nearly 11 per cent in the course of the year
 By contrast, alternative A would imply a reduction in the funds rate, reaching year-end levels about ¾ of a percentage point below the current level
 (13) Under alternative B, M-2 growth for the year ahead is expected to be in a 4½ to 7 per cent range and M-3 growth in a 6 to 8½ per cent range, 2½ percentage points lower, respectively, than their current longer-run ranges for the QIII '78 to QIII '79 period
 Growth of the broader monetary aggregates is, of course, slower under alternative C and more rapid under alternative A
 (14) The range for bank credit growth for alternative B has been reduced to 7½ to 10 per cent--1 percentage point lower than its current range, reflecting the slowing of economic activity, the sustained higher level of interest rates, and the cumulative reduction in bank liquidity
 Alternative I calls for a reduction in the Federal funds rate by ½ percentage point from the current level; such a decline over the intermeeting period would be most consistent with the alternative A longer-run range
 This alternative would be consistent with both the alternative B and C longer-run ranges
 Alternative III, which calls for increases in the funds rate to around the midpoint of a 10¼ to 11 per cent range, is most consistent with longer-run alternative C
 The table on page 14 provides such information for longer-run alternative B
 Growth for M-1 would have to be about 3 percentage points lower to reach the low end of the alternative B range of growth, and 3 points higher to reach the upper end

 Alternative C is based on a lower M-1 growth rate, and includes an M-2 growth closer to, though still above, the Committee's earlier objective
 Alternative A involves more rapid growth in the aggregates
8 6 to 9 (12) Alternative B involves acceleration in money growth rates over the balance of the year from their recent pace, with M-1 expanding at a 5 percent annual rate on average in November and December and M-2 at a 9 percent rate
 (13) The staff would expect that expansion in the aggregates as specified under alternative B could be attained by growth (at annual rates) in the family of reserve measures over November and December as follows: monetary base, 7 percent; total reserves,7 percent; and non- borrowed reserves, 15 percent
 (16) Pressures on thrift institutions are unlikely to ease over the next few weeks under alternative B
 (17) The specifications of alternative C involve slower growth in the monetary aggregates than alternative B, as indicated in the table in paragraph (11)
 On the assumption that adoption of this alternative would mean that the Committee desires greater assurance that growth rates for the aggregates will not be excessive, the upper limit of the proposed funds rate range has been raised slightly from that of alternative B
 Consistent with such an approach, the nonborrowed reserve path for this alternative has been constructed on the assumption that borrowings average a shade under $2 billion, implying growth in nonborrowed reserves of around 8¾ percent over November and December--considerably less than the alternative B pace
 (18) Adoption of alternative C would probably lead to some rebound in market interest rates, as expectations that interest rates had already peaked were disappointed
 Pressures on thrift institutions would be somewhat more intense than under alternative B, mortgage rates would probably rise a little further, and the bank prime rate would also be under further upward pressure
 Nevertheless, the higher rate levels than under alternative B would tend to hold down money demanded in early 1980, implying a decline of interest rates early in the new year if the Committee wishes to provide the reserves needed to keep M-1 in the first quarter of next year on the midpoint of its longer-run growth path--assumed for these purposes to be a 6 percent rate of growth
1/ (19) Provision of reserves needed to attain the specifications for the monetary aggregates presented under alternative A would appear to involve an easing in money market conditions
 The growth in the monetary base and total reserves over November and December implied by that alternative--at 7¾ and 7½ percent, annual rates, respectively--are only slightly more rapid than under alternative B
 The funds rate range proposed for this alternative is 10½ to 15½ percent, involving a reduction in the lower limit as compared with alternative B
 (20) The approach to open market operations of alternative A would exert considerably downward pressure on market interest rates generally as more and more participants came to believe rates had peaked
 This decline of interest rates would ease cost pressures on banks and thrift institutions, but would not, given present ceiling rates, substantially increase deposit flows to thrifts, relative to alternative B, even if the funds rate began to approach its 10½ percent alternative A lower limit
 (21) The monetary aggregates targeted over the last two months of the year under alternative A would not lead to growth in the monetary aggregates for the year 1979 very much different from that of alternative B, but the lower interest rates associated with this alternative might tend to moderate the expected recession in economic activity and tend to increase the quantity of money demanded in early 1980",0,1979-11-20,3,[]

  The third scenario corresponds to Alternative C in the Policy Alternatives section, in which the total quantity of agency MBS purchases is reduced by $250 billion to $1 trillion
  Purchases of agency MBS are scheduled to be completed by the end of this year; however, due to expected settlement lags and prepayments, agency MBS holdings under Alternatives A and B peak at $1
  For the Alternative C scenario, although total purchases are less, the pattern for agency MBS holdings is similar, and holdings peak at $960 billion
  In the baseline scenario and Alternative A, reserve balances decline through the end of the forecast period, while in Alternative C, a resumption of open market purchases is required in 2016 to maintain reserve balances at a level of $25 billion

 Under alternative B, a federal funds rate of around 8 percent would be consistent with the average relationship that prevailed over the first half of this year between borrowing and the funds rate-discount rate spread

 (13) The tightening of reserve positions under alternative C immediately following the discount rate hike would be somewhat surprising to market participants and the associated 1/2 percentage point increase in the funds rate probably would show through nearly fully in private money market rates
 (14) With the higher interest rates of alternative C, M2 is pro- jected to record only 3 percent growth over August and September
 Growth of M3, by contrast, would probably not be damped enough under alternative C to move below its midpoint, even by year-end

  The wording of Alternative A is more tentative than that of Alternative B
 Alternative C offers the most upbeat summary of current conditions by omitting the list of factors that are restraining household spending, a list that Alternatives A and B carry over from the March statement
 Alternative B repeats the words of the March statement:  “With substantial resource slack continuing to restrain cost pressures and longer-term inflation expectations stable, inflation is likely to be subdued for some time
” Alternative C highlights recent increases in energy prices but notes that inflation has remained subdued
” Alternative A observes that longer-term inflation expectations have been stable but also notes that recent data suggest inflation has been trending down in response to substantial resource slack; moreover, Alternative A indicates that the Committee expects inflation to remain “quite subdued

” Alternative C modifies the final words to “for some time,” signaling an earlier increase in the funds rate
  Alternative A sharpens the conditionality in the extended period language and suggests that an increase in the federal funds rate is likely to come later than markets now expect
 After observing that inflation has been trending down in response to substantial slack, Alternative A says:  “To promote a more robust economic recovery in a context of price stability, the Committee anticipates maintaining the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent for an extended period—until economic conditions such as appreciably higher rates of resource utilization, increasing inflation pressures, or rising inflation expectations warrant a less accommodative monetary policy

 April 22, 2010 Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 39 of 59 THE  CASE  FOR  ALTERNATIVE  B If policymakers expect the pace of economic recovery to be moderate and inflation to be subdued for some time, as they did at the time of the Committee’s March meeting, and if they still judge that the potential benefits of further purchases of longer-term assets would not outweigh the costs, then they might choose to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate and reiterate that economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period, as in Alternative B
  Alternative B offers a choice between the two approaches
 As noted earlier, the Committee might conclude that the statement should contain neither version of the fourth paragraph of alternative B; policymakers may judge it better to communicate reinvestment policy in the minutes or in the directive
 Language along the lines of that proposed in Alternative B—if it did not include an announcement that the Committee will stop reinvesting the proceeds of maturing Treasury securities—probably would result in little change in bond yields, equity prices, or the foreign exchange value of the dollar
 April 22, 2010 Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 43 of 59 THE  CASE  FOR  ALTERNATIVE  C If policymakers are confident that a sustainable economic recovery is now under way and see substantial upside risks to the medium-term inflation outlook—or significant risks that financial imbalances could emerge—in the absence of prompt monetary policy adjustments, then they might choose to issue a statement such as that proposed in Alternative C
 If so, they may choose to announce those decisions—and the reasons for the decisions—by issuing a statement like that in Alternative C
 The adoption of Alternative C would surprise financial market participants, who appear to expect only small changes in the statement at this meeting, in part because the minutes of the FOMC’s March meeting emphasized the conditionality and flexibility of the existing language and noted that it would not limit the Committee’s April 22, 2010 Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) 45 of 59 ability to commence monetary policy tightening promptly if necessary
 Thus the adoption of Alternative C would surprise investors on several fronts
 Investors likely would read the statement of Alternative C as signaling earlier policy firming than they had previously anticipated and hence short-term interest rates would increase
  If so, policymakers may want to issue a statement like that in Alternative A in an effort to bring market expectations for the federal funds rate into closer alignment with their own
  If policymakers see a significant risk of such outcomes, they may judge it appropriate to signal, as in Alternative A, that monetary policy will remain unusually accommodative until measures of resource utilization increase appreciably or inflation pressures rise
 If so, they could include paragraph 4 of Alternative A in the statement
 A statement like Alternative A—with or without paragraph 4—would come as a surprise to financial market participants, who appear to anticipate only minor updating of the language

 (14) As noted earlier, both alternatives C and D contemplate lower longer-run growth ranges for the monetary aggregates than alternative B
 While the reduction is substantially larger in the case of alternative D, in either case the Committee may wish to consider a rise in the funds rate between now and the next meeting to around 5-7/8 per cent, the midpoint of a 5½-6¼ per cent range
 Even under the short-run specifications of alternative C, there would appear to be sufficient leeway between ceiling rates in time certificates maturing in four years or more and yields on market instruments to enable banks to retain the funds involved in maturing ""wild card"" certificates
 They could, however, lose some funds to thrift institutions, which can offer somewhat higher (16) The rise in market rates of interest over the next few weeks accompanying short-run alternative C (or D) would probably carry the 3-month Treasury bill rate above the 5¼ per cent ceiling rate on thrift institution savings deposits
 Under alternative C we would expect that thrifts would become less willing to commit funds to the mortgage market at near the recent pace
 (17) If the Committee wishes to achieve the midpoints of the longer-run growth ranges for alternative C--indexed by an M-1 range of 4-6 per cent--the staff expects that the funds rate would need to rise only a little further and would top out at around 6¼ per cent in the first quarter of 1978
 The greater restraint on growth of the monetary aggregates over the longer-run under alternative D would require a larger rise of interest rates to levels closer to those projected at the previous FOMC meeting
 (18) Alternative A contemplates an easing of money market conditions between now and the next Committee meeting
 But assuming that incoming economic news does not cast doubt on the fundamental strength of the economy, interest rate declines may be limited over the next month or so as corporations and State and local governments increase market borrowing in anticipation of higher interest rates later on and as the market focuses on the Treasury's large fall cash (19) We would expect the funds rate to begin rising in the fall under alternative A if growth in the aggregates is to remain around the midpoints of the longer-run ranges for this alternative
 Given the degree of near-term ease assumed, the funds rate by spring may have to be at or slightly above the level assumed at that time under alternative B in order to constrain monetary growth in the first half of next year to the indicated rate
 Meanwhile, however, for most of the one-year period ahead, short- term rates would have been lower than under alternative B, with consequent relatively easier credit and liquidity conditions at banks and other Directive language (20) Given below are alternatives for the operational paragraphs of the directive
 As suggested below, the particular language needed in the opening lines of the money market formulation would depend on the specific conditions sought; the three alternatives shown--calling, respectively, for somewhat easier, prevailing, and somewhat firmer money market conditions-- are intended to be associated with the specifications discussed in the pre- ceding section under alternatives A, B, and C",3,1977-07-19,5,"["" The specifi- cations of alternative D, however, involve a larger adjustment in the ranges, with the midpoint of the growth range for M-1 reduced to 4\xc2\xbe per cent over the QII '77-QII '78 period"", ' While the reduction is substantially larger in the case of alternative D, in either case the Committee may wish to consider a rise in the funds rate between now and the next meeting to around 5-7/8 per cent, the midpoint of a 5\xc2\xbd-6\xc2\xbc per cent range', ' The greater restraint on growth of the monetary aggregates over the longer-run under alternative D would require a larger rise of interest rates to levels closer to those projected at the previous FOMC meeting']"

5 (13) Alternative B is designed to attain the upper limit of the 2½ to 5½ percent range for M1 by June
 This approach, like alternative A, would be consistent with growth for 1982 at around the midpoint of the longer-run range
 Alternative C, which involves about a 2½ percent annual rate of growth over the last two months of the current quarter, is designed to reach the upper end of the M1 range by September
 (14) Alternative D specifies a 4 percent annual rate of growth for February and March
 With such a rebasing of the 2½ to 5½ percent longer-run range for 1982, the specifications of alternative D if extended for the year would bring M1 into the upper half of the rebased range by the fourth quarter of this year
 If alternative C were adopted in conjunction with a rebasing of the long-run range, growth by the fourth quarter would be around the midpoint of the range
 Given the slowing in M1 growth that is targeted for the balance of the year, the staff expects that M2 growth over the year as a whole will fall within its longer-run range for alternatives A, B, and C, and will be at the top of the range under the more expansive alternative D
 Such behavior would be consistent with the unchanged income-velocity of M2 over the past two (16) Alternative B calls for growth in Ml at about a 1 percent annual rate over the two months January to March, a considerable decelera- tion from the rapid pace of the previous three months

 Thus, unless the downward shift in money demand halts, or is reversed, the odds are that the proposed alternatives, particularly alternatives A and B, may involve further downward pressures on short-term interest rates

 Alternatives B and C, which involve reducing the Committee's fourth quarter target for M1-B set at the last meeting, would tend to limit downward pressures on interest rates between now and year-end and possibly work toward a smoother transition to targets for 1982
 Because it is so late in 1981, the impact on annual growth of the aggregates this year from adoption of either of these alternatives rather than continuing with alternative A would be relatively small, as may be noted from the detailed tables on pp
 (13) Alternative B would require expansion in total reserves at a 6 percent annual rate over the last two months of the year, while growth in reserves under alternative C would be at a 4½ percent annual rate
 The staff believes short-term rate declines under alternative B could carry the funds rate into the 10 to 12 percent range
 The aggre- gates specifications of alternative C are likely to be associated with a funds rate in a 12 to 14 percent range, implying the that the funds rate could drop below the current discount rate
 (14) Declines in market interest rates, both short- and long-term, generally would be more modest under alternatives B and C than under alter- native A, and potential downward pressure on the dollar in exchange markets would be reduced
 Under alternative C, that might also develop, but it would be less certain as the weight of Treasury financings and possible market disappointment about the likely course of the funds rate (and hence of dealer financing costs) would work to hold bill and other short-term rates up
 (15) The possibility of the funds rate dropping significantly below the current 13 percent discount rate introduces complications in the design of reserve paths, particularly for alternatives A and B
 The nonborrowed reserve path for alternative C, the alternative involving the least expansion in reserves, might be initially constructed on the basis of $400 million in borrowing
 The more reserve expansion of alternatives A and B logically should be based on lower levels of borrowing, but whether set at frictional levels or higher, we would expect the demand for reserves soon to fall well short of supply",0,1981-11-17,4,[]

 The assessment of risks portion of the statement could again indicate that, with “appropriate policy,” the risks to both of the Committee’s dual objectives should be kept roughly balanced and that policy accommodation can be removed at a measured (17) Release of the statement for Alternative C would lead market participants to boost noticeably their expectations for policy tightening",0,2005-12-13,5,[]
