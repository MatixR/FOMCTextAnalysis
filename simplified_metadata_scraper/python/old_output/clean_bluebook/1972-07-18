preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned 
versions text-searchable.2   Though a stringent quality assurance process was 
employed, some imperfections may remain.

format.  All scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced 
tilting) and lightly cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other 
blemishes caused after initial printing).

Recent developments
(1) The rate of growth in reserves available to support private
nonbank deposits has been fluctuating within the 4-1/2--8-1/2 per cent
annual rate range for June-July adopted at the last Committee meeting.
Estimates have been as low as 6 per cent, but most recent figures indicate
a rate of growth of 8-1/2 per cent for the period, as shown in Table 1
attached. Over the three statement weeks ending July 12, RPD has been
sustained by large excess reserves averaging $265 million, about $115
million more than expected.
(2) With private demand deposits coming in below expectations
in the latter part of June, M 1 expanded at a 4-1/2 per cent annual rate
for the month, about one and a half percentage points below the rate built
into the alternative B path of the last Committee meeting. In the first
two statement weeks of July, however, there has apparently been a sharp
pick-up in the rate of expansion, and the level of M1 moved substantially
above the path levels specified earlier. It seems possible that the late
June weakness in narrowly defined money supply temporarily reflected in
some part either direct or indirect effects of large outflows of dollars
from the U. S.
(3) Growth of M2 from May to June--at a 10 per cent annual
rate--was close to earlier anticipations. Growth in time deposits other
July 14, 1972
than large CD's was the same as earlier projected. In early July, however,
such deposits are showing somewhat more strength than anticipated.
(4) The bank credit proxy in June expanded at a 4-1/2 per cent
annual rate, about as projected. The outstanding level of U. S. Government
deposits dropped sharply from May to June, although the average level of
such deposits in June turned out to be slightly higher than expected. In
recent weeks, the level of U. S. Government deposits has exceeded earlier
projections by substantially larger amounts, partly reflecting the sizable
volume of additional cash obtained by the Treasury through sale of special
securities to foreign central banks.
(5) Short-term interest rates, particularly rates on private
market instruments and the bank prime rate, have drifted upward since the
last Committee meeting. After reaching a recent peak of 4.14 per cent in
early July, the 3-month bill, however, was most recently quoted around 3.95
per cent, little changed from the time of the previous meeting. The Federal
funds rate has edged up from an area just under 4-1/2 per cent to around
4-5/8 per cent in the two statement weeks ending July 12. Meanwhile,
long-term interest rates have been generally stable.
(6) Recent tendencies for bill rates to decline have reflected
market anticipations of large demands for bills from foreign official
institutions acquiring dollars in support of foreign exchange rates.
Large foreign demands falling directly on the bill market have not yet
materialized, however. During the past statement week the Treasury put
on $670 million of specials, and the System sold $630 million of bills
directly to foreign account as technical factors, principally float,
provided considerably more reserves than anticipated or than needed to
meet reserve objectives. Foreign bill purchases in the market, coming
mainly on last Thursday and Friday, amounted to only $165 million. An
additional $2-3/4 billion of foreign buying is now in prospect for the
first three days of next week. Some of this may be invested in Treasury
specials; some may be accommodated through sales of bills from the
Exchange Stabilization Fund; and some may have to be purchased in the

Prospective developments
(8) Patterns of monetary aggregates and money market conditions
summarized below (and detailed in tables on the two following pages) reflect
essentially the same alternatives presented to the FOMC at its last meeting.
For the third quarter as a whole growth rates in M1 and the Federal funds
rate range are identical, but there are some differences in other monetary

(9) Growth in M1 is expected to be considerably more rapid in
July than in June--around a 10-1/2 per cent annual rate--in view of the
apparent sharp rise of $5 billion in demand deposits in the first two weeks
of the month. The size of the increase--the largest two week increase in
1/ In addition, the level of M1 attained by September is lower than presented
at the previous meeting because rates of growth are linked to a June base
which fell somewhat short of levels estimated earlier.

the history of the series-probably reflects faulty weekly seasonal adjustments
and other temporary aberrations in a period containing a mid-year statement
date, a major holiday, and a somewhat larger than normal amount of Treasury
checks paid after the end of the fiscal year. We have projected a con-
siderable lowering in the average level of demand deposits in the latter part
of the month. A return to more normal conditions, and given the reserve
paths specified for the various alternatives, would lead to a more moderate
rate of M1 growth over the balance of the quarter.
(10) With respect to money and short-term market conditions,
the staff's best current estimate is that the Federal funds rate will need
to move up from the recent 4-1/2--4-5/8 per cent range--given rising trans-
action demands for cash associated with expansion in GNP--in attaining the
reserve path and aggregates of alternatives B or C, with a more pronounced
rise likely under alternative C. However, bill rates may not increase
much, and under some circumstances could decline, over the next few weeks.
The Government's near-term cash needs remain relatively small. Moreover,
the recent pattern of dollar outflows, if continued, will increase potential
foreign demand for bills. Between now and the next meeting of the Committee
a 3-month bill rate in a 3-3/4--4-1/2 per cent range might be anticipated
under conditions of alternative B, assuming the funds rate in that
alternative does not move much, if any, above 4-3/4 per cent.
(11) The Treasury will announce on July 26 terms on which they will
refund $2.3 billion of publicly held obligations maturing in mid-August and
probably also $1.8 billion of September maturities. Because Treasury cash
has been buttressed by recent sales of special issues to foreign official
accounts, it is not clear that they would have to raise much, if any, new
cash at the time of the August refunding. While our staff estimates still
indicate a somewhat less comfortable position than do Treasury estimates, the
new cash that our estimates suggest will be needed by the end of August might
be obtained through further issuance of special securities to foreigners. In
the refunding, the Treasury might well choose to offer intermediate- and
longer-term securities in view of the relatively calm state of capital markets.
If the Treasury does emphasize such offerings, this would be likely to moderate
the usual seasonal upward pressures on short-term markets, particularly if
there is no sizable announced bill offering for cash.
(12) In the absence to date of substantial upward pressures on
short-term market rates, net inflows of time deposits other than large CD's
have remained relatively strong. It does appear from early figures for July
that the rate of expansion in the current month will drop somewhat from the
advanced June pace, but not by as much as we had earlier expected. Thus,
we have revised up our estimate of growth in such time deposits for the
third quarter, with the result that projections of M2 growth for that
quarter are somewhat stronger than at the time of the last meeting.
(13) Growth in the bank credit proxy is projected to remain
relatively low from June to July. Thereafter, the rate of expansion is
expected to accelerate as the outstanding level of U. S. Government deposits
rises. Sizable further sales of special issues to foreigners in the weeks
immediately ahead, however, could of course alter this projected pattern
of U. S. Government deposits and the credit proxy.
(14) Bank business loans, following what appears to be a
transitory drop in June, are expected to resume their rise in the months
ahead in view of the continued substantial increase projected for economic
activity, and for inventory accumulation in particular. If loan demands
strengthen as expected, and assuming bank sources of funds become more
costly and show only moderate growth (as is most likely under alternative C),
banks would probably become more reluctant buyers of longer-term issues of
securities. At the same time, demands for credit in bond markets are
expected to remain around recent levels over the next few months. Thus,
it would appear that bond markets will be under some upward interest rate
pressure unless there is a favorable shift in expectations. However, such
upward pressures may not develop over the weeks ahead if bill rates remain
around current levels. And over the longer run, the still wide spread of
long over short rates seems to permit scope for a rise in short rates
without significant effects on long markets.
(15) In the fourth quarter, assuming an M1 growth of around
6 per cent, short- and long-term interest rate increases are likely to be more
pronounced since Treasury cash borrowing is expected to rise much more
than seasonally at that time. Also, demand for money for transactions
purposes is likely to remain strong in the fourth quarter if growth in
nominal GNP accelerates somewhat further, as projected, from the current
10 per cent pace. On the other hand, aggregate money demand is likely
to be moderated to some degree by the lagged effects of interest rate
increases over recent months and in prospect.
Proposed directive
(16) Three alternative formulations for the operational
paragraph of the directive are presented below. They might be associated
with the correspondingly lettered patterns of growth in the aggregates
described in the preceding section.
(17) Alternative A.
"To implement this policy, while taking account of
[DEL: possible] THE FORTHCOMING Treasury financing, developments
in capital markets, and international developments, the Com-
mittee seeks to achieve bank reserve and money market con-
ditions that will support [DEL: moderate] SOMEWHAT FASTER growth
in monetary aggregates over the months ahead."
(18) Alternative B.
"To implement this policy, while taking account of [DEL: possible]
THE FORTHCOMING Treasury financing, developments in capital
markets, and international developments, the Committee seeks
to achieve bank reserve and money market conditions that will
support moderate growth in monetary aggregates over the months
(19) Alternative C.
"To implement this policy, while taking account of
[DEL: possible] THE FORTHCOMING Treasury financing, developments in
capital markets, and international developments, the Committee
seeks to achieve bank reserve and money market conditions that
will support [DEL: moderate] SOMEWHAT SLOWER growth in monetary aggregates
over the months ahead."
(20) In all three alternatives it is proposed to retain the
instruction to take account of both capital market and international
developments (as well as Treasury financing) for essentially the same
purposes as they serve in the current directive. In particular, the
reference to international developments can be interpreted as calling
for minimizing downward pressures on bill rates to the extent consistent
with the specifications for reserves and monetary aggregates and the
Federal funds rate constraint desired by the Committee.
