MONEY MARKET AND RESERVE RELATIONSHIPS
Money markets
Recent developments. Key short-term interest rates have risen
sharply since late July. Since the Committee's last meeting, the
Treasury bill rate has moved up 33 basis points to 5.10 per cent. Some
trading in the Federal funds market has been reported at rates as high
as 6 per cent, and two short-term Federal Agency issues were marketed
this week at 6 per cent yields. Rates on dealer loans posted by New
York banks touched a new high of 6-5/8 per cent and CD issuing rates
have continued to press against the 5-1/2 per cent ceiling, with
secondary market quotations advancing to 5-3/4 per cent and even 6 per
cent. The atmosphere of tightness in the money markets was relieved
only briefly at the end of recent statement weeks when the Federal
funds market eased temporarily and some associated declines in very
short-term bill rates occurred.
It seems possible that market anticipations, which have been
a major factor in the recent sharp advance in various short-term rates,
may have somewhat outrun current supply-demand pressures in the money
markets. The largest upward adjustments in short-term rates recently
have occurred following various announcements, including that of the
$3.0 billion tax bill auction, the prime loan rate increase, and the
Board's action raising reserve requirements against time deposits.

Nevertheless, the cumulative impact of underlying supply-demand pressures
has also contributed to higher yields.
Net borrowed reserves have fluctuated in a $300 - $465 million
range in recent weeks and in the three statement weeks since July 27
have averaged $400 million, up from $365 million in the previous 4 weeks.
Member bank borrowings have averaged about $765 million since late July,
some $25 million above their average for the previous month.
Prospective developments. Probably the most critical factor
in the immediate outlook for money and capital market developments,
aside from the general uncertainty afflicting markets, is the shape of
bank portfolio adjustments that may be undertaken in preparation for
mid-September pressures arising from possible CD run-offs, the reserve
requirement increase, and prospects for heavy tax-date and other loan
demands. These anticipatory adjustments could include, for example,
bank liquidation of intermediate-term Government securities, Agency
issues and/or municipal securities, and a temporary reinvestment in
short-term uses, such as Federal funds and very short Treasury bills.
Such adjustments by banks -- and similar portfolio switches by other
investors -- could produce diverging interest rate movements, quite
apart from any changes in marginal reserve availability or actual CD
run-offs that might develop before the tax date.
In consequence of such adjustments, Treasury bill rates would
probably rise less than other short-term rates, and could decline in the
absence of new psychological shocks to the market. This assessment
- 2 - August 19, 1966
CONFIDENTIAL (FR) - 3 - August 19, 1966
assumes peak pressures on money market banks will not occur before the
September tax and dividend period, when the new reserve requirements on
time deposits are also scheduled to go into effect. Further, pressures
that might arise in the bill market from bank sales of March and April
tax bills should be relieved to some extent by large System purchases
in late August and early September. On the basis of current projections,
these purchases could aggregate between $1 and $1-1/4 billion, although
a failure to settle the airline strike would increase float above the
levels assumed in the projections and cut back the System's purchases.
Finally, the short bill market probably will benefit from CD liquidations
by liquidity-sensitive corporations and other investors.
Over the three-week interval until the next meeting of the
Committee, therefore, yields on 3-month bills could drift downward
from the 5.10 - 5.15 per cent level, assuming that net borrowed reserves
1/
range around $450 million. Under these circumstances, the Federal
funds market would be subjected to conflicting interests, as pressures
develop in some parts of the banking system while others are accumulating
precautionary liquidity. The fund rate, therefore, may fluctuate widely
from day to day, probably in a range of from 5-1/2 to over 6 per cent.
But other money market rates -- including those on longer
bills -- could well continue to work higher. And intermediate maturities
probably will continue to face very difficult market conditions, especially
1/ Exclusive of any additional adjustment assistance credits discussed
in the draft memorandum on coordination of discount administration

if there are additional sales of participation certificates. There
exists the possibility of discontinuities developing in the pattern
of rate movements for particular issues from time to time.
If monetary policy moves in the direction of gradually increased
firmness in money market conditions (one reflection of which would be
2/
net borrowed reserves ranging upwards from $500 million ), markets
would be affected both by the ensuing tighter bank positions and by
the impact of the deeper net reserve figures on market psychology.
Under these conditions 3-month bill rates would be expected to move
generally higher, perhaps within a 5.00 - 5.25 per cent range, and
associated yields on other money market instruments probably would be
correspondingly higher. Federal fund and dealer loan rates would
undoubtedly reach new highs (perhaps as high as 6-1/2 and 7 per cent,
respectively) toward the end of the period, as tax, dividend, and
reserve requirement pressures begin to converge.
Under either monetary policy assumption, the Staff believes
that long-term interest rates will rise further in the period ahead.
Heavy capital market financing prospects, the expected further loss of
bank support for municipals, and widespread anticipations of tighter
monetary policy and substantial CD run-offs point to significantly
higher yields in all sectors of the long-term market.
The potential for cumulating CD run-offs at the major banks,
in fact, poses problems in interpreting current money market statistics.
Given current rate relationships, such run-offs could commence at any
2/ See footnote 1 on page 3.
CONFIDENTIAL (FR) - 5 - August 19, 1966
time, but are likely to be most marked during the September tax and
dividend period. And if hard-hit banks borrow temporarily from the
Federal Reserve to meet such run-offs in a period of increasing loan
demands, the resulting bulge in member bank borrowings would complicate
open market operations. Maintaining a given net borrowed reserve target
under such circumstances would result in large amounts of total reserves
being supplied and also a significant redistribution of reserves. In
this process, net reserve positions would be eased for banks not suffering
CD run-offs, and some money market rates might move lower. To avoid
such easing tendencies, it would be necessary to absorb by open market
sales a major portion of the reserves provided through the discount
window, even in the face of deepened net borrowed reserve figures.
The developments outlined in the preceding paragraph would
follow whether or not the proposed additional assistance program is put
into operation, but the operation of the program would likely produce
larger and longer-lived borrowing by the hard-hit banks and consequently
require more offsetting open market operations to counter easing tendencies
in some money market rates.
The alternative policy of allowing net borrowed reserves to
rise more or less in line with member bank borrowings could have a
sharp psychological effect on market attitudes and market rates. This
effect might be moderated if it were understood that the change repre-
sented a deliberate shift in reserve management practices, toward providing
more of the needed expansion in aggregate reserves through borrowing relative
CONFIDENTIAL (FR)
to open market operations. To the extent that it proves possible to
distinguish between "regular" and "special program" borrowings, it may
be possible to retain the net borrowed reserve concept (in adjusted form)
as a useful indicator of marginal reserve pressures.
Reserve flows, bank credit, and money
Recent developments. Daily average deposit figures now avail-
able for all of July indicate slightly smaller growth in bank credit than
estimated in the last Blue Book. Nevertheless, a 10 per cent annual
rate of growth was posted for the month, despite persistent downward
drift in the weekly figures following sharp expansion in late June and
early July. The moderation in growth of member bank deposits shown by
the weekly figures has continued through mid-August, and appears to
have been balanced on the asset side by greater than normal repayments
of security and finance company loans, continued bank sales of U.S.
Governments, and most recently, a considerable weakening in business
loan expansion, especially at New York City banks. These tendencies
reflect in part the short-term nature of June tax-period borrowing,
and also the shifting of corporate withholding tax payments from
August to July and June.
It should be pointed out, however, that the average deposit
figures probably significantly understated average expansion in bank
credit in July and early August. In this period, U.S. banks borrowed
over $900 million of existing dollar deposits from their foreign
branches, a development which was not necessarily offset by lower
- 6 - August 19, 1966
CONFIDENTIAL (FR) - 7 - August 19, 1966
deposits in the United States. Such borrowing, if added to domestic
deposit expansion, would have raised the bank credit growth estimates
by about two percentage points (annual rate) over the last six or seven
Movements of funds between private and U.S. Government demand
deposits were unusually large in July and in the first half of August.
Since late June, when large corporations began accelerating payments
of employee withholding taxes to the Treasury, the weekly deposit data
have shown relatively large week-to-week shifts. On balance, however,
private demand deposits have declined moderately over this period.
Time deposits grew more rapidly in July than in the preceding
two months, and weekly estimates through August 17 indicate only a
slight reduction from the July rate. Most of this strength in time
deposit expansion has been in the country banks, which apparently
are less exposed to competition from the money market. In the latest
week ending August 17, however, reserve city banks reported a large
increase in total time and savings deposits, probably reflecting some
success in advance funding of the heavy September CD maturities.
Total reserves increased about 9 per cent in July following
3/
little change in May and June. Nonborrowed and required reserves
both increased less than total reserves, as excess reserves and
borrowings increased, in part because of the effect of the airline
strike on float and on the distribution of reserves.
3/ The aggregate reserve series have been revised to take account of
the change in requirements in July and of changes in seasonal factors.
CONFIDENTIAL (FR) - 8 - August 19, 1966
Prospective developments. Projection of member bank deposits
and reserves in coming weeks and months will be influenced greatly by
Treasury financing operations, the continuing shift to accelerated tax
payment schedules and the banking system's experience in handling CD
maturities at increasingly unfavorable differentials in rates. The
latter is perhaps the pivotal factor that makes projections more than
usually uncertain. Large CD run-offs, on the one hand, would tend to
hold down the rate of bank credit expansion. But to the extent that
CD funds may be diverted to demand deposit balances rather than to
market instruments, the reduction in bank credit expansion would be
less and there would be some offset to the decline in required reserves.
The ways in which banks obtain needed reserves could produce
divergent movements also in nonborrowed and total reserves over the
coming month. For example, if banks come to the discount window for
temporary accommodation, and if any easing in money market conditions
is countered by open market operations, net borrowed reserves will
increase and growth in nonborrowed reserves would be slower than growth
in required and total reserves. On the other hand, if bank and investor
adjustments in September bring such adverse money market reactions as
to require System injection of nonborrowed reserves, it is conceivable
that borrowings might not increase very much. Open market injections
of reserves would tend to create excesses, which then could be tapped
in the Federal funds market by banks experiencing CD run-offs.
CONFIDENTIAL (FR)
August projections indicate a relatively small monthly average
increase in the credit proxy -- about 2 to 3 per cent. Time deposit
expansion is expected to slow, but for the month on average there should
still be substantial growth -- around 13 per cent. A large reduction in
U.S. Government demand deposits is projected, despite the $3.0 billion
financing to be credited to tax and loan accounts on August 26. Loan
repayments and credit rationing are expected to hold private demand
deposit expansion down on average to about a 3 per cent annual rate.
Consequently, required reserves may decline about 2 per cent.
Assuming no appreciable further change in money market condi-
tions, and also assuming no significant run-off in CD's, a sizable increase
in bank credit and deposits would be expected in September. Both the
credit proxy and required reserves would be expected to increase about
8 per cent. Private demand deposits would be expected to increase 14 per
cent, reflecting large temporary shifts from Government deposits in the
second half of August and in September. Time deposits would be expected
to expand more slowly, at about an 8 per cent annual rate compared to
13 per cent in August, reflecting the passing of the interest-crediting
period and the assumed leveling off in the volume of outstanding CD's.
Even under present money market rate relationships, however,
a more likely assumption is that there will be a CD run-off in September.
If money market conditions continue to tighten, it would not be
unreasonable to anticipate a large run-off, perhaps as much as 10 per
cent or $1.8 billion over the course of the month, although any
- 9 - August 19, 1966
CONFIDENTIAL (FR) - 10 - August 19, 1966
quantification is necessarily sheer conjecture at this time. If the
funds flowed largely to market securities, and the reserves released
were absorbed by open market operations, a CD liquidation on this
scale would reduce bank credit expansion for the month by about 5
percentage points (from 8 per cent to 3 per cent annual rate). Assuming
some offsetting expansion in demand deposit growth, total required
reserves would rise on the order of 7 per cent annual rate.
