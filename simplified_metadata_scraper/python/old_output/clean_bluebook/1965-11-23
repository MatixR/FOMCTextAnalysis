Prefatory Note 
 
 
The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version available 
based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the Board 
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was created 
through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned 
versions text-searchable.2   Though a stringent quality assurance process was 
employed, some imperfections may remain. 
 
Please note that some material may have been redacted from this document if that

1  In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic 
format.  All scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced 
tilting) and lightly cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other 
blemishes caused after initial printing). 
 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optical character recognition computer program (OCR) 
first created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, 
staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.  Please note that the numbers and text in charts and 
tables were not reliably recognized by the OCR process and were not checked or corrected by staff.

MONEY MARKET AND RESERVE RELATIONSHIPS
Money markets
Recent developments. Treasury bill rates have shown little
net change since early November, with the 3-month issue fluctuating in
a 4.04 to 4.10 per cent range, and with rates on most other short-term
instruments changing little. Most recently, net investment demand for
bills has improved somewhat despite continued bank selling. Banks
have been sellers of bills as tax and loan balances were drawn down,
but bank reserve positions were not expecially taut and this has tended
to moderate money market pressures.
Thus far in November, Federal funds have traded at an effective
rate of 4-1/8 per cent on every day except one, but 4-1/4 per cent
trading has generally been light. Member bank borrowings were quite
low in the week ending November 10, but returned to almost $500 million
in the next statement week. The power failure at the end of the
November 10 week added to excess reserves at that time through its
effect on float, and this contributed to the free reserve figure of
almost $100 million in that period. The return to net borrowed
reserves of $200 million in the following week was not accompanied
by any sharp tightening of money market conditions, partly because
major money market banks carried over large cumulative reserve sur-
Prospective developments. With net borrowed reserves of
around $100 to $150 million--and no change in other policy instruments--

bill rates are likely to remain at the upper end of their recent
band and may move slightly higher in the weeks ahead; a likely range
for the 3-month bill would be 4.05 per cent to about 4.15 per cent.
Some build-up in dealer bill inventories and somewhat higher dealer
financing costs may occur over the next few weeks as the banking system
encounters peak seasonal loan demands and banks sell off their awards
in the recent $2.5 billion auction of June tax bills. Pressures on
dealers and banks will be intensified by corporate needs for funds
around the mid-December tax and dividend dates, particularly if rate
relationships make it difficult for banks to replace heavy CD maturities.
In late November and early December pressures on short-term rates
will be moderated by sizable System purchases of bills.
In the corporate and U.S. Government bond markets, there
appears to be some feeling--although by no means universal--that
yields may have risen to temporarily sustainable trading levels.
Absent any major new addition to the financing calendar or any
overt policy change or increased expectations of such a change, these
bond yields may move little in the immediate weeks ahead. In the
municipal market, however, upward pressure on yields persists.
Reserve flows, bank credit and money
Recent developments. Final data for October confirm that
both nonborrowed and total reserves rose during the month--after de-
clining in the two previous months--but the increases were slightly
less than earlier thought. The downward revision reflects a slower
pace of reserve growth in late October, which apparently continued
CONFIDENTIAL (FR) -3-
into early November, as Treasury deposits declined and as banks
concomitantly became large net sellers of U.S. Government securities.
Prospective developments. Nonborrowed reserves, seasonally
adjusted, may still be expected to expand moderately over all of November,
at about a 2.5 per cent annual rate or perhaps somewhat higher. Total
reserves are likely to show less expansion in November than non-
borrowed--and may even decline--as banks had reduced borrowings in
late October and early November.
The tax and loan account financing of the $2.5 billion in
new June tax bills will lead to a bulge in reserve expansion toward
the end of November. With higher average Government deposits expected
to require substantially more reserves in December, and with moderate
further expansion expected in private deposits, substantial growth
in both nonborrowed and total reserves is expected in the final month
of the year.
The System is likely to supply about $1 billion in reserves
during the two statement weeks ending December 8 as float declines,
currency flows into circulation, and required reserves expand. In
the following two statement weeks the System will absorb about two-
fifths of those reserves as the usual sharp holiday rise in float
more than offsets the continued growth projected for required reserves.
Expansion in bank credit on a daily average basis is likely
to be considerably slower in November than its unusually high
October pace, although the strength of business loans in the most recent
statement week and the impact on banks of this month's Treasury
CONFIDENTIAL (FR)
financings suggest a build-up in the latter part of the month that
is likely to extend into the December holiday season. In November
and December, growth in the bank credit proxy may average between
8 and 10 per cent, compared with the 8.5 per cent growth rate since
March. Money supply expansion, which has slackened recently, is likely
to pick up in the weeks ahead, with the demand deposit component averag-
ing about a 4-5 per cent growth through the end of the year. Time
deposit growth in November appears to be below its 17 per cent October
pace; maintenance of this growth rate in December will depend importantly
on whether banks can replace their maturing CD's.
Effect of alternative policies
A tightening of bank reserve positions to a range of, say,
$200 to $250 million net borrowed reserves, coming in a period of
peak seasonal pressures and in the wake of Treasury financings, would have
a significant impact on market rates. The staff estimates this could
move the 3-month bill rate into a 4.15 - 4.25 per cent range, with
funds trading often at 4-1/4 per cent and dealer loan rates at major
money market banks rising above recent levels. At the long end, bond
yields would be put under stronger upward pressure. The tendency of
market rates to rise would be reinforced as the increases generate
renewed expectations of a possible discount rate rise.
