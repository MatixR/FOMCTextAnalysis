Prefatory Note 
 
 
The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version available 
based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the Board 
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was created 
through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned 
versions text-searchable.2   Though a stringent quality assurance process was 
employed, some imperfections may remain. 
 
Please note that some material may have been redacted from this document if that

tilting) and lightly cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other 
blemishes caused after initial printing).

Recent developments
(1) M1 and M2 appear to be expanding at annual rates of around
4-1/2 and 8-1/2 per cent, respectively, over the January-February period,
in both cases just below the mid-point of the Committee's operating range.
The recent reduction in offering rates at some banks and thrift institu-
tions on time and savings accounts, in combination with the rise in market
interest rates, seems to have had the expected moderating impact on growth
of the time and savings deposit component of the broader monetary aggregates.

Latest Estimates

1/ These figures do not incorporate the quarterly benchmark and seasonal
factor revisions of monetary aggregates that will be published on
February 17. The benchmark revisions (based on the June call report)
are quite small. The level of M1 for each month of last year was
revised up no more than $300 million. The monthly levels of M2 were
adjusted up by even smaller amounts. The effects of changes in sea-
sonal factors on M1 and M2 levels were also generally quite small.
The net impact of the revisions raised growth rates of M1 and M2 for
1976 by less than .1 percentage point. All tables on subsequent pages
of this report (with the exception of Tables 1 and 2, following the
charts) are based on the new series. The new and old series are com-
pared in Appendix IV.
(2) Immediately following the January FOMC meeting the Desk
aimed for a Federal funds rate in the 4-5/8--4-3/4 per cent area in accor-
dance with the Committee's instructions. This objective has been maintained
throughout the intermeeting period, as incoming data have suggested M1 and
M2 growth well within their respective two-month ranges. With negotiable
CD's declining since year end and demand deposits falling in late January,
nonborrowed reserves are expected to decrease in February after increasing
rapidly in January.1/
(3) Since the mid-January FOMC meeting, interest rates on
Treasury securities, especially coupon issues, have fluctuated within a rela-
tively wide range. Interest rates rose in late January following announce-
ment of the terms of the Treasury's mid-February financing package and
likely cash needs over the balance of the first quarter. Subsequently,
with the funds rate remaining near 4-5/8 per cent and growth in the mone-
tary aggregates slowing, interest rates declined. Interest rates generally
showed little change, on balance, over the intermeeting period, but most
interest rates remained significantly above their December lows.
(4) Credit demands have generally remained strong recently.
Public offerings of corporate bonds were substantial in January despite
some postponements and cancellations in response to higher interest rates.
State and local governments have issued new securities at a rapid pace so

far in 1977. On the other hand, the pace of business borrowing in short-term
markets appears to have slackened somewhat over the past two months.
(5) The Federal government has borrowed appreciable amounts
of new cash since the January FOMC meeting, raising $2.8 billion through
a late January sale of 2-year notes and $3.7 billion in connection with its
mid-February refunding. In the refunding the Treasury auctioned $3.0
billion of 3-year notes at an average rate of 6.62 per cent, $2.0 billion
of 7-year notes at an average rate of 7.25 per cent, and $750 million of
30-year bonds at an average rate of 7.63 per cent. Most recently, the
two notes have been trading at prices above their auction averages, and
dealers have made reasonable progress in distributing their awards of
these issues. The bond has been trading slightly below its average issuing
price; dealers still hold most of the relatively sizable awards they
received of this issue.

Prospective developments
(6) Summarized below are alternative short-run specifications
for the monetary aggregates and the Federal funds rate. (More detailed
short-run and longer-run data are shown in the tables on pp. 5a and 5b).
Each of the alternatives is believed to be consistent with growth ranges
for the monetary aggregates over the QIV '76-QIV '77 period adopted by
the Committee at its previous meeting. The differing patterns of
Federal funds rates and velocity implied by the three alternatives--
given the projected growth in nominal GNP--are shown in appendices II and
III, respectively.

(7) Growth in M1 over the February-March period is expected
to be in a 3-7 per cent annual rate range, assuming a Federal funds
rate centered in a 4¼-5 per cent range, as in alternative B. The rate
of expansion that is anticipated for M1 reflects in part the retardation
in economic activity caused by the recent cold snap and associated fuel
(8) M2 expansion under alternative B may be in a 7-11 per
cent annual rate range over the February-March period. Time and savings
deposits other than large CD's are likely to continue rising at close

to their reduced January pace, as banks remain less aggressive in
offering time deposits over the next few weeks in light of moderate
bank credit demands from business and other customers. Also, the rise
in yield on intermediate-term Treasury obligations since the beginning
of the year has made such securities somewhat more attractive to savers
as compared with time certificates of deposit.
(9) M1 and M2 under alternative B may be expected to rise at
annual rates of about 5½ and 10 per cent, respectively, in the first
quarter. Growth in these aggregates, especially M1, is likely to
strengthen in the second quarter, as a result of the temporary impact
of tax rebates. M1 growth in the second quarter would be further augmented
by increased money demands associated with the rapid expansion in nominal GNP
projected for the spring as the fuel shortage subsides.
(10) A considerably slower growth in monetary aggregates would
be required in the second half of 1977 than in the first half if growth
over the year is to be around the mid-points of the longer-run ranges
adopted at the previous Committee meeting. Growth in the aggregates
would probably slow to some extent as a natural reaction to the sharp
expansion in money that is likely to accompany rebate payments. To
achieve the amount of slowing needed, however, it is very likely that
short-term interest rates will have to rise as the year progresses, given
the projected expansion in nominal GNP over the year. Under alternative
B, the staff would expect the Federal funds rate to begin rising in the
spring and reach around 6½ per cent by the fourth quarter of this year.
(11) Interest rates are expected to show little net change over
the next few weeks, though, given the specifications of alternative B.
The Treasury will probably raise $7-9 billion of new money between now
and the next meeting through routine offerings of 2- and 4-year notes,
additions to the weekly and monthly bill auctions, and cash management
bills. Much of this need has probably already been discounted by the
market, but rates on Treasury securities could rise a little in the process
of distributing the issues. The municipal bond volume is expected to
remain at around the advanced January pace over the weeks immediately
ahead, but new issues of publicly offered corporate bonds seem to be
moderating in reaction to the recent rise in bond yields.
(12) Bank credit is expected to continue expanding at a
moderate pace in the first quarter. Business loan expansion may be only
a little above the reduced December-January average rate, but banks can
be expected to continue to be active lenders in the consumer and mortgage
loan markets. The higher level of yields on intermediate-term Treasury
issues since the beginning of the year may encourage some pick-up in
bank buying of such securities. Banks are expected to obtain sufficient
funds to finance such credit expansion from demand deposits and time
deposits other than money market CD's. The outstanding volume of CD's
will probably continue to decline modestly.
(13) Alternative C contemplates a tightening of the money
market over the next few weeks, with the funds rate rising to the mid-
point of a 4¾-5½ per cent range. Such a rise in the funds rate in the
weeks immediately ahead has probably not been discounted by the market,
and thus a fairly substantial upward adjustment in interest rates could
be expected to ensue. The 3-month bill rate would probably rise to
levels somewhat above 5 per cent. Yields on intermediate- and longer-term
issues would also increase, though probably by less than the rise in
short rates, given increases that have already occurred in longer-term
interest rates.
(14) The tightening of the money market and slower near-term
growth in nonborrowed reserves under alternative C would also tend to
hold down expansion of the monetary aggregates over the February-March
period as compared with alternative B. It would also be likely to lead
to slower growth in the aggregates over the first half of 1977, assuming
that the funds rate were permitted to rise somewhat further in the spring.
However, alternative C would require a more rapid growth in the aggregates
than alternative B in the second half of 1977 to attain the longer-run,
QIV '76-QIV '77 ranges for the aggregates adopted by the FOMC. Thus,
monetary policy would have to be more accommodative in the latter part
of 1977, and the Federal funds rate would not be likely to rise as
high as under alternative B. We estimate that the rate would, as a result,
peak at about 6 per cent in the summer of this year.
(15) The near-term easing of the money market encompassed by
alternative A would, of course, lead to declines in interest rates over
the next few weeks and higher growth rates in the monetary aggregates.
Most market participants would probably view the drop in the funds rate
as temporary, and this would work to limit interest rate declines. In
bond markets, for example, corporations would be likely to accelerate
offerings of new issues.
(16) With monetary growth rates more rapid over the next
few months than under the alternatives discussed above, alternative A
would imply more restraint later in the year if growth in the aggregates
is to be constrained within current longer-run ranges. A funds rate of
around 6¾ per cent is expected by the end of 1977 under this alternative.
Proposed directive
(17) Given below is a proposed operational paragraph for the
directive if the Committee wishes to continue formulating its instructions
in terms of desired growth in monetary aggregates over the months ahead.
No alternatives are presented for this formulation, in the expectation
that the reference to desired growth will be taken to apply to the longer-
term targets and that at this meeting the Committee will not reconsider
those targets.
"Monetary Aggregates" Proposal
To implement this policy, while taking account of developments
in domestic and international financial markets, the Committee seeks
to achieve bank reserve and money market conditions consistent with
moderate growth in monetary aggregates over the period ahead.
(18) Should the Committee desire to place main emphasis on bank
reserve and money market conditions, the language needed would depend on
the specific conditions sought. Three alternative "money market" direc-
tives intended to correspond to the similarly lettered policy alternatives
are given below.
