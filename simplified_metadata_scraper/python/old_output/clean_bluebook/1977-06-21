The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version available 
based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the Board 
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was created 
through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned 
versions text-searchable.2   Though a stringent quality assurance process was 
employed, some imperfections may remain. 
 
Please note that some material may have been redacted from this document if that

1  In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic 
format.  All scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced 
tilting) and lightly cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other 
blemishes caused after initial printing). 
 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optical character recognition computer program (OCR) 
first created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, 
staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.  Please note that the numbers and text in charts and

Recent developments
(1) M-1 increased at a 1.1 per cent annual rate in May
following April's record rise, and over the May-June period it appears
to be growing at around a 1¾ per cent annual rate, slightly below the
mid-point of the Committee's desired range. M-2 appears to be increasing
at nearly a 6 per cent annual rate in May-June, a little above the
mid-point of the Committee's range. Nonborrowed reserves apparently
will decline on balance over May-June--with a small June increase not
quite offsetting a May decline--primarily because of a flattening of
growth in demand deposits and an increase in member bank borrowing since

1/ These figures do not incorporate the regular quarterly benchmark
revisions of monetary aggregates that will be published on Thursday,
June 23. The revisions (based on the December Call Report) are
generally quite small. The level of M-1 was lowered somewhat by
these revisions, while the level of M-2 was raised slightly.
Quarterly growth rates for M-1 for the last quarter of 1976 and the
first quarter of 1977 were lowered about ½ of a percentage point.
M-2 growth was raised by about the same amount. All tables on sub-
sequent pages of this report (with the exception of Tables 1 and 2
following the charts) are based on the new series. The new and old
series are compared in Appendix IV.
(2) In accordance with the Committee's directive, following
the May meeting the Account Management aimed at a Federal funds rate of
about 5-3/8 per cent. Subsequently, with incoming data suggesting that
growth rates in the monetary aggregates would be within the Committee's
desired ranges, the Desk has continued to seek a funds rate around that
(3) Short-term market interest rates generally increased about
10 to 15 basis points in the latter part of May, but subsequently they
declined and are now little different from their levels at the time of
the May meeting. The recent tendency for such rates to decline appears
to be attributable in part to the steadiness of the Federal funds rate
and to the slowing of growth in the aggregates. Short-term credit demands
also have eased somewhat in recent weeks. The Treasury has continued to
redeem bills in its regular weekly and monthly auctions, and short-term
borrowing by State and local governments has dropped back to relatively
moderate levels following a bulge in April. In addition, business demands
for short-term funds at banks and in the commercial paper market moderated
in May, after showing exceptional strength in April. Most major banks
recently raised the prime rate in two steps from 6¼ to 6¾ per cent, although
most recently one large bank posted a 6½ per cent prime rate. Even with
the prime rate at 6¾ per cent, the spread over the cost of open market
funds has narrowed by about ¼ of a percentage point since the previous
prime rate adjustment in mid-December.
(4) Most long-term yields have declined about 10 to 20 basis
points since the time of the last FOMC meeting, in part because short-term
rates did not rise in the manner expected by many market participants.
These yield declines also reflected reduced offerings of long-term
Treasury and corporate debt and strong institutional demands for municipal
securities. Yields on primary mortgages, on the other hand, have changed

(7) Assuming the Federal funds rate remains around the
5-3/8 per cent mid-point of the alternative B range, the staff expects
M-1 growth in the June-July period to strengthen to an annual rate in
the range of 3 to 7 per cent. Available weekly data suggest that M-1
growth will remain relatively slow in June. By July, however, most
of the adjustment to the April bulge should have already occurred, and
M-1 is expected to grow more rapidly in response to the projected expansion
in GNP and the associated increases in transactions demands for money.
The July expansion in M-1 is likely to be buoyed further by an earlier-

than-usual distribution of social security checks, leading to more than
normal amounts of funds held in demand deposit accounts over the long
holiday weekend.1/
(8) Under alternative B growth in M-2 over June-July would
be expected to pick up somewhat, due mainly to the anticipated
strengthening in M-1. However, growth in the time and savings deposit
component of M-2 also should recover somewhat from the reduced pace of
recent months. The stimulative effects on time and savings deposit
inflows of a continued rise in personal income and advances in offering
rates at some banks are expected to be about counterbalanced by the
delayed impact of earlier increases in short-term market rates.
(9) Over the next few weeks aggregate demands on credit
markets may change little. Households probably will continue borrowing
substantial amounts in the residential mortgage and consumer credit
markets, and business demands for short-term credit may strengthen from
May's temporarily reduced pace. However, offerings of long-term bonds
by businesses are expected to remain light into the summer, and offerings
by State and local governments are likely to decline somewhat.
1/ Since the usual distribution date for social security checks (the
third of the month) falls on a Sunday in July, the checks will be
delivered on the preceding Friday. In October 1976 and April 1977,
the two previous occasions when checks were delivered early, the money
stock bulged in the first week of the month and remained relatively
high throughout the first half of the month. The staff projection
of July M-1 growth reflects an assumption that this pattern will
reoccur. If this assumption were not made, the projected M-1 growth
rate would be reduced by about 2 percentage points in July and
about 1¼ percentage points in the 2-month June-July period.
Furthermore, the Treasury may continue redeeming bills on into July.
Although it is widely expected that the Treasury will market about
$1.5 billion of 15-year bonds in the last week of June, it appears that
this will be the only new money it will raise in the coupon market until
early August.
(10) Given this background, and assuming that Federal funds
continue to trade at around 5-3/8 per cent as contemplated under
alternative B, it seems probable that short-term rates will remain
close to current levels in the near term. However, there might well be
some backup in long-term rates in the aftermath of the recent rally that
carried corporate and municipal yields to around their lowest levels in
several years.
(11) Over the longer run, interest rates, particularly in
short-term markets, are likely to come under upward pressure. The
Treasury's need for new money will be expanding substantially. Business
demands for funds may strengthen in the latter part of the summer and in
the autumn as rising expenditures on plant and equipment and inventories
outpace growth in internal sources of funds. Also, credit demands of
households and State and local governments are likely to remain strong.
(12) The staff projections suggest that under alternative B
the Federal funds rate would have to advance to an average of about 6
per cent in the first quarter of next year if M-1 growth in the QI '77-
QI '78 period is to be held near the mid-point of the Committee's
4 -6 per cent range. This funds rate level is somewhat lower than that
shown in the last blue book, reflecting both the slower second-quarter
growth of the aggregates than projected then and the slightly slower
growth of nominal GNP now expected in late 1977 and early 1978. Inflows
of interest-bearing deposits are still expected to slow sufficiently to
keep growth in M-2 and M-3 in the lower part of their respective one-year
(13) The alternative C specifications involve an increase of
the funds rate over the next few weeks to the mid-point of a 5½-6½ per
cent range. This may be accompanied by growth in M-1 in the June-July
period at an annual rate in a range of 2½ to 6½ per cent. Money market
firming of the degree contemplated under this alternative probably would
produce a prompt, appreciable rise in short-term interest rates and some
increase in bond yields. The rise in short-term market rates probably
would induce more depository institutions to raise offering rates on
savings and time deposits to ceiling levels. Short-term rates might rise
far enough to trigger sizable outflows of savings funds to market
instruments and to induce banks to bid aggressively for negotiable CD's and
for the types of large-denomination time deposits included in M-2. If
ceiling rates are unattractive relative to market rates, beginning in July
some institutions may experience substantial withdrawals in connection
with heavy maturities of "wild card" accounts.1/
(14) The immediate tightening of the money market under
alternative C would tend to lessen the degree of restraint that would be
needed later to achieve growth in M-1 over the QI '77-QI '78 period near
the mid-point of the Committee's one-year range. The funds rate under
this alternative would be expected to reach 6½ per cent in the fourth
quarter of this year and to remain around that level in early 1978.
Because short-term market interest rates also would be expected to be
lower than under alternative B or A, banks and thrift institutions
should be able to maintain stronger inflows of interest-bearing
deposits at that time. Although growth in M-2 and M-3 would consequently
be stronger in late 1977 and early 1978 than under the other alternatives,
even under alternative C the growth rates projected for M-2 and M-3
over the year ending QI '78 are in the lower part of their respective
(15) An easing of the Federal funds rate over the near term
to the mid-point of a 4½ to 5¼ per cent range--as called for under
alternative A--and the associated decline in short-term rates might
well be accompanied, at least temporarily, by significant declines in
1/ From July to October 1973 interest ceilings were removed on time
deposits with minimum denominations of $1,000 and maturities of
at least four years. Commercial banks accumulated about $9 billion,
and thrift institutions $18 billion, in such "wild card" accounts.
About one-third of these deposits at commercial banks are estimated
to have been issued at rates above now-prevailing ceilings on four-
year accounts. Although information concerning thrifts is much less
complete, it is estimated that about the same proportion of their
"wild card" certificates were issued at rates above current ceilings
on four-year accounts.
long-term rates. At present dealer positions in Treasury coupon issues
are relatively low and forward calendars for long-term Treasury and
corporate debt are quite light. In order to achieve growth rates in M-1
at the mid-point of the Committee's one-year range, however, the Federal
funds rate would have to begin to rise relatively soon and to reach a
level above those envisioned under alternatives B and C. Thus, under
alternative A, the Federal funds rate would be expected to average around
7¼ per cent in the first quarter of 1978.
Directive language
(16) Given below are alternatives for the operational para-
graphs of the directive. The first formulation, like the directive
adopted at the last meeting, places main emphasis on near-term rates of
growth in monetary aggregates; it shows--in strike-through form--the
specifications adopted at the last meeting. The second formulation places
main emphasis on money market conditions. As suggested below, the
particular language needed in the opening lines of the money market
formulation would depend on the specific conditions sought; the three
alternatives shown--calling, respectively, for somewhat easier, prevail-
ing, and somewhat firmer money market conditions--are intended to be
associated with the specifications discussed in the preceding section
under alternatives A, B, and C.
"Monetary Aggregates" Formulation
The Committee seeks to encourage near-term rates of growth
in M-1 and M-2 on a path believed to be reasonably consistent with
the longer-run ranges for monetary aggregates cited in the preceding
paragraph. Specifically, at present, it expects the annual growth
rates over the May-June JUNE-JULY period to be within the ranges of
[DEL: 0-to-4] ____ to ____ per cent for M-1 and [DEL: 3½ to 7½] ____ to
____ per cent for M-2. In the judgment of the Committee such
growth rates are likely to be associated with a weekly average
Federal funds rate of [DEL: 5-3/8] ____ per cent. If, giving approximately
equal weight to M-1 and M-2, it appears that growth rates over the
2-month period will deviate significantly from the mid-points of
the indicated ranges, the operational objective for the Federal
funds rate shall be modified in an orderly fashion within a range
of [DEL: 5¼ to 5¾] ____ to ____ per cent.
If it appears during the period before the next meeting that
the operating constraints specified above are proving to be
significantly inconsistent, the Manager is promptly to notify the
Chairmanwho will then decide whether the situation calls for
supplementary instructions from the Committee.
"Money Market" Formulation
At this time, the Committee seeks to maintain about the
prevailing money market conditions (or to achieve somewhat easier
or somewhat firmer money market conditions) during the period
immediately ahead, provided that monetary aggregates appear to
be growing at approximately the rates currently expected, which
are believed to be on a path reasonably consistent with the
longer-run ranges for monetary aggregates cited in the preceding
paragraph. Specifically, the Committee seeks to maintain the
weekly average Federal funds rate at about ____ per cent, so long
as M-1 and M-2 appear to be growing over the June-July period at
annual rates within ranges of ____ to ____ per cent and
to ____ per cent, respectively. If, giving approximately equal
weight to M-1 and M-2, it appears that growth rates over the
2-month period are approaching or moving beyond the limits of the
indicated ranges, the operational objective for the weekly average
Federal funds rate shall be modified in an orderly fashion within
a range of ____ to ____ per cent.
If it appears during the period before the next meeting
that the operating constraints specified above are proving to be
significantly inconsistent, the Manager is promptly to notify the
Chairman who will then decide whether the situation calls for
supplementary instructions from the Committee.
