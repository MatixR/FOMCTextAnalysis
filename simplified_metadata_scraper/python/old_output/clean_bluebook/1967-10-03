through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned 
versions text-searchable.2   Though a stringent quality assurance process was 
employed, some imperfections may remain. 
 
Please note that some material may have been redacted from this document if that

1  In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic 
format.  All scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced 
tilting) and lightly cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other 
blemishes caused after initial printing). 
 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optical character recognition computer program (OCR) 
first created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, 
staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.  Please note that the numbers and text in charts and

MONEY MARKET AND RESERVE RELATIONSHIPS
Recent developments
With private credit demands moderating and with relatively
high market interest rates beginning to impinge somewhat on the previous
rapid rate of increase in time and savings deposits, bank credit ex-
pansion in September averaged 9½ per cent at an annual rate--as
indicated by preliminary daily deposit figures--down 7 percentage
points from the pace of August and in line with staff expectations.
Euro-dollar borrowings abroad by U.S. banks showed little change on
average in September, although increasing toward month end.
Private demand deposits declined slightly in September,
reflecting in part relatively weak business loan demand, while time
deposits increased at a considerably slower pace than in the preceding
months of this year. Outstanding negotiable CD's are estimated to have
declined $700 million in September, on the basis of partial figures thus
far available. While banks were clearly not aggressive in seeking CD
funds, some large banks did find it necessary to raise their offering
rates in face of further upward rate pressures in short-term markets.
Treasury bill rates have risen generally 5 - 15 basis points
on balance since the last meeting of the Committee, with the largest
increases in the long-term bill area, the area most influenced by the
Treasury's cash borrowing plans. In the latter part of September, the
Treasury announced $4.5 billion of April and June tax bills to be

auctioned October 3 and paid for on October 9, with 75 per cent tax
and loan credit. The Treasury also announced another full 13 week
cycle of $100 million cash additions to the 3-month bill auctions.
In anticipation of a financing announcement, the 3-month
Treasury bill rose by 20 basis points in a week to a peak of 4.60 per
cent on September 22, but subsequently dropped back to around 4.40 per
cent as the market supply of such bills became limited in a period when
the System was meeting sizable reserve needs. But the 6-month and 1-
year bills have stayed closer to their late September peaks and were
most recently quoted at 5.02 and 5.16 per cent respectively. Rates on
other short-term instruments, such as Federal Agencies and bankers
acceptances, have also advanced somewhat during recent weeks.
The Federal funds rate fluctuated in a 3-7/8 - 4-1/8 per cent
range during the past three weeks and new dealer loan rates in New York
in a 4-1/8 - 4-3/8 per cent range. For Federal funds, this has been
the range of fluctuation generally prevailing since May, along with
member bank borrowings most commonly in a $50 - $100 million range
and free reserves generally in a $175 - $325 million range.
During the three weeks ending September 27, which included
the September dividend and tax period, the Federal funds rate has averaged
just about 4 per cent, a tick higher than in previous summer months.
Member bank borrowings have averaged $83 million and free reserves
$270 million, little different from levels prevailing during summer,
but the basic reserve deficit, and hence demands for money market funds,

of major New York banks bulged around the mid-September dividend and
tax weeks.
Relative to the seasonal movements in other reserve factors,
the System's open market operations were a minor factor in the market
until the last 10 days of September. In meeting the reserve needs
that developed in this recent period, the System purchased around $725
million of Treasury bills, and also bought $140 million of coupon issues.
These operations and other factors affecting reserves during the month
led to an expansion in total reserves of 7½ per cent, at a seasonally
adjusted annual rate, and required reserves at around a 6 per cent rate.
The required reserve growth was well below that of the previous two
months, partly because bank credit expansion in September was sustained
mainly by time deposit growth.
Prospective developments
It would appear that bank credit in October under the influence
of the current Treasury financing is likely to expand somewhat faster
than in September--in the area of 10 - 13 per cent--if money market
conditions remain within recent ranges. These market conditions are
likely to be consistent with a 3-month Treasury bill rate moving up
in a 4.40 - 4.70 per cent range as the favorably dated December bills
move cut of the 3-month maturity slot. The bill rate was only affected
to a very minor extent by the recent increase in the Canadian discount
rate; however, any further significant tightening of money market
conditions abroad affecting Euro-dollar rates would tend to exert
pressure on our bill rates.
CONFIDENTIAL (FR) -4- September 29, 1967.
The rate of bank credit expansion projected for October is
about the same as that experienced in the first half of 1967, and
below the high July-August rates. It in large part reflects $5
billion of Treasury net cash borrowing during the month--including the
tax bill financing noted earlier and cash additions to the regular weekly
and monthly bill auctions. About half of the bank credit expansion,
on a daily average basis, will probably take the form of additions to
U.S. Government demand deposits. Banks will sell off part of the tax
bills they acquire, but such sales are likely to be at a relatively
slow pace so long as loan demand pressures remain moderate. Under such
conditions, private demand deposits and the money supply may be expected
to show a small increase in October.
Time and savings deposits in October are expected to expand
in an 11 - 13 per cent range, slightly faster than in September, but
still slower than in earlier months of the year. Net inflows of con-
sumer time and savings deposits are likely to continue at around the
recent somewhat reduced pace, given continued competition from market
rates. Banks are likely to make some efforts to replace September CD
run-offs in October, but the net increase in CD's outstanding in the
month is likely to be moderate in view of the uncertainties about the
strength of loan demand and competition from new tax bills, so long as
there is continued availability of Euro-dollar funds. Banks will probably
find it necessary to stress relatively shorter CD maturities in order to
attract funds, given the existing structure of rates in the bill market.
CONFIDENTIAL(FR) -5- September 29, 1967.
Because Government demand deposits are projected to be a
principal source of funds for bank credit expansion, required reserves
in October may expandata 15 - 17 per cent rate, a much more rapid
growth than in September, when demand deposits were only a minor
source of bank credit growth. Total and nonborrowed reserves would be
expected to grow at similar rates, assuming borrowings do not edge up
from current levels, since banks have little scope to economize on
excess reserves.
If the Committee should favor a move toward somewhat firmer
money market conditions, it might contemplate operations leading to
an increase in member bank borrowings from current levels to a $100 -
$150 million range and a rise in the Federal funds rate to trading
more frequently at 4-1/8 per cent. The psychological and other effects
of such a policy shift are difficult to specify in the present
environment, dominated as it is by a number of fiscal uncertainties.
The 3-month bill rate would be more certain to move towards the upper
end of the previously specified range and would likely break through
to around 4-3/4 per cent. The equilibrium bill rate would depend in
large measure, however, on how strong an effort banks would make to
secure CD's by raising their offering rates while it was still feasible
to do sc. With such an effort, a temporary quickening of bank credit
growth could develop, with a further impetus if banks also become more
aggressiv in the Euro-dollar market. Intermediate- and long term
market yields would also tend to rise further, with the extent cf
September 29, 1967.
increase depending in part on how apprehensive market participants
become about the future mix of fiscal and monetary policies, including
discount rate action, and about prospects for disintermediation.
The current Treasury bill financing and the Treasury's mid-
November refunding to be announced in the latter part of October would
pose some problems of timing if the Committee calls for a move toward
less ease, even if the change in conditions sought is of the modest
dimensions suggested above. The initiation of such a move would need
to be timed to avoid undermining either bank or dealer underwriting
support in the current large tax bill issue and thus would depend
upon market conditions surrounding the financing--with the auction
date October 3 and the payment date October 9. And to avoid
complicating the Treasury's problems in designing and pricing the
mid-November refunding, any such move would best be substantially
completed a few days before the announcement date around October 25.
