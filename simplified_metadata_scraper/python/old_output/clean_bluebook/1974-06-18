of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was created 
through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned 
versions text-searchable.2   Though a stringent quality assurance process was 
employed, some imperfections may remain.

Recent developments
(1) M 1 increased at about a 5 per cent annual rate in May but
there was an acceleration in early June, so that growth for the May-June
period now appears likely to fall just under the 7 per cent upper end of
the Committee's range of tolerance. M2 has displayed a generally similar
pattern of monthly change, rising at a 5½ per cent annual rate in May and
then at a considerably stronger pace so far in June, when there has been a
larger than expected rise in large time deposits other than money market
CD's. For May and June combined, M2 appears likely to grow at a rate
roughly equal to the 7½ per cent top of its range of tolerance. And RPD
growth is near the upper end of its range.

(2) Growth in the bank credit proxy over May and June is
estimated at an average annual rate of 14 per cent, below the extra-
ordinary April pace but still strong. Banks greatly increased their
borrowings in the CD market in May in view of the continued generally
strong loan demands and in anticipation of large maturities in June. In
late May and early June, CD growth has slowed substantially, however.
Borrowing in the Euro-dollar and commercial paper markets was also
relatively strong until late May and then abated.
(3) Deposit growth at nonbank thrift institutions was at only
a 1½ per cent annual rate in May, and available data for early June
suggests that inflows have picked up only slightly. This conforms
generally to the experience of banks with respect to passbook savings
and small time deposits. Time and savings deposit accounts at banks
subject to Regulation Q ceilings have shown little, if any, growth in
recent months. Growth in bank time deposits has been in the form of
money market CD's and other time deposits over $100,000.
(4) Short- and long-term interest rates have fluctuated in
a relatively narrow range in recent weeks. At times during the inter-
meeting period, market sentiment appeared to be developing that
interest rates had reached peak levels and were about to decline.
Scattered declines in bank prime loan rates gave credence to this
view, and the stock market rallied. Market interest rates showed little
change, because the money market remained taut and the Account Management
sold a large block of bills timed so as to help dampen market
expectations of rate declines.
(5) With the potential for a resurgence in bullish sentiment
still present, however, Committee members concurred with Chairman Burns'
recommendation of June 10 that the upper limit of the funds rate range
be raised to 11¾ per cent, on the understanding that the Desk would use
this leeway if market interest rates came under downward pressure or
if the monetary aggregates began growing at rates that appeared to be
testing the upper limits of their tolerance ranges. In recent days,
given the latest estimates for the aggregates, the Desk has been aiming
at a Federal funds rate in the area of 11½-1l¾ per cent. The 3-month
bill rate was about 8.30 per cent at the close on Friday, up about 10
basis points from its level at the time of the last Committee meeting.
(6) The table on the next page shows (in percentage annual
rates of change) selected monetary and financial flows over various
recent time periods. Appendix table III compares money supply growth
rates computed on a quarterly-average basis with those computed on a
last-month-of-quarter basis. Projected figures on the two bases are
shown in appendix table IV for the three alternatives presented in

(8) At its last meeting the Committee adopted longer-run
targets for the second and third quarters combined that included a
5½ per cent annual rate of growth in M1 from the March level. Extension
of such a growth rate to year-end is illustrated by the dashed line
in the chart on the following page. Rates of growth consistent with
that extended path are shown in alternative C. These include a 4¾
per cent annual rate of growth in M1 between June and year-end, which
would compensate for the estimated 7 per cent annual rate of growth
for Ml in the second quarter and would lead to an average 5½ per
cent growth for the last three quarters of the year.

(9) The staff expects that attainment of the alternative C
aggregates would require a further rise in the Federal funds rate between
now and the next Committee meeting to a consistent trading range around
12 per cent or a little above. Projected growth in nominal GNP for the
second half of the year is now slightly slower than at the time of the
last Committee meeting, but the growth rates for the third and fourth
quarters--annual rate of 8.8 and 10 per cent, respectively--still suggest
sizable increases in transactions demands for cash.
(10) A rise in the funds rate over the weeks ahead would be
associated with further increases in interest rates generally. The
increases could be quite marked as expectations that market interest
rates had peaked--already coming into question--turn into expectations
of further rise. If the funds rate rose to the 12 per cent area, the
3-month bill rate might well fluctuate in a 8½-9½ per cent range over
the weeks ahead, the 3-month commercial paper rate would rise above its
earlier 11 per cent peak, and the prime loan rate would again be under
substantial upward pressure. However, increases in short-term market
rates, particularly in the Treasury bill area, could be tempered if
foreign official demand for U.S. Treasury securities were to strengthen.
Rising short rates would probably be communicated to longer-term markets
also, given sizable corporate and municipal security offerings in prospect.
The increase in bond yields, at least on the highest quality issues, would
be moderated, however, to the extent that evidence of monetary restraint
tends to make investors somewhat less pessimistic about the outlook for
(11) The rise in interest rates expected under alternative C
would further constrain inflows of consumer-type time and savings
deposits to banks and thrift institutions, given current Regulation Q
ceilings. As a result, growth in M 2 and M3 for the second half of
1974 would be reduced to about 5¼ and 4½ per cent, at annual rates,
respectively. Banks would be forced to raise interest rates offered for
CD's and Euro-dollars. However, we would expect considerable moderation
in the amount of net new funds raised through these instruments; bank
loan growth would probably be cut back by tighter lending terms, and
banks would probably become increasingly wary of adding to CD holdings at
ever higher interest costs. Marginal financial and business firms might
find it difficult to refinance maturing debts as banks and other lenders
become more selective. Financial strains would increase generally, and
the odds on failure of some of the more vulnerable firms would rise.
(12) Alternative B encompasses a 5¾ per cent growth rate for M1--
and growth rates of 6¾ and 5½ per cent for M2 and M3 respectively--in
the second half of 1974. These aggregate growth rates appear to be con-
sistent with a Federal funds rate around 11½-11¾ per cent, close to the
center of the range for this alternative. Thus, upward interest rate
pressure under this alternative would be considerably less than under
alternative C. At this writing, interest rates generally appear to be
in process of adjusting to Federal funds trading at rates somewhat above
11 per cent. This process may be completed by, or shortly after, the
forthcoming Committee meeting; and little further, if any, upward rate
movement is likely to develop subsequently if the funds rate remains
around the center of alternative B range.
(13) Assuming the prevailing money market conditions, M1
growth in the June-July period is likely to be in a 6-8 per cent annual
rate range. On the basis of partial data for the early part of June,
we would expect June growth to be on the order of 8 per cent at an annual
rate. Given the over-all interest rate increase of the past few months,
and the end of the tax refund period, growth in M1 is expected to slow
in July and subsequent months of the third quarter. For the third
quarter as a whole, M growth is indicated to be 5¼ per cent at prevailing
money market conditions--though rising to 6¼ per cent in the fourth quarter
when nominal GNP growth is projected to expand somewhat more rapidly.
(14) The substantial injection of nonborrowed reserves that
seems necessary to attain the aggregates of alternative A would probably
lead to an easing of money market conditions. A downward movement in the
funds rate--and especially a drop to the 10¾ per cent mid-point of the
range shown for this alternative--would be accompanied by a sharp decline
in market interest rates as investors came to believe that monetary policy
had made a major turn. The decline would be especially large in short-
term markets. In the Treasury bill market, the 3-month bill rate could
drop to below 7 per cent in view of the limited market supply at the
moment and the sizable volume of maturing mid-June tax bills. Given
the basic strength of credit demands, however, the immediate decline in
interest rates would probably be followed by a gradual upward readjustment
if the Federal funds rate were to hold around 10¾ per cent.
Proposed directive language
(15) Presented below are three alternative formulations
for the operational paragraph of the directive, which are intended
to correspond to the similarly lettered policy alternatives dis-
cussed in the preceding section. As will be noted, alternative A
refers to growth rates in the monetary aggregates prevailing over
recent months. Growth in M1 was at an annual rate of about 7 per
cent in the first quarter, and including an estimate of 8.2 per
cent for June, it is about 7 per cent for the second quarter as well.
The comparable rates for M2 are about 10 per cent for the first
quarter and about 8 per cent for the second quarter.
Alternative A
To implement this policy, while taking account of
developments in domestic and international financial markets,
the Committee seeks to [DEL: maintain about the prevailing restrictive]
ACHIEVE BANK RESERVE AND money market conditions [DEL: provided that]
CONSISTENT WITH GROWTH IN the monetary aggregates AT ABOUT THE
RATES PREVAILING OVER RECENT MONTHS [DEL: appear to be growing at
rates within the specified ranges of tolerance].
Alternative B
To implement this policy, while taking account of
developments in domestic and international financial markets,
the Committee seeks to [DEL: maintain about the prevailing restrictive]
ACHIEVE BANK RESERVE AND money market conditions [DEL: provided that
the] THAT WOULD MODERATE GROWTH IN monetary aggregates OVER THE
MONTHS AHEAD [DEL: appear to be growing at rates within the specified
ranges of tolerance].
Alternative C
To implement this policy, while taking account of
developments in domestic and international financial markets,
the Committee seeks to [DEL: maintain about the prevailing restrictive]
ACIIEVE BANK RESERVE AND money market conditions [DEL: provided that
the] THAT WOULD SLOW APPRECIABLY THE GROWTH IN monetary aggregates
OVER THE MONTHS AHEAD [DEL: appear to be growing at rates within the
specified ranges of tolerance].
(16) In the event that the Committee again wishes to couch
the operational paragraph of the directive in terms of money market
conditions, the specifications of alternative B might be associated
with the language used in the directive adopted at the last meeting--
namely, that "...the Committee seeks to maintain about the prevailing
restrictive money market conditions, provided that the monetary aggre-
gates appear to be growing at rates within the specified ranges of

agreements maturing in 16 days or more, are indicators of dealer holdings available for sale over the near-term. Other security dealer posi-
tions are debt issues still in syndicate,excluding trading positions. The basic reserve deficit is excess reserves less borrowing at Federal
Reserve less net Federal funds purchases. Weekly data are daily averages for statement weeks, except for corporate and municipal issues in
syndicate which are Friday figures.
