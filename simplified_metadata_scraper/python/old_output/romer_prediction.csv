2,E,3/4/69,"the fomc again agrees to attempt to maintain current monetary conditions.  but there is an explicit asymmetry toward easing:  conditions should be eased if bank credit appears to be contracting any more rapidly than projected, but tightened only if bank credit appears to be growing substantially faster than projected.  the asymmetry suggests an expected reduction of roughly 1/8 point (since a typical move is 1/4 point and the asymmetry does not guarantee a move).",E
